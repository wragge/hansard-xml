It would restrict land clearing in Australiaâ although not enough, I believeâto 1,000 hectares for any operator over any period of five years. That seems an extraordinary amountâafter all, that is 1,000 football fields of native forests or woodlands scraped off the face of this continent. Australia is the only developed or rich country on the list of the worst 10 land clearers in the world. </para></talk.start><para>We know that there has been movement towards ending the land-clearing debacle in Queensland, which both Labor and the government have been totally irresponsible in preventing over the last decade or so. That land-clearing agreement does not come into force over the coming few years and, in the meantime, estimates are that up to 600,000 hectares are to be cleared in that state alone. Proportionately it gets worse when you go to Tasmania, in terms of volume as well as area. The most massive hardwood forests on the face of the planet in Tasmania, extensive rainforests, not least those in the Tarkine wilderness area of the north-west of the state, and woodlandsâboth dry forest and wet eucalypt forestsâin the centre and east of the state are being cleared at the greatest rate in history. And, I might add, this is being done for the fewest jobs and for the poorest return to the public purse in history. That simple set of statements underlines the total failure of the regional forest agreement signed by Prime Minister Howard in 1997 to bring into play the much promised conservation of forest values in Tasmania.</para><para>I was explaining to the committee last nightâand seeking advice and information from Senator Hillâabout the failure of the regional forest agreement in Tasmania and about, in the absence of some change to put teeth into the regional forest agreement, the absolute need for a binding land clearance trigger which gives the federal government the power to intervene. What we got from that debate last night, from Senator Hill and from the government, was that this legislation looks after, will look after and is alleged to give greater strength to looking after Australia's top cultural and natural heritage, but not where logging in Tasmania is concerned. If there is one major factor that is going to be completely freed up to continue destroying national heritage it is the logging industry under the regional forest agreements, and that in particular means the Bacon government in Tasmania and Gunns Pty Ltd, the world's biggest woodchipper of hardwood forests.</para><para>I put it to the minister that the Meander Dam, which is currently before Environment Minister Kemp, should, under this legislation, be halted because it is endangering a prime habitat of the tiger quoll, a marsupial carnivore. The independent umpire in Tasmania determined that the dam should not proceed. What happened there? Lack of good faith was shown by the Howard government and Environment Minister Green in Tasmania, who hurried into the parliament to overturn the determination of the Land and Environment Court, so to speak, in Tasmania so that the dam building could proceed, the habitat could be flooded and the endangered species could be driven a little further towards extinction.</para><para>Minister Kemp has yet to make the decision to show that, if only on one occasion, this environment planning and conservation bill can have teeth. The problem with the legislation before us is that besides abolishing the Australian Heritage Commission and independent expertise, at least in listing places and things of supreme national heritage value, it gives the powers across to the minister to both list and delist places in Australiaâin other words, to come under political suasion. Last night the minister said that, when listing national heritage places, they did have to take into account economic and social factors. Read for that big corporations, and indeed in some cases small corporations, wanting to grab the Australian people's heritage and develop it for their own ends.</para><para>We have heard precious little by way of a response to the request for information about Point Nepean. There was a request to Senator Hill to give an assurance that the heritage values there will be protected as the government moves to privatise an extraordinarily important part of the Australian national heritage, including historic buildings, in Victoria. But no plan has been put before this committee; there has been no covenantingâ just a submission that the prospective developers in that case all feel that they can meet the objective of looking after heritage values. It is a matter of saying, `Leave it to private enterprise.' I, for one, have been around for far too long to do anything of the sort, and I think the minister should have presented the terms and conditions, if privatisation must occur, for any developer so that we can clearly see for ourselves that Point Nepean will be protected.</para><para>I could move on to talk about Recherche Bay in Tasmania but there will be a specific amendment in relation to that so I will wait until then. The amendment that we are considering deals with land clearing. This is a very important Greens amendment. It should be supported by the Labor Party as well as the Democrats. I do not believe that support will be forthcoming. I do not see a substitute or alternative arrangement. We should be seeing one; otherwise there will be no effective mechanism for the Commonwealth to intervene in the interests of the nation to prevent the destruction of prime native vegetation in Australia. What could be more prime than, for example, the Styx Valley in Tasmania, where the tallest hardwood forests on the face of the planet are being cleared at a prodigious rate, right up to the boundary of the current World Heritage area, under the Snowy Range, under the authority of Prime Minister Howard?</para><para>Let me refer to the Tarkine wilderness in north-west Tasmania. There is a pipeline track there, through the heart of that rainforest. It has been there since 1965, when the then Tasmanian Labor Premier, Eric Reece, gave the authority for that track to be cut through the heart of the wilderness in order to take iron ore from the Savage River mine to Port Latta on the north coast. It is there; but it has been sealed off and the magnificent rainforest on either side has been protected in the intervening nearly 40 years. Now, suddenly, under the Bacon government in Tasmania, there has been a public announcement by forests minister Paul Lennon. Recently, by the way, at a meeting in New Norfolk, where people were objecting to more log trucks being driven past their schools and through their town, he said that it was his job to defend the logging industry in every aspect, right across the boardâno give, nowhere, no time.</para><para>But when it comes to the heart of the rainforestsâthe greatest temperate rainforest that our nation has, and which should be given priority for listing under this legislationâwhat will be the act that pre-empts that legislation? Mr Lennon has announced it, on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt Hon. John Howard, whose imprimatur is right on this, under the regional forest agreementâthat is, the logging of 2,000 cubic metres of these statuesque, giant Antarctic beech, myrtle beech, for extraction by Britton Brothers and others in northern Tasmania so that they can make money out of them. There is no need for it because if you go across to Burnie, you will find a pile of rainforest woodchips there, including myrtle, on the wharf, ready to be sent to Japan to make paper. Under the mismanagement of Gunns Pty Ltd, massive quantities of rainforest are being logged for woodchipping at $10 a tonne royaltyâor less than that. On the private land, of course, they cut down the forest, put the trees through the woodchip mill and get $100 freight on board per tonne for woodchipâsent to a ship standing offshoreâfor logging these forests which have been growing for centuries.</para><para>The Tarkine is of World Heritage significance and would be listed now as a World Heritage area if the previous Labor government or this Howard government had nominated it. It has extraordinary natural values. As I say, it is the largest temperate rainforest in Australia. It is bigger than the Daintree and the forests of the north which are tropical rainforests and which are World Heritage listed. It has extraordinarily important Indigenous values. It is named after the Tarkina people on the west coast and the Tommeginne people who were inland from that. This is the `forest of the dancing snakes'. It does not matter to this government; it does not matter under this legislation. The first priority will be to log in the heart of it so that some small-time operator can make a quick dollar. </para><para>If I am wrong about this, let us hear it from the minister. But there is enormous fear about this on the north-west coast of Tasmania, at a time when what is creating jobs in Tasmaniaâand it is growing prodigiously; the ferries are packedâis tourism. People are coming to Tasmania to see its natural and built heritage, which we have more of, thank goodness, per square inch than most other places on the planet. People are not coming to see these forests horizontal on a log truck. They are coming to see them vertical in their god-given ambience, with their wildlife, with their streams flowing crisp and fresh, and with the cleanest air in the world, as has been monitored at Cape Grim, just west of the Tarkine. Of all the monitoring stations on the face of the planet, it has the cleanest air.</para><para>What is planned under the regional forest agreement with respect to the Tarkine? It is being eroded at record rates at the moment, under Forestry Tasmania, the Tasmanian government and Prime Minister Howard. It is planned to put in a forest furnace at Smithton, so that more of it will be burnt to provide electricity through Basslink to unsuspecting Melbourners who will be buying it as so-called `green power'.</para><para>I ask the minister: what is being done to review this decision on red myrtle? It was part of the regional forest agreement for determination in the five-year review, and there has to be a decision made which is agreed to by Minister Kemp. Is he going to make sure that there is not this dangerous environmental trespass on the pipeline track to get at that red myrtle or, as usual, are we going to hear nothing, or at best weasel words, about that?</para><para>That brings me to an important heritage matter. It is one of many, but I want to bring up the issue of logging at Kindred on the Leven River in northern Tasmania. There, we are assured, under the Forest Practices Code in Tasmania, rare and endangered species will be protected. Here was a concentration of <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus viminalis </inline>down to just a couple of per cent of its original range. Under the Forest Practices Code, which is Prime Minister Howard's guarantee to the Australian people that such values will be protected, the private landowner moved in and flattened the area. He did so without a timber-harvesting plan; without policing under the so-called Forest Practices Code, which is abused repeatedly; without an injunction from the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board, which is supposed to be the arbiter in Tasmania; and without a squeak out of the Hon. Paul Lennon, the minister for woodchipping and forests in Tasmania, or the Premier, the minister for national parks. </para><para>There was illegal logging. That <inline font-style="italic">viminalis</inline> was sold somewhere illegally to an entity which took the illegally logged, rare and endangered <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus viminalis </inline>and sold it onto the market. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I ask the minister: does he know who sold that <inline font-style="italic">viminalis</inline> and, if not, will he find out? I also ask the minister: is it true that, even when a forest practices plan was insisted upon by the Forest Practices Board, the owner then illegally roaded this block, breaching the forest practices plan, in a configuration that was dangerous to the travelling publicâa person had to go out with a stop-go sign for the trucks going in and out, carting this national heritage forest off to whatever market it went to? Is it also true that there was then an incursion into the river reserve of the Leven Canyon which allowed pirates to escape with tree ferns and other valuable components of that reserve? </para><para>How extensive was the failure of this system under the Prime Minister's signature to protect the national heritage on the Leven River at Kindred? What has been the response under the legislation we have before us today to ensure that (a) the landowner was stopped immediately his illegal operation was brought to attention and (b) he was brought to book, or is this just another case of dozens and dozens of people flouting this Forest Practices Code and getting away with itâbecause in Tasmania you do not confront the industry; they determine what happens?</para><para>I would like to know that from the minister. The minister will get up and wanly, amongst other things, say, `Oh well, when we and the Democrats put through this legislation and guillotined it through this Senate in June 2000, you will notice that we excluded any further responsibility for the minister for forests under the regional forest agreement.' What I am saying is that that is totally against the spirit of this legislation. The Greens are trying to put federal responsibility for species and places of national heritage significance back in. That is what this bill is about. We have an amendment here to prevent land clearingâits worst excesses, at leastâwithout the authority of the government. </para><para>I am asking the minister: what is the alternative plan the government has in place to (a) prevent the massive land clearing, with its awesome contribution to global warming out of Australia and (b) in particular, prevent the destruction of some of the most delicate, important, valuable, beautiful and inspiring components of native vegetation, including rare and endangered species, in Australia? That seems to be happening at a greater rate than ever before in history under Prime Minister Howard's authorityâif not signed authority, then withdrawn responsibility. What is going to be done about that? Doesn't the Prime Minister care? He knows about the matters I am talking about because there is a line of authority and he signed the document which gave the guarantee and, of course, he will want to know that his guarantee from 1997 is being carried out. </para><para>I ask any member of this committee, any party at all: if the Greens' land-clearing triggerâwhich, as I said, I think is far too loose, but it is hereâwhich gives the federal minister for the environment the power to intervene on excessive land clearing is not the right one, what is your solution? The worst thing we can do here is say, `Well, it's not exactly what we would like so we won't vote for it and we'll have nothing. We'll allow the situation to continue.' We are legislators for this great nation of ours; we are the custodians of this nation's natural and cultural heritage.</para><para>This bill, which I hold up hereâ500 pages about to become 700 pagesâis `the book' of protecting the Australian people's heritage for future generations. I am saying it is a failure when it comes to forests and woodlands and rare and endangered speciesânot just the plants involved but the wildlife that live amongst them. I am asking everybody, including the Labor Party: if you do not support this amendment, where is yours? What are you going to do about the rapid deterioration of the nation's heritage? This bill does not have teeth. For goodness sake, give it teeth by supporting this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13877</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs Senator Brown has finished with the bill, I would like to begin with the bill and put this amendment into context in this debate. Hopefully we will get to the final vote on this very important package of heritage bills today. I think this is the fourth or fifth time we have resumed this discussion in this chamber. Hopefully we will see this through today and it will give us a far better means of protecting our national heritage than the current system. </para></talk.start><para>Indeed it has been a long time coming. The process began under the previous Labor government. I think these bills have had a six-year gestation period. Senator Hill may be able to help me a bit with the time line. There have been some three years of active negotiation and discussion. In the last six to 12 months they have been quite frenetic and fraught with a few difficulties but we are virtually there. What gives me great heart is the number of organisations that are supportive of this legislation: the Heritage Commission, the Australian Council of National Trusts, the Humane Society, WWF and the list goes on. There are about 20 of them all hoping that we will see this legislation through today. </para><para>I will look specifically at the issues Senator Brown has raised. Yes, in Tasmania there is a major problem. We are effectively sitting and watching our heritage being trashed. Our old forests are being reduced to those various coloured piles of woodchips that I have seen on the waterfront at Burnie. At the same time we are seeing more and more people on the bushwalking tracks. I have done a fair bit of bushwalking down in Tasmania and the last time I was there they were at the pointâand Senator Brown may be able to help me with thisâof deciding whether or not Cradle Mountain track should be accessible by permit only over Christmas because so many people are using that track.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âNo, but they are moving to that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âYou cannot say to them, `Well, go and do the south-west track.' To start with, that is not very well developed and is really for very qualified, experienced, very fit people. The last time I was down there I went on the walk that takes you up to the Walls of Jerusalem and that was packed with people going both ways for the entire day that I was going up. A few days later when I was coming back there were fewer people because it had been effectively snowing in the middle of summer. The tracks are packed, and what is Tasmania doing? It is clear-felling areas that could be the next walking area, the next tourist destination. One of my daughters has already walked much of that area in the Tarkine, on virtually no tracks at all. It is a beautiful place that the Tasmanian government could put real resources into for its tourism potential. But we are not seeing that, and I agree with Senator Brown that this legislation is not dealing with that. But neither, unfortunately, are Senator Brown's amendments. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe we need to sit down with those stakeholdersâthose people who are interested. And the same thing applies when we are talking about land clearing. My home state has good land-clearing legislation but people are still finding ways around it and we need to have a far better monitoring and enforcement process. But speaking from a state that has dealt with it, I do not believe we need to come in and wave a big stick over people's heads, with no compensation and no discussion. I believe that that would initially lead to an even greater rate of clearing than we are seeing now, and the way this amendment is written, with its reference to 1,000 hectares, would lead to that. </para><para>In some places where we have endangered species one hectare is too much to be cleared. I draw the chamber's attention to a letter I had today from Alastair Graham of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. They are looking again at this issue and they are actively in debate and discussion with government, as I am, on these issues. But there needs to be a complete ban on land clearing, a complete ban on logging of rainforest and a complete ban on industrial logging of old-growth forests rather than a blanket ban applied in this way. We certainly need to deal with this issue. Once you look at who the cessation of land clearing is going to affect you can see that it would only affect a handful of families. </para><para>People are resistant to change. They are particularly resistant to change if they do not have any view of where their future lies and what is going to happen to them. People are concerned about bureaucracy. As some farmers have said to me, bureaucrats are deciding for them where they can put fences and how many cattle they can run. This is a process that we certainly cannot let drag on, and I am very pleased that we are finally very close to an agreement in Queensland. Senator Brown, I certainly acknowledge your best intentions but unfortunately this amendment is not the way to go. Hopefully the Tasmanian government will come to its senses because this is where a lot of the problem lies and, with a review of the RFAs, hopefully we can get some sense into the heads of the members of the Tasmanian government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>13878</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will respond briefly. There are a lot of points that could be made but the first is that the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is regarded as of the best of its type in the world. Whereas you can always argue as to whether it could have or should have gone further, it does give the Commonwealth, for the first time, a significant role in the protection of assets of national importance. I think it has made a significant contribution to the sorts of goals that Senator Brown has been outlining. Senator Brown was opposed to it from the start. Senator Brown has never seen the legislative process as particularly useful in conservation. Regrettably he has not used the influence that he has in this place to achieve better conservation outcomes through the legislative process. It is true that it did not cover forests that were subject to regional forest agreements. The reason it did not was that it was a process that was already in place across Australia to provide not only better conservation outcomes in relation to forests but sustainable economic returns.</para></talk.start><para>It was a policy that was agreed to by the two major parties in this country. In fact, it was commenced by the Labor Party but taken up by us. Its goal was, on the one hand, to achieve a comprehensive, representative and adequate conservation reserve system and, on the other hand, to allow for what was not within that reserve forestry that was conducted on both an economic and ecologically sustainable basis. A great deal of research from many of the best scientists within the field in Australia was undertaken over a considerable period of time to ensure that wise judgments were made as to where the boundaries were drawn, that proper assessments of the sorts of values that Senator Brown has been talking aboutâendangered species and the likeâwere properly taken into account in drawing those maps and that nothing is locked in forever, because mistakes can be made. There were review periods. Senator Brown made reference to the review of the Tasmanian RFA that is due to take place, and I am seeking advice on the status of that review at the moment. When he asks me about the issue of the red myrtle or of a particular endangered eucalyptus I will get that information. The advisers that I have here today do not have it at hand. That is why forestry that was subject to these ecological assessments was not included within the EPBC Act.</para><para>As I have said on many occasions, conservation in this country is really a partnership between the various tiers of government, with the states under our Constitution having primary responsibility for natural resource management. When the structure of the new Commonwealth legislation was being negotiated with the states, there was debate about whether extensive land clearing should have been included as a trigger as a matter of national environmental significance. It was decided, in the end, not to include it. Some of the reasons were covered by Senator Lees in her contribution. Some states had already enacted effective legislation, such as South Australia, which passed its legislation on this matter some 25 years ago. It was very difficult to determine a formula. The formula being proposed by Senator Brown is simply an arbitrary formula.</para><para>For those and other reasons it was decided that their share of the burden, emphasis and responsibility should remain on the states. We have been seeking to implement that commitment on a cooperative basis ever since. Reference has been made today to the slow but, it now seems, positive progress that has been made in Queensland. Queensland is likely to agree to, legislate and enforce new restraints that will be financially supported by the Commonwealth as well as the states. So the Commonwealth will be a party to achieving a better land-clearing outcome in Queensland. It is in the effective implementation of that sort of partnership that we believe the issue of land clearing might be best progressed.</para><para>This debate has been something of an aside, I have to say, to the purpose of the heritage bills that are before the chamber, but I accept that the issues are important. Whereas the formula that has been adopted across this chamberâwith Labor on the RFAs and then with the Democrats on the EPBC Actâcertainly moves us in the right direction, I do recognise that it will never satisfy Senator Brown and we will have to have these asides from time to time. Seeking, on the part of the Commonwealth, to unilaterally breach the agreement that was made with the states in the planning of the EPBC Act will not, in my submission, achieve the outcomes that we are seeking anywhere near as effectively as the sort of cooperative arrangement that we are in the process of implementing in Queensland. On that basis, the government will not support the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13880</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to indicate that the Democrats will support this amendment. I do not think it is ideal. As I said yesterday, there would be some difficulties in terms of administration and enforcement of such a law. However, we are all getting rather frustrated with what the minister describes as attempts to develop a cooperative arrangement with the states. From my perspective there is not a great deal of cooperative rhetoric or language that is being heard between the Commonwealth and state governments, and I do not think this is helping the situation. The government did commit to moving forward on land clearing, but effectively we have heard not a lot since that time. It is little wonder that senators in this place, such as Senator Brown and us, use this opportunity to put forward what may be not entirely 100 per cent ideal legislation. But it is the only tool we have in order to push governments along. I suggest that the ALP think seriously about supporting this.</para></talk.start><para>Let the government take it away if it is not supportive of this model. Then come back to this chamber and suggest something which is. That way at least we can see this making some progress. I think we are all accustomed to making change over time in this place. Certainly I would argue that that is what this legislation does for heritage. It is not the ideal answer, but it is a start. On that basis, we are supporting it and its thrust. Nonetheless, I think we should apply the same approach to matters such as land clearing. We will go on shortly, Senator Lundy, to your amendments to do with greenhouse. It is much the same problem. In other words, an amendment which we might develop in this place is an attempt, as much as anything, to get it right. It probably needs a great deal more thought and effort to make sure that it is right. Nonetheless, it is a good start and that is, I think, what we should be aiming for.</para><para>As I understand it, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust talked about clear-felling of old-growth forests, and I think it is the case that Tasmania Together proposed to phase out clear-fell old-growth forest logging by 2010 and stop clear-felling of higher conservation forests by January 2003. I think if we were able to work with the states to agree on that phasing outâperhaps an even more reasonable proposal than that, I would suggestâ this would at least give us some confidence that we were moving in the right direction. I want to indicate that that is what the Democrats propose to do.</para><para>I really think that the minister will have to get accustomed to the idea of these kinds of amendments being put forward until there is something more concrete that the chamber can feel assured about in terms of land clearing, because it is a huge issue for this country. It is a greenhouse issue as much as a biodiversity and conservation issue. It is also a heritage issue because, as Senator Brown often says in this place, some of these very old trees, in particular, and ecological systems are a really significant part of our heritage.</para><para>I would also commentâas it seems I have done thousands of times in this placeâthat the minister says that there is already a protection system in place: our RFA system looks after forests, it is sustainable and all of that. But even state governments come to the understanding that the RFA system does not work in Victoria. The Bracks government, and I congratulate them for this again, has decided that logging in the Wombat State Forest is not sustainable, partly because they are running out of water in Geelongâa bit like in Adelaide, Senator Hill, but of course that is not quite the same problem. For that reason they are phasing out logging.</para><para>I think this is a recognition that the RFA process never was about a sustainable yield of timber and probably never will be. In most cases there should be sensible reviews to determine whether the RFA process is based on a fallacy, and that is that you can keep on doing this clear-fell logging forever and ever. I will leave my comments at that, but it is important to say, I think, that we cannot just say, `We won't deal with land clearing or forestry issues anymore because they're already dealt with by the RFA process.' Time and time again, the evidence demonstrates that to be not the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13881</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe minister said that this is the best bill in the world. It is very easy to say that, but it is also very easy to prove that that is absolutely wrong. When it comes to the logging of the nation's heritage forests, you only have to look at New Zealand and Thailand, which have stopped it. Here we have a licence for it to continue at a greater rate than ever before in history. This bill is a manifest failure. It is one of the worst bills in the world when it comes to protection of the forest heritage and the wildlife heritage of this nation. The Greens are trying to put into the bill a tooth to help protect that forest heritage where the delinquency of the authorities in Tasmania is allowing even the soft rules of the regional forest agreements to be broken. The government is going to oppose it, and the question is: will the Labor Party oppose it?</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lees said that hopefully we will see the Tasmanian government come to its senses. I would be with Senator Lees on that hope if I did not live with all those log trucks ripping through Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and all the other towns of Tasmania that are en route to woodchip mills. Do you know how many? There are 500 trucks a day going out of our old-growth forests into the woodchip mills to export, amongst other things, some of the most statuesque, important and rare forests of the world to the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere, via paper mills, at the lowest return in historyâas I said earlierâto the Tasmanian people in terms of royalties. `Best bill in the world,' my foot!</para><para>The minister said, `Senator Brown has never seen the legislative process as worth while.' That is quite wrong. I am here as a legislator. I have legislation before the minister to give him the power to intervene on land clearing and he says, `No, wrong way around.' I am the legislator. It is the government here who are saying, `We don't want to legislate.' They do not see this parliament as being the place for legislation on this matter. Sure, the woodchip industry has prodigious influence. It gives donations to the big political parties. It has business lunches and dinners with relevant ministers in Tasmania. It rules over the 80 per cent public sentiment against this destruction of our forests. That is why we do require legislation in this place. We do not have legislation in this place because the government do not see the legislative process as worth while. They see their cosy arrangement with the job-shedding woodchip corporations as what is worth while to them in a political sense. It is the forests and the wildlife that suffer as we go.</para><para>The minister said that endangered species are protected properly by the maps. Let me tell you what goes on within areas of the maps drawn up under the regional forest agreementâjust a pencil sketch. The rare and endangered tiger quoll I spoke about earlier is being extensively poisoned by 1080 under Mr Howard's signature and the regional forest agreement. The beautiful little bettongânow almost extinct on the mainland but still numerous in Tasmaniaâ with its white-tipped tail is being poisoned under the Forest Practices Code as 1080 is spread out across these forest areas once they have been logged and fire burnt, because they do not want these animals coming in and grazing on the precious seedlings which give them their money from the next crop of woodchips. We are talking about total destruction of ecosystems. This poisoning is different to that on the mainland. This is not poisoning of feral animals; this is poisoning purely, 100 per cent, to kill native wildlife, including endangered species, under this legislation which the minister says is the best in the world.</para><para>Then there is the giant wedge-tailed eagle, bigger in Tasmania than its mainland cousins, which nests in these forests. They have simply been cut out from underneath it. We do not know the impact of 1080. Some say it does not affect it. That is codswallop. The fact is that the wedge-tailed eagle is down to 200 breeding pairs and one of the biggest threats to itâit is also threatened by farmers poisoning carcassesâis the loss of habitat which is being cut from under it by Gunns Pty Ltd and the minister for forests in Tasmania, Paul Lennon, under the authority of Prime Minister Howard through his signature on the regional forest agreement.</para><para>When you get to the streamside reserves you find extensive breaches of the Forest Practices Code where the logging industry, including Forestry Tasmania itself, has gone in through streamsides which are supposed to be protected and which, amongst other things, are prime nesting sites in Tasmania for the pure white goshawk, which is also down to 200 breeding pairs. You see it going through the forest like a white flash; it is one of the most magnificent things to see in action. It is being driven just a bit closer to extinction every time a nesting site is lost through an illegal operation under the Forest Practices Codeâunder the authority of the Prime Ministerâbecause there is no proper comeback against the people who do things like that, including Forestry Tasmania under the authority of the Rt Hon. Paul Lennon, Deputy Premier of Tasmania, and the Premier.</para><para>This legislation says: `We won't touch forests like that in Tasmania. We will not protect those species. We will endorse their getting closer to extinction at the greatest rate in Australian history of forest destruction. While we are at it, we will cut across the job-creating tourism industry and give the benefit to Gunns Pty Ltd'âthe CEO of which, Mr John Gay, having sacked dozens of people in recent years, cashed in his options on 31 July this year and made $7 million in one day, in one transaction, out of these forests we are trying to protect. Gunns has made a 35 per cent return on its capital so far. Forestry Tasmania has made a negative return. It makes the books look as though it is earning one per cent. These are the Tasmanian people's forests but Gunns is making the money andâbesides that which goes into the pockets of Mr Gay and other members of the board like the former Premier of Tasmania, Robin Grayâit bounces across Bass Strait, through the Stock Exchange and into the pockets of shareholders including the Commonwealth Bank and Perpetual Trustees, doing nothing for Tasmania. That is the economic side of this destruction of rare and endangered species, grand forests and Tasmania's future fortune under the failure of this legislation.</para><para>I propose a tooth which says, `Any owner who is going to log more than 1,000 hectares over five years will be guilty of a misdemeanour which will lead to 50,000 penalty units for a body corporate or 5,000 penalty units for an individual.' Guess what? The government says no. It says, `Oh no, it's the environment.' Criminal behaviour towards the environment shall not be created when it comes to forests because that might just entrap some of the high-flyers who are robbing the public of their environmental heritage as well as their right to a decent return if they were to log these forests. Ditto when it comes to the red myrtle in the Tarkine, which is being targeted in the coming summer by a get-rich-quick group of operators who are quite happy to see much bigger amounts of myrtle from elsewhere going to whatever downstream processing designs they have for it. They are quite happy to see it go to the woodchip mills and be sent as scrap to the paper mills of Japan, Korea and China under the authority of Prime Minister Howard and the regional forest agreement.</para><para>This is scandalous. The Tasmanian situation is an absolute environmental, economic and employment scandal. That is why the Greens are calling in the state and federal parliaments for a judicial inquiry into it. But, far short of that, surely we could legislate to make things right in the interests of this nation. Surely the time to do that is when you have before this parliament a bill amending the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This is the bill whereby we get the teeth to do the right thing by the people of Tasmania and of this nation. I have moved an amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens which says, `Let's have a very blunt tooth, at least, to stop this massive rate of land clearing not just in Tasmania but also elsewhere in Australia where it occurs,' and the government has said, `No, it is better that we have nothing.' Read into that prodigious influence on this government by big-money concerns at the expense of the people and the heritage of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>13883</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Brown knows full well that Labor do not have an intention to support any of these amendments apart, of course, from our own. We do so on the basis that the main problem with this bill comes back to the issue covered in Labor's amendments right at the start: this bill is removing the independence of the Heritage Commission. It effectively makes all of the decisions that are going to be dealt with under this new bill political decisionsâdecisions made in the Minister for the Environment and Heritage's office. For this reason, Labor believe this bill cannot be supported.</para></talk.start><para>Like the Greens and other parties, we have taken the opportunity to move an amendmentâit is coming up shortlyâto highlight issues of concern which this bill presented an opportunity to say something about. Our amendment relates to a greenhouse trigger. At the same time, we are well familiar with the opportunity that bills such as this present to argue the cause on each of these issues. What we are hearing here from Senator Brown is his well and often stated case. It is not a case that Labor agree with, and we have a series of complex views on these matters that we have argued out in this chamber before. As I said, that is the approach Labor are taking to the package of bills. We are not going to support them. We know the Greens are not going to support them. We hope the Democrats are not going to support them now that they have effectively had to do a mea culpa because their deal with the government has fallen through, with the government now relying on Senator Lees and other crossbenchers to see these bills go through.</para><para>I do not believe there is a justification for this bill passing this place. I do not believe that the merits exist within what is left already for it to pass. I note with interest that we are now almost going through an exercise with the Democrats trying to outgreen the Greens, the Greens trying to maintain their credentials, if you like, and Meg Lees coming up from the rear trying to argue the case in some absurd fashion that there is some ongoing concern in the context of a bill that she is going to support. It is beyond belief that we find ourselves here debating these points when the most critical principle of heritage protection in consideration here is its independenceâthe ability to have areas or items listed without it being a political decision. We have been in the chamber now for a long time debating these bills on the basis that somehow we can make them better through a whole series of amendments. The Democrats got as many of theirs up as they possibly could, with Senator Lees coming in with a group of amendments that backed in the rest of what effectively constitutes the deal with the coalition.</para><para>It is not going to be a good outcome either way, and if everyone was genuine and genuinely committed to heritage protection in Australia they would realise that once that fundamental independence is gone from the Heritage Commission these bills are unsupportable in the first place. I take Senator Lees to task over her comments about all of those groups she keeps referring to and saying support the bill. The Australian Conservation Foundation does not support the bill. We know now, via comments made by Commissioner Rodney Dillon, that ATSIC has grave concerns about the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage protection as well. Their fear, and indeed Labor's concern, is that those issues will not be proceeded with in due haste on behalf of the coalition.</para><para>There is a whole range of issues tangled up here, which makes the best outcome not proceeding with this legislation in its current form. I believe the coalition government have an obligation to actually go back and do what they should have done at the start, which was come forward with a model that did protect the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission and made the appropriate updating of the act, which is, I guess, the main thrust of their argument as to why it should pass. Losing the independence of the Heritage Commission is a trade-off which is far too great for Labor to contemplate supporting. It is like the crossbenchâin particular, Senator Lees, who has done the dealâsaying, `We know this proposition needs to be updated and we are actually quite happy for you to completely destroy the principles that gave it life in the first place,' which are by having independent decision making and an independent decision-making structure around it. It is unbelievable that the compromise has been so great. It has obviously been a significant focus of the coalition to ensure that compromise, and the amendments we have seen which have tried to fiddle around the edges by increasing accountability are all designed to try and offset that fundamental trade-off that we think is unacceptable. We will continue with our opposition and I look forward to having an opportunity, hopefully very shortly, to move Labor's amendment in relation to a greenhouse trigger so that we too can take the opportunity that this bill presents to have a say on the issues that are important to our hearts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13884</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI realise I should resist the temptation, because we have been debating this for many daysâindeed, this has now been six years in the makingâbut I cannot just let that go through to the keeper. This will be a great outcome for heritage in this country. Indeed, it is because people are committed to preserving our national heritage that we have this bill before us today. From all the groups that I have mentioned through to people in the departments and those at a ministerial level, we have people committed to getting this legislation through. Senator Lundy mentioned the ACF. The ACF has become an absolute dinosaur. The ACF refuses to do anything that involves a coalition government. The ACF is sitting out there waiting for the next time the Labor Party is in government. Obviously that is going to happen at some time in the futureâit is inevitable in Australian politics. Senator Hill thinks it is a little amusing but, Senator Hill, at some stage you are going to have to pass the baton across to this side. They will move over to your side and you will come over here and on we will go. That is the day the ACF is waiting for before it will support anything a government does. Who knows what the Labor Party are going to do? As Senator Brown has already said, they are at the heart of the problem of the destruction of our national forests.</para></talk.start><para>However, putting that aside, yes, a letter did come yesterday from ATSIC, from Commissioner Dillon, and we have spoken to Commissioner Dillon since then. Unfortunately, he was deliberately misled and some very inaccurate information was passed on to him. He does not now support the comments that he made as a result of being substantially misled. So let us just get on with itâlet us get this legislation through. I will not read the long list of 20-odd organisations, starting with the National Trust, that are supporting what we are doing. Of course there is still some tidying up to be done. This needs monitoring and we need to work on constant improvements. But it is an enormous step forward from where we were. </para><para>The ALP will be moving an amendment in a moment that they hope will sink the bill. They are trying yet another strategy because obviously, if their greenhouse amendment gets up, the government will not be very pleased. I will argue the case or not for that amendment later, and by the look of it that will be after question time. I think the ALP's behaviour and attitude to this whole issue have been very disappointing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13885</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf it is the case, as you say, that Commissioner Dillon has retracted his written statement and it has been refuted, we have not seen a retraction. It is very easy to stand up in this place and say, `Don't worry about that letter.' The fact is we are in possession of the letter and we have not been advised of any such retraction. It is probably worth while at this point outlining the actual concerns expressed. They include, in the final paragraphs:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate what I said in my last letter: that Indigenous heritage may not always be protected where this protection stands in the way of short-term economic gain. For ATSIC to support this bill it would need to be satisfied that:</para></quote><para>Â·	the government will commit in Parliament to immediately invigorate the negotiations with the ATSIHP Bill;</para><para>Â·	ensure that the RNE becomes a part of the matters of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act;</para><para>Â·	the Bill includes the provision of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage inspectors with appropriate powers to ensure adequate protection of Indigenous heritage;</para><para>Â·	some technical amendments are considered to the objects of the wildlife protection clauses that came into force in January 2002 to recognise the inherent Indigenous rights and ownership in wildlife similar to the clause that was supported unanimously in the Senate; and</para><para>Â·	the emergency listing provisions are strengthened along with other matters that ATSIC has already raised.</para><para>I look forward to getting some clarification about the status of this letter because there is nothing on the deck to suggest that it is not still current in terms of that advice.</para><para>I can only go back to my original point. It has been quite an exercise hearing the crossbenchersâthe Greens, the Democrats and Senator Leesâvying for the strongest green credential. You cannot take away the ultimate point about this legislation, which is: what you are doing is selling out. You are letting the government potentially politicise the listing of Australian heritage and heritage protection. I cannot see how this exercise can be justified. It is just another example of the lengths the coalition will go to, and the ability of the crossbenchers to be manipulated into a situation of supporting something for gains that do not have to come with a trade-off. In this case particularly Senator Lees held out and asked for and insisted on from this government that they cover all bases. That is what this parliament is all about. So I am concerned to hear continually their justification and how great this bill is going to be. </para><para>Labor have already put on the record, and we acknowledge, that there have been improvements and there are some improvements in this bill. They are way overdue. It does not cancel out our fundamental point: that the loss of independence of the Heritage Commission is an unforgivable sell-out. It is an unforgivable trade-off and one that we will not accept. Nothing changes that perspective. I know that Senator Brown has already said that he is not supporting the bill either and it remains to be seen whether this deal will ultimately lead to a sell-out deal being done with Senator Lees. </para><para>The Democrats would have loved their set of amendments to have got up. It was fascinating to sit back and watch the bickering about whose amendment was better and whose amendment was worse, and the tinkering around the edges, and the government just sitting back and saying, `We will have one of theirs and one of theirs,' and making up the weakest mix of whatever they were trying to do. That is the exercise that we observed yesterday in this place. That is what it has been reduced to. That fundamental trade-off has been done and it is unforgivable. As I have said many times, Labor will not be supporting this fundamentally flawed bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>13886</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, I do not agree with Senator Lees that the Australian Conservation Foundation is a dinosaur organisation.

Domestic action has largely failed and emission projections have recently been revised upwards, as it has become increasingly clear that current programs to reduce emissions are failing. The need to achieve emission reductions is not reflected in the priorities of other government policies, including industry, energy, treasury, and research and development. The coalition government has consistently failed to spend money allocated to climate change in the budget each year. It has delayed spending at the same time as emissions are increasing.</para><para>Labor believes that much more needs to be done to tackle climate change. Not a day goes by when the effects of climate change are not being seen and felt. Labor believes that with vision and leadership Australians do not have to choose between decent environmental outcomes and a strong and growing economy. It is possible to have both. In pursuit of this type of sustainable economic growth, Labor is taking this opportunity to move amendments to include a greenhouse trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This will enable major new projects to be assessed for their greenhouse impact as part of any environmental assessment process, and will ensure that new developments represent best practice and that Australia's national interest is taken into account. This amendment is an expression of Labor's greenhouse policy released in August last year.</para><para>Labor's approach to climate change is good for the environment, good for jobs, good for investment and good for industry. Indeed, the passage of these bills gives the government the opportunity to finally deliver on the Prime Minister's 1999 promise of applying a Commonwealth greenhouse trigger under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in relation to new projects that would be major emitters of greenhouse gases. But we have heard already the expression in the chamber by Senator Lees that to include such a trigger in this bill would sink the bills, so it is pretty obvious that Senator Hill has failed to convince his colleagues of the need for a greenhouse trigger and that his successor, the current Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, has not even bothered trying. But promise they did and, four years later, we are still waiting.</para><para>Again, in stark contrast, Labor first moved an amendment for inclusion of a greenhouse trigger to the EPBC Act when it was first debated in 1999. To ensure sustainable economic growth, Labor has once again introduced these amendments now. The absence of a trigger exacerbates the damage being done by this government's illogical position in saying that they will meet the Kyoto protocol but steadfastly refusing to ratify it. It is also another example of a fundamental failure of national leadership on reducing Australia's escalating greenhouse emissions. I urge those in the chamber to support these amendments. It is worth noting that the Greens moved similar amendments and we believe not only that our amendments are stronger but also that this is an appropriate opportunity to see whether or not the coalition are capable of taking up the challenge of this crucial issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13890</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am amazed because I can remember that when I was trying to negotiate a greenhouse trigger to the EPBC Act, Mr Beattie, the Labor Premier of Queensland was totally opposed to it. It is interesting to see that it is now federal Labor policy. We know that we have federal Labor taking one position and Mr Beattie taking another, but my experience, to fill Senator Lundy in on the full story, was that all of the states were totally opposed to it. I now suspect that all Labor premiers are totally opposed to it. This was the stumbling block.</para></talk.start><para>We agreed to a greenhouse trigger in principle and the legislation provides a consultation process with the states. That was commenced, various consultancies were let and advice was given as to what might be the best model in all the circumstances. Discussion papers were put out and so forth but we were not able to reach a conclusion and the consultation process, from the perspective of the government, continues. If Senator Lundy is now indicating that Labor has switched and that the state Labor premiers are now likely to support a greenhouse trigger, that is very useful information for the government to take on board. It may be that one day we can get to an outcome of a greenhouse trigger representing a matter of national environmental significance within the EPBC Act. I thank Senator Lundy for that piece of information. Whilst we are not prepared to sign on in this way, because the act sets out the process for the introduction of new greenhouse triggers, I think her revelation of the new ALP federal policy may be helpful in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13891</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens will be supporting this amendment. It is largely the Greens' amendment brought forward by the Labor Party, but let me concede to Senator Lundy that I think it has a refinement or two that makes it even better. Let me reiterate what we are talking about here. We are talking about an impending global emergency which is going to affect the lives of every citizen on this planet and every Australian for decades to come. The later the action is taken, the greater the action that will be required. Over the last century the earthâthis planet, the only living place we haveâheated up by one degree Centigrade, or 0.6 degrees to be exact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast global heating ranging from one to six degrees in this coming century. In the wake of the heating disasters that we just saw in Europe and Asia, where 5,000 people died in France and preliminary figures are going into the thousands in India because of the heatwave, some scientists are now saying that we have to look at seven to 10 degrees heating by the end of this century, making large areas currently inhabited by millions of people totally uninhabitable because of global warming. Who would deny that that is going to involve the extinction of large slabs of our fellow creatures on this planet? That is what 1,200 of the world's top scientists, including 100 Nobel laureates warned us of a decade ago.</para></talk.start><para>Which peoples are the greatest malefactors when it comes to this? Australians, like the Americans, are the worst per capita polluters of the environment and the worst causers of global warming on the face of the planet. Here is an opportunity for the Howard government to do something about it and it is going to vote against itâeven when it just pertains, as this bill does, to the environment of Australia. We have 11,000 people in Tuvalu who are going to be missing their country by the end of this century if the worst predictions come true. They have appealed to allow Australia to take them lock, stock and barrel. The Howard government, whose policies are contributing manifestly to this emergent global warming crisis, says, `We won't take them; we will leave it to New Zealand,' where people per capita on average produce half the global warming gasses that are produced in Australia under the Howard government.</para><para>The Howard government is going to oppose this greenhouse trigger because of the coal and aluminium industriesânot the people of Australia but the big money, vested interests who have open access to Prime Minister Howard's door against the interests of the average Australian citizen. This is culpable; this is irresponsible. This is the government putting its head in the sand as the sand heats up and saying that it is somebody else's problem, particularly the next generation's, or that there will be a technofix. They are dreaming that somebody else should fix up the problem that this government, and like governments around the world under the pressure of these big industries, is creating.

Does the minister agree with her department's view that trying to crack down on share investment activities that enable rich families to get the family tax benefit cannot occur due to `the complexities of assessment and verification by Centrelink' and because it is not cost effective? Given that this minister has shown she is prepared to strip the tax returns of 650,000 average Australian families each year, no matter that the debts have come about through no fault of those families, when will she show the same alacrity to close this loophole for the rich?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13892</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the senator for the question. I will deal first with this allegation of stripping families of their tax returns when the overpayment they might have incurred may have been through no fault of their own. That may be true. There may be families who have quite openly told Centrelink what their income estimate would be during the year and they might have changed it appropriately. There might be families who at the end of the year have a windfall of one type or anotherâit might be the opportunity for extra overtime, which is appreciated, or it might be a capital gains tax, for example, the selling of a beach house. The capital gain would come in in that year and dramatically push someone over. Of course, they would then incur an overpayment because adjusted taxable income for social security purposes is not the same as taxable income for income tax purposes. </para></talk.start><para>The key point is of course that family tax benefit is paid on the basis of two things: your income and the number of children that you have, and there are differing rates for the age of the children because it has been ascertained that children cost different amounts at different ages. We can say this: families in the same circumstances should get the same amount of money. If a family overestimates their income because they think they are going to have a pay rise or they think they are going to get overtime and they therefore do not get as much family tax benefit from us, at the end of the year we do what has not been done in the past: we top them up and give them their entitlement so that a family in the same circumstances as another family will get the same amount of money. Equally, a family who has assessed their income in another way and who may have fallen short in their estimate and may therefore have been overpaid will be required to pay that money back. It will be treated, in effect, as a down payment on the next year's entitlement. Up to a certain amount of money, families pay back at $20 and at another amount of money at $40. I do not regard it as stripping them of tax returns.</para><para>The family tax benefit is integrated and related to the tax system. Just as in the tax system sometimes lucky people get a cheque saying, `Here you are; you have had too much tax taken away during the year and you get some tax back,' and other people get a notice saying that they have to pay more, with the family tax benefit system some families who have been paid more will be told at the end of the year, `Hold on, you have an overpayment; we have to fix this up,' and hundreds of thousands of families will be told, `Hold on, we did not give you enough,' and we will top them up in a way that no government has previously done.</para><para>As to the first part of the question, which related to share trading, the advice I have at this pointâand I want to qualify this because I think it needs further checkingâis that the definition we use of `adjusted taxable income'ânamely, income for social security purposes in relation to family allowancesâis the same as Labor used when they means tested their family allowance.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13893</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question arising from the partial answer by the minister.

Is it low-income families who have got the biggest tax gainsâhuge tax gainsâfrom us? Yes, it is. Is it low-income families who now get a lot more in family tax benefits? Yes, it is.

I do not think they did.</para></talk.start><para>Senator, I have already saidâyou perhaps were not focusing on this issue because you were reading out a question from someone elseâI have asked my department to look at this with the tax department and see if there is any loophole that can be reasonably closed, if there is in fact one.

One of the major reforms that we are requiring in the agreements is that the statesâthey have not done this beforeâas they come up to the plate, should tell us what they are going to spend in this financial year and at least match our growth in funding. Some states have failed to tell us what they spent last year and what they spent the year before. So the public do not even know what they have spent for the past two years, let alone what they are going to spend for the next five years. Yet the states demand that the Commonwealth tell the public what we are going to spend five years in advance. So one of the reforms is about transparency and fairness. If the Commonwealth is asked to say what we are going to spend for the next five years, the states ought to tell us what they are going to spend, in order to give patients and hospitals certainty.</para></talk.start><para>One of the other reforms is to ask the states to report on certain achievements under the health care agreements. Some statesâfor example, New South Walesâ have not even achieved the number of separations that they have been paid for in the life of the last agreement. So we are saying to them that we want better reporting and more information so that the public knows how their hospitals are performing. We want to see how they have spent the money. It is very simple: come up to the plate and tell us what you are going to spend and make sure that you enable anybody who fronts up to a hospital to be treated as a public patient. Let me say that some people are being cajoled into using their private health insurance in ways that are totally unconscionableâthey are being rung up and asked after they have left hospital to change their admission details in order to help with hospital funding. That is outrageous. We want the states to treat people, if they turn up to a hospital, as a public patient; we want to ensure that they report on how they have spent the money; and we want them to match our funding. </para><para>The health reform agenda has been driven by the health ministers. As I said yesterday, I have cooperated with the statesâwith nine groups who have given us ideas on how we can reform the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. We spend $40 billion on health every year between the Commonwealth and the states. If we can drive those dollars further, we will get better health outcomes for people. We can actually reform and streamline cancer care, we can improve the delivery of mental health services, we can improve quality and safety and we can improve pharmaceutical benefits and the way they are used.</para><para>There is a summit going on at Old Parliament House.

It would add another layer of bureaucracy. We have a system in place now with elected representatives. We are electedâthe commission would not be electedâto deliver health, to pay for health and to ensure that we get cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth.

However, what is important, Senator, is that we do not go for bits of information and therefore give out misinformation and mislead the public, so let me deal with these two matters separately.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the review of saved cases of carer allowance, a good portion of these are, of course, people who were saved cases and were saved by a Labor decision in 1992â which we did not disagree with and in fact continued the quarantining of. They were reviewed because there was a change in 1997 or 1998 and they were promised at the time that they would have no further review for five years but that when that five years came up they would be reviewedâand they are now in the process of being reviewed. What we have found with about 40 per cent of those reviews done is that there was a good and proper reason to do them. A third of the people at one point last week who had had their payments cancelled self-assessed as no longer being entitled. There were children who were asthmatic who obviously needed assistance and care when they were younger but who, as they grew older, were able to manage their condition better, their medication improved or perhaps even their condition did. And so it is with insulin-dependent diabetes, where very young children cannot handle their medication but, as they grow older, they can. In fact, we are told by the various associations that we should treat these children as they become adults as being able to live perfectly normal livesâand I think we have senators who understand that very much in relation to diabetes.</para><para>So they were reviewed for medical condition, which was very important, and, of course, they were reviewed for income and assetsâand I do not think anyone would disagree that that should be the case. The disgrace over those reviews is that one of your colleagues encouraged plenty of people to believe that they would necessarily lose payment when, as you know, Senator, something like 99 per cent of those who were reviewed at the particular point I am talking about maintained their paymentsâthis is the Down syndrome childrenâand those who lost it lost it only because the child was not in care or for some other reason, but not in relation to the medical condition. That is the disgrace of the saved cases reviewâthat you and your colleagues chose to frighten a lot of people who have a lot more on their plate than they need and do not need to have added a fear campaign so that somebody can get a headline.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âYou are a hypocrite!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âWithdraw that, Senator Conroyâit is unparliamentary and you know it is!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âI withdraw.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>âAs to the family tax benefit, the senator asked me about foreign income.

It is something that Labor never understoodâthat to deliver ongoing public benefit, you had to run a sound economy. It was made particularly difficult for us because, when we came into government, of course, we inherited $96 billion of Labor's debt. The year we came into government we found a $10 billion deficit when Senator Cook, a senior economics minister on the other side, said it was actually in surplus.</para></talk.start><para>Under Labor the books were a mess, but we have been able to turn them around. We have delivered five budget surpluses and we have taken the tough but fair decisions needed to strengthen the economyâand Labor opposed every one of them. But the people of Australia are now seeing the benefits, despite Labor. We have been able to create 1.1 million extra jobs; businesses are continuing to grow and employ people and invest; consumer confidence is up; interest rates are, of course, at record lows, which helps Australian home buyers; and, most importantly, by returning the budget to surplus we can now direct more money towards those areas that are important to Australian familiesâand health is just one area where the Commonwealth government is making substantial new investment.</para><para>We are investing in a better health system for all Australians. We have put on the table a record $42 billion for public hospital funding. As Senator Patterson said, that is an extra $10 billion over the last agreement or an increase of 17 per cent over and above inflationâit is a 17 per cent real increase; a $10 billion real increase. That would deliver greater certainty for hospitals and great benefits for the Australian people. It is in addition to the $917 million that we have invested to make Medicare fairer for all Australians, to improve affordable access to GPs, to reduce up-front fees and to train more doctors. Together, this represents the largest ever investment in health by an Australian government, and I congratulate Senator Patterson.</para><para>What is Labor offering? We saw the Labor premiers on the television last weekend calling for reform. What is the offer of the Labor state premiers? Not one of them has put forward an offer at all. The Commonwealth has $42 billion on the table but the state Labor premiers only call for talk. We know what that is code for. That is code for the Commonwealth having to take more funding responsibility and the states having to take less. And this is at a time when the states are awash with money. They have the GST: the growth tax in Australia. They have all of it, every single last dollar of it. How much of that are they offering for health? They are not putting a dollar on the table. They are awash with money from stamp duty. They have so much money they do not know how to spend it. But how much are they putting up for public health? What have they put on the table? Nothing. All they have said is that they want more consultation. They want another process of reform and they want to put it on the COAG agenda. If these state Labor premiers were genuine, they would be putting their money on the table and they would be matching the 17 per cent of the Commonwealth. Then the public would really benefit.

The family allowance or family payment, or whatever they were called then, were not means tested. Later in Labor's term they were means-tested but the advice I have is that the child disability allowance people were nonetheless able to keep their disability allowance.

I think there are a couple of points that need to be borne in mind. I would, first of all, repeat everything I said to Senator Bartlett on this issue, I think about a year ago. That is, you do need to ask yourself, SenatorâI think we all need to ask ourselvesâwhat is served by a royal commission. Some people who have unfortunately suffered abuse will be pleased to come forward and get help. But I make the point that those people who have suffered abuse do have at the moment avenues to go through to get help, to tell their story and to get assistance. I am not saying that there should not be more, but there are some avenues there.</para><para>I want to lead on and link that, however, to those people who would rather forget. It is not for you or me to say to them that they ought to come forward, to make the assumption that their lives will be better if they do that. Therefore, I am not confident that a royal commission will, as you say, rid us of this problem once and for all. One of the reasons I am not confident of that is that in fact the greatest majority of child abuse actually happens not in the institutions but in the home. What are you going to do? Call up hundreds of thousands of families in Australia and ask them about their experience of it? While we are naturally concernedâanybody would beâabout institutions that hold themselves out to be in some way morally superior to the rest of us and that allow this to happen, so we should be revolted when it happens to any child. It does not matter to me if it is a priest, their father, their uncle or the boy next door.</para><para>You can always get a headline wanting to kick the churches, but the real problem lies in our own homes, not in the churches andâ I will even let the state governments off the hook for a minute, but I would welcome a supplementary if you have oneânot in places that provide state care. Let me make the point that there are a lot of people who take children into care who are good and decent people, who every day do the right thing by these children. When the general public talk about children who are abused in state careâand it does happenâthose people who have got kids in state care in their homes think that the general public will believe that it is them. So there are degrees of sensitivity that need to be looked at in this area.</para><para>As for the state governments, there is a lot they can do. Later I will be raising a matter which I believe is one I can look to you for your support on. In some states, the rate at which a child who is accepted and agreed to have been abused and who comes back within 12 months with the same claim is far higher than the rates in other states. If you are really interested in this, let us get some facts and figures, go to those states and ask them what they are doing. Even worse, in some states the rate at which a child who is not believed and who comes back within 12 months with the same claim which is found to be right is higher than the rates in other states.

You can ask the senators who attend: I take a position which is different from some other ministersâbut which was followed by some Labor ministers and not othersâand that is to interfere as little as possible and let the Public Service do its job because I think estimates committees are a very important part of parliamentary accountability. Saving except for pains in the neck who ask the same question 20 times and you have to say, `We're wasting time,' or `You're badgering a public servant,' or, if there were some political point to be made, `Don't interfere.' So I do not generally look at these answers and my chief of staff's advice concurs with that. I have not checked the answer. If I have signed off on it, I will come back and tell you. As to what has happened over the last couple of days, Senator, as you know, I was on my way to and/or in Derby on Thursday and in Fitzroy Crossing on Friday and had, as you would understand, very limited telephone communication over this.

Yes, that is true, it was, so you should have had plenty of time to have read it. What they make plain in the article is that, although there would seem to be some discrepancies between research conducted by them on the one hand and by the Department of Education, Science and Training on the other, in fact there is no inconsistency. They do say that there are a number of policy variables which make it difficult to determine whether or not students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have greater difficulty, but they also say that it is very difficult to reach firm conclusions. There is a particular debate relating to the meaning of participation in higher education. The Chapman and Ryan research deals with enrolments, the DEST material deals with applications and, as they say, the distinction is very important.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Our work on HECS and the analysis of applications in the DEST research are posing difficult questions. It is therefore credible for the Chapman and Ryan research to find generally that the introduction of and changes to HECS had no effect on enrolmentsâas we didâand for the DEST analysis to suggest small decreases in applications for some groups after the 1997 changes. So what that means is that there will continue to be an ongoing debate, which of course is grist to the mill for those who are looking to try to demonstrate disadvantage, but the reality is that you will be very hard-pressed to come to that conclusion.</para><para>There are a number of data problems associated with the analysis that has been conducted by the department. I think we have already gone over that in considerable detail. There is no doubt that the changes involved in this whole process do put greater pressure on universities to perform. That is at the heart of Dr Nelson's challenge to get at least one Australian university into the top 100 in the world. Excellence may not be a critical factor as far as you are concerned, but for students it is absolutely important. They certainly want to see high-quality education options available. If they cannot get them from one institution, they should have the ability to go elsewhere. These changes are designed to try to ensure that the overall standard is raised without disadvantaging those from poorer backgrounds.

The Australian Taxation Office recently released its compliance program for 2003-04. The program outlines the risks to Australia's revenue and the steps the tax office is taking to address them. While the vast majority of Australian people do do the right thing, there are some specific areas identified for increased compliance focus.</para></talk.start><para>The tax office will increase its use of data matching to identify those who try to operate outside the tax system. Last year, the tax office collected an additional $3 billion for the community as a result of audit work, and 67 people went to jail for avoiding their tax obligations. Over the three years to 30 June 2003 the tax office estimates that an extra $2.6 billion in revenue has been collected as a result of tax reform's impact on the cash economy. The tax office's compliance program is part of an effort to ensure a fair, efficient and effective tax administration system for all Australians, because this government believes that protecting Australia's revenue base, low taxation and getting the economic fundamentals right underpin growth and wealth that can provide vital services such as health and education.</para><para>And what is Labor's plan for health and education? Labor wants to increase taxes. It wants to increase the Medicare levy. The evidence that the Labor Party will rip into the taxpayer to meet additional spending is overwhelming.

Tony Jones said:</para><quote><para>I raise it because this is in your facts sheet about tax and I'm just trying to get to the point here of what you mean by saying Australia is a low taxing country relative to other OECD countries.

Both of these propositions cannot be right.</para><para>Senator Conroy was the first in a long line of Labor spokesmen who spilt the beans on Labor's plans to slug the taxpayer when he fessed up to a group of schoolkids a couple of years ago.

But there were 22 questions.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13908</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the explanation.</para></motion><para>It is more than three monthsâit is almost four monthsâsince I asked the questions on 5 May. I would argue that there are a lot of people who really need answers to those questions. They are timely and urgent. As the minister will recall, all Pan Pharmaceuticals products were recalled with a class 1 classification. That means that they were deemed to be potentially life threatening. The TGA has said that the majority of the recalled items did not fall into class 1 classificationâ in other words, they were not life threatening. In fact it is probably disputable whether Travacalm, the one product which was said to have triggered the recall, was even that. However, the vast majority of those recalled items fell under what is known as `medicine potencies outside standard limits' and a routine recall would have been necessary. But there is not even any evidence that the majority of those items were outside standard limits. No testing was done to indicate that.</para><para>My question was: what prompted the government to set up an expert committee to review complementary health care? This would appear to have been a failure in quality control in manufacture, not a failure of the complementary health care system or complementary health products. This government chose this opportunity to set up a council which would look into those products that many would say did not need looking into.</para><para>A member of that committee, Professor Alastair MacLennon, is reported to have said that the government should not support the complementary health care industry. Why then was Professor MacLennon not ruled out as a biased member? Instead, the government put him on this committee. These are serious questions, and the minister has had them since May and has not bothered to answer. I asked who on the committee has expertise in regulatory controls to meet appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and I asked for details to be provided. Again, there was no indication of that. I asked who on the expert committee has expertise in the interaction between complementary and prescribed medicines and the communication of this information to health care practitioners, and I asked for details to be provided. They are pretty obvious questions and they point to a lack of proper process in this whole recall matter.</para><para>It was said that 15 August was the date that this committee was to report to the government. My question does not include whether that report has been received and what the minister proposes to do with it. Presumably she has had it for some days, but I would like to ask the minister to include that question here as well: what has this committee discovered and when are we all going to hear about it? I asked whether the committee called for public submissions but I understand this did not happen. Again, three months ago it was a reasonable question; now it is probably passe. But how will this committee collect its evidence? I ask: why was this a level 1 recall? Clearly it was not and should not have been. Why is it that other options were not taken up? Why was it that Pan Pharmaceuticals' products other than Travacalm were recalled at all? There may have been poor practices at the manufacturing base but this is no reason to recall all of those products and, I must say, to thrust so many small businesses into a dire situation. Many of them found that people came back to return the products and they had to hand over money for refunds, but there was no question of compensation for them. The whole thing really is a serious mess.</para><para>Why didn't the TGA examine some of these products before doing that recall? As I said, they were not a classification 1 recall, not posing a danger to anybody and, by recalling them, they simply inconvenienced consumers and small business people. I think it would have been more sensible for the TGA to have informed the Complementary Healthcare Council so that the industry could work together with the TGA to test all those products in question. It is my understanding that Wal-Mart in America was selling and still is selling Pan's recalled products, and that they tested them and found them to be of good quality. I looked up the Internet and there was certainly a warning in the UK that this has happened in Australia but, to my knowledge, no other country has seen fit to recall every product that had a Pan Pharmaceuticals component to it. So I asked whether the government could confirm that in Europe Pan's products were still being sold, likewise in New Zealand. I think this is information that we in this place are entitled to know, as are those people who use these products and the small businesses that use them too.</para><para>According to the Complementary Healthcare Council, sales of medicines are down 20 to 40 per cent and export sales are down $200 million. My question still is: does the government intend to compensate small retail businesses for that economic loss and the general decline in consumer confidence? What response has the government made to the request from the Complementary Healthcare Council for funds to invest in marketing for the industry and for positive statements to be made by the government about complementary medicines? We are not talking about a small sector; it is well known that vast numbers of people use these products and by all accounts they use them safely. It is a bit like the ethanol debate: once you start to suggest that there is a serious problem then people wonder about whether they ought to be taking these productsâwonder unreasonably, I would suggest.</para><para>We wanted to know what progress there had been to the government's request to major distributors that claims by small business for refunds to consumers for recalled products be expedited. We would like to know whether the government is monitoring the financial impact of this recall on small business. If it is not doing that, why is it not doing that and what does it propose to do? I would say to the minister and to all ministers in this place that the Senate is getting a little fed up with the way questions put on notice are treated with disdain. I know there are a lot of questions in this set of questions but it is the case that this is a topical issue. It affects thousands of people. I know that all senators in this place will be receiving messages in the hundreds from people in the complementary health care system. If they are not then they are not looking at their emails. If you think that there is no interest in this question then that would be a mistake. What we do want is to have answers to questions provided in good time. I certainly do not think that almost four months is in good time, and I urge the government to get the answers to these questions to the Senate as quickly as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13909</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me set the record straight.

On the one hand, we have a minister who is happy to justify stripping the carer allowance from 30,000 families with disabled kids and, on the other hand, evidence has emerged that indicates hundreds, if not thousands, of high-wealth families have accessed family tax benefit payments. The double standard is quite stark and obvious for all to see. Right under the minister's nose families earning hundreds of thousandsâif not millionsâof dollars per year have pocketed payments which are worth up to $4,300 per child; yet low-income and middle-income families caring for kids with severe asthma, ADD, diabetes or cerebral palsy are being stripped of a modest $87 per fortnight benefit. Moreover, these are not completely new issues.</para><para>The income test for FTB is an original fault, of which the minister has had full and adequate knowledge for a long timeâyet she has done nothing. Today she professes innocence and is suddenly talking to her department and trying to receive some advice about the problem. Now that the figures are out there, the minister is running for cover and blaming everyone but herself. The minister has failed to adequately address the loopholes that Labor has been identifying. Firstly, when a claim for family tax benefit is lodged, no verification is made of current family income. Payments are made on the basis of customer estimates alone. Secondly, margin lending losses from playing the share market may be used by families to artificially reduce assessable income. Thirdly, and finally, the government relies on the self-reporting of foreign income with no verification measures in place.</para><para>I will take the points one by one. The first is verification of income. The fact is that high-wealth individuals may access family tax benefit A payments because, at the time of claim, no verification of family income occurs and payments commence on the basis of a customer estimate alone. Indeed, the current family tax benefit rules mean that families may obtain these payments for up to two years before they must provide details of their actual income. While they may have to eventually repay the benefit, it does allow high-wealth individuals and families to pocket payments for up to two years interest free. It is this same flawed estimation system that punishes honest families. Even if they advise Centrelink of changes in their income, they may still have their tax returns stripped to recoup the money.</para><para>The second point is margin lending losses. Unlike the negative gearing of property, families who negatively gear shares may reduce their assessable income for family tax benefit. This is an illogical and clear loophole. It is also a practice that has exploded in recent years. The net value of margin lending loans has exploded from $2 billion in 1996 to more than $10.5 billion today. There are 130,000 individuals who have margin loans in Australia and, even if just one uses the mechanism to claim more of the family tax benefit than they would otherwise have received, it is one too many. This loophole should be closed forthwith.</para><para>The final point is foreign income. The other loophole pointed out by Labor is that, while foreign income impacts on family tax benefit payments, no verification is made by Centrelink. Essentially it is an honour system. Foreign income is, of course, a major problem for taxation as well. Currently only foreign cash transactions of more than $5,000 are tracked by financial institutions and AUSTRAC, and only a small proportion of these may be investigated by the ATO. As a bare minimum, Centrelink ought to seek bank statements and obtain data from financial institutions to obtain concrete information on those who derive a foreign income. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13911</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne salient piece of information should be put into this debate to take note of answers by the Minister for Family and Community Services in question time. That fact is that there are around two million Australian familiesâwith something like 3Â½ million childrenâwho are, at the present time, benefiting from the introduction of the family tax benefit by this government. That is a huge number of people who depend upon the capacity of the government to deliver benefits to them through this mechanism, and I think it ill behoves us to begrudge them receiving that kind of benefit. The vast majority of Australian families with dependent children benefit from the government's family tax benefit. Expenditure on family assistance under this program has increased by about $2 billion, and I will come back to why that is in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>With so many people benefiting from these arrangements and so much money involved in this program, it is inconceivable that, from time to time, anomalies in that arrangement will not arise. Anomalies were identified during the process of the estimates committee hearings earlier this year. They were identified and acknowledged not just by members of the estimates committee who might have been sitting opposite but also by the minister herself. Much has been made of the so-called discovery that some very wealthy peopleâ15 millionaires, supposedlyâare receiving the family tax benefit. That information was discovered by virtue of a table being produced at the Senate estimates committee. On production of that table, some doubts were raised about its accuracy. At the upper end of the income spectrum, the numbers supposedly receiving benefits were quite small. But still it did appear to show that 15 people on incomes greater than $1 million were receiving the family tax benefit.</para><para>To her credit, Minister Vanstone took that information and ordered an investigation into how that could be. Minister Vanstone has not come to this place and argued, as those opposite would like to pretend, that it is fine for millionaires to receive the family tax benefit. On the contrary, she has made it clear she does not believe that is an appropriate outcome, and she has said instead that there should be an analysis of how the system throws up such results, if indeed there are millionaires receiving the family tax benefit. Careful analysis of each of the cases in that particular matter has had to be undertaken, and that analysis is not yet complete. Of course, there are privacy issues in that as well.</para><para>In any system this large, there could well be perfectly innocent explanations as to why this kind of result might be thrown up. There could be the incorrect transfer of data from one set of figures to another. There could be some cases where benefits have been saved from earlier recipients and preserved in some way that goes against the current guidelines. It could also be that some people are claiming those benefits who are not entitled to them, and perhaps in some way the system has not properly identified them. Whatever the explanation, it behoves us all to let that analysis which Minister Vanstone has initiated be completed and then we can come back and decide whether or notâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>âWill you guarantee you will bring the review back?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KO6</name.id><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name></talker><para>âIt is not up to me to do that, Senator.

I remind senators that there are two million Australian families receiving benefits under this scheme. If you think you can administer a scheme that large without anomalies on occasion being thrown up, good luck to you. I think it is as credible as any other promise the Labor Party is making at the present time, if that is what you say. This government deserves credit for seeing a problem in the way in which the system is being delivered and moving quickly to identify solutions to that problem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>13912</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week we had the debacle of the carer allowance reviews, and here today we have been given a further insight into why the Minister for Family and Community Services is not suitable to have responsibility for this very critical portfolio. I guess really we should be asking ourselves, `Why did the Prime Minister appoint this minister to this particular portfolio?' because it was about eight years ago that the Prime Minister, John Howard, told us about his fairer Australia. We have seen nothing fair from this minister. And then we heard about his commitment to look after Australia's battlers. The last two weeks has shown us that the understanding of what an Australian battler is is not known either to the Prime Minister or to Minister Vanstone.</para></talk.start><para>The double standards of the government have been exposed by what we have seen in the past couple of weeks. At the same time as families earning hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars have been pocketing up to $4,300 per child, we have at the other end of the scale the low- and the middle-income families caring for children with severe asthma, diabetes, attention deficit disorder and cerebral palsy being stripped of a modest $87 per fortnight in benefits. Clearly the minister has lost control of the day-to-day running of her portfolio. I think it is open to question as to whether she has any feeling for those in the community who are less well off and less able to cope with the difficulties thrown up by life from time to time. Even worse, the minister is blaming everyone but herself for the mess that we are confronted with. It seems to be a part of the government's philosophy that ministers blame someone else if they make a mess. The minister has clearly failed to adequately address the loopholes, and it has been left to the Labor Party to raise them.</para><para>When a claim for family tax benefit is lodged, there is no verification of current family income payments made at allâit is the applicant's estimate alone that is taken into account. This leaves those big salary earners at liberty to show their absolute greed, and they feel no embarrassment about it whatsoever. We could say, `We should deal with those people,' and no doubt the minister will deal with those people now that it has been exposed. But it has shown us another side of some of thoseâyou cannot mark all of them downâwho are wealthy within the community. Many of those who are wealthy in our community are out there to get anything they can and to lean on everyone barring their own capacity to earn. Yet those who are least able to provideâthose who are less well off and those with children who need acute careâwould not think to, and do not have the capacity to, look for rorts of the system or to look for loopholes that have been left open. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></question><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13913</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat we have seen in question time today is an attack on the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, and the governmentâan attack on the government's and the minister's administration of this important big budget item and sensitive portfolio of social welfare.

We have a serious issue here in the minister's response to the questions both last week about the carer allowance and today about the whole issue of the number of people who have extraordinary levels of income and who are receiving the family tax benefit. There are some issues that still need to be raised in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>This afternoon in answer to a question from Senator Faulkner the minister talked about the fact that she had checked with her chief of staff and her staff had actually made changes to the answer. She said that she does not interfere. She said that she likes to let the public servants do their job. Unfortunately, the outcome of that decision is that we have a minister who does not know what is going on in her department. Given the sensitivity of the department and the issues that are raised in this debate, that is a real area of concern for us. </para><para>The minister's responses to the questions and the excuses she offered us today in her answer are of concern to us all as well. First of all, yesterday she suggested that Labor was somehow responsible for these wealthy families keeping their benefits. She knows that is simply not true. While it is true that some families were receiving child disability allowances in 1993 and they retained the family payment when the benefits were overhauled, the coalition decided to preserve their benefit again in 1998 when the carer allowance was introduced.</para><para>So the last review, which occurred in 1998, and which gave five years grace for the reviews, was a decision of the coalition. The minister also claimed that Labor's opposition to the current carer allowance review was somehow preventing wealthy families from being removed from receiving the benefits. That is a pretty desperate kind of claim because we all know, and the minister certainly ought to know, that the carer allowance is not means tested. Perhaps the minister is considering introducing an income test for the carer allowance. If she is, she certainly should say so. But there are many, many unfortunate families currently being thrown off the benefit and losing it because of the tighter medical assessment, not their income. </para><para>I will give an example of the hardship caused as a result of the stinginess of this whole approach. Let me tell the Senate about a delightful young woman that I know. Alice is 13 and has Down syndrome. Her father is 52 and he earns about $26,000 a year. Her mum is a stay-at-home mum, not by choice but by necessity. Alice's mother has not been able to contribute to the family's income. Alice's parents have spent a fortune on sensory equipment to help Alice's development. They receive just $78.80 a fortnight in carer allowance and the maximum family tax benefits allowable. </para><para>Last year Alice's father was directed to do overtime owing to a new contract given to the construction company he works for. As a result of that overtime Alice's family received a debt advice from Centrelink for overpayment of family tax benefit parts A and B, irrespective of the fact that they reported changes to their income throughout the year. This system is a system where one in three familiesâthat is about 600,000 to 700,000 families every yearâaccumulate an average debt of around $850 through no fault of their own. The Ombudsman says this system is flawed. He has pointed out that families cannot avoid these debts and that we have to do something to change the system.</para><para>In terms of Alice's family, to add insult to injury, Centrelink sent them a carer allowance review form after the minister decided that some children with disabilities do get better and conditions become more manageable. Of course, we know that Down syndrome does not go away. In cases like Alice's, sometimes children are able to achieve incredible results and show improvements, but improvements for a Down syndrome child or young adult do not mean the same as they do for an able-bodied child. Improvements might include actually being able to get a bus independently. Improvement could mean maybe being able to cook toast or pour cereal for themselves for breakfast. But what it does not mean is that those daily chores can be done unsupervised. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>13915</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>13915</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hutchins</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on poverty and financial hardship be extended to 27 November 2003.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ridgeway</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	notes that </para><para>	(i)	the United States (US) Under Secretary of Commerce, Mr Grant Aldonan, has stated publicly that the US wishes to challenge reference pricing as part of the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Australia, saying, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 13 August 2003, `there is a sense of unfairness in the US' because US consumers paid high prices under a free market while consumers in Australia and elsewhere benefited from low `reference prices' under schemes like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS),</para><para>	(ii)	the price of pharmaceuticals and the PBS would increase significantly in Australia if our PBS `reference pricing scheme' was diminished or abandoned, and</para><para>	(iii)	any free trade agreement with Australia must pass the US Congress;

The telecommunications industry is attracting significant new investment which increases the potential for national security and law enforcement issues to arise. </para><para>Under the Telecommunications Act a person may apply to the Australian Communications Authority (the ACA) for a carrier licence so long as the person is a constitutional corporation, a partnership of such corporations or a public body. Under the existing framework in the Telecommunications Act, consideration of national security and law enforcement interests is currently not required as part of the carrier licensing process. The ACA is not required to consult with the relevant national security and law enforcement agencies prior to issuing a carrier licence to an applicant and whilst the grounds for refusing to grant a carrier licence are not limited under the Telecommunications Act, the ability to refuse to grant a carrier licence on national security grounds is not provided for expressly. </para><para>The bill amends the Telecommunications Act to ensure that national security and law enforcement interests are considered in the carrier licensing process by: </para><para>(a)	requiring the ACA to consult with the agency co-ordinator in the Attorney-General's Department prior to granting a carrier licence; and</para><para>(b)	allowing the Attorney-General, in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the Telecommuni-cations Act, to direct the ACA to refuse to grant a carrier licence on national security grounds.</para><para>The agency co-ordinator is a senior official in the Attorney-General's Department who liaises with national security and law enforcement agencies. The agency co-ordinator will be able to extend the consultation period up to a maximum of 12 months in four 3-month periods to deal with any security issues raised by an application for a carrier licence. For example, it may be possible to enter into a contractual arrangement with a carrier licence applicant during this period to address security concerns. </para><para>The provision of extended consultation periods will allow any security risks that have been identified to be effectively managed within the carrier licensing process to ensure that the need for the Attorney-General to exercise the power to issue a direction to the ACA would arise only in extreme circumstances, where the risk to national security could not be effectively managed though other mechanisms such as a contractual arrangement.</para><para>The bill will also allow the Attorney-General, again in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the Telecommunications Act, to direct a person not to use or supply, or to cease using or supplying, a carriage service or all carriage services to itself or any other person on national security grounds. The direction may be issued with respect to particular individuals, groups or existing telecommunications industry participants, whose activities pose a risk to national security.</para><para>Similarly to the power to direct the ACA to refuse a carrier licence on national security grounds, it is expected that the Attorney-General would exercise the power to direct a person to cease using or supplying a carriage service only in extreme circumstances where the risk to national security cannot be managed effectively through other mechanisms. </para><para>The bill amends the Telecommunications Act to allow for the application charge for a carrier licence to be refunded to the applicant if an application is refused by the ACA or upon review. There is no current provision in the Telecommunications Act for the refund of a carrier licence application charge. While there has not been a carrier licence refusal to date, the new provisions in the bill that will allow the Attorney-General to issue a written direction to the ACA to refuse to grant a carrier licence on national security grounds could increase the likelihood of a licence being refused.</para><para>The bill amends the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act<inline font-style="italic"></inline>(the ASIO Act) to enable a carrier licence applicant, a carrier or a carriage service provider to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of an adverse or qualified security assessment that ASIO has provided to the Attorney-General. It is expected that ASIO would provide a security assessment to the Attorney-General in connection with the Attorney-General's consideration of whether to issue a direction on national security grounds to the ACA to refuse to grant a carrier licence or to a person not to use or supply, or to cease using or supplying, a carriage service or all carriage services to itself or any other person. The proposed amendments to the ASIO Act will also require the Attorney-General to notify a person of an adverse or qualified security assessment in respect of that person except where such notification would be contrary to the interests of national security.</para><para>The bill amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (the ADJR Act) to exclude from judicial review under the ADJR Act decisions made by the Attorney-General under the proposed amendments to the Telecommunications Act on national security grounds. The exclusion of judicial review under the ADJR Act is consistent with existing exclusions under the ADJR Act for similar decisions based on national security considerations. Judicial review will still be available in the Federal Court under section 39B of the Judiciary Act and in the High Court under section 75(v) of the Constitution.</para><para>This bill also contains several other minor amendments to the Telecommunications Act to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of current call data disclosure and interception arrangements. The amendments will:</para><para>(a)	accommodate current law-enforcement agency management structures in the definition of âsenior officerâ in subsection 282(10) of the Telecommunications Act;</para><para>(b)	clarify that, when executing a telecommuni-cations warrant, carriers and carriage service providers should provide all relevant information associated with that communi-cation, along with the call content; </para><para>(c)	clarify that the capability to intercept a communication passing over a network, facility or carriage service is the fundamental legal obligation to be met by carriers and carriage service providers under Part 15 of the Telecommunications Act; </para><para>(d)	impose a 60-day timeframe for the agency co-ordinator to consider applications by carriers and carriage service providers to be exempted from the obligation that their networks, facilities and carriage services have an interception capability; </para><para>(e)	require carriers and nominated carriage service providers to include in their interception capability plans statements about current and continued compliance with their interception obligations, and to require interception capability plans to be signed by, or on behalf of, the chief executive officer of the carrier or nominated carriage service provider; </para><para>(f)	change the date on which carriers and nominated carriage service providers must lodge their interception capability plans with the agency co-ordinator and the ACA from 1 January each year to 1 July each year; and</para><para>(g)	change references to the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland to the Crime and Misconduct Commission of Queensland which was established in 2002.</para><para>The package of amendments contained in the bill will lead to more secure telecommunications networks and services and improved arrangements for the provision of assistance to law enforcement agencies by telecommunications carriers and carriage service providers.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Moore</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>13924</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Motion for Disallowance</title><page.no>13924</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13924</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That Amendment 41 of the National Capital Plan (Gungahlin Drive Extension), made under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, be disallowed.</para></motion><para>I would like to explain to Senator Lundy that I would have preferred to have delayed this motion but it is the Labor Party's support for the government position to have it brought on and dispensed with today that leaves me no option but to bring the motion forward. That then brings us to the debate on the substantial matter, except for one thing: the major reason for delaying this vote of the Senate would have been to allow the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, which is inquiring into this matter, to have deliberated. It has not done so, and I always believe that a debate is better when you have the information which gives the best determination. I think this should have been delayed longer so that we could get the evidence from all the citizens involved, all the authorities involved and the government instrumentalities involvedâ both at territory and national levelâbefore this determination to proceed with the eastern alternative goes ahead.</para><para>I am not going to canvas in detail the arguments for the alternatives, except to say that there is a very strong local community group, headed up by the Save the Ridge residents, who are opposed to the decision that has been made because they believeâand they have a very cogent argumentâthat this alternative is going to have by far the most detrimental impact on the environment. That does not mean just the local environment; it means the natural heritage of this important part of the ACT's constitutional make-up. They believe that there are better alternatives. One can argue very wellâas a number of residents and organisations in the ACT doâthat there is not a need for this debate to be taking place. They argue that there are better alternatives, including the one thing the ACT lacks greatly and needs very importantly: a better public transport system. Canberra, by design, is a beautiful, pleasant place to live in but it is the most spread out capital city in the nation. It has a bus service but it does not have a rail service. Residents have been pushing for a light rail service and for alternatives which would lessen the impact of road transport on the wonderful amenity that Canberra has. This Gungahlin expressway is simply going to increase the impact. It is going to be a further incentive for the motor car and motor truck to dominate Canberra at a time whenâand we were debating this earlierâwe should be sensibly going to clean, quick, efficient public transport.</para><para>You cannot divorce the two. The more you press for expressways and the more you put up to $100 million into this particular roadwork, the less money there is available for public transport. It has become too much embedded in the mind of both Labor and Liberal governments that public transport is an add-on. It is not; it is a real alternative. Until the mindset changes so that you understand that the future of world society depends on efficient, clean public transportâ particularly public transport not based on fossil fuelsâthen we are adding to the problem every time we link one part of a city with another part by a new expressway, as is happening in almost all capital and major cities in Australia.</para><para>That said, the argument against the route that has been chosen by the National Capital Authority is a very strong one. The Save the Ridge group have made their submission to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inquiry into the National Capital Authority. They have a list of reasons for their concerns, particularly their concern with the planning route that has been decided by the NCA for the Gungahlin Drive extension. Their concerns come under the headings:</para><quote><para>1. Lack of accountability and transparency of NCA.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>2.

It has got important plant and animal communities, it is in the city and it is going to be very badly affected by this expressway. The submission goes on to list further concerns under the headings:</para><quote><para>4. The terms of reference set by the NCA were skewed.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>5.

Part of his letter, which has gone to the opposition, says this:</para><quote><para>As an ANU scientist I am also the chief investigator on a $1.2 million ARC funded linkage project that uses the natural resources on Black Mountain reserve and Bruce ridges.

The GDEâ</para></quote><para>that is, this expressway, the Gungahlin Drive extensionâ</para><quote><para>threatens our research project and undoubtedly many others. I have recently been offered a Canada research chair and am now considering moving my team and our research project to the University of British Columbia. It is now my opinion that the NCA and the ACT government provide no support or incentive for research projects in the ACT. The Gungahlin Drive extension is a fine example of short-sighted planning that will not only destroy a unique asset but with it destroy opportunities for research that could be of huge benefit to the prestige and economy of the ACT and Australia. I urge you to consider this request very seriously.</para></quote><para>That request should be met in the way the doctor asks. I brought forward this disallowance motion because there is strong feeling in the community about it. The Senate is the backstop here. We do have responsibility in this fashion for what is happening in the ACT. There are community groups and large numbers of residents and academics who are opposed to the ACT's decision in this matter, and it is quite proper that that opposition should find expression in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13926</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is also with some regret that I find myself in this position in the Senate. Had due process been followed and the policy of the ACT, now Labor, government on their preferred route, the western route, been adopted and accepted then we would not in fact be here. If that had happened, we would not have to be debating this disallowance motion of the amendment that would allow the eastern route to be constructed. There is some important history of this debate that I think needs at least a little airing this afternoon. First and foremost is that the eastern route is not the ACT government's preferred option. In fact, the western route was, which in large part would have satisfied the concerns of the Save the Ridge group and other citizens concerned about the eastern route. Obviously it would have provided the solution to a growing traffic problem in the new area of Gungahlin.</para></talk.start><para>However, the Labor government in the ACT, in their wisdom, have determined that a road to solve the Gungahlin problem is their first and foremost policy. For Labor it is not a question of the western route or no road. This is where the concerns of Save the Ridge diverge from the ACT government. The Labor government was put in a position where it had no choice if it were to build a road. It was forced to accept the route determined, effectively, by the National Capital Authority. I can say that because the chain of events that emerged following the election of the ACT government very clearly demonstrated how the National Capital Authority asserted its powers under the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act to directly influence what could or could not be done. Without going into the detail now, because I do not think it is necessary to the germane issues we are debating here today, the NCA concluded that in their view only the eastern route was allowable.</para><para>In my view, this was a very politically fraught debate. I certainly have alleged on more than one occasion that I felt the National Capital Authority's actions were highly political with the involvement of Minister Tuckey. I think that is highly regrettable. It actually does not change anything because, whatever the circumstances, if the ACT government were going to build a road to serve the needs of Gungahlin residents they would have to build it on the eastern route. They made that decision in those circumstances in December 2002.</para><para>Under the provisions of the act, that amendment to the National Capital Plan is subject to a disallowance and it is that disallowance moved by the Greens in March this year that we are debating. One of the interesting things about this debate and why we are now debating the disallowance in these circumstances is that, unlike any other act that I could find or have been made aware of, that particular act governing the National Capital Plan does not have a time limit on the number of days that a disallowance can stay on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. Usually legislation requires and specifies 15 days, and this debate would have been brought on in that manner. But for some reason this act does not have that provision, hence the concern I expressed when I rose earlier to prevent further postponement of this debate that we are in fact in a situation whereby it could be postponed in perpetuity, never allowing the Senate to actually debate the disallowance, regardless of the various views. That is of concern and certainly why Labor feels very strongly that this issue has to be decided. For the record, it has actually been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for some 28 sitting days, but that amounts to some four months of deliberation. </para><para>This disallowance motion does not prevent works beginning on the road. With respect to the deliberation, once gazettal has occurred work can actually start, but it is not particularly desirable. I for one would certainly argue that, if a disallowance is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, it is reasonable that that be respected, particularly if it is known that the prospects are that it is going to be successful. However, that is not the case in this regard and now we find ourselves needing to bring on the debate, and I acknowledge the Greens withdrew what seemed to be some confusion about a further postponement to allow this matter to be debated.</para><para>I now turn to some comments made by Senator Brown about the role of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. That committee is currently inquiring into the role of the National Capital Authority, but those terms of reference do not specifically go to whether or not the Gungahlin Drive extension should proceed on either the western or the eastern route. That inquiry is able to reflect upon those issues and is continuing to do so. But the terms of reference do not play a formal role one way or the other in determining matters relating to this disallowance. </para><para>I guess my view in following this area is that, ultimately, the ACT government is the appropriate body to determine the location of the route. In the lead-up to the ACT government election, the western or eastern route was the big issue. I said at the time that the ACT election should effectively serve as a referendum on the western or eastern route of the Gungahlin Drive extension, and I believe it did. The upshot was that Labor was not allowed to proceed with its policy of the preferred western route. It was prevented from doing so because of the views held by the National Capital Authority and, I believe, the federal Liberal Party. As a result, Labor put the need for the roadâand the only option left to it by the National Capital Authority, that of the eastern routeâat the forefront, making it policy to allow that road to proceed. I do not believe that it had any choice in doing that. It was a situation whereby Labor was forced to concede to the powers of the federal act governing the ACT land and planning issues as a result of our status as the nation's capital.</para><para>It is my hope that in the future, when we have had time to reflect on this and other circumstances, we can find a way to better establish the roles of the different territory and national capital planning authorities and how they can work together to achieve the best outcomes for the ACT. I do regret that the ACT government has been reflected upon by Save the Ridge and others as somehow not representing their interests, because there is not a government that has fought harder for its own policy than the current ACT Labor government. I will also say that I respect and think it appropriate that the ACT Labor government believes that a road is necessary over the proposition put by the Australian Greens that no road is the best option.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13928</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to oppose the disallowance motion which Senator Brown originally moved in this place, as pointed out by Senator Lundy, in March of this year and then over a series of postponements dealt with today. The motion to disallow amendment 41 to the National Capital Plan would have the effect, if it were to be passed, of preventing the route of the Gungahlin Drive extension being determined to the east of the Australian Institute of Sport, although it is obvious from what Senator Brown has had to say that his intention is that the road be prevented from being built at all. He would prefer that there was not a road on any alignment down, or close to, the O'Connor ridgeâand I will comment on that aspect of his position in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>The route for this road has been a matter of debate in the territory for a very long time. The idea of a road travelling between Belconnen and north Canberra was first foreshadowed in planning documents issued by the NCDC in the mid-1960s. The proposal firmed up in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the road was described as the John Dedman Parkway. More recently its name has been changed to the Gungahlin Drive extension, acknowledging that there is a road called Gungahlin Drive travelling through part of Gungahlin and the new road will be an extension of that.</para><para>The first question I would like to pose in this debate today is very simple: why are we debating this matter? Why should we be debating this matter? The National Capital Authority is responsible by statute for determining the location of national and arterial roads in the ACT. That is clear from its legislation. It does not build the roads, generally speaking, but it does determine their location. The Gungahlin Drive extension is not a national road; it is, however, an arterial road. It is designed to service the needs of Gungahlin residents, most particularly, undertaking domestic journeys between Gungahlin and areas in the south of the ACT like south Canberra, Woden, Weston Creek, Tuggeranong and perhaps, as a very long diversion, the city centre of Canberra.</para><para>What is the national interest in determining the route of an arterial road within the ACT? It is true that the Commonwealth has had its interest sparked by the proximity of the road to the Australian Institute of Sport and has quite appropriately felt the desire to protect the integrity and the interests of the Australian Institute of Sport in the deliberations about the route for the road. But in a sense that is a coincidence. This debate would still be proceeding even if the AIS were not located in that corridor, because the NCA retains a responsibility to decide what the route should be, given that it is an arterial road. With great respect, it seems to me that, as the ACT is self-governing, the location of arterial roads within the territory servicing the domestic needs of ACT residents ought to be determined by ACT residents themselves through their elected parliament and not by the national parliament.</para><para>That is a personal view and a digression. I return to the matter which is before the house. As has been indicated by Senator Brown and Senator Lundy, there are two essential issues in this debate. The first is whether the road is needed at allâthat is, whether we need to reserve a route for an extension of Gungahlin Drive into the central part of the city. The second, if we do need to reserve a route, is whether the route should travel to the east or to the west of the Australian Institute of Sport. Let me address the first question: whether a road is needed. I think that the case for this road along this corridor is simply irresistible. It is extremely difficult to argue on the basis of any comparable city plan anywhere else in Australia that a road of this kind could be dispensed with.</para><para>As I have said, this road is designed to serve the needs of the residents of Gungahlin. At present Gungahlin has between 30,000 and 40,000 residents but it is planned to ultimately have 110,000 residents. When it is complete, if it has been completed in accordance with the present territory plan, it will be the largest of the territory's townshipsâlarger than Belconnen is at present, with something like 90,000 residents. Yet it is the only township that has been planned until now without a choice of arterial escape routes to allow egress by residents. With the current level of vehicle use in the ACTâor, indeed, anywhere else in Australiaâit is simply inconceivable that a road would not be necessary to service such a large number of people. For example, the planning for Belconnenâwith, as I mentioned, 90,000 peopleâincludes four arterial exits. In Tuggeranong, which is a bit smallerâwith about 80,000 residentsâthere are, again, four major arterial exits.</para><para>At present in Gungahlin there is only oneâNorthbourne Avenue, the main entrance into Canberra city and the road used by people coming by car from Sydney or Melbourne. It is very significant route which is at present seriously congested for periods during the morning and the afternoon. That generates a very large amount of so-called rat running whereby residents are forced to use suburban streets in Belconnen and particularly in north Canberra to avoid those congested roads in finding their way into more southern parts of the territory. Even with the creation of the Gungahlin Drive extension and a further arterial road to the east of Mount Ainslie, the so-called Majura Drive through the Majura Valley, Gungahlin residents will have less accessibility than residents in Tuggeranong and Belconnen. There will be fewer lanes available to them to drive anywhere out of Gungahlin. That is unfortunate.</para><para>Senator Brown said that one of the reasons why roads need to be provided at a high level in the ACT is that Canberra lacks a good public transport system. Senator Brown said that Canberra needs a better public transport system. With great respect, I think that is nonsense. The ACT has an excellent public transport system. I challenge Senator Brown to travel on one of the ACTION buses and see what a good public transport system it is. It is clean, it is efficient, the timetables are very well kept to and the routes are in good locations. Frankly, I think it would be very hard to compare ACTION with any other public transport system in any part of the country and not find this city's public transport option excellent.</para><para>The problem with the public transport system is that it is not well used. People do not take advantage of the public transport system. In part, that may be because the option to use cars has historically been available in the ACT, and most residents in the ACT do in fact choose to use cars. But the argument that we can avoid the need for the Gungahlin Drive extension by merely closing off access routes to and from Gungahlin, forcing people to use public transport because there are no other options available, is a very poor way of producing the outcome that Senator Brown would argue forâthat is, presumably, that we have a much higher take-up of public transport and do not need roads like the Gungahlin Drive extension.</para><para>Indeed, some comment was made on this when the earlier work that was done in the ACT addressed the question of the alternatives of public transport. The ACT government previously commissioned the preliminary assessment evaluation for the John Dedman Parkway proposal, as it was then called, in 1997. That followed the earlier preliminary assessment under the territory's planning legislation by Maunsell Pty Ltd. They commented in that evaluation on a document produced by the Conservation Council of the South-East Region and Canberra entitled <inline font-style="italic">Canberra at the crossroads: a way out of the transport mess</inline>. I quote from the evaluation: </para><quote><para>The report suggests that if much higher levels of public transport patronage are achieved then the John Dedman alignment will not be needed. It suggests targets of 30% of work trips, 65% of city centre work trips and 50% of trips to ANU.</para><para>The PA assessed traffic demand at three levels of public transport patronage, the current 10%, 20% (twice current levels) and 30% (three times current levels). The 30% overall patronage level equates to over 50% transit share for civic work trips (close to the suggested target of 65%). Even under this scenario traffic modelling in the PA demonstrated that a John Dedman Parkway would still be needed.</para><para>The crossroads report suggests that traffic demand can be further ameliorated by reducing the population of Gungahlin from 110,000 to 85,000.</para></quote><para>Gooromon Ponds is a proposed base for a township for the ACT which in fact lies outside the present borders of the ACT beside the road between Canberra and Yass. It is being considered at this stage because alternative options in the ACT are very limited. The evaluation goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It is likely that Gooromon will be a substantial development area in the future especially as Jerrabomberra is increasingly constrained by grassland and endangered species issues. Population not accommodated in Gungahlin may well go to Gooromon. Gooromon traffic will access the city via the Barton, Northbourne and John Dedman corridors. The John Dedman alignment should be retained to meet this need if and when it arises.</para></quote><para>Of course, the need most certainly has arisen, at least as far as planning for it is concerned at this stage.</para><para>It is very hard to argue that in some way the residents of Gungahlin in the ACT should be discriminated against vis-a-vis other residents who enjoy much better road access to their residences. Equally, a much more carefully researched and compelling case needs to be made than the one which is presently available to us, which is that somehow if a magically much greater level of public transport usage can be engineered the road will not be required. I suspect that even if public transport levels of the order found in Sydney or Melbourne were engineered for Canberra we would still not be able to do without a second major arterial route out of a township of the size that Gungahlin will ultimately beâthat is, in the order of 110,000 people. If you look at similar population centres elsewhere you will see that very well demonstrated.</para><para>Senator Lundy, in particular, raised the question of the issue of the eastern route versus the western route. I do not want to go into that in great detail because that is perhaps a debate for another day. Clearly, Senator Brown wants to achieve a situation where there is no route specified. He may or may not prefer the western route over the eastern route, but the fact is that once you have got over the argumentâas I think you mustâ that there is not a need for the road, then the question of east versus west is an interesting argument.</para><para>Very briefly, the case for the eastern route as opposed to the western route is based on three main grounds. The first is that the western route takes the road much closer to housing, particularly in Kaleen. We have generally tended to avoid major arterial roads passing close to housing in the territory. It would be a pity if that principle were not to be applied in the case of this road. The second is that to put the road on the western route would make it pass through developed parts of the ACT, particularly through the suburb of Bruce. It would be a road effectively bisecting the suburb and facilities of Bruce. It would have the effect, for example, of separating the sports precinct in Bruce from the industrial estate there. It would have the effect of putting the road very close to the student residences at the Institute of Sportâand having a major motorway just a few feet from their bedroom windows is hardly the kind of encouragement one would want to give to our young aspiring sportsmen and sportswomen.</para><para>The most compelling argument is that the western route would be significantly more expensive for the ACT consumer. That route would cost at least $10 million more and, on some estimates, $30 million or more than the cost of the eastern alignment. It might be very generous of members of this place to decide magnanimously that they prefer the western route over the eastern route but, of course, it is the residents and the taxpayers of the ACT who have to foot the cost of the alternative route. I do not think it is appropriate for us to make that decision. The fact is that, on a number of grounds, the eastern route is a much better route.</para><para>As to the impact on the environment, I concede that the arguments between east and west are rather closer, but it is wrong to suggest that the western route is free of environmental problems. It is not. It is also wrong to suggest that the eastern route is extremely damaging to the environment. I have personally walked the area concerned to examine it. It is, in some parts, seriously degraded. In fact, part of the route was a tip for ACT residents in past years. It does not travel along the route of the ridge itselfâthat is, the highest part between north Canberra and Belconnen. In fact, it travels very close to the developed areas where the Bruce Stadium and the Institute of Sport are currently located, minimising the impact on the environment.</para><para>Particularly for reasons of cost, I think it is very likely, notwithstanding what Senator Lundy has told the Senate today, that the ACT government was quite relieved to be told that it could not have the western route because of the very considerable costs and problems associated with that route. It can at least now look the Save the Ridge group in the eye and say, `We did our best,' but still pocket the saving between the eastern and western routes.</para><para>Senator Lundy indicated also that she regretted the role that the NCA has played in interfering with the ACT government's decision. Given what I have said about what I think should be the role of the NCA in such matters, I have a smidgin of sympathy for that point of viewâjust a smidginâbut I also point out that Senator Lundy did propose at the time the previous government was in place and was talking about the eastern alignment that perhaps disallowance of that eastern alignment might have to be contemplated by presumably Senator Lundy and her colleagues in the Senate. If it is wrong of the NCA to overturn the decision of an elected ACT government, presumably it is also wrong of the Senate to do so.</para><para>I close by saying that I think, irrespective of whether the Senate should be having this debate, it is very important to make a decision which allows a route to be settled upon and to proceed. I invite senators who have any doubt about the subject to travel to Gungahlin early one morning, climb in a car at about quarter past eight or half past eight and attempt to travel to Parliament House and see how long it takes them. They should compare that kind of travel with similar routes elsewhere in the territory and see how very difficult the position is for residents of Gungahlin. I urge the Senate to oppose this motion of disallowance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13932</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to lend our support to the disallowance motion today. I begin by saying that I agree with much of Senator Humphries's articulation of the issues. I may not agree with all the conclusions or the answers that the senator put forward, but I think all of us involved in this debate today have raisedâor, indeed, will raiseâconcerns, whether a smidgin or a lot, about the role of the NCA. The issue of the role of the federal government in arguably a self-governing territory is perhaps an important debate but, as the previous speaker has said, perhaps one for another day, although it is of course quite pertinent to the debate before us.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lundy commented that the previous election in the ACT was in a way a referendum on the issue, and I agree with her on that. I put on record again the position of the Australian Democrats. When we went to the last ACT election, we had a very clear policy on this issue. It was a clear policy of opposing the eastern alignment of the GDE, and the Democrats intend to stick to that commitment, whether it is through our federal representatives or, indeed, through our member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, Roslyn Dundas. We believe that the eastern alignment of the Gungahlin Drive extension should be removed from the National Capital Plan altogether. As colleagues may know, my ACT colleague Roslyn Dundas has been involved in many debates on this issue in the assembly and has articulated her opposition to the eastern route in the media and in the community. So that comes as no surprise. On behalf of the Democrats, she has met with the AIS on occasions to identify its concerns, with the goal of course of resolving some of the issues. An inspection of the western route was also conducted to inspect the social and environmental impacts of the road. That is obviously an issue that has been raised.</para><para>As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have also put on record the opposition of the Australian Democrats to the approval of this process; hence, our final opportunity today through this disallowance motion to put on record our concerns and our opposition. We have actively participated in the protection of O'Connor Ridge in discussions to assist the campaign to stop the eastern route of the road going through. One of the main concerns we have of course is the environmental devastation that we believe, and others believe, would be caused by the eastern alignment of the GDE. We believe that this would be the worst possible environmental outcome that could be produced. The previous speaker made clear that perhaps there are environmental considerations with the western and the eastern routes and, yes, we concede that, but we believe that the eastern alignment is the least preferable.</para><para>We have been concerned by the ACT government's dogged determination to push the Gungahlin Drive extension through the east despite overwhelming evidence that there are environmental and other impacts and also against strong public opposition. Despite the fact that the inquiry by the Standing Committee for Urban Services had of approximately 1,000 submissions only 2.5 per cent that favoured the government's position that the road went to the east of the AIS rather than to the west, the government has maintained its stance regardless of that community concern. Besides major public opposition to the eastern option, there is also evidence that the western route can be better, more economical and, arguably, more efficient than the eastern route, which could require the running of an inferior highway up and down slopes through the most ecologically significant part of the Canberra Nature Park.</para><para>We knowâand I am sure that the last thing the Senate probably needs is additional history, but I will attempt to be brief because I think colleagues have already outlined some of the historyâthat the current plans have been on the table for around 40 years since town planners recognised that an effective road link to Gungahlin was needed to deal with the population expansion in the national capital. A transport corridor for the Gungahlin Drive extension was originally identified before the Australian Sports Commission and the AIS were built at the Bruce precinct. In 1991 the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory ratified the need for this road link. In 1997 several routes were examined as part of the John Dedman Parkway preliminary assessment. From this process, two proposed alignments emerged as the only viable options: the first, the eastern option, which would run on the O'Connor Ridge side of the Australian Institute of Sport side of Bruce; and, the second, the western route, which would run through the western side of the AIS. Over the years consultancies commissioned by the NCDC have favoured routes to the west of the AIS. There are the two previous studies, to which you have already heard referencesâMaunsell back in 1975 and 1977ârecommending and confirming the western option.</para><para>The issue of the Gungahlin Drive extension has, since its inception, been a political issue. I do not think anyone in this chamber debates that fact. It has particularly been a political football for the two major parties. With a growing population in Gungahlin, what I would call poor transport and infrastructure planning and the increased pressure on the Gungahlin roads, the ACT government was forced to make a decision. Hence, we found ourselves in the position before the last election where both major parties were forced to make a decision as to their preferred options. The parties took two clear and distinct proposals to the electorate at that time. The ACT Liberals promised to build the road along the eastern alignment, cutting through the nature reserve, while the ALP committed itself to the western route. Recognising that both major parties were committed to a road and that a road would be built one way or the otherâand the Democrats do recognise that factâthe ACT Democrats took the position that a western route was preferable to the eastern alignment. We took a very clear stance opposing the eastern route. This is not a new-found position.</para><para>The ramifications of the Labor and Liberal decisions, it could be argued, were quite electorally significant. The issue of saving the O'Connor and Bruce Ridges, Canberra's inner city nature park, became a very strong community issueâand it still is. I mentioned that overwhelming community opposition to the proposed eastern alignment before. I think that the Save the Ridge campaign is a cry with which many Canberrans and others of us are familiar. I think that is an important part of this debate, because it does involve the issue of an election promise being broken. </para><para>Following the Labor Party's success in the 2001 ACT election, Labor did progress planning and design work to ensure that the GDE would be built to the west of the AIS. The construction of the GDE to the west of the AIS required an amendment to the National Capital Planâthe jurisdiction of the National Capital Authority. Late in 2002 the NCA indicated that they would not support a road built along the western route. Apparently their basis for this was a concern that a road along the western route would impact adversely on the Australian Institute of Sport. This argument, we believe, has been brought into question by the Fitch report, among others, commissioned by the ACT government. This one was released earlier this year. The report, which has been discussed through the joint standing committee, particularly at last week's hearing, states that an eastern alignment would have a greater environmental impact than a western alignmentâagain, a concern for the Democrats. It states that an eastern route would cut through the bushland through which AIS athletes regularly jog and cycle as part of their training and that a western alignment, with all the additional noise abatement and impact reduction that have been proposed by the Stanhope government, would surely have impacted less than an eastern route.</para><para>Our concern is this: with the Labor Party having promised the voters of the ACT a particular route and that, if elected, it would protect the valuable inner city bushland, what was the response of the Labor government when the NCA made its position clear? Again, this relates back to the powers of the NCAâan unelected, arguably unrepresentative government agencyâto tell a democratically elected government the path that it should pursue. The debate as to whether or not the Labor government put up a sufficient fight is one which has no doubt raged within the assembly and the community. It is not one which I will explore today, because all of us have touched on the broader issue: the powers of a self-governing elected assembly and government as opposed to the government agency that is the NCA.</para><para>Today we are presented with an opportunity to stand up against a decision that was made by the NCA and acknowledged and accepted without the fight that we would have liked to have seen by the Stanhope government. We have got an opportunity today to stand up for the interests of those Canberra residents who were promised an alternative route, a chance to knock back the NCA's decision on this particular issue and maybe send the draft amendment back to the National Capital Plan for a closer look. As I mentioned earlier, the standing committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the NCA and is in the process of hearing evidence about a range of these issues. I look forward to the outcome of that inquiry.</para><para>Again, the Democrats reiterate our concern for what is a broken promise to the people of Canberra. Our concerns relate to the powers of the NCA and the backflip by a Labor territory government. We hope Senator Brown will have the numbers and the disallowance motion before us today will be passed. Our concern is that if this process goes ahead, valuable bushland will be destroyed. This bushland provides a rare and valuable inner urban recreational amenity as well as a habitat to wildlife. It is enjoyed, and has been enjoyed, by generations living in the inner north of Canberra.</para><para>The Democrats also reiterate our call for something that is long overdue: a long-term integrated transport strategy. I will not pick up Senator Humphries's point in detail hereâthe notion that there is a good public transport system that is not necessarily well used. I think that is an interesting debating point. I would urge Senator Humphries to read some of the submissions that are coming into the joint standing committee, particularly in relation to the issue of public transport. I do not think any state or territory in Australia has public transport right yet, from a range of perspectives, so there is always room for improvement. A long-term integrated transport strategy is appropriate.</para><para>We believeâand my colleague Ros Dundas in the ACT Legislative Assembly certainly also argues thisâthat the people of Canberra have not had sufficient transport planning and they have had an ineffective allocation of funds in that area. We must deliver a scheme that will focus on the transport needs of the ACT for the next few decades, not just for the next few years. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance of the approval of amendment 41 of the National Capital Plan, the Gungahlin Drive extension, as part of our long-running concern about and opposition to the route that will be going ahead if this disallowance motion is not supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>13935</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI congratulate Senator Stott Despoja for that very good summation of why this disallowance motion should proceed. I will be very brief because most of the issues have been canvassed. However, I want to refer a little to Senator Humphries's submission, because I thought it was quite extraordinary. The first thing is that Senator Humphries says it is not appropriate for us to make this decision. Here is the democrat at workâif Senator Stott Despoja will forgive meâversus the market fundamentalist. What we have in Senator Humphries's submission is that the due democratic processes of ACT governance do not count and that the backstop that the Senate provides in a debate like this, with its elected representativesâone on either side from the ACT, to boot, both of whom have contributedâought not to count. That leaves the NCA. I might ask: who elected them?</para></talk.start><para>If you go a little bit further back, it leaves the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Wilson Tuckey, pulling the strings. So much for democracy when it gets to a true market fundamentalist. It really has to be taken out of the people's hands and determined by people behind closed doors, with their ears shut to public submission but with a very big clout at the end of the day. I would have thought Senator Humphries, as a Liberal, would have more respect for democratic processes than that. What it boils down to is him supporting Wilson Tuckey against the democratic options that the people of the ACT have had. If you go back to the election then you go back to the western alternative for the Gungahlin Drive extension.</para><para>The second thing is that Senator Humphries got down to the real grit of the environmental argument with his comment that east versus west is an interesting argument. No, it is not. There is a compelling argument for the western alternative, and that is what is driving many of the people who are fighting to save the ridge. It is not interesting; it is compelling. No wonder Senator Humphries did not get into a rebuttal of itâ because there is none. He simply goes right across the top of the environmental values and, true to a market fundamentalist, gives them zero weightingânothing at all. We come back to this argument that we are moving large numbers of people, and then always the rational, fastest way to do that is what comes out because there is a dollar sign attached to it at the end of the dayâ$10 million on this occasion, Senator Humphries says. So dollars count and environmental values and long-held legal planning principlesâguidelines to the NCAâgo out the window when it is convenient. Bring in other alternatives and make it expedient, and ultimately the decision here is not made by the people of the ACT but by Wilson Tuckey and the NCA, behind closed doors.</para><para>Senator Humphries says, `I will verbal Senator Brown while I am at it and say that he doesn't want this at all, that he stands for public transport and that the expressway is not an alternative.' In case he is tempted, as I think he may be, to go and spread that about, let me make it clear that the Greens have been arguing for the western alternative. Added to that has been a very good argumentâand Senator Stott Despoja just outlined it very wellâthat public transport should be considered and brought into this debate. Had that been done long agoâhad a start on it been made in 1910 or 1920âwe would not be having this debate. We would have a city with a public transport system second to none in the world instead of a city with a future linked to expressways only, in a world where that is a prescription for greater environmental and traffic difficulties. Senator Humphries strayed to it a little when he said we do not want roads and cars near houses. But we are talking about cities. If you do not want roads and cars near houses, what is your alternative? It is public transport: clean, efficient, quick, cheap public transport.</para><para>But, as always with market fundamentalists, there comes into it a cost factor. They do not even look at it because they presume it is going to be more expensive, and they discount social and environmental costs. Those costs equal zero in that line of argumentâ even for a great city like Canberra, whose ambience and amenity are salubrious and beyond the dreams of every other capital city in the world. Those other values equal zero in the argument put forward by Senator Humphries. I reject that.</para><para>I believe it is our right to be debating this matter here. The Greens are not the least bit on the back foot about bringing up this matter. After all, there is a motion that the Senate can choose to or choose not to deal with. The Greens have said: `Let us deal with it. Let us have the arguments put out and let us, seeing a determination is being made on the eastern alternative, for goodness sake have another look at that. Ameliorate it if you can. Take Senator Humphries out of the room when you do so because, if that amelioration is going to cost a few dollars, he will be opposed to it.' There are other values there that might advantage all concerned. Let them be considered. If nothing else comes out of this debate, at least let those be considered.</para><para>Finally, there has been and there will continue to be a strong public debate about this issue and trenchant opposition to the NCA-Wilson Tuckey-Senator Humphries alternative because it is the wrong one. The people of the ACT need to be recognised. They are citizens. This is their city. They deserve better than to have their submissions ignored behind closed doors. They deserve better than to have their vote in their territory government ignored. They are not going to get recognition from Senator Humphries, they are going to get it from Wilson Tuckey and they are not going to get it from the NCA, but they are recognised in this place today. I think they are recognised very strongly by Senator Stott Despoja, by Senator Lundy and by me. That is the function of this place. You never know what will happen in these campaigns, and I personally hope that people will keep up their strength and yet see better sense and greater wisdom brought into this debate so the decision foisted upon them is altered.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy PresidentâSenator J.O.W.

It is an important amendment, and I hope committee members will take particular notice of it. It is to ensure that in the future any components of Australian heritage that are so important that they have been listed by a minister under the new system are not delisted without the authority of parliament. In other words, delisting has to be by regulation. The reasons for that are very obvious: pressure can be brought on any minister of the day to delist part of Australia's heritage, whether cultural or natural, by big-moneyed interestsâwhen what Senator Hill calls `social and economic values' come into play. The amendment simply gives parliament that authority. It is a very important backstop to the protection of national heritage.</para><para>I think Senator Hill, being a democrat by nature, will support this. I am pleased to be able to draw it to his attention, because it was just one of those things that he overlooked. It is an extremely good amendment. I know that Senator Lees will want to support it as well, because it is such an important backstop for protecting Australia's heritage down the line. Mark my words: there will come a time when a minister of the national government of Australia will be under backroom pressure to delist part of the Australian heritage, to take off one of its values, to remove some acres of it or to give over some buildings, some foreshore or some forests, because a developer wants to get at them in some way or other. If the arguments are good for that, put them to the parliament and have the parliament make that decision. It should be done by regulation. There should be the option for both houses of parliament to look at it, to give their stamp of approval before a heritage area, place or value is delisted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>13939</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was about to leap to my feet to move Labor amendment (1) on sheet 3051 but, given that it is identicalâand given that Senator Brown leapt to his feet and moved his amendment on the issue of the disallowanceâI indicate that Labor will support Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 3050.

Where the minister wishes to remove places because of a loss of heritage value, she or he must do so using the vehicle of a disallowable instrument.</para></talk.start><para>Labor believe that removing a place is a significant step. To make sure that there is absolutely no doubt about the role of parliament in the decision making process, Labor's amendmentâwe are debating the Greens amendment but ours is identicalârequires that a disallowable instrument be used. I have to say that this is again an attempt by Labor to make this government accountable. Our primary complaint with these heritage bills is that effectively the opportunity to maintain the independence of the Heritage Commission has gone. Labor, as I have said before, are not in a position to support these bills but have supported this particular amendment because we proposed to move one that expressed the same thing and it presented an opportunity to improve specific accountability to the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>13940</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have to say that I do not understand Senator Brown's amendment and therefore I rise to seek some clarification. The government bill has the effect that if a site is to be removedâif the minister decides to remove it as a result of loss of valueâit is a disallowable instrument; it can be disallowed. The only instance that I can see where it cannot be disallowed is if it is being removed on national security grounds. That seems to me to be a reasonable outcome. If the government has taken a national security decision then I do not think it is appropriate that it be disallowable; if it is a values issue then there is an argument that it should be. The government has accepted that, and that is the way the bill has been drafted. If that is clear, as I think it is, I cannot see the point of Senator Brown's amendment, unless he is trying to achieve some other outcome that is not apparent to me. It is interesting that both Senator Brown and Senator Lundy can clearly see something here that I cannot see. One of the two might explain it to me.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>13940</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a removal of doubts clause. There is some doubt, in the way the government has written the legislation, that in all cases there will be an opportunity for parliament to disallow the removal of a place of national heritage value from the Heritage List. Already the minister has said, `Except where national security is at stake'. Could the minister give us an example of where that would be the case? In any event, when he gives the example, I ask committee members to think about this: why should the parliament not be involved in an important matter like that? We are talking about a very short-listed national heritage register which lists the most important components of the nation's heritage. This is a doubts removal clause. It simply says the parliament should be there to validate the delisting of an entity from that list, whatever the circumstances.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13940</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf we are debating whether or not a disallowance on national security grounds should attract a disallowance then that clarifies the issue. There is clearly an issue between the government and Senator Brown; I do not know about the opposition. If that is the issue between the government and Senator Brown then we stand by our position that, if it is removed on national security grounds, it is inappropriate that it be disallowed because of the executive responsibility of the government on national security issues. What would be such a circumstance? I have to concede that it takes a bit of imagination to conjure up a circumstance in which a matter of national heritage significance would be withdrawn on national security grounds. Perhaps the national item could be a defence site and the weight of circumstances in which Australia finds itself could mean that a certain defence activity should take place on that site that has a higher precedent in terms of Australia's national interests than the heritage value. I think that is highly unlikely to occur, so we are probably spending time here arguing about nothing. I certainly believe that there is an argument to include the provision in the billâand the government has done that. If the provision is includedâthat is, that there is a capacity to remove on national security groundsâit is inappropriate that that be subject to parliamentary disallowance.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13941</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI reiterate that in all circumstances, and particularly because the minister has not been able to give an example of what he means by national security being at stake, the parliament should be the authority, not the minister of the day, whoever that might be.

Apart from the defence issue, on the values issue I do not think that we have a disagreement with Senator Brown in principle. It is just a question of the best way to legislate, and we believe that our bill as it stands effectively achieves our objectives. Therefore, we would not support Senator Brown's amendment.

The amendment states that its purpose is to avoid any misunderstanding. The intent of it is, of course, to clarify. So I do not accept that for a second. I thought that I would take this opportunity to again reflect on the overall nature of this bill. I will do so by quoting from an article authored by Tom Uren that was referred to earlier in this debate. It appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 13 August this year. Tom Uren's words certainly sum up much of Labor's concernâwhich, I hope, I have conveyed adequately to the chamber in the course of this debate. I will not, obviously, go through the entire article, but I think that its central passages are extremely pertinent. Tom Uren writes:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Gough Whitlam's Government set up the Justice Hope Committee in 1973 to inquire into the National Estate.

A permanent statutory body should be set up to manage the National Estate.â</para><para>The Hope inquiry recommended that the new authority be granted independence from governments. The Whitlam Government created the AHC as a statutory authority, with both houses honouring Hope's recommendation.

Tom Uren also goes on to reflect upon the role of the Democrats and urges the Democrats to support his campaign.

It remains to be seen how the Democrats will treat the final form and shape that this bill takes.</para><para>Finally, in reflecting on Tom Uren I would like to acknowledge his role in seeking to protect Australian heritage through his campaign and his continued advocacy of the need for an independent commission to look after the interests of Australian heritage. Indeed, I acknowledge the fact that that campaign should continue in the context of this bill and following its passage through this place. I thought that it was a timely opportunity to read that excerpt from Tom Uren's piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>. I think that it serves as a timely reminder that the amendment we are now debating is another effort to remove ambiguity on the accountability aspect that having a disallowable instrument for all removals of heritage items from the list brings into this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>13942</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me put the argument again, in regard to what Senator Hill said, to express clearly why this amendment is necessary. We are dealing with the clause in the bill which describes how a minister may remove places or national heritage values from the National Heritage Listâand there are five clauses. All of them mention, in one way or another, the removal of places or values from the National Heritage List by the minister. But when you get to the clause which says that the parliament can disallow the minister's decision, it is only about values, not about places. So a piece can be taken out of a place provided it does not, in the opinion of the minister, affect the values. Why the sudden restriction to values in the disallowable instrument? My amendment ensures that there is consistency right through and that, when it gets to what the minister can disallow, which is places and values, the parliament can override the minister on places and values, not just values. That is the minister's wording. Let us be consistent about it. This amendment, which is shared by the Greens and the Labor Party, says, `Let us make sure, so there can be no doubt about it, that the minister cannot remove either a national heritage place or a national heritage value from the list without the authority of parliament.'</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>13943</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government's problems with this have been enunciated by Senator Hill, but I want to reiterate because I heard Senator Lundy, when she began her last intervention, intimate that she was attracted by the argument in Senator Brown's amendment about creating more clarity. The reality, however, is that it would create internal inconsistencies in the legislation and, more importantly, it would ensure that subclause (1)(b), which allows the minister to remove all or part of a place from the list, applies to only two items. There are only two reasons why the minister can remove things from the list without them being disallowable instruments: firstly, if they seek to have those values and, secondly, if it is in the interests of Australia's defence. Those are the only exceptions; all the rest have to be disallowable. As I understand it and as I am advised, Senator Brown's motion would have the effect of ensuring that these two would also have to be disallowable. That is quite clear. It is undesirable from the government's point of view, and we believe the legislation is better in the form in which it is presented.</para></talk.start><para>I am also advised, in relation to the last part of Senator Brown's contribution, that there is a difference between the way people perceive national heritage places and values, and that the government has adopted the World Heritage modelâthat is, it is values to which you obviously give protection. Of course, those values are attached to a place, and it is obviously very hard to take one away from the otherâthey are intrinsically linked, no doubt. I do understand that the ACF have a different view of that but, on my reading of this legislation, it clearly talks about places on the list. It clearly means that in relation to the places and the values in subclauses (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) they are all disallowable, with the exception of the two which I referred to in subclause (1), which are not disallowable for reasons the government claims are sound.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13943</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst, the government has just said that this measure is based on the World Heritage model which looks at values. That is not right. There has just been a move by the Australian government, backed up by the British and American governments, to try to have a values only system of listing and assessing World Heritage properties. It was voted down in the world forum in Paris. The Australian government failed to get it through there, and now it is trying to introduce it in this legislation. The Australian public know the value of heritage places and know the historical, Indigenous, cultural, natural and environmental values in places, but they want those places protected because they hold those values. Here we have a bill in which the minister has written in subclause (3):</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Minister may remove all or part of a place ...</para></quote><para>However, when it comes to what parliament can do, they can only object to the removal of a value because it has been lost or something.

As I understand it, we already have an exemption power under section 158, which is that a site is not to be listed because it is not in the national interest. I would have thought that if there was a defence-sensitive site, then it would not be listed in the first place. It is hard to see why we need to have that exemption from a disallowance. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13944</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe obvious answer is that we are talking about something that is already on the list. It would not be on the list if the national interest exemption had applied in the first place. But this is something that could be on the list. I heard Senator Hill say before he left that this will obviously be a very rare occurrence. He could not even think of an example, though he tried to come up with one. It may well be a piece of coastal land in the north-west of Western Australia, for example, that has some wonderful valuesâis a wonderful place and has those values attached to itâbut which may be required for defence purposes. For that reason, it may need to be delisted. That is something that is in the future.

Of course, a definition of an action is critical to triggering the application of the proposed heritage legislation. The government's proposed definition of an action significantly weakens the heritage protection laws by substituting the strong definition of an action outlined in the Australian Heritage Act with the weak definition contained in the EPBC Act. </para><para>Under the Heritage Act, the taking of an action includes the making of a decision or recommendationâincluding direct financial assistance to a state or territoryâthe approval of a program, the issue of a licence or the granting of permission. It also includes a recommendation in relation to direct financial assistance granted or proposed to be granted to a state or territory. The EPBC Act's definition of an action, the weaker, excludes these decisions. The effect of using the narrower definition is to exempt all government decision making and funding activity from the operation of the legislation. This amendment is about maintaining the status quo of the definition of an action in relation to heritage, but it also addresses the flaw in the EPBC Act by applying the definition in the Australian Heritage Act and thereby ensuing a higher standard of protection of Australia's natural and cultural heritage than the government has proposed with this bill. That is amendment (1) in this set of amendments.</para><para>Amendments (2) to (6) also deal with the definition of an action. They are directed at widening the scope of the action to include a recommendation. So the first amendment is about including funding decisions and these ones are about including the recommendation. The Heritage Act says:</para><quote><para>... if the adoption of a recommendation would adversely affect a place, the making of a recommendation shall be deemed to affect the place adversely.</para></quote><para>The bill before us weakens the protection for our national heritage by omitting a recommendation from the definition and, therefore, the scope of the activities that trigger the act. Reducing the type of actions to be covered in this bill will result in many Commonwealth actions that affect heritage places being exempted from proper consideration, assessment and decision. The narrow definition of the action that the government proposes in this bill is the same as the one in the EPBC Act, as I said before. The Greens believe that this is one of the major flaws in the legislation that was, as we have heard before, guillotined through the parliament with the support of the Australian Democrats. </para><para>The definition fails to capture policy plans and programs. Only significantly advanced development proposals are captured. By the time they trigger the act, they have significant political and financial momentum and it becomes difficult to properly scrutinise or stop them. This is borne out by the statistics of the operation of the EPBC Act where, of the near 900 referrals to the Commonwealth so far, only one proposal has been stopped. That was the matter of Booth, a case involving a Queensland orchid farmer who wanted to install electrified barriers against flying foxes, and the proposal was stopped because it was already illegal under state law. </para><para>The Greens believe that the critical component of the EPBC Act needs to be fixed, and this amendment does that by extending the definition in the act to ensure that it includes recommendations and funding decisions in accordance with the provisions of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. This will ensure that the full sweep of government decisions is captured. In talking further about the weak definition of an action that we find in the EPBC Act, I think it is quite astounding not to include government decisions and funding decisions in the definition of an action to trigger such action. In the EPBC Act, some other things are not included in the definition of an action, such as a decision by a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation under a whole range of different acts, including the Customs Act, the Export Control Act, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act, the Fisheries Management Act, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, the Quarantine Act and the Trade Practices Act. </para><para>I turn to how these acts in the past and the predecessor to the EPBC Act were able to be used to protect national heritage in Australia. Of course the Export Control Act is an act that I have been familiar with as part of the environment movement in the way in which it regulates the export of uranium from Australia. It is a clear act that has implications in protecting heritage areas of Australia. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act was used in the 1980s to quash a proposal for sandmining at Shelburne Bay in Far North Queensland. The Shelburne Bay region has outstanding conservation and cultural heritage values and is known for its magnificent pure white sand dunes, the Barrier Reef coastline, the heathlands and the forests. The traditional white sands of Shelburne Bay have been described by the traditional owners of the land as `an image of the great white manta ray' landing in that area. Proposals in the 1980s by a Japanese company to mine Shelburne Bay were opposed by the Hawke government. In 1987 the government used the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to quash such a proposal for sandmining at Shelburne Bay. Under the current EPBC Act, these acts are excluded, and it would not be possible for the Commonwealth government to stop a sandmining proposal at Shelburne Bay under this definition of an action. </para><para>The series of Greens amendments that I have moved seeks to redress this situation and return us to a situation much closer to the legislation that we had in the predecessor to the EPBC Act of being able to use all these pieces of legislation, including government funding decisions and recommendations in the definition of an action. I urge the committee to support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13947</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI place on the record Labor's view, consistent with our position on certainly the vast majority of other amendments moved by senators in this place, that we will not be supporting these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13947</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhile it is an attractive proposition to extend the definition of an action, we think that there are many other amendments that would be required to be made in order to bring this into effect.

In response to the points you have made:</para><para>1.	The ACF stands alone in opposition in the spectrum of stakeholders who have engaged in the consultation with the Heritage Bills in recent year. At the meeting of the National Cultural Heritage Forum the following stakeholder groups indicated their strong support for passage of the Bills: Australia ICOMOS Australia Council of National Trusts, Institution of Engineers Heritage Committee, Federation of Australian Historical Societies, Australian Academy of the Humanities, National Heritage Chairs and Officials (representing the state, territory and NZ heritage councils), Royal Australian Institute of Architects, Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology, Australian Institute of Archaeology, Property Council of Australia Museums Australia. Mr Wayne Smith of the ACF was not counted as a supporter. I note the inclusion of the Wilderness Society in your letter. Mr Marr attended the National Heritage Convention in 1998 but has not participated in consultation since that date. The Society has been regularly invited to participate in consultations through the development of the Bills The offer was not taken up,</para><para>2.	I do not understand your claim about the weakening of the existing AHC Act provisions. I expect you are referring to the removal of the grants trigger. In practice this has, in recent years, largely a waste of time and money. By far the majority of the AHC Act section 30 advice matters has been the Director of the Heritage Commission providing formal written advice to the FA Director responsible for heritage grants. They are the same person. I remain surprised you see substantial criminal penalties as a weakening. You would be aware that in the recent case relating to the protection of outstanding Commonwealth heritage on Norfolk Island listing of the area on the RNE proved useless. Section 26 of the EPBC Act was used to provide effective protection,</para><para>3.	Your point about needing to place these sites on the Commonwealth Heritage List is simply wrong. These places are protected now through the existing operation of sections 26 and 28 of the EPBC Act whether they are listed or not. That is why the Bills do not include penalty provisions for Commonwealth places. They are already in place. The Bills provide further clarity, tighter definitions and a management framework for protection that is already there. Having said that, all Commonwealth places on the RNE with heritage values will be transferred to the Commonwealth list. Work is continuing on checking the values for relevant places and significantly upgrading the Statements of Significance. In the last 18 months the AHC has almost exclusively confined its RNE listing action to Commonwealth sites in anticipation for the operation of this provision.</para><para>Your link any alleged World Heritage strategy on the part of the Commonwealth Government is a mystery to me, The Bills focus on `values' vs `places' is based on aiming to achieve the best conservation and practicable management outcome.</para><para>With reference to my comment `existing arrangements are maintained'. This is reference to the fact that, under the new system, the Register of the National Estate is to be maintained by the Australian Heritage Council together with the power of the Council to add to the Register. If there is a departure from these arrangements then it is in the area of a significant expansion of the Council's function vis a vis the Commission.</para><para>The proposal to accommodate social and economic considerations for heritage places is widely seen as sound governance. Comparisons with other EPBC triggers are irrelevant. It is impossible to contemplate that an non-answerable body of heritage experts could make decisions that could impose significant impacts, severe penalty provisions and oversight of the Federal Court on citizens for the potentially large sweep of areas and tenures potentially covered by heritage listing without the opportunity for those citizens to put their case, Almost all those engaged in the consultation process now accept these decisions are rightly to be taken by elected representatives answerable to Parliament. The Bills however readily recognise that the final decisions must me made in an open, proper and transparent way with ready, broad standing, legal redress to transgressions.</para><para>I notice again that something is being made out of any delay on placing Commonwealth RNE on the Commonwealth list. Let me restate the position that delay does not matter. These places are already protected by sections 26 and 28 of the EPBC Act. Any `delay' will be the result of checking that each of the c800 places actually exist and their statements of significance reflect the heritage values set by the legislation. This work is well underway. There is no other agenda at work here. Why would a conservation body want to take an action that misses an ideal opportunity to have sound upgraded statements of significance which, for the first time, become the statutory basis for protection when the alternative is outdated and in many cases, one-line statements of significance?</para><para>Your comments about a partisan position are not understood. The current Bills have their origins in a reform process established in 1996 by Australian Heritage Commission Commissioners appointed by the previous Government. `The second major tier of the Bills is the protection of Commonwealth heritage. The provisions are a direct implementation of an inquiry conducted on the matter by the previous Government. The basis for the national heritage listing policy is an intergovernmental agreement signed in 1997 by all state and territory governments as well as the Commonwealth and the Local Government Association, Successive AHC Commissioners have remained strongly committed to the measures now detailed in the Bills.</para><para>At the recent meeting of Australasian Heritage Chairs and Officials in Wellington NZ there was considerable enthusiasm to see the Bills passed. All of these jurisdictions are Labor Governments. The suggestion of a partisan position is therefore incorrect. There are a number of national heritage strategy programs in train that will implement a coordinated approach to heritage protection. There is already coordinated work addressing early themes for listing, maximising the value of heritage for tourism in regional Australia and a coordinated approach between the protection of national, Commonwealth and state/territory heritage places and areas.</para><para>Even the matter of overseas listing is the subject of enthusiastic engagement. Australia and New Zealand are working collaboratively to achieve early inscription of the Anzac area on our respective national registers. This is been done in close cooperation with Turkey as part of a possible collaborative effort to see the Gallipoli Peace Park put forward for World Heritage nomination backed by the national inscriptions of Australia and New Zealand.</para><para>I hope my points of clarification have been of assistance.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Tom Harley Chairman</para><para>cc Australia Heritage Commissioners</para><para>Australian Democrat, Green and Independent Senators</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âI thank the chamber. I would like to answer another criticism of Senator Brown's on an ongoing issue that we have been debating since we began debate on these bills I do not know how many days ago: values. Senator Brown has some difficulty with the concept of our protecting values. I look at just a couple of World Heritage listings and at the system of protection of values. To start with Kakadu National Park, it was `inscribed on the World Heritage List in three stages over 11 years'. It goes on to say, `It is one of the few sites included on the List for both outstanding cultural and natural universal values.' I will not read any further, but it talks about the various natural and cultural values that Kakadu has under the World Heritage listing. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Looking at the World Heritage listing for Heard and McDonald Islands, the values table there sets out a variety of values. One relates to the outstanding examples representing major stages in the earth's history. Another value relates to the outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes. These are all values for which places are listed. I just want to reiterate that this bill is strengthening the protection because it will be recognising not just an individual building or an individual particular placeâmaybe a bridgeâbut the values of that particular area.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>13950</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI understand Senator Lees's argument and find it very wanting. Of course places are inscribed on the World Heritage List because of the values that they contain which are of universal significance: natural values, cultural values and those dynamic values of evolution of species and cultures to which Senator Lees referred. If you look at the nomination for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage place, Senator Lees, you will find that it is nominated for all four of those natural values. It is one of only a handful of the hundreds of World Heritage nominations in which that conjunction is held.</para></talk.start><para>But there is a growing move by the Australian and American authorities to say, `Let's just list the values.' It is a very clever move, because what it says is, `Then we can get at the rest of these places with developments. Then we can have the historic building kept intact while we exploit the perimeter around it for car parks. Then we can have the wild river kept intact, but we can log the forests on the hillsides to the east and west. Then we can list a rare and endangered species habitat, but we can allow some incursion in the vicinity which is not going to materially affect it'âmining or tourist ventures for some developer who has got at some government. You are opening the door to serial erosion of a place and, with it, the threatening of the values that are within it.</para><para>Everybody understands where a place is and where the boundaries are on a map. As soon as you go to values, you get into opinions. It is a moving feast and, even though those values have been listed, under this legislation it becomes the prerogative of the ministerâgetting some advice from a council, but it does not have any strengthâto determine what those values are. Not so with lines on maps: you know where the boundaries are. But when it gets to values a minister can look a camera and a nation straight in the face and say, `I'm going to protect that value and I'm going to protect that rare plant there, but I am going to allow this tourist development right next to it.' Of course, if a bushfire gets away, people trample on that plant or rootrot gets in as a result of the road going into that development, he did not know about that at the time and some other government has moved in in the meantime. It becomes a moving feast of erodability of the place that has been put on the Heritage List.</para><para>That is why that last amendment was important. The minister has in his legislation mentioned place as much as he mentioned value, but when it comes to the parliamentary powers to do something about deregistration only the values would be able to be deregistered. The minister would be able to come in here and say, `I am protecting that valueâwhile I take a big lump out of that place.' It is a very dangerous drift. Australia, Senator Hill, the Hon. David Kemp, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and the Hon. John Howard, the Prime Minister, are pushing not just in this country but in world fora to try to pull the rug out from under this protection of place. They say, `Leave it to us; trust us with values.' Of course, behind them is a whole suite of developers wanting to get at heritage. It is very important that that be stood against. </para><para>It was a very important victory in Paris earlier this year when the Australian government's move to undermine World Heritage through this `Let's have values and not place' was lostâbut now we have it being advocated here. Senator Lees, I just disagree with you. I think you should protect both the place and the heritage values for which it is listed. It is very important to understand, if it is going to be a continuing debate, that the public will side very much with the places being protected. You know where they are, you know where the lines are and you know what the boundaries are. If you just leave it to values, then anything can get clobbered, ultimately, by a minister asserting that they are going to protect the value while they erode the place.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendments (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nettle's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:18:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator J.J.

I recognise that for ongoing listing of sites that are overseas a cooperative management regime would be put in place between the Australian government and whichever government. But I imagine an emergency listing where it is an interim measure could be used to stop a heritage place being destroyed whilst an agreement was reached between the two governments about ongoing management of the site. So I recognise that in an ongoing sense there needs to be joint management, but I am wondering why that needs to be the case in an emergency listing, given that it is an interim measure. Would it allow time for such a joint management proposal to be negotiated between the two governments in question?

These amendments, as I read them, are not going to have an effect in any event. Senator Nettle might have a problem, but I do not think the problemâ with respectâis with the amendments that are now before the chamber.

Arguably, that may not be necessary. You can have a debate as to whether in fact it is necessary, because arguably it cannot have an effect unless there is a jurisdictional connection.

We see them as a significant weakening of the legislation. I would be interested in hearing the minister's arguments, but it seems to us that there is no justification for the amendments. After all, this legislation applies to Australian citizens and their actionsâso, if an Australian corporation decided to bulldoze something on the Kokoda Trail or one of the other sites that are being considered for listing, there would be no opportunity to put in place the emergency listing quickly enough. It seems to us that it is a necessary and sensible thing to advise foreign countries of our actions, but we are talking about Australian citizens or Australian corporations. If we cannot through this legislation determine, or at least stop, any behaviour or action being taken by Australian citizens overseas then I think it is a poor showing. I think the emergency listing process is a good one. It prevents sites being damaged by actions that would otherwise take place if such a provision did not exist. It is too late once the damage has been done. We think it should be sufficient to notify the foreign country of our intention to act and explain why. I cannot imagine a country saying, `No, we need to go through 15,000 processes before you can tell your own citizens that they are not to damage a heritage site.'</para></talk.start><para>It also seems to us that a number of these amendments, such as amendment (6), are putting into legislation matters which are simply departmental correspondence. It should not be necessary to put into law the necessity to notify foreign departments. That ought to be something that happens in any case. I do not know whether the minister wants to give us a more thorough explanation of the need for this or some examples where it might be necessary, but it is very difficult to see any good reason for this. It did not come up in the inquiry process and I wonder, as I said, why it is necessary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13957</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was not party to the negotiation, but it seems to me that being able to list extraterritorially is quite a radical step in itself. It is a good step. Under this legislation, we will be able to list assets that have very important heritage values to Australia albeit they are located overseas. There has already been public discussion in relation to the Gallipoli Peninsula. It would be not only radical but highly provocative if we were to give ourselves the power to make emergency listings. In our relationships with other states, I think they would regard that as highly provocative and, in a piece of legislation where we are trying to build public confidence in the protection of Australian heritage, taking unnecessarily provocative steps may well prove to be counterproductive.</para></talk.start><para>The philosophy behind this legislation is a little different to that of the past. Under the existing legislation we have ended up with 20,000 listings or nominations because parties went out and sought nominations against threats or perceived threats and we ended up with a totally unworkable system. We prefer to approach this in perhaps a little more conservative way but a way that can give confidence that we will build assets that we are capable of protecting. We will put in proper processes for their conservation and protection. I guess that means the philosophical basis is a little different to what Senator Allison is looking for, but that is the philosophical basis on which we drafted the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>13957</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBut the minister would acknowledge that this legislation applies only to Australian citizens and Australian corporations. Let us take the example of Gallipoli that he provided. If there were the need for an emergency listing, it is hard to see that Australia would just sit back and not act quickly in the event that whatever values we determined worthy of heritage listing at Gallipoli were damaged by an Australian citizen who might be taking such action as to do that.

These reports are a timely reminder, in the context of the government's proposal to fully privatise Telstra, as they raise critical issues about Telstra's readiness for full privatisation. The reports conclude that competition has not developed as extensively as expected because of issues to do with the industry's structure, Telstra's network ownership and the integrated nature of its operations. The reports state:</para><quote><para>Competition has clearly not developed as extensively as was expected following the opening of the telecommunications markets in 1997.</para></quote><para>While there are signs that competition is increasing in long-distance and mobile services, the ACCC believes that it is still not being effectively competitive. In particular, the ACCC argues:</para><quote><para>... that the markets for local call and fixed-to-mobile services are a long way from being effectively competitive.</para></quote><para>Surely this has to be of some concern to the government and to consumers generally? The ACCC found that in 2001-02 telecommunications prices decreased more slowly than in any year since 1996. Small business for the first time experienced an increase in price, while large business customers got twice the price reductions of those ordered to residential customers. The ACCC's report to the minister in June this year, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Emerging market structures in the communications sector</inline>, stated:</para><quote><para>... the ongoing lack of effective competition in many telecommunications markets means consumers continue to pay higher prices and receive lower quality services across the entire communications sector than they otherwise would.</para></quote><para>Today's ACCC reports raise serious concerns about the way in which Telstra measures price movements, raising serious questions about whether Telstra is complying fully with the price cap determinations. Under the price control arrangements affecting Telstra, the ACCC has to ascertain whether Telstra has complied with those price control arrangements. It should be noted that this compliance is a condition of Telstra's carrier licence. On page 165, it states:</para><para>... without independent confirmation the auditor is unable to satisfy itself about the accuracy of the price movements and Telstra's compliance with the price movement cap for the first and second basket of services ...</para><para>On page 157 it further states:</para><quote><para>Telstra has breached its price control obligations ...</para></quote><para>and that:</para><quote><para>This breach is central to the possibility of a more substantive breach of the 2002 determination in the 2002-03 price cap year, should there be no carry over from 2001-02.</para></quote><para>Part of the problem is that Telstra is not complying with the ACCC methodology. According to the ACCC there is a disparity of views between the ACCC and Telstra in relation to the measurement of price movements. Clearly, Telstra needs to be pulled into line. The ACCC report shows that the government has a lot of regulatory issues to sort out before it can convince Telstra's customersâthe Australian publicâthat the pricing and regulatory system is fixed, full privatisation can proceed and an out-of-control corporate gorilla can be created.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>13959</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Brandis)</inline>âOrder!

I want to make the point that our coalition government is in the business of working in partnership with communities and shows a particular interest in the development of an activity and business that will encourage growth in regional areasâand that is the ethanol industry. One of the ways in which the government has sought to do this is by backing a home-grown industry which, if expanded, has the potential to create employment growth, increased productivity in rural areas and a renewable biofuel which will be of great value to all Australians.</para></talk.start><para>I am greatly surprised that the ethanol industry has not gained bipartisan support. You might expect opportunism from the Greens, but you would hope that it would not come from the alternative government. Labor has shown a complete lack of understanding of regional affairs and a complete lack of regard for the ethanol industry. Instead, it has concentrated its efforts on scoring cheap political points by trying, firstly, to embarrass the Prime Ministerâwho is in favour of an expanded Australian ethanol industry and increasing development in rural and regional areasâand, secondly, to attack the main player at present, which is the Manildra Group. The Manildra Group is based at Manildra in the central west of New South Wales and is a very large employer. At this time it purchases around one million tonnes of grain each year, so it is a very important player in the grain market.</para><para>There are a number of benefits in producing and using ethanol petrol in Australia. Firstly, from a production point of view, ethanol is a renewable energy source that is produced from sources such as sugarcane, wheat and barleyâcrops that Australia produces very well. These crops are the lifeblood of Australian agriculture, and an expanded ethanol industry would provide an additional alternative market for grain and crop producers. I might say a little bit more about this in a minute, but the US experience shows the advantages of having one extra choice for producers of those grains. Market opportunities are improved substantially if ethanol production is in place.</para><para>There are plans for two major ethanol plants in my home region, which is northern New South Wales, at Gunnedah and Quirindi. These two projects combined would provide a massive injection of good into our local regional economy. At Gunnedah the proposed $55 million plant, if it goes ahead, would provide 150 jobs during construction and around 34 permanent positions. It is estimated that the production of 120 megalitres of ethanol at Gunnedah would lead to spending in the north-west of about $1 billion during the initial five years of operation. At Quirindi, Symgrain, a branch of the Research Foundation Institute, has a proposal to develop an ethanol plant based on new processing designs utilising higher contents of starched wheats. Initially, the plant would see production of 60 megalitres of ethanol per annum, with an eventual increase to 100 megalitres. One hundred and forty jobs would be created during the construction phase, with an additional 300 jobs envisaged once the plant is operational. It has been estimated that the plant will provide a $30 million regional injection, mostly in new farm incomes. Even if both these plants were established in the same region, neither would intrude on each other, as both would use different processing and import methods and, possibly, different grains.</para><para>The second reason an expansion of the ethanol industry in Australia should be encouraged is that such biofuels offer greenhouse, air quality and regional benefits while reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels. The use of these renewable fuel alternatives will reduce our dependence on both domestic and overseas oil resources. The advantages are very obvious. The use of ethanol blends can reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other ozone pollution problems. Ethanol is low in reactivity and high in oxygen content. It is for this reason that the ethanol industry in certain states of America was first encouraged by state governments, and they of course have mandated a 10 per cent ethanol petrol blend.</para><para>This has certainly had an impact in Minnesota. It is quite extraordinary. Minnesota is a small state that is very much dependent on agriculture. In the 12 years or so since assistance was provided to the ethanol industry in that state, ethanol production has gone from 11 million gallons to 300 million gallons, according to the figures for 1990-2002. Ethanol consumption in fuel has gone from 30 million gallons to 240 million gallons. Ethanol production provides nearly 3,000 jobs in the state of Minnesota and has an economic input to local communities of around $A900 million, which certainly would not include the amount of money involved in the purchase of the grains used in ethanol production.</para><para>The coalition government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to support the production and the use of biofuels in Australia. The National Party are strong supporters of the ethanol industry and its further development, and our leader, John Anderson, has shown that he will certainly go in to bat as hard as he can for the industry. In May 2002, the coalition government announced a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to the increased use of ethanol in fuel. In the same month, BP commenced a trial selling E10 fuel from six Brisbane service stations. In April 2003, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, announced that the coalition government would move to set a 10 per cent maximum limit on ethanol content in petrol and that the labelling of ethanol blends at the pump was mandatory. This was an attempt to build confidence in the community, which had become necessary because of the misguided and inaccurate comments of some of the oil producers and other misguided groups in the community with a particular agenda that they wished to push. It is very disappointing that it was necessary to do that.</para><para>On 25 July 2003, the coalition government announced its decision to allocate $37 million to fund one-off capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity. The subsidy will provide 16c per litre to new or expanded projects producing a minimum of five million litres of biofuel, with a maximum grant of $10 million per project. This is in addition to the existing production subsidy for biofuels, equivalent to 38c per litre which will be available to the industry until 30 June 2008. The ethanol industry will then be brought back into the tax net, which is a good thing. They should be provided with assistance to get their industry up and running, but eventually they must come back into the tax net and that is what is going to happen. Also in July 2003, the coalition government announced its decision to provide short-term assistance to all existing fuel ethanol producers to assist in the transition to the recently announced E10 standard to allow the current production subsidy to be paid in advance of the payment of excise.</para><para>The coalition government will also work actively with the ethanol industry to restore consumer confidence in using ethanol in fuel because it is in Australia's best interests. The ethanol industry is really a win-win situation. I cannot for the life of me understand why our political opponents are being so vexatious and difficult about it because it is very good for Australia. Labor have shown a distinct lack of interest in supporting the ethanol industry and therefore in supporting growth and development in rural and regional Australia. Labor have been responsible for scaremongering amongst the public that ethanol in petrol will damage cars, which has been found to be untrue when capped to the small percentage of 10 per cent. Labor have done what they can to damage the ethanol industry in their recent attacks upon the Prime Minister's credibility, which have been purely politically motivated and certainly not in the interests of growth in the community. This is a great industry. It should be encouraged. It is in Australia's best interests for it to succeed, and I am very pleased that the industry is looking to expand in my part of New South Wales because it will provide a lot of jobs, a lot of growth and extra markets for grain producers who need that assistance.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Geelong Wool Combing Ltd</title><page.no>13961</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13961</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to bring to the Senate's attention the plight of over 100 employees who have been locked out of their workplace for the past 15 weeks. Geelong Wool Combing Ltd locked out its work force on 1 May this year and has since issued five lockout notices, which will see the lockout protract until at least 12 September this year. The workers at Lara's Geelong Wool Combing Ltd have declined a company proposal that would result in a 25 per cent wage cut, an unlimited use of casual workers and fewer permanent jobs. The company's proposal is a big ask of a rural work force already struggling to make ends meet. The company's demands would have a serious impact on the everyday lives of its work force, and one can certainly understand why the proposal has been knocked back by the GWC workers. However, rather than negotiate an outcome which both parties could accept, Geelong Wool Combing Ltd has simply locked out its work force and has refused to come back to the negotiating table.</para></talk.start><para>The company's demands to reduce wages by 25 per cent and reduce access to permanent employment have been seen by the work force and its representative bodyâthe Textile Clothing and Footwear Unionâas an insult given that the work force has shown tremendous loyalty to the company over many years. Workers at the plant had not taken one moment of industrial action prior to the commencement of the first lockout, nor had they taken industrial action over the lives of the five previous agreements, which date back to 1993. Geelong Wool Combing Ltd have indicated to their work force, through the TCFUA, that they have three non-negotiable items: one, the unbundling of the package rate which has been standard since the first EBA in 1993; two, the introduction and use of an unlimited casualised work force and labour hire; and, three, the flexibility to move between seven and five day a week operations giving employees limited notice of such decisions. This proposal is in contrast to the current operation which runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week on a 16-week roster cycle.</para><para>The non-negotiable items demanded by the company, if accepted as part of the new EBA, would see dramatic changes and discrepancies in the weekly working hours and incomes of the employees, a reduction in the work force's job satisfaction and security and the requirement for workers to be at the call of the company 24 hours a day. Further, the 25 per cent pay reduction would effect inevitable economic hardships on the work force, many of whom are the sole income providers for the young families in the area. Despite the onerous and, I would argue, outrageous demands of the company, the TCFUA and their GWC membership have maintained their willingness to negotiate with the company and, as I stated earlier, have not taken one minute of industrial action over the GWC proposals. The work force has demonstrated its preparedness to negotiate with its employer, so it is high time the company abandoned its lockout approach and returned to the negotiating table. The GWC lockout has gone on long enough and the company must now negotiate in good faith in order to overcome areas of contention, allow its workers to get on with the job and recommence production.</para><para>The economic impact of the GWC lockout is severe. It is having a devastating effect on workers themselves and their families and also the local communities in and around Geelong. Seven of the locked-out employees at Geelong Wool Combing have been forced to put their houses on the market due to their incapacity to maintain mortgage repayments and for similar reasons. At the same time as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are talking up the issues of housing affordability for young families, their very own Workplace Relations Act is forcing workers to abandon their dreams of owning their own homes and is in fact forcing workers to sell their dreams and homes simply to survive a lockout which the act does not compel the company to negotiate an end to. Another member of the locked-out work force has had to cancel his wedding as he and his fiancee are forced to use the money previously saved for the wedding to meet day-to-day costs.</para><para>The situation transpiring in Lara is symptomatic of a disturbing trend whereby employers use lockouts as a strategy to erode the hard earned wages and conditions of their employees during enterprise bargaining negotiations. These lockouts often have the greatest impact on workers from low-income backgrounds. The use of work force lockouts by employers as a bargaining tool has been on the increase since the implementation of the 1996 Workplace Relations Act, which removed the emphasis on parties to bargain in good faith and removed the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to settle disputes between parties negotiating an enterprise agreement.</para><para>It is time the Howard government recognised that it acted erroneously when it abolished the powers of the AIRC to intervene in situations where compromise could not be reached and it is time the government acted to remedy the situation. The removal of the AIRC's powers to act as an independent umpire and the other regressive reforms introduced by the 1996 Workplace Relations Act skewed employment law in this country in favour of employers at the cost of an equal and balanced system and aimed to diminish the role of trade unions as representatives of the work force.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has recognised that this neoconservative ideological crusade by the likes of former Minister Reith and current Minister Abbott has resulted in systemic unfairness in Australia's workplace laws. A future Labor government will repeal the unfair lockout laws and will enact legislation that requires parties to an enterprise agreement to bargain in good faith. Furthermore, a future Labor government will reinstate the full powers of the AIRC to act as an independent umpire in situations where a compromise cannot be reached.</para><para>Under Labor's proposal, disputes such as that in Lara would have a greater chance of settlement due to the parties being bound to bargain in good faith. Under Labor's proposal, which is currently on the table as the Workplace Relations (Good Faith Bargaining) Bill 2003, parties to an enterprise agreement must adhere to basic ground rules such as agreeing to meet face to face, following agreed negotiating procedures, disclosing relevant information, considering and responding to proposals, and adhering to commitments given in negotiations. Under Labor's proposal, if parties to an enterprise agreement fail to reach compromise when in dispute, such as in the case involving GWC and its work force, parties would be required to attend an AIRC mediation while workers continue production and the plant continues to operate and to benefit the economy.</para><para>The failure to support Labor's proposal means that this government continues to act in violation of the International Labour Organisation's convention on collective bargaining. The government is also reluctant to agree with the United States to include basic labour rights as part of the planned free trade agreement. The US chief negotiator in the FTA talks has said that the US wanted labour provisions `very similar' to those in its free trade agreement with Singapore, which require that both countries' laws protect internationally recognised labour rights including the right of association, the right to organise and bargain collectively, and acceptable minimum wages, working hours and occupational health and safety standards. Further, it requires countries to effectively enforce those labour laws. The government is most reluctant to agree to these provisions and insists on including clauses that would allow it to continue to act in defiance of international law, as it does on so many other issues, and maintain labour law that is in contradiction to internationally recognised labour rights such as protection of the rights of workers to bargain collectively.</para><para>The dispute in Lara is a demonstration of how workers in this country have suffered at the hands of this government's neoconservative ideology when it comes to labour law. The Geelong Wool Combing dispute is having an adverse effect on the work force at that plant and is having an adverse effect on the economy both locally and nationally. Workers have been forced to sell homes and postpone weddings as the plant stands stationary without any production or output in an atmosphere of hostility between management and the work force.</para><para>The ill-conceived Workplace Relations Act has facilitated this totally unacceptable situation. Minister Abbott has created conflict where there was none. Minister Abbott has created pain and hardship to workers in this country where there needed not be any. I call on the government to implement Labor's good faith bargaining policy and, in the meantime, I call on the management of Geelong Wool Combing Ltd to come back to the table and negotiate with its work force in good faith.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Mackay Development</title><page.no>13964</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>13964</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak tonight about a major decision facing the Mackay City Council and the Queensland government on the development of East Point on the north shore of the Pioneer River at Mackay. This is the largest area of beachfront open land near Mackay's CBD, a 70-hectare site encompassing several ecosystems. The land is Crown land owned by the Queensland government. This is a government which has been facing increasing criticism of its native vegetation clearing policy and its failure to implement appropriate coastal developments along the Queensland coast.</para></talk.start><para>East Point will be a test for the Queensland government, as it will be for the Mackay City Council, because this site is now subject of an application to turn it into a residential development. Under this plan only 10 hectares will be kept as open space. Significantly, 15 hectares of a 20-hectare area of concern classified casuarina forest will be cleared. Given there are only 800 hectares of remnant casuarina forest left standing between Proserpine and Sarena, that is quite a large chunk. That remnant vegetation of course is just five kilometres from the centre of Mackay, making it even more significant.</para><para>The site also includes sand dunes and an important wildlife corridor toward the mangrove forest along Bassett Creek. This creek itself is a DPI-protected fish habitat. The Bird Watchers Club of Queensland has counted 147 species of birds using the site, 25 of these being migratory birds protected under the federal EPBC Act. These include the eastern curlew, the little curlew, sandpipers, greenshanks, egrets and terns. The rainbow bee-eater and the cicada bird have both been observed in the casuarina forest marked down for clearing. Rainbow bee-eaters even nest in the forest. The site is also a nesting site for the flat-back turtle, classified as a vulnerable species under the EPBC Act and the Queensland Nature Conservation Act. And all this just five kilometres from the centre of Mackay.</para><para>Yet this site is earmarked for development as a housing estate. Applications for rezonings are now before the Mackay City Council, with ultimate approval for the sale and development of the site resting with the Queensland government. East Point is shaping up as a major test of environmental credentials for both the state and local government. Its unique area is also a unique opportunity for Mackay as East Point, properly developed, could become in itself a tourist attraction for Mackay.</para><para>The possibilities were outlined in an alternative plan developed by the Mackay Conservation Group and submitted to the city council. The group points out that East Point is twice the area of Mackay's new botanic gardens, encompassing casuarina forest, beach scrub, native grasslands and mangroves. Their proposal would include walks and bikeways linking these various habitats and local historical sites. The extensive birdlife that uses the area could be highlighted with the use of bird signs and watching points. A beachfront park making use of such a variety of ecosystems could help make Mackay a tourist destination in its own right, rather than merely a transit point. Such use of the site would enhance its ecological and tourist values, rather than detract from them.</para><para>The Mackay Conservation Group has listed seven major objections to the proposed development of East Point. These include the loss of community property, the loss of `of concern' vegetation, adverse effects upon ecological sustainability and biodiversity, the potential for contaminated run-off to reach the Bassett Basin fish habitat, natural hazard threats, conflict with the planning scheme regarding tourism designation and no evidence of the financial viability of the plan. These are matters that the state Minister for Natural Resources, Stephen Robertson, and the city council need to consider very carefully before allowing this crown land to be transferred to a private developer for housing. The council needs to consider these matters before considering a rezoning application for the site as well. This is an important opportunity for Mackay that should not be missed.</para><para>To date, the state government's response has been disappointing. The government may yet decide under the Land Act, for example, to sacrifice the `of concern' vegetation by arguing that a net gain for the conservation has been achieved. This would be hard to argue as there is no place where casuarina forest could be re-established at East Point, while fauna traffic between the forest and the Bassett Creek mangrove forest would be severely impacted by a large housing estate. At present there is a moratorium on clearing of `of concern' vegetation in Queensland, but the developer would be free to apply for a tree-clearing permit from the department once the moratorium is lifted. But that moratorium would not apply if the land were transferred to private freehold title.</para><para>Recently the department's attitude appears to have changed, with the casuarina forest being shifted from a higher `of concern' conservation classification, linked to the habitat of the vulnerable flat-back turtle, to a lower classification, with suggestions that vegetation in the buffer zone could be counted in calculating a `no net loss' on the site. This is the sort of environmental backflipping that Queensland is used to from the Beattie government, but it is just not good enough. It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the Department of State Development did not undertake an environmental assessment of the land at East Point before putting it out to public tender in 1996. Now, on 16 May, a development application for the site has been notified under the Integrated Planning Act, potentially taking it outside normal approval processes.</para><para>The Queensland State Coastal Management Plan states that significant wildlife habitats must be protected, particularly remnant ecosystems, viable populations of protected species, the roosting and feeding habitats of migratory and resident shore birds, and fish habitats. These are fine words from the Beattie government on paper. The East Point development application will test whether the Beattie government will hold to them in practice. With 25 bird species and their habitat, found on the land, listed as protected under the Commonwealth EPBC Act, at least two of which live in the casuarina forest; with at least 67 fish species in the adjoining estuary; with evidence of echidnas, quolls and numerous reptile species living on the site; with the vulnerable flat-back turtle nesting on the beach adjoining the site at East Point; this is an important ecosystem.</para><para>Under the provisions of the EPBC Act, when a development is proposed where there are federally listed endangered, vulnerable or listed migratory species and the development will have a significant impact on them, an environmental impact statement is required. Yet no environmental impact study or environmental impact assessment of any depth has been done of this site to date, despite the significant impact that development would have on protected flora and fauna species. East Point is ecologically linked to the coastal wildlife wetland corridor stretching from East Point through the Mackay Port wetlands to Blacks Beach. Up to 20 per cent of this area could be lost to developments at East Point and Blacks Beach spit, and the filling of the Bedford's paddock wetlands. This is unacceptable to conservationists because many migratory species protected under international agreements utilise this corridorâfor example, the world population of eastern curlews is in the lower eight hundreds, but up to 300 reported sightings of this species have been recorded in one month in this corridor. The EPBC Act requires that regional as well as local impacts of human disturbance be considered when development is considered. This is yet to occur.</para><para>The Mackay Port Authority has proposed to fill the Bedford's paddock wetlands with dredge spoil from the deepening of the Mackay Harbour. Over 1,830 people signed a petition opposing the transfer of dredge spoil. In its official response, the Queensland environment minister acknowledged that the Environmental Protection Agency recognises that much of this land has conservation values and that the dredge spoil is currently disposed of safely at sea.</para><para>There is a demand for beachside housing in every Queensland coastal town of appreciable size. Clearing `of concern' vegetation to house tourists or residents makes no sense, as you are destroying the biodiversity that they originally came to see. In Queensland we have already lost too much of our coastline to inappropriate development. Over 3,000 people have signed petitions submitted to the Queensland parliament expressing concern about this development. Over 480 have signed objections to the councilâa new record for the Mackay City Council. That level of local concern needs to be heeded by local, state and federal governments.</para><para>East Point is a unique natural asset of Mackay. It should be retained as an ecotourist landmark for both human and non-human visitors to the Mackay area.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pacific: Peace Initiative</title><page.no>13966</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13966</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn our age some conflicts or wars in a military sense appear to be easily won using the benefits of modern technology, highly skilled personnel and lots of money. However, winning the peace is often a more difficult exercise, particularly if we examine hostilities in such places as Bougainville, East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. While there are significant peace movements around the world, the initiative that I am promoting is related, yet different. Nowadays, peace issues may dominate the media or the international agenda. I put on the record that I support the thrust of the dedicated service, much of it voluntary, to the relief of human suffering. While other peace movements are often against all forms of war, which I acknowledge is a noble objective, the void that I believe needs filling is restoring the peace, infrastructure and community rebuilding after conflict.</para></talk.start><para>I believe we need some form of international reconciliation arm of an appropriate body such as the United Nations or a similar organisation that has a role not unlike the Moral Rearmament which followed so successfully after the cessation of hostilities in World War II or even Nelson Mandela's peace reconciliation in South Africaâaccompanied by a lot of money.</para><para>Recently, Reverend John Woodley, a former Senate colleague, visited Parliament House to inform senators and members of an ecumenical endeavour being undertaken by the Pacific peace-building initiative in the Pacific and South-East Asia. This peace initiative is seeking to bring training in peace-building mediation and reconciliation to church and government leaders as an alternative to the violence and killings that have occurred in many of these nations in recent times. I am sure that senators will agree this is a worthy objective. I have been told as recently as today by Reverend Woodley that the first lot of classes have been filled, which is heartening.</para><para>Indeed, conflict, violence, inequality and instability continue to abound around the world and in our own region. In a world of violence and anger, there is a need for leaders to be empowered and encouraged to generate processes which transform the conflict in their communities and nations. As part of such an alternative response, the Pacific peace-building initiative, in cooperation with the Uniting Church Alan Walker College in Sydney as well as affiliated national churches, is offering a special course for leaders who want to be part of a creative, grace-inspired approach to dealing with conflict. Initially, the main activity will be the provision of specialised intensive training in peace building, conflict transformation and the restoration of justice.</para><para>There have been a number of requests from church leaders in the Pacific, Asia and Australia who have indicated the need for research and understanding of the social, economic, political and cultural processes operating in the very diverse societies in our region. Through these courses it is hoped to empower a critical mass of people with the skills and commitment to build a just peace.</para><para>The Alan Walker College has already made a contribution to just peace through courses in reconciliation theory and practice in French Polynesia, Bougainville and the Papua New Guinea Highlands. Some of the facilities and partners of the Alan Walker College will be engaged at the beginning until the Pacific peace-building initiative is fully established as an independent body. It is intended that nine courses will be offered between 6 October and 21 November 2003. These courses will vary from between 30 and 40 hours. Some sessions will be in a plenary format and some will be offered as parallel options.</para><para>Those who complete six of the courses will be awarded a certificate in peace building. However, single sessions are also available. The critical issue is that a large number of people will acquire skills in this important alternative to the usual method of settling disputes. It is possible that the full course may be used for academic credit in other institutions. The important thing is that the peace-building course will be culturally sensitive and will have practical components. An interactive approach is used in the classroom in order to draw upon the rich experience of the participants as well as the instructors. Networking between people from different nations, churches and cultures will, therefore, be encouraged.</para><para>I believe that it is important to give senators some idea of the flavour of the programs on offer. It is not an exclusive list. They include: the fundamentals of peace building; recognition theology and practice; confronting racism; celebrating diversity; reconciliation processes in cultures of the Pacific; women in peace building; regional stories and initiatives in peace building; healing people traumatised by war; community based restorative justiceâfor example, in Rwanda; and religion as a resource for peace.</para><para>As senators can see, the courses are comprehensive and cover critical topics. The victims of war need to be lifted out of their poverty. Communities need to be rebuilt, including vital infrastructure such as hospitals and schools as well as winning the hearts and minds of the people, as suggested by the Reverend John Woodley. This program, I believe, needs government support to accomplish fully the noble goals of the Uniting Church promoters and to make a real contribution to lasting peace in our region. I commend the Pacific peace-building initiative to the Senate. I trust that, through the minister responsible, the government will look favourably upon these suggestions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Airline Services</title><page.no>13968</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>13968</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to commend Senator Watson on those remarksâI think it is a very worthwhile initiative.

The Kimberley region is a growing export earner for the nation. It is an exporter of iron ore, it exports diamonds and it exports food from the plantation production in the Ord River scheme alongside Lake Argyle in the north-west. Tourism is the growth industry of the region. The Bungle Bungles are an outstanding international tourist attraction. The Ord River scheme itself is also an outstanding tourist magnet. The scenic and cultural attractions of Broome are etched, I think, in the national imagination and are known worldwide, and the Broome tourist market is growing rapidly. All of that brings growth and development to a remote area of Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government, which talks a lot about border protection, perhaps should recognise that in this region of Australia the best border protection that can be offered is to settle those areas with stable industry and with a strong economic base and to encourage people to live and locate there. But, to achieve that, it means that the provision of services has to be significantly improved. The foremost service for that remote part of Australia is airline services. If airline services are not frequent and are not efficient, tourism cannot flourish. Other ventures that require spare parts to be flown in at short notice are stalled in their development, and the equipment and other supplies that you need do not reach their users in time to meet the strategic needs of the business. </para><para>When Ansett collapsed, the government said some very brave words about helping country people who were disadvantaged by the reduction in airline services. In Western Australia, the biggest state in the Commonwealth, we listened closely to those words. Western Australia has the longest lines of communication. It has some of the most isolated townsâBroome, Derby, Kununurra and Wyndham are four examples of Kimberley towns along or near the coast that rely absolutely on airline services to survive. Broome is 1,600 kilometres by air from Perth, about 3,000 kilometres from Melbourne and more than that from Sydney. Broome is about 2,400 kilometres by road from Perth. Road trains and road freight take a long time to reach their destination. Where urgency is required or where convenience is needed, such as in the tourist industry, airlines are effectively what people rely on. What we now find is that, despite the fact that Qantas have lifted the load rating of their aircraft to that region, the full loads that Qantas enjoy because of the booming tourist market mean that airfreight gets bumped off the flight and may not be delivered on the day it is needed. It may not even be delivered in the same week. I am talking here about necessary equipmentâauto parts and things of that nature.</para><para>Let me give you one example of the inconvenience this creates by talking about the need for daily newspapers. The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper, which is the main newspaper in the state of WA, is flown to Broome on a daily basis. The tourist industryânot to mention the local residents of that regionâ requires a regular newspaper feed into that market. If you are a Fremantle Dockers fan and you miss the coverage of the last match in the AFL round, you are required to read the <inline font-style="italic">West's </inline>summary on Monday morning to find out what happened and to appreciate the significance of their victory. Often you cannot get the paper the same day or, on many occasions, at all. Broome now is in a situation where daily papers are not guaranteed. The major newsagent in the town estimates that newspaper sales have at least halved since the collapse of Ansett. Newspapers do not arrive at the same time every day. It can be any time between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. if, as I have said, they arrive at all. This means that newsagents cannot tell people when the newspapers will arrive. That creates considerable bemusement among tourists but a great deal of frustration among residents.</para><para>We wrote to Qantas, bringing up these issues, on 15 July. I have to say that Qantas were prompt with a response, replying to us on 28 July. As a result, Qantas say that they have reviewed the procedures that they have undertaken and will now give greater priority to freightâand particularly newspapersâon their flights, effective from 21 July. However, since that date, there have still been several days when the papers have not arrived until quite late in the afternoon. It has been reported to me that, in some cases, they have not arrived on the same day. The newspaper is just one visible example of the type of frustration that occurs. </para><para>If you are waiting for a spare part to be flown in to fix your four-wheel drive so you can go out to a remote location and it does not arrive that day, your whole schedule is put out. The people that depend on you to turn up on time in the inland destination to which you may have been heading are also frustrated. That creates major problems for small local business. We hear a lot about small local business being the lifeblood of regional communitiesâand justifiably, because they are. But these frustrations make the life of small business people in that part of Australia even tougher than it might be anywhere else. The whole thing comes down to the availability of airfreight on a regular and a dependable basis. The office has spoken to a number of mechanical and engineering companies that rely on airfreight to supply parts. Customers are often left waiting for days for parts to arrive, even when the business has paid for expensive priority freight. This can leave people, as I have said, without vehicles, without equipment and, sometimes, without a livelihood.</para><para>What is the answer to all of these problems? It is a tough call to readily identify a particular answer, but what it does require is a government more sensitive to the needs of a community such as this. Perhaps the government ought to look at its regional development policies and start to call together the providers of airline services to see whether Qantas can do more to provide a better and more dependable service and to look at the options that Virgin Blue, as a competitor in that market, may be able to take up. Virgin Blue services the Broome tourist market out of Adelaide and other ports, but if it were able to take a higher percentage of freight in its flights to that region, that would be a useful consideration.</para><para>The intrastate airline in Western Australia is Skywest, which was part of the Ansett empire. When Ansett collapsed, Skywest continued functioning as an efficient airline service, but it is facing tougher times now than it did before. I am not one to argue for subsidies but, with the need to find a regular and dependable service for this part of Australia, which is so important strategically to us and from a wealth and export generating point of view, that may be needed in order to anchor the growth of the tourist industry and ensure it is stabilised and continues to grow. It is an investment that would repay itself in spades, if it were made. Perhaps the answer is to look at air freight providers like Toll Holdings and companies such as that.</para><para>This problem is calling out for some coordination that understands and recognises the real frustrations of living in the north-west and the importance of that part of Australia to the rest of the nation in strategic and economic terms and can deal with those problems that are genuine and serious. We do not want platitudes; we want action. We want to see a positive and constructive approach taken to resolving the problems. This is not an argument about acrimony; this is about trying to find solutions. But it seems to me that at the present time the government is missing in action. It would be very nice if it came back and did focus on these areas and started to look at the real issues that are facing ordinary people in those remote areas of Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Urban Planning</title><page.no>13970</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13970</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the Senate tonight to bring to the attention of my fellow senators further evidence of the appalling lack of an urban planning policy in my home state of New South Wales. For years Premier Bob Carr has claimed that Sydney is full; he keeps saying this month after month. He claims that people from overseas should stop moving to Sydneyâhe did so again last week. In taking such an approach, Mr Carr is continuing to play King Canute. Just like the Viking warrior who became English king, who could not stop the ocean tide, the Premier will also fail in his efforts to stop the urbanisation tide in Sydney.</para></talk.start><para>The combination of a climatically harsh interior and a coastline that boasts an enviable climate and attractive environment encourages in Australia one of the world's most highly urbanised settlement patterns, particularly in the Sydney region. Cities have always held a magnetic attraction for populations. In the movie <inline font-style="italic">City Hall</inline> Al Pacino plays the mayor of Chicago who, following the accidental shooting of a small boy in crossfire between police and a drug gang, stands at the head of the boy's coffin and, in defence of his administration of Chicago, makes this eloquent tribute to cities:</para><quote><para>The first and perhaps only great mayor was Greek. He was Pericles of Athens, and he lived some 2500 years ago, and he said, âAll things good on this Earth flow into the City, because of the City's greatness.â</para></quote><para>Viable for thousands of years, the great city of Athens is testimony to the self-sustaining power of mighty cities. Historically, regional centres adjacent to great cities have also benefited from their attraction. For example, in New South Wales prior to the election of the Carr Labor government, the Illawarra, the Central Coast and the Hunter acted as safety valves to relieve infrastructure pressure on a steadily growing Sydney. According to a recent study, that is no longer the case. Researchers at the Centre for Population and Urban Research confirm in the latest edition of <inline font-style="italic">People and Place</inline> journal<inline font-style="italic"></inline>that population flows into and out of the city that were previously balanced have now changed dramatically, with net overseas migration into Sydney now more than three times greater than the number of people moving out of the city.</para><para>This is not evidence of a population crisis for Sydney but rather evidence of the ineffectiveness of Bob Carr's urban policy over the last eight years. The Premier's recent panic call for a reduction in immigration numbers would deprive New South Wales of much needed skilled immigration and retard the economic growth of the state. His glib `more migrants to the regions' solution has already been tried but with limited successâ and in a free society, restricting the movement of people is unsustainable. Sydney's population is now over four million and will continue to grow, despite what Bob Carr says or does. Is this such a bad thing? Three years ago I was in the cities of Sao Paulo in Brazil, which currently has a population of 22 millionâthe entire population of Australia in one cityâand Chicago in the USA, which has a population of 12 million. Compared to these metropolises, Sydney is just a baby. Do such huge cities work? My assessment was that Sao Paulo did not and that Chicago did.</para><para>Very large cities can work if they can manage four facets of city life: transport, communications, water supply and waste disposal. In the centre of India near the Taj Mahal lies the appropriately named `Abandoned City'. Built by Akbar in the 16th century, this beautiful city of carved stone was at the time bigger than contemporary London. It was abandoned six years after it was finished. Why? It depended for its water supply on a lake fed by a large river. For four successive seasons in the 16th century the Indian monsoons failed. As the water dried up the people left the city, never to return. A breakdown of one of the four facets probably led to the death of many ancient cities. The bookish Bob Carr, who prides himself on his knowledge of history, should learn the lessons of history about urban growth and decay. A good start for Sydney would be to divert the expanding population away to other nearby centres and to try to stem the drift to Sydney from the bush. In terms of policies such as this, Bob Carr is another policy void. Public infrastructure in the adjacent regional centres of the Hunter and the Illawarra, compared to Sydney, is relatively underutilised.</para><para>Mr Carr should also realise that, even if such policies work well, that will not be enough to stem Sydney's growth. The mixture of employment opportunities and lifestyle is irresistible. What the state government must do urgently is address expansion and develop policies to accommodate Sydney's inevitable population growth. Mr Carr must plan and progressively roll out the key infrastructure needed to support a slowly expanding Sydney, which is projected to grow from four million to 5.9 million by the year 2051. Washing his hands and just saying that Sydney is full shows once again that the Premier of New South Wales is not prepared to tackle the difficult issues. He should follow John Brogden's lead and take a serious look at public-private partnerships for infrastructure development. Trying to do it all on the back of taxpayers would quite rightly create another bush revolt. Bob Carr's belated call for a reduction in immigration does nothing to hide his government's urban policy void.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Diabetes</title><page.no>13972</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13972</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI stand in this adjournment debate to highlight the motion that was passed unanimously in the Senate today.

The Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Minister Vale, issued a press statement again today which allegedly sought to clarify matters relating to the concern expressed about the treatment of those defence personnel, but it was a very misleading press release in that again the minister failed to acknowledge the full range of allowances paid to Australian Federal Police serving in the Solomon Islands. The cause of concern for our troops in the Solomons has been a comparison of conditions afforded to AFP officers and those afforded to the ADF. Again the minister failed to make clear in her press release the full range of allowances paid to Australian Federal Police and sought to compare only part of the AFP's package with that of the ADF. So, in addition to the concerns about the lack of fresh food and the living conditions afforded to ADF personnel, there remains a serious inequity in their allowances when compared to those for the Australian Federal Police. </para></talk.start><para>In terms of the taxation arrangements, there is a tax ruling that ensures that AFP officers have their salary and allowances tax free. There is no similar ruling made on behalf of ADF personnel and none has been sought as far as I know by the minister. That is again of concern and that is reflected in the very unequal treatment of those personnel. I am most concerned that again the minister has sought to reject concern about the taxation treatment for ADF personnel serving in East Timor. From references to the Defence web site and the understanding of the troops concerned there is no clarity that they will continue to receive tax-free allowances. The minister now claims that they will retain their tax-free status, although Senator Hill made it clear in this chamber yesterday that they would notâthat the tax-free status would be removed. Minister Vale today claims that that tax-free status will be retained, but again that is not what was on the web site and that is not what has been conveyed to serving personnel and their families.</para><para>I think it is incumbent upon the minister to come clean and provide full information, because there is certainly no tax office ruling that I can see that allows our troops to be treated in that way. In fact, the Defence web site advises Defence Force members to seek exemptions under the tax act. I made the point to Senator Hill yesterday that the ability of Australian Defence Force soldiers living in tents on the border with West Timor, and who are on patrol, to seek tax exemptions and rulings from the tax commissioner is rather limited and their access to normal processes inside Australian society is restricted by virtue of their service. It is obviously appropriate that there be some sort of formal ruling that affects all of them as a class of income earner rather than for them to be advised that they ought to seek some separate ruling from the Taxation Office while they are serving their country in very difficult circumstances and without access to the normal conveniences of modern society.</para><para>Again I place those concerns on the record. I urge Minister Vale and Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, to provide full information on the conditions that apply in these cases to assure the families and really to provide the evidence for their claims, because on the public evidence available so far, firstly, ADF personnel in the Solomons are being given a very raw deal in comparison with the Federal Police and, secondly, the soldiers serving in Timor have had a serious downgrading of their conditions in terms of the taxation treatment.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Northern Territory Day</title><page.no>13974</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13974</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday was the second anniversary of the election of the Martin Labor government in the Northern Territory. The significance of that day will go down in the history books. I want to speak this evening about another significant day that we have celebrated this year in the Northern Territory, and that was Northern Territory Day on 1 July this year. My speech is somewhat delayed, but that is due to the large amount of business that the Senate dealt with in the last week of the autumn sittings. Nevertheless, I think it is important to actually put on the record the significance and the importance of this day for the history books.</para></talk.start><para>The date of 1 July was particularly significant this year in the Northern Territory as it recognised 25 years of self-government in the Territory and 25 years of the Northern Territory flag. On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory Self-Government Act came into force establishing the Northern Territory as a body politic under the Crown. Self-government was not only significant to the Northern Territory but also a major event in Australian federalism. The constitutional development of the Northern Territory has been, and continues to be, a process dominated by political rather than legal considerations. </para><para>The Northern Territory Self-Government Act 1978 of the Commonwealth parliament is regarded as the Northern Territory's constitution, so to speak. However, it is important to note that this legislation is an ordinary act of parliament and is capable of being amended or repealed by the parliament as it sees fit. There have actually been a number of amendments to the act since 1978, but none of them have radically changed the nature of self-government in the Northern Territory. The six states federating in 1901 comprised the entire continent of Australia and the island of Tasmania. The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory were detached from their states after Federation. Their existence and political representation was contemplated by section 122 of the Constitution, which empowers the Commonwealth to allow the representation of any territory in either house of parliament to the extent, and on the terms, it thinks fit. </para><para>The Northern Territory was originally part of New South Wales and was annexed to South Australia. In April 1901, due to the heavy financial costs, South Australia offered the Northern Territory to the new Commonwealth government, and on 1 January 1911 the Northern Territory was formally transferred to the Commonwealth. As a result of the transfer, residents of the Northern Territory lost all political representation; they had none in the Commonwealth parliament and neither was there any form of `state' or local government. It was not until 1922 that the Northern Territory was granted a member of the House of Representatives by the Northern Territory Representation Act. However, the parliamentary rights of the Northern Territory member were severely restricted. The member was prohibited from voting on any question, although they could be present for the deliberations. Of course, history will show us the great work of Harold Nelson, who campaigned under the slogan of `No taxation without representation'. In 1959 the voting right was extended to any issue relating solely to the Northern Territory, but full voting rights were not bestowed by the Northern Territory Representation Act until 1968. Territory residents additionally lacked any vote in constitutional referendums until this was granted by a referendum in 1977. Their votes still only count in the overall majority, not in the majority of states. </para><para>In the 2000 redistribution, the Northern Territory gained its second seat in the House of Representatives. However, this year it has been revealed that the Northern Territory is set to lose that seat largely due to a disputed population calculation. Senate representation for the Northern Territory was enacted by the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973 as part of the Whitlam government's electoral reform measures. Senators for the Northern Territory were first elected in the 1975 election. </para><para>Although there are limits placed on Northern Territory self-government, it is definitely accepted as a major improvement on the administrative arrangements that existed before 1978. Self-government has resulted in a much greater degree of local involvement in matters affecting Territorians with members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being elected rather than appointed. The Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 gave the Legislative Assembly the power to make laws for peace, order and good government of the Territory, to be administered through a Northern Territory Public Service and Treasury.</para><para>The other significant feature of Territory self-government is that the grant established a new separate body politic under the Crown, with its own ministers selected from and responsible to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, with responsibility for the public service, education, local government, health, land use and control, electricity and water resources, police and the administration of the justice system. Significantly, the major exclusions that remain within the control of the federal government are in the areas of industrial relations, uranium mining, Aboriginal land rights and the management and control of Uluru and Kakadu national parks.</para><para>Constitutional development regained momentum during 1976 and 1977. Prime Minister Fraser's 1975 campaign commitment of statehood in five years dramatically changed the Commonwealth's traditional approach. During 1976 and 1977 the essential elements of self-government were established. As well as the fashioning of self-government principles, the period was significant in implementing policies which were to have an immense impact on the Northern Territory's subsequent political and constitutional history. These involved Aboriginal land rights, the commencement of uranium mining, national parks administration and salient issues of political conflict between the Territory and the Commonwealth from the mid-1970s which exist to this day.</para><para>The Northern Territory flag also celebrates its anniversary, this year being the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Territory flag. I will just give a brief history here: the flag incorporates the three Territory colours, which are black, white and ochre, with the Territory's floral emblem, Sturt's Desert Rose. The white stars on the black panel represent, quite obviously, the constellation of the Southern Cross. The representation of Sturt's Desert Rose on the red ochre panel shows seven petals with a seven-pointed star in the centre, which symbolise the six Australian states and the government of the Northern Territory. The flag of the Northern Territory was the first official Australian flag to not contain the union flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack.</para><para>Early in 1978 the Northern Territory executive held an open competition in the Northern Territory, seeking a suitable flag design to symbolise the changed constitutional status of government in the NT. The new flag was finalised and was used in ceremonies associated with the creation of the Northern Territory government on the first day of self-government, 1 July, 1978.</para><para>The grant of self-government by the Commonwealth in 1978â25 years agoâ was a significant step on the path to statehood. In 1998 the government of the Northern Territory put forward a proposal for the Northern Territory to become Australia's seventh state by the year 2001. The people of the Northern Territory voted against the proposal at a referendum that was held in conjunction with the 1998 election.</para><para>However, recently the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, launched a renewed campaign towards statehood. This campaign is welcomed as a means by which the people of the Northern Territory can express their view on the possibility of statehood for the Northern Territory. This would be the first new state created since federation. The announcement provoked a positive reaction in the community. The Chief Minister assured Territorians:</para><quote><para>This time we will do it properly with careful community consultation and community involvement from the startâthis time we will get it right.</para></quote><para>An inquiry by a legislative committee into why the vote failed last time found that, apart from the political derailing of the process, there was a lack of understanding about statehood and a lack of information about the process of constitution making. This is precisely why a community based plan for how best to move towards statehood is currently being drafted. It is expected that the time line for the campaign will last around five years.</para><para>Northern Territory Day on 1 July 2003 marked the 25th year of self-government in the Northern Territory and the 25th year of the hosting of our unique flag. It was a unique time to again look at the issue of statehood and to recognise the contribution of the Northern Territory to the country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Cape York</title><page.no>13977</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>13977</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen I gave my first speech in this place in August 1999, I spoke of my great concern that health outcomes for Indigenous Australians on Cape York Peninsula were nowhere near equal to those in non-Indigenous communities.

There are over a dozen Aboriginal communities in the Cape York region and, while they may live in extraordinarily beautiful surroundings, they also record the worst health statistics of anywhere in Australia.</para><para>The problems are widely documented and are described by some health professionals as Fourth World, with low life expectancy and high mortality rates for children under the age of four and deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases remaining unacceptably high in Indigenous communities. Hospitalisation rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are between 60 and 90 per cent above those of the rest of the population for various illnesses. Diabetes, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, influenza and lung cancer rates are high. Injury admission rates are up to 40 per cent higher than the Queensland average and admission rates for preventable infections, including those for sexually transmitted diseases, are extraordinarily high. Diseases such as syphilis are prevalent on the peninsulaâdiseases almost unheard of in mainstream Australia. In fact, today at the health summit convened at Old Parliament House, the health status of Indigenous Australians was described as equivalent to the health status of the people of Bangladesh.</para><para>Other health issues of concern on Cape York Peninsula include rates of hospitalisation due to self-harm that are much higher than those in the rest of Queensland. Residents of Cape York are also much more likely than other Queenslanders to have portions of lower limbs amputated due to the complications of diabetes. These are the problems that the Prime Minister has now heard of first-hand at Aurukun, a community close to Weipa. This is a place where I am privileged to know many people of the Wik nations and have been invited to be part of their way of life from time to time. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister endorsed the adoption of an innovative new strategy designed to tackle many of the Indigenous communities' health problems at the root causeânamely, excessive alcohol consumption.</para><para>In 2000, a significant Well Person's Health Check study was published, which demonstrated that most of the drinkers on Cape York drank at harmful levels. Much of the drinking occurred at the end of the week. Unsurprisingly, the statistics showed that alcohol related assault injuries also escalated quite dramatically at week's end. It should be recognised though that, while the number of drinkers in any one community is significant, the majority of people do not drink at all or drink in moderation.</para><para>A major Queensland government response to these issues has been labelled <inline font-style="italic">Meeting Challenges, Making Choices</inline>. It has been, in no small part, developed in response to calls for action from Indigenous leaders, including Noel Pearson. It is also the first time, I believe, that such a major and holistic undertaking has been attempted in this country. In 2000, Noel Pearson published a groundbreaking and influential paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Our Right to Take Responsibility</inline>. Noel argues in this publication that `the right to self-determination is ultimately the right to take responsibility'. He says:</para><quote><para>When you look at the culture of Aboriginal binge drinking you can see how passive welfare has corrupted Aboriginal values of responsibility and sharing, and changed them into exploitation and manipulation.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Our Right to Take Responsibility</inline> goes on to deal with confronting racism, with problems with existing power structures within communities, with the necessary transition from the `gammon' welfare economy to Indigenous participation in the `real' economy and with how this can only be achieved by a respectful partnership between government, government agencies and the Aboriginal people of Cape York Peninsula.</para><para>Noel Pearson's work reinforces my own view that we can view the alcohol problems on Cape York no longer as symptomatic but as causal. Alcohol abuse directly contributes to a wide range of social problems on the cape, including violence, truancy, foetal alcohol syndrome, housing, nutrition and community management. This is not to say, though, that government does not have a responsibility to address the causes of alcohol abuse, lack of esteem and little aspiration and hope for the future. Unfortunately, there has been little focus on redressing the fundamental discrimination experienced by Indigenous Australians, especially those on Cape York Peninsula, during the life of this government. It is important now that we take the opportunity that has been given to us through the work of Noel Pearson and others, and through the Fitzgerald report and the work of the Queensland government, to tackle the issues of alcohol and the effect of alcohol abuse on Cape York.</para><para>To give the Senate some idea of the extent of the issues, let us consider the level of violence in Aboriginal communities on Cape York. According to Queensland police statistics, it is 42 times that of the general community. It is not twice, not three times what constitutes an acceptable level of crime against a person in Sydney, Adelaide or the suburbs of Cairns. It is at a level that suggests all residents of these communities have been subjected to systemic hostility and aggression. They are not living normal lives by any stretch of the imagination. If this were occurring in any Australian metropolitan centre, we would see national community outrage.</para><para>Alcohol consumption within the passive social welfare paradigm that has enveloped these communities over the past two and a half decades has seen the normalisation of what Pearson characterises as `pathological behaviour'. It is a situation which requires urgent attention and leadership from governments and from within the Indigenous community itself.</para><para>I would like to pay tribute to the work of Indigenous leaders in tackling the problem of substance abuse at the community level. It is with some sense of relief that I sense that governments at both the state and federal levels are beginning to see that allowing Indigenous children to continue to grow up in these circumstances is in fact unAustralian. There is much to be done and there is no room at all for buck-passing or petty politics when it comes to confronting massive social need and the need for social change.</para><para>Whenever the agenda for change is ambitious, vested interests so deeply rooted and behaviour patterns so entrenched it is unrealistic to expect that there will not be a level of tension. In moving to adopt new pathways and partnerships, we have seen tension between and within communities, organisations, governments and people, whether they be Indigenous or non-Indigenous. But when the stakes are high, all those of good faith must set aside old tensions and embrace new ways of working together. It is my belief and great hope that this is in the main achievable by those of us working in the region.</para><para>But tension is different from direct opposition. Some of the opposition has come from those who benefit from grog sales. This has seen local justice committees, who are working hard to devise and implement alcohol management plans, being accused of being undemocratic or unrepresentative. Another source of opposition in North Queensland has been some conservative members of the House of Representatives. For example, the member for Leichhardt, Mr Warren Entsch, is on the public record as saying:</para><quote><para>The Napranum Alcohol Management Program as it stands is not going to solve any alcohol related problems in the region.</para></quote><para>Further, he said:</para><quote><para>But if theyâ</para></quote><para>that is, the state governmentâ</para><quote><para>think by encouraging prohibition and then restricting the practices, the sale practices, of local businesses outside the communities, is going to fix the problem, they're in la-la land.</para></quote><para>Of course, since then the Prime Minister has praised the economic and social initiatives in the communities, including the strict alcohol limits. Mr Entsch was, as you would expect, clinging to the shoulder of the Prime Minister throughout the press conferences held on the cape in the last month. One quite naturally assumed that he had gone through a conversion of some sort.</para><para>Yet the very next dayâand this is what makes me so furiousâhe came out to publicly condemn the initiative and the state government. The day after the Prime Minister left Far North Queensland, Mr Entsch came out to publicly condemn the initiative and the state government for not yet having established detox centres in these communities. Did he at any time suggest the Commonwealth might be part of this partnership or might be able to assist financially? Did he raise the matter with the Prime Minister? Did he sit down with Indigenous leaders, who are working so hard, with a view to developing a strategic solution or identifying potential funding sources? Given the commentary in the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline>, I suspect not. He instead jumped at yet another photo opportunity in his usual one press release a day approach to community action and community liaison. This sort of undermining blame game is no longer tolerable. I call on the member for Leichhardt to desist in future and to constructively engage in the partnership process.</para><para>Mr Entsch would benefit from a visit to the Cape York Health Council, Apunipima. They have clearly defined a holistic approach to their future health service needs which is called the River of Life. It is `upstream' issues like alcohol consumption that the Indigenous leaders on that council say must be tackled first within their communities. By contrast to Mr Entsch, I commend the Queensland government, which has responded quite bravely to Noel Pearson's call for action and to the <inline font-style="italic">Cape York Justice Study</inline> conducted by Justice Tony Fitzgerald. The state government announced in April 2002 that it would transfer liquor licences from councils to community based boards and it would impose strict conditions on hotels and roadhouses near Indigenous communities. The government has said that it will strengthen and expand community justice groups. It will give them, for the first time, legislative backing and protection and will create exciting economic development and employment opportunities in Indigenous communities.</para><para>As at 7 August 2003, 11 Queensland communities had completed their alcohol management plans. They are Aurukun, Palm Island, Doomadgee, Napranum, Woorabinda, Wujal Wujal, Lockhart River, Cherbourg, Kowanyama, Pompuraaw and Mornington Island. Of these communities, three have had their alcohol restrictions regulated. They are Aurukun, effective 30 December 2002, and Doomadgee and Napranum, both effective 9 June 2003. </para><para>Alcohol management plans will directly impact on the quality of life of the estimated 17,579 people living in mainland communities. A comparison of medical treatment data for the two months prior to the restrictions coming into place in Aurukun with that of the first two months post implementation has shown the following. There was a 29 per cent reduction in the number of overall presentations for injury and a 74 per cent reduction in the number of presentations that were alcohol related. The percentage of all injuries that were alcohol related reduced from 53 per cent to 19.6 per cent, and there was a 55 per cent reduction in the number of presentations due to assault. These are amazing statistics that have changed the lives of, especially, women and children who live in Aurukun.</para><para>As well as the above statistics, there is some anecdotal evidence that suggests that there has been really positive change in Aurukun. There has been a 20 per cent increase in food sales and a notable improvement in the atmosphere of the Aurukun community. Community members have expressed the opinion that Aurukun is the cleanest and quietest it has been in recent memory. Work attendance rates have significantly increased, and there has been a notable increase in positive social interaction. The Principal of the Western Cape College, Aurukun Campus, Mr Stan Sheppard, said that attendance at the primary school was up by between 30 and 50 children every day, in comparison with recent years. He also said that the children looked more rested in general and that fewer children required a sleep when they got to school.</para><para>What is, in effect, being asked of governments is support for the children of Cape York Peninsula to unlock the doors to real educational opportunity and a sense of security in their homes and in the community. It is not a big ask. To the people of the North working towards this goal: thank you for your efforts to date and keep the faith for the future. The Queensland government's major funding commitment and the Prime Minister's support are encouraging. But, important as they are, they are first steps in what will be a long, tough road.</para><para>To me, it is the prevalence of foetal alcohol syndrome amongst the communities of the Cape that is the most compelling reason for urgent progress up this steep pathway. The rates of foetal alcohol syndrome on the Cape are the highest in Australia, and the innocent victimsâthe babies born with irreversible brain damageâdo not have a voice. Foetal alcohol syndrome is only seen when there is high level of alcohol intake, resultant high levels of conception, and public acceptance of continued binge drinking throughout pregnancy. You can imagine the burden that this places on the extended generations and the fractured social climate that must exist in order for it to occur. It is the same sort of fragmentation that one sees in the families of all alcoholics, but it is multiplied in intensity many times over on Cape York Peninsula because, within Indigenous communities, it has been allowed to pervade society as a whole.</para><para>I speak in this place tonight to recommit myself to assisting Indigenous communities to break the cycle of passive welfare and substance abuse. I want to do so in partnershipâin a manner that devolves power and shares responsibility for future development. I say to others of influence that there is no area of greater need or responsibility than our need to share in an ambitious vision for the future of the children of Cape York.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.34 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13981</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>13981</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government document was tabled:</para><quote><para>Australian Competition and Consumer CommissionâTelecommunications reports for 2001-02âReport 1: Telecommuni-cations competitive safeguards;

accountable for loss of cables that are not monitored by alarm systems. </para><para>KPI 2 Clearance of backlog of cables in alarm</para><para>The backlog of cables in alarm is defined as those cables that are in alarm condition in the alarm system on 28/6/02. All cables in alarm will be backlog and any new alarm after this date will be designated as ânewâ alarms. </para><para>NDC commit to remove 3300 cables from the backlog per year, an average of 275 cables per month until the backlog is eliminated.</para><para>Cables will be deemed out of alarm when all alarms points in that cable including flow alarms are cleared from the AMS system (ie &gt;50kpa), or all transducers within a cable length have an APCAMS reading of 40kpa or greater. These points must remain out of alarm for more than 5 days to be removed from the backlog.</para><para>To verify a backlog cable has been brought out of alarm NDC must present a history report on each cable, which is a print-out from the alarm system. This report will be presented to the regional CLOs for verification. If the cable remains out of alarm for 5 days the CLO will forward the alarm report on to the contract manager and be deemed out of alarm. NDC will report on a monthly basis.</para><para>Any penalties relating to this KPI will be measured and applied on a quarterly basis. To achieve the targets agreed to, NDC must have submitted 825 reports each quarter referring to cables they have taken out of alarm until the backlog is eliminated. For every cable short of this target NDC will be penalised $450.</para><para>KPI 3 Response to new alarms</para><para>The contractor is to acknowledge and interpret all new alarms within one hour of being in alarm and take appropriate action to take the cable(s) out of the alarm state. No new alarm shall remain active for more than 5 calendar days.</para><para>This action will drive the contractor to ensure that timely action is taken to all new faults in both cables and systems to ensure that the risk of failure is minimised and the state of the network is improved. By ensuring that system components remain active, the monitoring and visibility of the network remains high and again the risks of problems are minimised.</para><para>KPI 4 Reduction in the number of cylinders in the network</para><para>Contractor is to reduce the number of air cylinders supporting the network over the period of the contract. This, in conjunction with KPI 2, will ensure a steady improvement in the health of the pressurised network.</para><para>NDC to report on the total number of cylinders used to support the network each month</para><para>To support this KPI in an incentive/penalty arrangement, payments for the Backlog Bottle Support are reduced gradually across the term of the contract. The implementation of a more formal approval process for those sites requiring long term bottle support will ensure that sites will not remain on cylinder support for extended periods unless there are extenuating circumstances.</para><para>(2)	Telstra advises that the strategy was developed in May 2002.</para><para>(3)	According to Telstra, the revised strategy was implemented in July 2002.</para><para>(4)	According to Telstra, National Network Solutions (NNS) has no direct involvement in the development or ongoing management of the CPAS strategy. Telstra advises that NNS undertakes a role of secondary workforce, working closely with NDC in undertaking the current CPAS program of work. For example, NNS is currently involved with the âacceleratedâ program of works.</para><para>(5)	According to Telstra, the âgrease-typeâ material is a blend of petroleum based and synthetic oils and waxes. It is injected into the cable core during cable manufacture to fill the space between the insulated conductors, and between the cable core and sheath.</para><para>(6)	Telstra advises that grease filling of cables was trialed in Australia in the late 1970s and regular use commenced in the early 1980s.</para><para>(7)	According to Telstra, grease filling is used in plastic insulated, underground cables of sizes ranging from 2 pairs up to 800 pairs.</para><para>(8)	Telstra advises that a hollow plastic tube called Dekabond is used to bypass all grease filled sections in air core cables. This tubing allows air to be fed to cables sections past the grease type cable.</para><para>(9)	According to Telstra, the process of installing Dekabond tubing is the Telstra standard and is to be used in all cases. </para><para>(10)	Telstra advises that, if the process of installing Dekabond is not carried out, it is picked up by audits or the activation of alarms. Telstra advises that installation of Dekabond tubing where required is being undertaken as part of the maintenance strategy.</para><para>(11)	Telstra advises that about 12 to 13% of the total of large size cable lengths installed in the network is grease filled. This figure is a percentage of the total sheath length installed, not numbers of cables. This figure accounts for main cables but not distribution cables which run from pillars/cabinets to customers. According to Telstra, data for these smaller cables is not readily available. Telstra has advised that over 99% of all copper conductor, underground cable now being installed into Telstra's network is grease filled.</para><para>(12)	According to Telstra, approximately 61% of cables in the Mains and Junction network are pressurised. The remainder is made up of grease filled or optical fibre cables which do not require pressurisation. Main cables run from Exchanges to a distribution point (cabinet/pillar) and junction cables are the inter-exchange cables. Telstra advises that other air core cables in the distribution (cabinet/pillar to customer premises) network are not normally pressurised and therefore Telstra is unable to calculate air supported cables as a percentage of total cables.</para><para>(13)	Telstra advises that the gel sealant was not used on cables, it was used in joints. According to Telstra, there are approximately 2.1 million gel filled joints in the Access Network and it estimates that around 3% of these may be affected by the gel sealant reacting with wet cable. Telstra advises that gel filled joints which remain dry perform satisfactorily.</para><para>(14)	Telstra advises that grease filling and air pressurisation are the two methods used to minimise the ingress of water into the cables.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Gas Bottles</title><page.no>13987</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1309)</subtitle><id.no>1309</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13987</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 March 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With respect to question no. 6 taken on notice by Telstra during the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee hearing on 6 December 2002, into the Australian Telecommunications Network:</para><para>(1)	What is the cost to rent a gas bottle: (a) per week; (b) per month; and (c) per year.</para><para>(2)	What is the cost to refill a gas bottle each time it is refilled.</para><para>(3)	What is the current cost of the total contract within Network Design and Construction (NDC) for the rental and refilling of gas bottles.</para><para>(4)	When did the contract with NDC increase from $19 million to $40 million; if these figures are not accurate, please detail the cost of the NDC contract, and any changes over the past 3 years.</para><para>(5)	What was the total annual cost of rental and refilling of gas bottles, on a state by state basis, for each of the past 6 years.</para><para>(6)	Can a list of companies which supply gas bottles to Telstra, on a state-by-state basis, be provided.</para><para>(7)	How many gas bottles are being rented in each state, for each month, for each of the following years: (a) 2002; and (b) 2003 to date.</para><para>(8)	How many gas bottle refills were needed in each state, for each month, for each of the following years: (a) 2002; and (b) 2003 to date.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13988</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by Telstra, is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra advises that the product sourcing agreement between Telstra and its supplier sets the cost of renting a gas bottle.

follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra advises that the proper method for permanently fixing lead cables depends on a variety of factors such as the type, location, severity and extent of the fault or damage to be fixed. For example, a small hole in an otherwise undamaged cable sheath at a readily accessible point in a manhole would be repaired by lead wiping or application of a heat shrinkable, wraparound repair sleeve. According to Telstra, if a cable in conduit has been severed or significantly damaged at a location between two jointing pits and cannot be joined at that location then that section of cable would be replaced by jointing in a new cable between the two pits.</para><para>(2)	According to Telstra, the proper method for permanently fixing lead to plastic cables depends upon interpretation of the term `fixing'. That is, whether it is to repair or attach.</para><para>Telstra advises that in terms of repair, the proper method of permanently fixing lead to plastic cables depends on a variety of factors such as the type, location, severity and extent of the fault or damage to be fixed. For example, a small hole in an otherwise undamaged cable sheath at a readily accessible point in a manhole would be repaired by lead wiping or application of a heat shrinkable, wraparound repair sleeve. According to Telstra, a severed or significantly damaged cable would be repaired by connector jointing the conductors from either side and applying a heat shrinkable, wraparound, in line joint closure.</para><para>In terms of attaching, Telstra advises that the proper method for permanently fixing lead to plastic cables is to connector joint the conductors from one cable to the other, then apply a heat shrinkable, wraparound, in line joint closure.</para><para>(3)	Telstra advises that the proper method for permanently fixing moisture barrier cables depends on a variety of factors such as the type, location, severity and extent of the fault or damage to be fixed. For example, a small hole in an otherwise undamaged cable sheath at a readily accessible point in a manhole would be repaired by application of a heat shrinkable, wraparound repair sleeve. According to Telstra, if a cable in conduit has been severed or significantly damaged at a location between two jointing pits and cannot be joined at that location then that section of cable would be replaced by jointing in a new cable between the two pits.</para><para>(4)	According to Telstra, the proper method for permanently fixing optical fibre cables is to join the existing cable with a replacement cable using standard optical fibre cable joints. Telstra approved Universal Cable Joint Closures are used for jointing the cable and after jointing, the Closures can be located in existing pits or buried underground. Where appropriate, cable replacement takes place between existing joints so that no additional joints are introduced, thus preserving the end to end cable performance.</para><para>(5)	Telstra advises that the methods for fixing plastic cable joints have not changed as a result of gel encapsulation. According to Telstra, the proper method of permanently fixing plastic cable joints depends on a variety of factors such as the type, severity and extent of the fault or damage to be fixed. For example, if a joint fault is traced to a number of faulty connectors then those connectors are replaced within the joint and the joint re-closed. If the length of conductors or quality of insulation within the joint closure is insufficient to effect repairs within the closure then the joint is remade with a new closure.</para><para>(6)	According to Telstra, if such damaged cable cannot be immediately replaced or permanently repaired then the temporary restoration and protection applied will depend on the specifics of the damaged plant. The appropriate temporary repair and extent of work will be determined through assessment by the on site staff who may also consult with their supervisor. For example, sections of damaged conductor within a joint may be shortened and respliced with new connectors to restore customer service. Telstra advises that if the cable damage is adjacent to the gel encapsulated joint then that section of cable may be replaced by cutting back and rejointing using standard connectors and joint closure.</para><para>(7)	Telstra has advised that staff were not instructed on a single or specific date not to use plastic bags. Rather, staff Information Briefs and Service Excellence bulletins were used to outline in positive terms appropriate practices rather than profiling inappropriate practices.

In meeting this standard, the Communication Technician (CT) is expected to review the various options available to restore the customer's service in a cost effective and timely manner. One option available to the CT is to install a temporary alternative cable, provided it can be undertaken safely in that particular situation.  The cable may be installed âon top of the groundâ or along an existing structure or within the Telstra ducting, pipe or tunnel network, so as to bypass the cable section where the fault is located. According to Telstra, each situation is independently assessed to ensure the safest, most reliable and viable alternative is used for that particular circumstance. </para><para>(2)	Telstra advises that it is not possible to readily identify temporary alternative cables âon top of the groundâ or âalong fencesâ as a separate sub-group within the Telstra database, as all types of alternative temporary cable are recorded using the same indicator field.  There is no specific âflagâ to distinguish them from instances where a temporary alternative cable has been provided within the Telstra network of conduits, tunnels and ducting.</para><para>(3)	According to Telstra, the definition of âtemporaryâ in this case is âwhere a safe, technically acceptable, interim installation practice is performed to provide an immediate, stable service in response to a customer faultâ. Telstra advises that it is expected that the interim solution will remain in service until the permanent restoration is implemented through the normal course of business operations.</para><para>(4)	Telstra advises that the categorisation of each CNI notification registered within the Telstra database is determined on its merits and is highly situational.  The location and the possibility of future safety implications, as well as the risk to customer service stability are all determinates of the categorisation. CNI's with temporary alternative cable solutions applied are categorised using the same methodology and staff submitting a CNI (having first hand knowledge of both the site and situation) assist in determining the category to be applied to the CNI at that time. According to Telstra, changes in circumstance at the site, along with other information that may be received, could lead to a re-categorisation of the CNI. </para><para>(5)	According to Telstra, its Area Management strategy (as distinct from TASM which was a trial arrangement) does have similarities to the old District Manager Structures that operated until the early 1990's in that both have the concept of ownership for service delivery within a geographic area as the best way of managing the business and both aim to bring together local activities under a single manager.</para><para>Telstra advises that they are different in two main areas. That is, customer ownership and size. Unlike the District Telecom Manager (DTM) structure, Area Managers will only be accountable for the delivery of service and investment in the access network (including management of suppliers / contractors etc). They do not `own the customers' as was the case with the DTM structure, but rather act as delivery agents on behalf of Consumer &amp; Marketing, Telstra Business &amp; Government and Telstra Country Wide. As such, they do not have the Sales, Billing or Service Advantage elements that were part of the previous districts.</para><para>The new areas are more much larger in size than the former Districts, in fact, more the size of former Regions (an amalgamation of two or more Districts)</para><para>(6)	According to Telstra, under Area Management, the Area Manager (being accountable for investment in the access network and for the delivery of service within the area), will have a direct influence in determining the timeframes and priorities of the CNI's within their area.</para><para>(7)	Telstra advises that under Area Management (not TASM), each area will have a single point of coordination for CNI's (the Area Maintenance Risk Assessor).  The Maintenance Risk Assessor will have responsibility of the overall coordination and management of CNI's (including allocation of priorities). This position will coordinate efforts to efficiently and effectively meet CNI demand for their respective area. The Area Manager will be accountable for and have financial responsibilities with relation to the CNI's.</para><para>(8)	According to Telstra, under Area Management (not TASM), the current centralised, national CNI database will remain.</para><para>(9)	According to Telstra, the General Managers for the Areas assumed control from May 2003, including CNIs for their Areas.</para><para>(10)	Telstra advises that Area Management (not TASM) was introduced in May 2003, with ongoing development over the next 6 to 8 months.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Security</title><page.no>13993</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1312)</subtitle><id.no>1312</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13993</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 March 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With respect to question no. 13 taken on notice by Telstra during the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee hearing, on 6 December 2002, into the Australian Telecommunications Network:</para><para>(1)	What checks does Telstra make to ensure all staff, contractors and their vehicles working on the cable network are correctly identified.</para><para>(2)	Can details be provided of the additional security measures Telstra has put in place to protect the network since terrorist attacks in September 2001.</para><para>(3)	What percentage of Telstra field staff have undergone Federal Police checks in each of the past 3 years.</para><para>(4)	Can details be provided of the Telstra background checking process which is currently in place.</para><para>(5)	Has the Telstra background checking process for staff been altered at all in the past year; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(6)	What areas in Telstra are classed as `sensitive' areas.</para><para>(7)	What was the rationale for Telstra deciding that the whole of the network was not to be considered a `sensitive' area.</para><para>(8)	Which staff and/or departments in Telstra are subject to the background checking process.</para><para>(9)	What is the penalty and/or internal process for Telstra staff and contractors not wearing a Telstra photographic identification (ID) card.</para><para>(10)	How does Telstra convey the direction to staff and contractors about the wearing of ID cards.</para><para>(11)	How many Telstra photographic ID cards have been issued to contractors and sub-contractors in the past year.</para><para>(12)	How does Telstra define `regular need to visit network sites' for the issuing of photographic Telstra ID cards to contractors [reference answer 13(5)].</para><para>(13)	Why are only `selected field staff' required to undergo these checks [reference answer 13(2)].</para><para>(14)	Does Telstra supply a Telstra uniform to any contractors and sub-contractors; if not, how are they identified as Telstra contractors.</para><para>(15)	Do contractors and sub-contractors have any identification on their work vehicles that identifies them as authorised contractors.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13993</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by Telstra, is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra has a program to issue a photographic ID Card to all employees on a regular basis. Contractors employed on a long term basis (greater than 3 months) and who have a need to visit Telstra facilities are also issued with a photographic card. Identification of short term contractors varies across the company and is dependent on the type of site, duration of access required etc. Such identification may include provision of a temporary contractor badge, completion of an Attendance Request form together with proof of identification such as a current driver's licence or a contracting company ID, or managed access in the company of a Telstra employee or lead contractor.</para><para>Additionally, staff and contractors who regularly visit any key network sites configured with electronic access control may be provided with an access card which enables fine tuning of the locations accessed and timing of entry.</para><para>Telstra does not require signage or branding to be displayed on prime contractor or sub-contractor vehicles.</para><para>(2)	Telstra does not wish to provide details of security measures employed by the company in any forum where those details may be disseminated to the public. In general terms, there has been an ongoing process of risk management review at significant sites and a specific group has been formed tasked with managing security risks associated with Telstra's important infrastructure. A detailed training program on risk management has been deployed and must be satisfactorily completed before access rights to network facilities are provided. Telstra is in regular contact with relevant authorities to identify and manage security risks in line with the most recent intelligence and expert opinion.</para><para>(3)	The database on which these clearances are recorded allows an enquiry based on name or employee number but does not provide for statistics based on job function.</para><para>Telstra estimates however that only a small percentage have undergone police checks. Only those staff involved in particular projects requiring a police check or security clearance would have been through any extensive vetting process.</para><para>According to Telstra, a review of available records indicates that it has initiated 31 Australian Federal Police record checks on staff between August 2002 and 17 April 2003. Other staff would have undergone checks sponsored by other departments or customers and conducted by the AFP and state police forces, the results of which would not necessarily have been communicated to Telstra. Staff involved in the support of CHOGM and the Sydney Olympics would be included in this.</para><para>Telstra is also conscious of the need to balance security issues with the privacy rights of all staff.</para><para>(4)	Telstra utilises the services of the Australian Security Vetting Service (ASVS), a division of the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department, to undertake vetting to standards required for national security clearances and for access to sensitive information or areas (Protected and Highly Protected). Telstra also undertakes vetting internally to the standards stipulated in the Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual.</para><para>(5)	No, there has been no material change to internal background checking processes.</para><para>(6)	Telstra defines sensitive areas (and functions) based on access to sensitive information, access to cash and exercise of financial delegations, and exercise of effective control over important IT and network facilities. The company does not intend to make public its list of sensitive sites as this may draw unwanted attention to specific sites and thus generate a further security issue.</para><para>(7)	The majority of the network is made up of the cable reticulation system and could be accessed by the public either directly, through cable pits or indirectly through excavation of cables. According to Telstra, it is not practical or possible to fully protect it from unauthorised access. Key cable routes and network sites are protected through provision of redundant paths and geographically diverse facilities. Further, key and strategic infrastructure is protected through a range of physical and logical security measures.</para><para>(8)	Background checking processes have been used with appointments to areas handling nationally classified information or processes, access to customer IT systems and data, and to meet specific customer or ad hoc requirements. From time to time, they have been applied in appointment or recruitment to IT Local Area Network (LAN) management roles or for Telstra Shop staff.</para><para>(9)	Any failure to comply with employment requirements is dealt with by local line management as a disciplinary issue. There are no stipulated minimum or maximum penalties for failure to wear an ID card. Telstra sites require company identification in order to gain entry. If an employee does not have their card they may be granted a temporary card under established processes.</para><para>(10)	New staff are required to undertake a security induction training module which stipulates the requirement to wear the ID card. This module is followed up after 12 months employment by a further awareness module that reinforces this requirement. New ID cards are issued in a folded paper âcard carrierâ which again reiterates the company's requirements to wear the ID. Staff who require entry into network facilities have completed further training in risk management which repeats the message. Further reminders appear from time to time in the staff newspaper and in e-mail bulletins. Awareness posters are available and displayed in many sites at local management discretion. </para><para>(11)	Figures are only available for the past two years and cannot readily be broken down to identify those employed only in field or network roles. They therefore include agency call centre staff, IT support staff, administration and temporary assistants, etc. Telstra currently has a record of 33,000 separate contract personnel who have been issued approximately 60,000 ID cards. This number includes multiple reissues where an individual has been re-employed on different occasions and the card expiry date reflects the contract end date. It also includes issue of replacement cards for those lost or damaged.</para><para>(12)	Telstra defines a `regular need to visit network sites' as:</para><para>Â·	being the normal place of work; or</para><para>Â·	there being a requirement to visit network sites at least three days a week; and</para><para>Â·	there being a period contract for services to be performed.</para><para>(13)	Generally, only those staff involved in servicing customers who have specific requirements for security clearances or background checking undergo this checking process.</para><para>(14)	Telstra does not supply uniforms to prime contractors or sub-contractors undertaking activities in the Access Network.</para><para>Prime contractors and sub-contractors are issued with Telstra Contractor Photo Identification cards.</para><para>(15)	Telstra does not require signage or branding to be displayed on prime contractor or sub-contractor vehicles.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Maintenance</title><page.no>13995</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1317)</subtitle><id.no>1317</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13995</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 March 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With respect to question no. 30 taken on notice by Telstra during the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee hearing on 6 December 2002, into the Australian Telecommunications Network:</para><para>(1)	(a) Has Telstra ever undertaken any work, including for internal purposes, of the nature of prioritising telephone exchanges according to revenue derived from them, and allocating maintenance and repair priorities based on that prioritisation; and (b) what steps did Telstra take to ascertain its answer.</para><para>(2)	Has Telstra ever done any work for internal purposes, of a similar nature to that described above; if so: (a) when was that work done; and (b) what was the exact description of that work.</para><para>(3)	Can Telstra provide information of this type to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee; if not, why not.</para><para>(4)	How does Telstra ascertain what exchanges need work done on them.</para><para>(5)	How does Telstra prioritise work in exchanges.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13996</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by Telstra, is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(a) and (b)	Telstra advises that to the best of its knowledge, it has not undertaken work for the specific purpose of allocating resources for maintenance and repairs to telephone exchanges based on revenue data. According to Telstra, there are a number of drivers that contribute to the prioritisation of telephone exchanges, such as growth, providing optimal customer service, and current and anticipated future demand. It is expected, however, that a large exchange that feeds a large number of customers, for example in a CBD area, is likely to require more resources for maintenance than a smaller exchange.</para><para>(2)	(a) and (b)	As outlined in response to part (1), Telstra advises that to the best of its knowledge, it has not undertaken work for the specific purpose of allocating resources for maintenance and repairs to telephone exchanges based on revenue data.</para><para>(3)	As outlined in response to part (1), Telstra advises that to the best of its knowledge, it has not undertaken work for the specific purpose of allocating resources for maintenance and repairs to telephone exchanges based on revenue data.</para><para>(4)	Telstra advises that allocation of funds is driven by proactive analysis of the network which prioritises projects and geographic areas where needs are greatest.  Contributing factors would include growth, faults and maintenance.  An example of this can be seen with Telstra's recent announcement to invest $414 million next financial year to further improve the reliability of its national telecommunications network by undertaking a targeted program to improve network resilience, increase product availability and reduce fault levels. According to Telstra, the Network Reliability Framework will further assist in identifying areas of greatest need.</para><para>(5)	Telstra advises that it prioritises work in exchanges as outlined in response to part (4).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dairy Regional Assistance Program: Bega Cheese</title><page.no>13996</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1471)</subtitle><id.no>1471</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13996</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the grant of $660 645 awarded for the Bega Cheese Shredding and Mozzarella Line Project in the 2000-01 financial year under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme (DRAP):</para><para>(1)	(a) What total DRAP funds have been paid to the proponent;

He will be responsible for coordinating management decisions regarding the implementation of the package. He is located on Solomon Islands and will consult widely with members of the Solomon Islands Government, particularly Prime Minister Kemakeza. The Solomon Islands Government is the sovereign authority in Solomon Islands and is in overall control of the assistance package. The Australian Government remains responsible for all policy decisions regarding the Australian contribution to the Strengthened Assistance package.</para><para>(2)	As Ministers have noted, some elements of the program may be completed in a reasonably short period, other elements will take a considerable period of time to achieve their objectives. In this environment the type and number of assistance personnel will be periodically reviewed. It is likely that the number of Australian Defence Force personnel will be reduced once law and order has been re-established. This, of itself, will be an indication that a measurable objective has been achieved. Nevertheless, it is recognised that some tasks, such as creating an effective police force, will take a considerable time and cannot be linked easily to time-specific indicators.</para><para>(3)	It is not the intention of the package to take responsibility away from Solomon Islanders. In some cases, notably in the police force and the finance ministry, Australian and other expatriate officials will assume in-line positions and work with Solomon Islanders. It is expected that as the process matures Solomon Islanders will assume sole responsibility for these positions.</para><para>(4)	(a) and (b) A comprehensive communication strategy has been developed to keep all Solomon Islanders informed of developments in the implementation of the program. Full use will be made of local communication networks, including the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Commission and the local newspaper. In addition, the Special Coordinator intends to travel frequently around Solomon Islands speaking to local communities.</para><para>(5)	The Assistance Package has been developed at the request of the Solomon Islands Government and has been approved by that Government. The Solomon Islands Government has decided that new approaches are needed. The Government of Solomon Islands remains in control of this process.</para><para>(6)	The Solomon Islands Rehabilitation Authority was a proposal made in the ASPI report. The Government has not established any such body.</para><para>(7)	As the Prime Minister has said, the estimated annual cost of the assistance package is between $200-300 million. This will cover the early period of the deployment. The costs are expected to decline in future years.</para><para>(8)	AusAID is required to adhere to regulations of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> and these requirements for Australian development assistance, including the appropriate identification, assessment, analysis and preparation of strategies for risk management, remain in place to ensure that proper care for the care and custody of public monies is exercised.</para><para>(9)	Over the last fifteen years, Australia has provided $246.2 million in aid assistance to Solomon Islands. This incorporates bilateral development assistance, as well as funds provided by the aid program to Non-Government Organisations, Multilateral and regional organisations for their work in Solomon Islands. It also includes a significant track record of assistance to humanitarian emergencies in Solomon Islands.</para><para>(10)	Australian assistance to Solomon Islands has not failed or contributed to the problems facing the country. Australian aid has made a positive difference. The Australian aid program, particularly since the outbreak of the conflict, has responded in an extremely difficult environment to immediate humanitarian needs in Solomon Islands, while also helping to address the most critical challenges facing the country - law and order and economic management. The aid program has resulted in increased government revenue through better management of customs and forestry, rudimentary health services being sustained across the country, including the funding of essential, basic medical supplies and services to all provinces and putting more police on the streets with 170 new graduates - the first since 1996.</para><para>(11)	The objectives of the current aid program - restoring law and justice, improving economic management, basic service delivery (health) and community development - are fundamental. The current program provides a strong foundation on which to build the civilian development assistance envisaged for the Strengthened Assistance operation.</para><para>(12)	As the Prime Minister has said, this is about a long-term commitment to improving the situation in Solomon Islands. Planning is underway for longer-term sustainable rebuilding of systems and institutions. Solomon Islands ownership and involvement from the beginning is crucial to this, and fundamental to Australia's approach. The aid program has well-established processes and a body of knowledge and experience in the identification, design and implementation of sustainable development activities. This knowledge, experience and appropriate processes will continue to be applied to development assistance to Solomon Islands as part of the ongoing partnership with Solomon Islanders to assist them in the economic and social development of their country.</para><para>(13)	(a) and (b) The ASPI report is a very useful contribution to the public debate on issues relevant to Solomon Islands. It has helped to inform thinking but it has not served as a template for the development of policy. The development of policy and planning on Solomon Islands is the product of ongoing dialogue, monitoring and strategies with the Solomon Islands Government, other stakeholders in Solomon Islands, and other partners in the region. The longstanding AusAID program to Solomon Islands was developed in partnership with the Solomon Islands Government, and has had four key objectives: restoring law and justice, improving economic governance, peace and community development and basic service delivery (health), which have sat alongside an ongoing role in humanitarian and emergency response. These key objectives are well targeted and responsive to the issues, are founded in partnership with Solomon Islands, and provide a foundation for the Strengthened Assistance package.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attorney-General's: United Nations Convention Breach</title><page.no>14046</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1634)</subtitle><id.no>1634</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14046</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 July 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Does the Government regard the public display of the word `Nigger' as acceptable.</para><para>(2)	What action will the Government take to implement the decision of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination calling on the Government to `take the necessary measures to secure the removal of the offending term (Nigger) from the sign at the Toowoomba sports ground'.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14046</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Australian Government condemns racial discrimination and vilification.  </para><para>Australia has comprehensively implemented its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in Australian law in the form of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (the Act).

The Government notes that the Committee did not find that Australia had breached any of its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Government also notes that the matters raised in the communication before the Committee have been considered extensively by the Federal Court of Australia, which concluded that, given the context in which the word `nigger' was used on the grandstand, it was not racially discriminatory. Leave to appeal that decision was denied by the High Court of Australia. The Government notes that, in announcing its decision, the CERD Committee noted with satisfaction the resolution passed by a public meeting attended by members of the local Aboriginal community and the chair of the Toowoomba sports ground trust that, in the spirit of reconciliation, racially derogatory or offensive terms will not be used or displayed in the future.
