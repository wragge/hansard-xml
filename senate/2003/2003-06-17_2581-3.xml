The Labor Party will not be supporting the message that has been communicated to us by the House of Representatives. The issue in question is the treatment for income tax purposes of foreign expatriates. This is the second time this measure has been debated: last year in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2002 and this year in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003, although that latter bill began life as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002. It is very obvious that the Howard Liberal government is very keen to get it passed. It is an indication of the Liberal government's priorities that it incorporates this measure in a tax bill that includes reducing the tax offset available to people with high medical expenses.</para></talk.start><para>This bill provides a tax exemption for temporary residents—persons who have not been a resident of Australia within the last 10 years—for all foreign source income and capital gains not associated with Australian employment or service for a maximum period of four years. It also provides an exemption from interest withholding tax obligations for a maximum period of four years. The bill also removes the current time limit of four years on exemptions from the foreign investment fund, known as FIF, rules for all holders of temporary visas. This measure applies not only to temporary residents but also to holders of a number of other visa classes.</para><para>The Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommended that tax exemptions for expatriates apply in relation to pre-residence assets and liabilities. But this bill goes further than that. It would extend that exemption to apply to foreign source income and withholding tax obligations regardless of whether they related to assets acquired before or after their residency began in Australia. The cost of these measures is significant—between $40 million and $50 million per year. That means these measures would have a four-year cost of up to $200 million, and this is a significant amount of money.</para><para>When these measures were put into this bill, the government pre-empted its review of international taxation arrangements. The Australian Democrats and Labor voted against these measures then because we wanted to see them dealt with in the context of the review of international tax. What came out of that review was a minimal set of measures to reform the controlled foreign corporation and foreign investment fund rules. The big issues—streaming and tax relief for Australian taxpayers for foreign dividend earnings—were ignored. The reason the government could not do more is that it does not have the financial capacity to do more. It could not give back to ordinary taxpayers the full proceeds of bracket creep; we discussed that last night. If it did, the budget would be in deficit in 2004-05 and 2005-06, and that is against a background of record high tax collection by this Liberal government. This is the highest taxing government in Australian history. Record high taxes, low services. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Increased employment, high taxes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—That is the approach of this Liberal government. Senator McGauran, you had better check with your adviser what your contribution to this debate should be—in an orderly manner, hopefully. Therefore, it could not afford to do anything much to enhance the international competitiveness of the Australian tax system. In this coming financial year, it is falling $900 million short of giving back the proceeds of bracket creep to Australian taxpayers. This is the $4 tax cut we discussed last night, which disappears for most Australians within the next year—the so-called sandwich and milkshake tax cut. That is not a Labor description; it is a Senator Vanstone, Liberal minister description. She is the one who dubbed it and gave it its true value and worth.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government could not even give back the proceeds of bracket creep to Australian taxpayers. It is not in a financial position to be giving $50 million a year worth of tax concessions to foreign expatriates. Where are the priorities of this government? The Labor Party will not support giving an extra $50 million in tax concessions to foreigners. That is not a Labor priority. Labor will continue to press for its amendments for this reason. We hope that other non-government members in the Senate will take the same view and that these measures will not pass. Accordingly, as I indicated at the commencement of my remarks, we will be voting to reject the message from the House of Representatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11618</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> is now before us for the third time. It has five chapters. The first, which is the issue of dispute, concerns foreign income exemption for temporary residents. The second concerns exempting compensation for loss of defence remuneration. The third chapter is titled `Amounts repaid are not assessable income'. The fourth concerns amendments relating to tax offset for medical expenses, about which you could have a number of opinions, but that has been let through. And the fifth concerns income tax exemption for the Commonwealth Games Federation. The government has said that, rather than accept the Senate's view that chapters 2 to 5 should pass and chapter 1 should be set aside for later consideration in conjunction with a broad review of international tax, it disagrees. In fact, the message from the House is very specific. It says it is not appropriate that these measures should be referred to the review of international tax arrangements. The fact is that RITA, as it is called, has reported but we have not seen the legislation which is attached to it.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister has recently raised the issue of the Senate not reviewing bills or issues fully enough. Frankly, I think that is an encouragement of us to be less helpful to the government than we have been in the past. I think the Senate has been guilty of being oversupportive of government and of allowing far too many bills to be considered without being referred to committee. For instance, statistically, we are at present referring only one-third of bills to committee. So I am sure the minister would agree that, in light of the Prime Minister's discussion, an important issue like this should definitely go off to committee and be properly and thoroughly reviewed in conjunction with the report on the international tax arrangements.</para><para>Of course it is our view, as it is the view of the Labor Party, that you cannot consider this issue of the foreign income exemption for temporary residents in isolation from a holistic review of our relationships on the international tax front. So I think the government are caught in a bind. Firstly, they have not brought forward the necessary legislation that follows from that, and perhaps quite properly so—perhaps they are still consulting. Secondly, they have asked the Senate to review these matters far more seriously. I do not think the Senate should be of a mind to rush at a measure like this, which is a cost of $50 million and may have negatives that we have not thought through. </para><para>The third area overhanging relative to the ways in which workers and executives who are foreigners are taxed is, of course, the bigger issue of the remuneration of executives in this country, which includes that of foreigners who are working for Australian companies. This is an issue of great concern. It has been strongly and passionately debated in this place, yet we still await the CLERP 9 legislation with which we could address these issues—and they are connected. There is a view in the Australian community that some of these foreign expatriates who come to Australia are nothing but carpetbaggers, people who come here and rip off our companies and drive them into a loss making or a poorer situation than they were in before. Of course, that is not true of the majority of foreigners who come to Australia and work here, who make a great contribution to our life. But we should recognise that that carpetbagging taint does attach itself to some very high profile circumstances.</para><para>The other point which exercises the minds of those who have to consider these issues is whether there is a real sign of difficulty in attracting foreign workers or foreign executives to Australia because of our international tax arrangements. Frankly, the evidence we have seen on this is circumstantial, it is anecdotal and it is not borne out by the extraordinary range of cultures and identities that we are exposed to by foreign residents, both temporary and permanent, who are so productively and usefully involved in our companies and organisations. I must say that the Australian Democrats have not seen anything which inclines them to change their minds. In the broad we agree with the views of the Labor Party, as expressed by Senator Sherry, except, as I say yet again, his view that this is a high-tax country. We do not think it is a high-tax country. We will accept the point that some Australians are taxed far too much and some Australians are taxed far too little, including the high-paid executives that are the point of some of this discussion.</para><para>So, Minister, the answer of the Senate to you is that unless you include this in your proposed international tax legislation, which will then go to committee, we are not of a mind to accept the government's proposition at this time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11619</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak once more on the <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> and specifically on the government's attempts to reform the tax treatment of expatriates, which the Labor Party and the Democrats, sadly, see fit to oppose. The Labor Party does not seem to care that this initiative will address barriers to international competitiveness in the tax system, and it does not care that it is blocking measures that will create employment and investment in Australia and that it will impede the development of Australia as a strong financial centre. This is a proposal that will boost investment in Australia and boost jobs. One of the prime obligations of the government is to do what needs to be done to create conditions that are most likely to provide work for everyone who wants it. I would have thought that the Labor Party would embrace that proposal. Labor's prime objective, however, appears to be to do everything possible to prevent this from happening.</para></talk.start><para>The temporary residents measure demonstrates the government's commitment to address barriers to international competitiveness in the tax system. The proposal will create employment and investment in Australia by removing competitive disadvantages to the development of Australia as a strong financial centre. This objective has been supported by successive federal governments, by state governments and by a wide range of business groups but, sadly, it is not supported by the federal Labor Party or the Democrats.  </para><para>The changes will remove counterproductive taxes imposed on foreigners who work in Australia. It is disappointing that the opposition—and I refer to the opposition collectively—appears not to see that these unfair taxes apply to many middle-ranking management and specialist staff who come to Australia to grow business, provide better products and enrich financial sector skills in this country. The way the Labor Party seeks to continually misinterpret and deliberately misrepresent this measure to the Australian public is appalling. `Big business,' they say, `Tax cuts for the wealthy,' they cry. These irrational views are based on a narrow ideology, which means that they refuse to recognise that those who stand to benefit from these measures will play a crucial role in the framework of our economy.</para><para>It was said in debate that we do not want to be giving $50 million to foreigners. That mere proposition shows that, even now after years of debate, there is still some misconception about the bill. The benefits of this measure flow ultimately to the Australian employers of temporary residents. It is the employers who usually bear the additional and, indeed, unfair costs of these people coming to Australia. These measures create a fairer tax system, removing what must on any view be regarded as arcane disincentives for those in the very professions that we need more of in Australia—professions where there are identified shortages, such as with registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and other professionals. Shortages of these kinds are often temporary for a company and the short-term contribution of foreign sourced employees assists the Australian community greatly during these periods. It is regrettable that the opposition cannot support a sensible and reasonable policy change to make Australia more attractive to these foreign workers.</para><para>The opposition's mantra is that this measure is a special concession for rich foreign executives. It may be that some parts of the opposition have simply misunderstood the benefits that these measures will bring to the very people whom you would think they would normally support. The measure will apply to people who are Australian residents for tax purposes but who are only here on temporary entry visas. Labour market intelligence undertaken by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in the latter half of 2001 identified that there was a national shortage of accountants, registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and information and communication technology professionals. People granted a temporary resident visa to come to Australia to alleviate the abovementioned skills shortages could benefit from the temporary resident tax exemption. In 2000-01, the top five occupations sponsored by employers under the business long stay visa were computing professionals, applications and analyst programmers, general managers, accountants and—what we really need—registered nurses. These are the kinds of people who will benefit most from the measure; not the rich foreign executives that Labor talks about.</para><para>Australia has surely grown up: we are no longer a closed and isolated country. We have major trading partners and major investments, and we do recognise the benefits of skilled labour and of the introduction and free flow of new ideas from overseas. Costs relating to temporary resident employees are an important consideration in establishing regional offices and headquarters and in making Australia a financial centre. How many times have we heard a debate about Australia becoming a branch economy? Here is a measure to address it, and yet it is ignored. Other countries in our region that compete with us for this kind of investment have also provided special concessionary tax arrangements for temporary employees. This government is not proposing substantial concessions and benefits for foreigners; it is simply proposing that some of Australia's historic and outdated impediments to labour sourced from overseas be removed so we can stay in the game. </para><para>Singapore is currently extending its already concessional tax treatment. China is emerging as a further competitor in the international skilled labour market. The New Zealand government is currently considering methods of removing these labour market impediments. Yet the Labor opposition is prepared to let Australia fall behind. Without reforms such as these, skilled professionals will continue to be lured outside Australia. The opposition does not seem to understand that, for Australia to even stay in the game against its competitors and go on enjoying the sort of growth we have seen in this country and the economic prosperity that in one way or another we have all enjoyed, Australia must find ways of continuing to be efficient, effective and competitive. </para><para>It is not as if there is any alternative policy being discussed here today; the only action is to block all of these crucial reforms. Japan, Hong Kong and the Netherlands are all streaking ahead of us now in attracting these kinds of workers, and yet the opposition to this measure will continue to penalise businesses that rely on specialist skills that can come from abroad. Under the government's proposal, Australia will benefit from the dynamic effects of having more and better businesses located here, as well as from the expenditure and local employment they will generate. Australia also benefits through the transfer of new management and other skills that key personnel can bring to Australian business.</para><para>We have been talking about undue haste. When this legislation last appeared in this place, it was suggested that the government had acted with undue haste in presenting these reforms. I should add that the reforms were recommended to the government by the Ralph review of business tax in 1999 and introduced by the government last year and again this year. During this lengthy period, the measure has been subjected to extensive consultation and has been consistently supported by business. This support has more recently been endorsed by the Board of Taxation. How that can be said to be undue haste is a matter of conjecture.</para><para>During debate in this place earlier this year, it was suggested—I think Senator Ludwig said it—that the government should consider any changes to Australia's international tax regime as part of a package. Indeed, Senator Murray said that also. The government has now announced its response to the review of international tax arrangements, which are also a very carefully and comprehensively balanced package. What is the Labor and Democrat position on the package? Certainly, from the Labor Party's announced statements, it opposes it. It offers no policies of its own. In fact, Mr McMullan has said that Labor supports the direction of all these reforms; it just has different priorities for the money. That is the nub of it: it has different priorities. It merely opposes any attempt by the government to make the lasting changes so sorely needed to assume and assure Australia's competitiveness as a global financial centre. </para><para>Rather than investing the intellectual resources and effort and the political ticker to develop a sustainable international tax regime that will benefit Australia, the priorities of the opposition are simply to oppose. We see mindless opportunism and obstructionism, and it is indeed a very sad day for the competitiveness of Australia and for the workers of Australia that we cannot achieve these reasonable reforms. Opposition for the sake of opposition, with their adding no constructive ideas of their own for improvement, is hardly the way this Senate works well. The government does not support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>11622</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I was interested in your remarks about the Ralph review and that the bill that is before us is part of the review's recommendations.

In doing so, I move the second reading amendment to this bill which has been circulated in the name of my colleague Senator Evans:</para></talk.start><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>“but the Senate condemns the Government for its health policy failures, including: </para><para>(a)	the Howard Government's withdrawal of $918 million from public hospitals over the next 4 years;</para><para>(b)	the Howard Government's unfair Medicare package which will result in bulk billing, in time, only being available to pensioners and concession card holders and families being left to pay more and more for their health care;</para><para>(c)	the Howard Government's decision to increase the cost of essential medicines by up to 30 per cent, hitting the sickest and the poorest hardest; and</para><para>(d)	the Howard Government's refusal to review the $2.3 billion private health insurance rebate to ensure that it provides value for money for consumers and taxpayers”.</para><para>The amendment encapsulates Labor's view on the government's health policy failures, which I will describe in a little more detail later on in my speech. This bill sets the scene for the Commonwealth to make its ongoing contribution to the funding of state public hospitals through the Australian health care agreements. The opposition supports the legislative framework that enables the Commonwealth to continue to fund the health care agreements over the next five years. Our great complaint with the Howard government is the level of funding.</para><para>People interested in this area may recall that, at the health ministers conference in 2002, all the states, both the territories and the Commonwealth—through the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson— agreed on a reform program. A task force of clinicians was charged by the health ministers conference to look at a range of reform proposals and reform mechanisms. This set up expectations that there would be, firstly, adequate funding of the states through the health care agreements and, secondly, implementation of some reform measures. But people will remember that in November last year, as well as last week in Sydney, all Australian health ministers turned up with the exception of the federal minister, Senator Patterson. The Commonwealth was represented by an empty chair. A decision had already been made by the government, effectively by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, on the amount of funding for health care. It was clear that, as far as the federal minister for health and the Commonwealth government were concerned, no discussion would be entered into between her and the states and territories, despite the states' and territories' greater appreciation of the sector's needs.</para><para>In January this year, the Treasurer said that we should proceed on the basis that there would be no new money for health in the budget. He was right. For once the Treasurer kept his promise, because that is precisely what we have seen. The forward estimates revealed that $918 million would be dragged out from funding of the health care agreements over the next four years. A virtually identical amount, $917 million over four years, will be spent instead on the government's unfair Medicare package, with zero net gain to health spending by the Commonwealth. This is a great lost opportunity. Nothing has been done and nothing will be done to improve one of the great problems that we have in health care funding in Australia at the moment—cost shifting. We know that for years the system has been bedevilled by cost shifting between the states and the Commonwealth, and here was a perfect opportunity for the Commonwealth to move beyond the old style approach and initiate solutions to the problem.</para><para>This bill and the negotiations leading up to it provided an opportunity for the Commonwealth to consider open, transparent, up-front pooling of funds between the states and the Commonwealth, not just for hospitals but potentially for aged care, pharmaceutical benefits and a range of other health areas. For the next five years every jurisdiction would know where each other jurisdiction stood on matters of health expenditure. This bill therefore represents, on one level, a great lost opportunity. But the greatest damage that the government is doing in this legislation is to rip between $1 billion and $1.5 billion out of Commonwealth funding for state public hospitals. </para><para>It is also appropriate in this context to examine briefly what impact the new unfair Medicare package has on our public hospitals. We know that when the Howard government came to office in 1996 bulk-billing rates were at 80 per cent and that shortly after Labor left office in May 1996 bulk-billing rates peaked at 80.5 per cent. In every year since then, under the Howard government bulk-billing rates have fallen. With the release of the statistics for the March 2003 quarter we see that the national figure for bulk-billing has plummeted to 68.5 per cent. In round figures, that is a 12 per cent drop in bulk-billing in the seven years that the Howard government has been in office. Over half of that drop occurred in the last year or so, effectively a six per cent drop within the last 12 months. </para><para>In December 2001, the health department advised that unless the government took dramatic action there would continue to be a serious and dangerous decline in bulk-billing. In response to this salient reminder, the government did absolutely nothing. As late as December last year, the Prime Minister stood in the other place and claimed it was factually incorrect to say that there was a problem with bulk-billing. Every quarter, when we saw the release of official statistics, the minister for health would say, `These are disappointing rather than disastrous.' They may not have been disastrous for the minister but for an individual who cannot find a bulk-billing doctor it is bordering on the disastrous. Where does such an individual go? What happens is that the states and territories ultimately have to pick up the tab when a person who cannot find a bulk-billing doctor subsequently seeks assistance from a hospital. It might take two days, two weeks, two months or two years but we know that sooner or later low-income Australians who cannot find bulk-billing doctors end up in the emergency departments of public hospitals, thus putting even greater pressure on the state system. State and territory health ministers have been saying for some time that the collapse of bulk-billing is putting additional pressure on our emergency departments. They are now being inundated with people who could and should have been dealt with by a GP.</para><para>It is also the case that those people who are least able to afford to see a doctor or pay for a script are also those people most at risk of serious illness or chronic disease. So how has this government responded to the collapse in bulk-billing? As I mentioned a moment ago and as this bill shows, the government has responded simply by taking $918 million over four years out of the funding for the health care agreements and by introducing its unfair Medicare package. Its Medicare package pays incentives to doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders only. That effectively destroys the universality of Medicare and the integral role of bulk-billing within it. Whilst it is disappointing to Labor and it is indeed disastrous for the health care system in Australia, the package comes as no surprise to the opposition. It reflects the long-held views of the Prime Minister, views expressed by the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition in 1987, when his formal election commitment to the Australian people at that time was that bulk-billing should be restricted to pensioners, concession card holders and poor people and that doctors should be free to charge everyone else what they chose. It has taken him a few years but the Prime Minister is now endeavouring to implement this objective. That is what this government's unfair Medicare package now seeks to implement: to reduce Medicare essentially to bulk-billing for pensioners, concession card holders and the poor. </para><para>The second thing that the government's unfair Medicare package seeks to do is enable, for the first time, the patient rebate to be split from the doctor's charge or copayment. That gives the green light to doctors to charge whatever they want. On the release of the package, the AMA said that doctors' fees would inevitably rise. The Parliamentary Secretary for Family and Community Services, the member for Parramatta, Mr Ross Cameron, has also acknowledged this. Any family with an income of $32,300 or more is not eligible for a health care card or a concession card. As a consequence—bit by bit, visit by visit—members of each of these Australian families will end up paying more and more every time they visit the doctor.</para><para>So the government's unfair Medicare package does not provide a solution to the dramatic collapse of bulk-billing or to the funding of our state public hospitals. As I said, the government is ripping $918 million out of the health care agreements and effectively funding its unfair Medicare package, costing $917 million, by that transfer of funds. When you look at the great areas of public health policy—Medicare and bulk-billing, health care agreements, state public hospitals, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, private health insurance—the government has dramatic failures for which it should be and is being condemned on every score. </para><para>With respect to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we find in last year's budget and again in this year's budget, the government committing itself to increasing the cost of essential medicines by 30 per cent. We know from the health department's own analysis that five million pensioner scripts will not be taken out as a result of the increase in the charge. What is the consequence of the Australian population, particularly pensioners, not taking out their scripts? It is the same as the consequence of not seeing a bulk-billing doctor. They end up in the emergency departments of public hospitals. Combined with the crisis in bulk-billing, more and more people will be attending the emergency departments of our public hospitals at precisely the same time that the government is ripping over a billion dollars out of the funding for our health care agreements.</para><para>Australians know that Medicare is the world's best health system and that only Labor has a plan to save it. We created it and we will now save it. Last month, Labor announced a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse in bulk-billing by lifting the patient rebate for bulk-billing. That will apply to all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. A Crean Labor government will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent and subsequently to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. That is an average increase of $5 per consultation. In addition, Labor will offer powerful financial incentives to doctors to support and extend bulk-billing, especially in outer metropolitan and regional areas where the collapse in bulk-billing is hurting families most. Doctors in metropolitan areas will receive an additional $7,500 each year for bulk-billing 80 per cent or more of their patients. Doctors in outer metropolitan areas and major regional centres will receive an additional $15,000 each year for bulk-billing 75 per cent or more of their patients. Doctors in rural and regional areas will receive an additional $22,500 each year for bulk-billing 70 per cent or more of their patients. These measures are the first step towards Labor's objective of lifting the average national rate of bulk-billing back up to 80 per cent or more. </para><para>Everywhere you look the effect of the government's policies on health increases the burden on individuals and that is at the heart of the unfair Medicare package—to shift the cost to a user-pays system. That runs through every area of health policy: authorising increases in private health insurance premiums; hitting the sickest and poorest with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines; reducing funding to the states for public hospitals; and giving the green light to doctors to charge Australian families with incomes of over $32,300 more every time they visit a doctor. These are the great issues of health care and health care policy before the Australian community. As far as the government's unfair Medicare legislation is concerned, we will fight those changes tooth and nail when they come before the Senate because the only consequence of those measures will be to hit Australian families.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11626</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> provides the Commonwealth contribution to funding our public hospital system. The government argues that $42 billion over five years is an increase. The states argue that it is almost $1 billion less than the previous budget for the same period. It also happens that the amount of $918.4 million that the states argue is a shortfall is roughly equivalent to the government's Medicare package—I will come to that a bit later. The federal government says that for the first time the states are being challenged to be more transparent in their funding to hospitals and to contribute the same growth amount as the federal government. But, of course, this is simplistic. What we do know is that the growth factored into this bill is around five per cent in nominal terms, whilst in the previous five years it was over seven per cent. This in itself is concerning given that the government's Intergenerational Report drew attention to the effect of an ageing population on the health budget.</para></talk.start><para>We ask why the federal government would effectively be reducing its contribution when we are aware of the challenges that the public hospitals face in our country. Emergency departments have seen huge increases in patients—these are of course people who cannot afford fees the doctors charge in their area. Funding formulas continually squeeze hospital budgets, waiting lists are still too long and so on. The government's argument is also simplistic because the traditional boundaries between federal and state health authorities are continually shifting. What was once the clear province of the states to provide an acute hospital setting is no longer the case. Intensive home based treatments for the chronically ill and for those with serious diseases are increasingly becoming technologically possible and, certainly, it is what the ill would prefer. In the long run, home based or out of hospital treatments are less expensive than hospital based care; however, they are only an option when someone takes responsibility for them and they are properly funded.</para><para>The 2003-04 budget papers are lower by $918.4 million than previous estimates of funding for health care agreements. The flimsy premise on which this is based—I quote the portfolio budget statement—is:</para><quote><para>... a result of a greater proportion of public hospital services provided to non-admitted patients and a reduction in public hospital usage growth beyond growth resulting from demographic changes.</para></quote><para>We say that that is an extraordinary justification. We have here an analysis based only on the volume of admitted patients, with no regard for whether or not each acute care episode is more expensive. Of the most unwell are those treated in hospital. With less acute cases treated outside the hospital walls it is also the case that the intensive care necessary in hospital is on average more expensive per episode. As well, there is a strong push for reducing the length of stay in hospital, endorsed by this government and its health department. Worldwide, hospitals are now viewed as expensive and often inappropriate places to recuperate. As long as the reduction in the rate of growth is appropriate and does not compromise quality, any government with long-term vision would be rewarding the states. Of course, the figures the government uses to justify the reduction in state funding may be due to the inadequacy of performance data held by the federal government. The ANAO audit report No. 21 entitled <inline font-style="italic">Performance information in the Australian health care agreements for the 1998-2003 appropriation period</inline> concluded: </para><quote><para>... while individual indicators have the potential to contribute to monitoring, the set of indicators is not adequate for:</para></quote><para>·	monitoring State and Territory conformance with the conditions and principles of funding;</para><para>·	providing an informed assessment of progress against AHCA objectives;</para><para>·	and monitoring the efficiency of the AHCAs. </para><quote><para>The ANAO found no evidence of further planning by Health for the continued development and review of performance indicators on efficiency, quality, appropriateness, accessibility and equity of health services, consistent with the commitment of the AHCAs.</para></quote><para>This is a serious lapse of accountability, the Democrats say, and it appears to suggest that this government accords very little priority to the principles underpinning its grants to the states on Medicare. That is, the lack of performance information allows greater political ambiguity and a lack of accountability of a substantial amount of taxpayer funds for one of the fundamental services of government: the provision of good quality health services. One needs to question why this might be so and why so few resources within the health department are directed towards ensuring the principles of efficiency, quality, appropriateness, accessibility and equity of health services as agreed under Medicare.</para><para>Is the answer that the government is not committed to ensuring that these principles are upheld? One might look to where the reduction in outlays has been allocated to examine this government's priorities. As I said before, the reduction of $918.4 million is the outlay required for the Medicare package. The government paid $140,000 just to produce the title—A Fairer Medicare, and we all know that it is not fairer. The marketing has not fooled us and it has not fooled anybody else, as far as I can see. It is galling that such misleading and wasteful marketing has cost taxpayers so much and that the minister for health shows no sign of taking responsibility for this particular poor performance. In fact, $140,000 would go a long way to assist funding some self-funded, resource-stretched organisations, such as those for cystic fibrosis or motor neurone disease, which exist on the goodwill of volunteers.</para><para>The Democrats say that the outlays for the Medicare package which shift costs to the sickest and the poorest individuals are budgeted at $917 million. I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that the government is not only dismantling Medicare with this package but also using funds from public hospitals to do so. This government has eroded confidence in the public health system by marketing itself as financially responsible and claiming that no more money can be found while at the same time happily funding those policies it sees as a priority, such as the $2.4 billion for private health insurance rebates.  </para><para>Let there be no mistake: the Democrats want to see financial responsibility in government, but diminishing investment in hospitals and in quality health care is irresponsible. We think that government priorities need to be more transparent. This requires good quality information, which is currently not available, and some mechanism for inspiring public confidence in the process. Given the abject failure of governments to date to undertake this process in a collaborative fashion, I believe there needs to be a change in that mechanism.</para><para>At the time the National Blood Authority was debated in the Senate, I congratulated the minister on achieving a collaborative model with the states to establish a state-Commonwealth body for the collection, dissemination and coordination of blood supplies. That demonstrated that where there is political will, a positive outcome can be achieved across Commonwealth-state divides. The Democrats have been calling for an independent arbiter in health funding since February this year. Just this week, this approach was endorsed by the Australian Health Reform Alliance, which consists of eminent groups such as the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Council of Social Service, the New South Wales Nurses Federation, Catholic Health Australia, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation and the Royal Australian College of Physicians. However, the minister rejected this idea, on the basis that it adds another layer of bureaucracy. I find that an astounding comment. The states and the Commonwealth have been embroiled in working parties negotiating meetings for over a year, possibly two years, with eight subgroups looking at ways to improve health care delivery. These working parties have essentially come to nothing. I challenge the minister to provide us with a costing of the wasted effort that went into a process that in the end was totally ignored by the minister. </para><para>As I envisage it, this independent arbiter could have the authority to build on the collection of data already held by the health department, the Health Insurance Commission and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, as well as hospital data from the states. The arbiter would have the authority to request and monitor data pertaining to services and service costs, and Australians could be confident that what they get is not just another product of political argy-bargy and spin wars between Liberal and Labor governments. The Commonwealth and states could agree to a global budget at the beginning of an appropriation period, with an agreement about how those funds would be spent—that is, both acute care services in hospital and after- and pre-care in the community. An acknowledgment would be made about the proportion of spending that the Commonwealth excludes for the provision of primary care, including pharmaceuticals, but grants would also be included for the states to provide primary care in rural and remote areas.</para><para>I hope that in time more funding for primary care will be allocated to the states, with the arbiter overseeing this to ensure national coverage and consistency of quality. However, we recognise that all changes need to be incremental. Where there are significant changes in the mix of primary and acute related services, this needs to be addressed by changes to annual funding, and this would be within the scope of the arbiter's authority. This represents a significant reform from the present situation, but it is time to come up with some solutions. We need to keep this in perspective, of course—we as a nation do have very good quality health services and very good health outcomes, but there is a tremendous potential to improve on where we are and to make the most of the excellent skill base we have in our medical and health work force.  </para><para>We will support the bill. However, we are not happy that funding for hospital services has been reduced, as I have already said. The budget surplus of $2.4 billion has been wasted on propping up private health insurance, an estimated $1 billion leakage from the PBS system and a costly war against a country that did not, as most us knew, have weapons of mass destruction—to name just a few areas in which savings could have been made to better fund our hospital sector. We are not happy with the federal and the state governments still being at loggerheads over everything from hospital funding, to disability funding, to housing funding. People are sick of those two levels of government not being able to get their act together on hospital funding and on other issues. We suggest that an arbiter might be a very good solution to sort this out. I foreshadow that the Democrats will be moving a second reading amendment. It has not yet been circulated, but I understand that it will be shortly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11629</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> appropriates funds for the Commonwealth government's contribution under the next round of Australian health care agreements with the states and territories, due to take effect from 1 July. The Commonwealth government proposes to contribute $42 billion for the term of the five-year agreement. The Commonwealth argues that its offer represents a substantial increase, up by around $10 billion, on the previous Australian health care agreements. It also plans to penalise those states that do not match its growth rate by reducing its contribution to them by four per cent. The states have reduced their share of funding in recent years relative to the Commonwealth and they should rectify this. But this should be done in the context of a major review of how the different spheres of government fund and deliver health care and how we determine the funds required to provide quality care for all Australians. The trend in state spending does not justify a federal fine. </para></talk.start><para>More alarming is the government's intention to reduce the foreshadowed expenditure in the next round of health care agreements and the justification advanced for that. The Howard government is trying to strip almost $1 billion from its contribution, as foreshadowed in the forward estimates, on the spurious grounds that an increase in private health insurance membership and private hospital admissions means there is less demand on public hospitals. This argument does not stand up to scrutiny. The latest available hospital figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare are for 2000-01. They show that separations for public hospitals fell by 0.1 per cent or 5,208 compared with the previous year. This contrasts with an increase in private hospital separations of 12.2 per cent or 244,802. The rise in the private hospital rate is substantial but, more importantly, the fall in the public hospital rate is negligible. When spread across a full year, it amounts to around 100 fewer separations a week across the entire country. How then can the government argue that this is less pressure on public hospitals? Not only do the figures undermine the government's contention, but its own policy objectives are at odds with its claim. </para><para>One of the main aims of the private health insurance rebate, the Medicare levy surcharge and the lifetime cover age based premium penalties was to increase insurance membership among younger people who are less likely to need hospital treatment, particularly elective surgery. So an increase in younger people taking up private health insurance is unlikely to have any impact on reducing pressure on public hospital admissions. As well as this, a large majority of new memberships for private health insurance include high up-front fees or excess in exchange for a lower premium. This can discourage people from using their private insurance, and they can opt instead to be treated as a public patient in a public hospital. Then, of course, there is cost shifting, and the federal and the state and territory spheres are guilty of cost shifting on health. This is one more reason that we need to review the respective roles of the different spheres of government in this critical public policy area.  </para><para>The shortage of aged care accommodation—a federal responsibility—has led to older people occupying public hospital beds, further increasing the pressure. The decline in bulk-billing rates for GP services, over which the Howard government has presided, has put additional pressure on the accident emergency services at public hospitals. Anecdotal evidence also overwhelmingly supports the view that our public hospitals are still under pressure in spite of the government wasting almost $2.3 billion a year on subsidising private health insurance. Ambulances are regularly sent on a search for a hospital able to take critical patients as they are turned away from one accident emergency unit to another, while other people with less serious conditions wait for hours for treatment. All the evidence points to growing, not falling, pressure on the country's public hospitals. </para><para>In the face of such evidence, we have to wonder about the government's real motives. Does the government intend to take Australia the way of the United States, which spends almost 14 per cent of its gross national product on health care compared to the OECD average of eight per cent? Yet as many as 42 million of its people are without insurance coverage for medical and hospital services and as many again have inadequate insurance arrangements. We could be forgiven for believing that this is the government's intention—forcing everyone to pay more in direct costs for health care, offering underfunded charity services for the very poor and using public funds to subsidise the private insurance of high-income earners. At the Liberal Party national conference earlier this month, the Prime Minister stated: </para><quote><para>... what this Government has done is to take some of the load off the public component of healthcare provision in Australia by strengthening and expanding the private component. </para><para>We believe in a partnership between the public and private sector to deliver superior health outcomes for all Australians.</para></quote><para>The fact is that most Australians want to be able to rely on a well-funded public system. The idea of taking the load off the public sector is code for expanding the profit-making sector and forcing more Australians to pay a larger direct share of the cost of health care and essential medicines. We have had the government's proposal to increase the patient copayment for essential PBS medicines by 28 per cent, a proposal that the Greens will continue to oppose because it will hurt vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our community. We have had the introduction of penalties and financial incentives. We have had the private health insurance rebate that costs the public almost $2.3 billion a year and which the government wants to increase by extending private insurance to out-of-hospital expenses as a part of its measures to dismantle Medicare by stealth.</para><para>The overwhelming majority of health economists have concluded that the private health insurance rebate is an inefficient use of public money. It does not buy one health service. We have seen that the private sector, which discriminates on the basis of income—that is, if you can pay, you get the care that you need—is performing a growing proportion of procedures that once would have been performed largely in public hospitals. Private health care is more expensive than public health care; there are fewer price controls and more money is spent on administration and marketing. Why would the government, which is continually lecturing us about economic efficiency, want to waste public funds on an inefficient allocation of moneys to the private health care sector in preference to the public sphere? It will cost us all more. At the same time, it diminishes our ability as a community to provide care to everyone who needs it when they need it, irrespective of their private capacity to pay. </para><para>As far as we can tell, the government has no intention of withdrawing the private health insurance rebate on the basis that the rising membership should be delivering the sort of financial stability that the industry claims it requires to be viable or on the basis that it has enabled the funds to boost their reserves, which increased by 51.6 per cent between 1999-2000 and 2000-01. The latest annual report of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council sounds a warning about the financial viability of the funds, yet the government is content to pour billions of scarce health dollars into this sector, even with these warnings being sounded. This is industry assistance for the long haul not to improve health outcomes, not to provide greater social equity and not to strengthen the public health care system that treats all people; this is industry assistance to underwrite an ideological agenda, undermining community services to enrich the private market and entrench privilege.</para><para>We are seeing in health funding what we have seen this government do in schools funding in recent years. We should be alert to the consequences of this agenda in health. Australian National University political science lecturer Dr Gwen Gray, writing for the ABC Online in March this year, noted that it is well established by international research that private health insurance cannot survive without taxpayer subsidy, `unless the public system is so poor that people feel forced to insure privately'.</para><para>The Greens are deeply concerned that the government is setting the framework for doing just that, slowly starving the public sector of funding, forcing people to pay more when they need to buy health services—rather than through progressive taxation—and undermining support among high- and middle-income earners for a system that spreads the risk and the cost across the community. There is enough evidence on the public record so that no-one should be in any doubt as to the Prime Minister's view of the national public health insurance scheme. The Prime Minister has never supported bulk-billing, having once described it as a rort. He was the Treasurer in the Fraser government that, the little by little, dismembered Medibank. It took a series of electoral defeats for him to understand that Australians would never vote into office a party intent on dismantling Medicare, so he chose instead to smooth his path to election and then announced his plans to destroy Medicare.</para><para>The government's package spells the end of the principle of universal public health care. It focuses on providing additional funds to support bulk-billing for people with concession cards, and this includes—let us remind ourselves—self-funded retirees earning $50,000 a year, but it excludes low-income earners who do not qualify for a health care card. There is nothing fair about that.</para><para>Under the guise of simplifying the claiming system, the government will open the way for doctors to directly claim the patient rebate at the same time as charging a copayment. This is a major shift. Previously, direct claim of the patient rebate was permitted only for bulk-billing services. This new proposal will enable doctors to increase fees because the quantum, initially, will be lower than what people are paying now, being reduced by an amount equivalent to the rebate. The package is misdirected because around 80 per cent of services provided to concession card holders are already bulk-billed. The challenge is to lift bulk-billing rates for all Australians. </para><para>The Australian Greens have already outlined a series of measures to work towards that goal. The private health insurance rebate should be abolished and the funding redirected towards public health. It should be used to lift the rebate for GP services by $5 for all patients, and the value of the rebate should be maintained not eroded through neglect, as this government has done. There should also be incentives for GPs who bulk-bill a substantial proportion of their patients.</para><para>The fall in the value of the rebate is not the only reason for the decline in bulk-billing, but it is an important factor. Other measures are needed to address work force issues. The Australian Greens support the work force measures in the government's package, but they fail to show any vision for alternative ways of delivering health care. For example, the Australian Greens believe we should be examining salaried GPs who work in community health centres or who are stationed alongside public hospitals. These models may be particularly useful in regional centres and rural communities, where it is difficult to attract doctors working on a fee-for-service basis. We note that some states are experimenting with these options.</para><para>The Australian Greens want Medicare expanded to cover more procedures, starting with dental services and the provision of more funding for mental health. Our proposals and our vision for providing quality, affordable public health care for all Australians stand in stark contrast to the government's plan, which undermines the principle of universality enshrined in Medicare and takes Australia down the road of privatised health care, with all of its dire consequences.</para><para>We are alarmed at reports that the Australian Democrats are considering abandoning their opposition to any measures that undermine bulk-billing for all Australians. Initially the Democrats joined the Greens in opposing the government's package, but late last week Senator Allison was reported as indicating that the Democrats could be persuaded to support the package if the government found a way to cap the copayment for non-concessionary patients. This is no way to defend the principle of universality, nor will it improve access to bulk-billing for all Australians. We call on the Democrats to join the Greens in protecting Medicare from the government's privatisation agenda for health care.</para><para>The Howard government is bent on destroying Medicare little by little, in the way the Fraser government dismantled Medibank two decades ago. Reducing the Commonwealth's contribution to the states and territories for public hospital services on the grounds that private hospitals are treating more private patients is just one more tactic in this offensive agenda. Most Australians want government to spend more, not less, on health care, and the most efficient and equitable avenue for this to occur is through the public sector. In the committee stage of this bill, the Australian Greens will give the government the opportunity to respond accordingly by reinstating its earlier spending commitment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>11632</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have barely begun to debate the budget and its associated bills in this place when the government introduces the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> in what can only be described, to my way of thinking, as one of the most ridiculous three-card tricks that we have ever seen. Thanks to this government, the universality of Medicare will be reduced to the waste bin of Australian history if these and other measures are fully implemented. The government would have us believe otherwise. In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing said in the other place: </para></talk.start><quote><para>This bill delivers on the government's strong commitment to the principle of universality under Medicare.</para></quote><para>I doubt very much that the Australian people believe that. From that comment and from others, you would think that the government has always been committed to Medicare. Nothing is further from the truth. Ask anyone and they will probably tell you that there is very little that is universal about Medicare under the stewardship of the Howard government. Firstly, you have to find a doctor or a medical practice that will bulk-bill. As we all know, over the last seven years this has become more difficult. In the electorate of Hasluck, in my home state of Western Australia, of the 62 local GP and other medical practices, only 25 bulk-bill. Of those 25, only two or three universally bulk-bill; the rest are just for health care card holders. If you do manage to find a doctor who bulk-bills, you will find that it is probably only for the young, the old or other health care card holders.</para><para>This government runs around the country sprouting this nonsense about its package delivering universality, but what it really delivers is `user pays'. This bill is part of that user pays nonsense. This bill delivers a $1 billion cut from the forward estimates for health care in our public hospital system. At a time when the public hospital system in this country is in crisis, the government is actually cutting money from it. We all know why it is in crisis, and it is a crisis of the government's own making. The government has presided over Medicare for seven long years and, during that time, has ensured that we have seen the beginning of its destruction. Bulk-billing rates have declined, from a high of 80 per cent down to 68 per cent.</para><para>What is the direct consequence of this? More and more of our fellow Australians are presenting at the accident and emergency departments of Australian public hospitals, seeking the provision of basic health care services. These are services that could be provided by a doctor or a medical practice but, as our fellow Australians can no longer afford to pay the fees charged by doctors, they go to the one place where they know they will not be turned away because of their lack of ability to pay.</para><para>This government is building a health system that is all about money: if you have the money, take out private health insurance; if you have the money, go and see a local doctor and pay the fees. But what happens to those without the money? They are condemned to lining up in the accident and emergency departments of our public hospitals for hours and hours, waiting to have their basic health care needs met. At a time when we know that the number of presentations at public hospitals is going up, this bill cuts their funding. The government is cutting the funding to public hospitals to fund its approach to Medicare.</para><para>In Victoria in 2002 an extra 50,000 patients presented to the public hospital system because of the failings of this government. Emergency admissions are increasing by eight per cent a year. In New South Wales in the same period, emergency department presentations exceeded two million. That means that each week in New South Wales some 40,000 of our fellow Australians are turning up in public hospital emergency departments. In my home state of Western Australia, on any given day 1,146 people are admitted to our public hospitals, a further 824 people are treated in our emergency departments and discharged, 11,283 people attend an outpatient session, and over 250 operations are performed. When you take into account all those statistics, what does this bill do? It cuts a billion dollars from the funding for those procedures. </para><para>The government's defence is that with the increase in private health insurance the load is being lifted from public hospitals. Let us examine that defence. For the small sum of some $4 billion—the private health insurance rebate, which is increasing all the time—private hospital admissions have gone up by less than one per cent. So let us be quite clear about this. Four billion dollars or so increases private hospital admissions by one per cent. Yet at the same time, in the case of Victoria, they get their share of the $1 billion cut and they get to treat an extra 50,000 people. </para><para>There is something fundamentally unsound about how this government approaches health care. It put in place a system that forces a whole lot of people into private health insurance, which costs a significant amount. Let us not fool ourselves by pretending that it does not represent a lot of money. Even with the benefit of the rebate offered by the government, I am aware of a family in the northern suburbs of Perth, a family of six with basic hospital coverage, that are paying nearly $180 per month. I am told by this family that their health insurance premiums have gone up at least once a year for the last three years. This family can now only find a medical practice that will bulk-bill for children under the age of 12.</para><para>Recently I travelled in the north-west of Western Australia. The north-west has the great distinction of having a fair number of high-income earners who work in the mining and resource sector and also a great number of people that are either in low-income groups or who receive Centrelink payments. If you go any further north in Western Australia than Geraldton there is no provision for private health services at all. There are no private hospitals and GP services are, in the main, delivered through the public hospital system, through organisations like the Aboriginal medical services, or there are salaried GPs provided by local government authorities. Yet that population still has to pay either the private health insurance premium or the extra tax this government has imposed on those who do not take it out. So they pay for a service that they cannot physically access, thanks to this government.</para><para>This is the rebate scheme that costs the budget more and more each year because of the increases that health funds seek to meet their costs, yet they do not deliver services to a significant proportion of those in my home state. It is an increase that the Prime Minister said would have to go before parliament, but which never really has. This approach was meant to relieve pressure on our public health system. This approach was said to be all about reducing the load on public hospitals, and yet we have ended up with the opposite result. </para><para>At the same time the government does nothing to relieve the pressure on Medicare. Bulk-billing rates have fallen by 12 per cent in seven years and the effect of the decline in Medicare bulk-billing is the increase in people going to our public hospitals. So for a whole lot more money the government has not fixed the problems in public hospitals nor addressed the problems in Medicare. In fact it has actually made them worse, with private health funds being subsidised to the tune of up to $4 billion supposedly to address the problems in the health care system. At the same time as this is meant to prop up the private health insurance scheme we have seen an enormous pressure on Medicare and a rampant increase in the workload in our public hospitals.  </para><para>So what is the government's new response to that? This government cuts a further billion dollars from public hospitals. The logic is inescapable really. In fact the logic has escaped entirely from the government's approach to the delivery of health care services. If you want to reduce the load on the public hospital system you should invest money in those areas that will see fewer people presenting at our public hospitals. If you want more people to use private as opposed to public hospitals then you would perhaps look at the health insurance rebate. However, you would only do this in a situation where you could make sure that no other factors impacted on it. You would have achieved your goal if you did not then fill up the public hospitals with new patients. Where are these new patients coming from? They have come from all those medical practices and doctors' surgeries across Australia that have stopped bulk-billing or only bulk-bill a limited patient group.</para><para>So the health budget is being eaten away by the need to prop up the private health insurance rebate scheme. If this is not the worst case of taking public money and passing it directly to industry, I do not know what it is. All this money is going directly to the private health insurance industry and yet we are not solving any of the underlying problems in our health system. This would have to be industry welfare of the worst kind, and it is now paraded as reasonable health policy.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party have outlined a way of increasing the rate of bulk-billing within the budget's ability to pay, and by doing so we will relieve the pressures on our public hospital system and allow accident and emergency departments to deal with accident and emergency cases, not people that cannot access GP facilities. We believe that the best way to decrease the pressure on our public hospitals is not to fill up accident and emergency departments with patients who should be seeing their local GP—patients who have voted with their feet as a consequence of not being able to afford to pay for their visits to their local GP. Health should not be about how deep your pockets are but about need, and your ability to pay should not determine your level of need.</para><para>Nor should we accept the Commonwealth stripping the funding from public hospitals to fund the user-pays private health system. Government spending should be about reducing the load on public hospitals through increasing the rates of bulk-billing—and Labor has outlined a very clear way of achieving that. It should not be about the redistribution of taxpayers' moneys to prop up an industry that was failing to attract new members. It should not be about allowing those same funds to increase their premiums and therefore also increase the cost of the government's contribution as a consequence of their own actions. And then we get the complaints from the private health insurance companies because their members actually make claims. </para><para>What did the health funds expect was going to happen when they got a compliant government to force people into something they did not really want to join? Of course they were going to put in claims. Of course they would look at their private health insurance as a cost—but one the funds themselves marketed on the basis of being able to claim for health related items. So what did the members do? They put in lots of claims. Then the health funds, with this captive consumer base, had to put up their premiums because they were losing money. Should we actually be surprised? Of course not. When people are conscripted, when they are denied a choice, do not be surprised when they make sure they get everything they can out of it. </para><para>After all this, this government needs to strip $1 billion from our public hospitals. This government's health system is a cruel joke perpetrated on the Australian taxpayer. It has reduced universality to a concept of user pays. Unfortunately, the effect of this is that all Australians are paying, even if they are not in a private health scheme. They pay through the increasing cost of the rebate. They pay through the increasing strain on the public hospital system. They pay through their inability to find a doctor who bulk-bills. They pay and pay and pay and end up with poorer health outcomes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11636</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It will be no news to anyone listening to this debate that the states and the Commonwealth are at loggerheads yet again over funding for our public hospitals and have gone back into their respective trenches. It happens time after time after time. The battle has as usual seen accusations fly as to who is putting in how much money and who should be putting in how much more. The Commonwealth argues this time that it has put in a real increase of 17 per cent in funding. It argues that the states are the ones that are being difficult and that their intransigence is all down to their having Labor governments. The states, on the other hand, accuse the Commonwealth of not offering a real increase but a decrease in what was expected of about $1 billion over the life of the agreement. The federal minister has refused to attend meetings with state health ministers. Accusations have been flying from the state health ministers back to the Commonwealth about the offer. Indeed, the Commonwealth has made it clear that it is not going to increase the offer.</para></talk.start><para>The minister argues that savings should be made because more public hospital services are being provided to non-admitted public patients than has been previously the case. I presume that that means—and perhaps the minister can fill us in on this when we get to the committee stage—more pressure is put on accident and emergency services and that there is more day surgery. I guess we will get to the committee stage of the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> later. Also, the Commonwealth argues that because there has been a reduction in the rate of growth in the use of our public hospitals they deserve to face these cuts. I presume that it revolves around the increased use of private hospitals for elective surgery. Other issues that are facing our public hospitals include beds being closed because the hospitals have run out of funds or because they simply cannot find the nurses to staff them. Most public hospitals do not seem to have reduced their waiting lists; nor to any great extent have they reduced any of the other waiting lists. Besides the ones for elective surgery there are many waiting lists for visits to specialists and in some cases, unfortunately, urgent treatment such as for cancer.</para><para>Minister, we see that the usage of private hospitals has gone up. The number of people accessing private hospitals has certainly jumped, but the pressure on the public system has not come down. It has not come down in any really measurable amount and certainly not to the point where people can expect timely access and that that access can be assured on the basis of merit. I believe it is simply not fair or reasonable for the Commonwealth to ignore what is actually happening on the ground in our public hospitals. Some ideological, wished for scenario of people all rushing off to private hospitals if they have any sort of problem with waiting in the public system is not going to happen. For some it is a financial issue: they simply cannot afford private health insurance. They do not want to risk the gap they may be faced with if they go private. For some it is a case of up-front fees for the specialist to begin with. For others it involves the nature of their illness or when or where it occurs. Most private hospitals do not operate a 24-hour emergency service. It will be interesting to see the state by state figures on how many private hospitals are offering a 24-hour accident and emergency service. </para><para>So where does the truth lie? As usual, it is between the two extremes. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says that the states are falling behind in the amount that they contribute to our hospitals. It points out that the share of funding that the states put in has fallen from 45.4 per cent in 1998-99, when the last health care agreement was signed, to around 43 per cent in 2000-01. Of the total moneys put in during that period, the Commonwealth's contribution has stayed stable at around 48 per cent. The missing nine or 10 per cent, for those who are doing their maths, is down to non-government contributions.</para><para>We must look at what the Senate can do as far as this ongoing battle between the Commonwealth and the states is concerned. As it is an appropriation bill we will be supporting the legislation. Yes, we can attempt to increase the amount—and I note that there is at least one amendment being circulated that is directed towards doing that—but I cannot imagine that that will be acceptable to the minister and to the government. As the minister has previously said, the Commonwealth has made an offer and it is not going to move. As we look at the legislation specifically, there are certainly some positives. I congratulate the minister on her direction to the states that they must declare publicly the level of funding that they are going to provide. I also congratulate her for the improved performance reporting framework that is being put in place under this legislation. I also agree that the states should match the Commonwealth funding, and I believe they should give a public commitment to doing so as soon as possible.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>11637</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Manildra Group of Companies</title><page.no>11637</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11637</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.

I am happy to get that information as soon as I possibly can. The government has been quite open and up-front about its attitude to ethanol. We think ethanol has a role to play in the fuel mix in Australia. We note that, for a variety of reasons, there was buyer resistance to ethanol. The government has done absolutely the right thing to indicate that a 10 per cent cap and proper labelling should be introduced. We were hoping that the states would do the right thing in terms of consumer information.

It was not appropriate to indicate that limit until we had been through a pretty exhaustive process of determining what was an appropriate position for the Commonwealth to take. Mandating or capping is quite a serious step but we think, in the light of the tests that have been done, that is appropriate. We want this to be part of Australia's fuel mix. It is appropriate to introduce this particular fuel into the fuel mix—but at the end of the day it is a matter for consumers to decide whether they want to buy fuel which has a safe component of up to 10 per cent of the fuel that they buy—and to ensure that retailers of fuel make sure that consumers know exactly what it is that they are buying.

It is with great pleasure that I am able to inform the Senate that last night the government's $2.4 billion tax cut was passed and will come into effect on 1 July. The fact is that these tax cuts really are l-a-w—they actually exist and they will be delivered. They are evidence of the Howard government's philosophy that once vital expenditure needs are met—defence, national security, health and higher education reform—money should be returned to taxpayers. </para></talk.start><para>The tax cut is also progressive. The biggest percentage benefit goes to low-income earners, particularly those who benefit from the increase in the low-income tax offset. The tax cut adds to the $12 billion in the personal income tax cuts that were a central part of the government's tax reform package in 2000-01. They were the largest tax cuts in Australian history. There can be no room for doubt about this government's commitment to tax reform. The Howard government has also abolished the wholesale sales tax, abolished financial institutions duty, abolished stamp duty on share transfers, halved capital gains tax, introduced family tax benefits parts A and B, reduced company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, introduced the baby bonus, abolished Labor's automatic indexation of fuel excise, cut effective diesel excise rates for heavy vehicles and introduced the private health insurance rebate.</para><para>Meanwhile, Labor is missing in action on the issue of tax. On the one hand, they claim that the tax cut is too small and that they will further reduce the overall tax burden. However, so far they have promised to fund their promises by opposing or reversing the government's tax cuts. Labor are committed to opposing our international tax reforms which will make Australia more competitive as a regional centre. Just earlier today the opposition refused to pass reforms to the tax treatment of workers who are temporarily resident in Australia. Who does this hurt? It hurts Australian employers who usually bear the cost of bringing nurses, engineers, occupational therapists and other professionals to Australia to fill jobs where there are identified shortages. The Labor Party oppose our reduction in the superannuation surcharge. They want to abolish the baby bonus. They still have not come clean on what they are going to do about the private health insurance rebate—and whatever commitments they give only last about as long as the appointment and tenure of each successive shadow health minister. And of course we all know that Labor have form when it comes to abolishing tax cuts. Who can ever forget the disappearing l-a-w tax cuts after the 1993 election?</para><para>If ever we needed more evidence that Labor cannot be trusted on tax we need look no further than the Labor state governments. In Victoria the Bracks government has increased car registration and indexed hundreds of fees and fines to the CPI. In South Australia the Rann government has slugged every household $30 a year. In Western Australia the Gallop government has increased stamp duty on property transfers. In Queensland the Beattie government has introduced a new $88 tax on all electricity account holders.</para><para>We have Labor's promises to oppose or reverse at least three key tax cuts of the government. Whoever leads the Labor Party, they are and always will be a party of higher taxes on hardworking Australian families. When it comes to Labor promises, don't listen to what Labor says, watch what Labor does. Labor stands for higher taxes. The only party with any commitment to removing the tax burden from ordinary Australians is the government.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>11639</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The amount we spend now is something like $11 billion a year in support for families, something the previous government never did. I pointed out in my answer to a question yesterday what a substantial increase in support to families there has been under this government. There has been a change and, three years later, we still have the Labor Party asking about it because they still have not cottoned on.</para></talk.start><para>The change is to an annual payment to families, where families in one set of circumstances, with the same income and the same number of children of the same age, will get the same amount of money. If Labor wants to market itself as a party of equity treatment, it will support a system where families in the same position with the same income get the same assistance. This system will allow for an advance payment of that annual payment, to be paid out fortnightly, based on a customer's estimate of income. Just as with the tax system, where some people get a refund cheque and some people get a letter saying, `You owe us more,' so it is with the family tax benefit system. Some people will have underestimated their income and because they have actually earned more than that they will obviously get less support, because under this system the richer people get less and the poorer people get more. They would therefore need to pay some money back.</para><para>I did not hear the good senator refer in his question to the hundreds of thousands of families who overestimate their income, find out they have earned less at the end of the year and, under this system, get a top-up in a way that they never did in the past. Hundreds of thousands of families are getting a top-up. We regard a system, Senator—through you, Mr President—where families in the same circumstances with the same income get the same amount of money as a fair and equitable system. We do not regard it as flawed; we regard it as a fair and equitable system.</para><para>It is a massive change from the way things used to be, Senator, with a complicated range of payments now down to two or three much simpler payments. It is a change whereby entitlement is not based on your position on a fortnightly basis but on an annual basis. It is aligned with the tax system. As long as this system stays in place, just as with the tax system, there will be people at the end of the year who get a top-up and there will be people at the end of the year who have an overpayment and who will probably either pay that back directly, if they can afford to, or will treat it as a down-payment on next year's very generous payments. I remind you, Senator, that the average payment to a family is over $5,000 tax free. I recall that members opposite raised in this chamber the case of a man on an income of around $30,000 who has seven children. He gets something like $25,000 tax free under this system. It is a very fair system and a very generous system, clouded for the public, I might say, by misconceptions carried into the community by Labor. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11641</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The $917 million fully funded package of measures is to strengthen Medicare to make it more accessible and more affordable. The Labor Party never cared a skerrick about accessibility. They refused to address the issue. There were too few doctors in rural areas and too few doctors in outer metropolitan areas; the doctors were clustered in the metropolitan areas. This is a package about access and affordability. We identified that there was an equity problem in the way Medicare currently operates. Patients' costs for visiting a GP depended more on where they lived than on their ability to pay. That is why we developed significant scaling incentives to GPs, depending on their location, to bulk-bill some or all of their patients. The level of incentives rises substantially the more remote the practice is. They range from an average of $3,500 to an average of $22,050 each year. Those GPs who participate in the General Practice Access Scheme and whose practices are located in an urban area of work force shortage will also be eligible for assistance to employ a practice nurse. The government will provide $8,000 payment per full-time GP up to a maximum of $40,000 to hire a nurse for the practice. It has been estimated by some people that a full-time practice nurse relieves a doctor's practice of about the equivalent of 0.5 of a medical practitioner.</para></talk.start><para>This package has been fully costed and, unlike Labor's alternative, it is not coming out of a deficit budget, which they are very good running. It is not coming out of an increase in existing taxes. It is not coming out of the abolition of the private health insurance rebate. Senator Coonan referred to that a moment ago in answer to a question. Mr Crean has to come clean and tell the Australian public—those people who have private health insurance—whether they will be doing anything with the rebate. They ought to come out and commit. He keeps saying that they have a health policy. He has a portion of a policy. He has not admitted or told the Australian public what he is going to do about private health insurance or what they are going to do about the private health insurance rebate.  </para><para>The Howard government has addressed the need to assist GPs to bulk-bill by providing a raft of measures and incentives to make the majority of GPs better off while, more importantly, remaining fiscally responsible. On the other hand we have the Labor Party, who have recently announced their untargeted $1.9 billion-dollar package that is unfunded. Whilst only retaining a number of our measures, they have provided no real incentives to get doctors into areas of work force shortage. They have provided a very expensive package which, as I said, is unfunded.</para><para>There are a number of taxes and rebates we know they have indicated that they will target to raise the funds. Will they increase the Medicare levy to fund their proposal? They have indicated on more than several occasions that this is a proposal worth considering—it depends on who is at the helm at the time, and they get corrected from time to time by Mr Crean. Let me state that, for each half of a percentage point rise in the 1.5 per cent levy, a family with a household income of $50,000 faces an extra tax burden of $250 a year. If they wind back the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, it will result in a tax rise for nine million Australians covered by private health insurance. The Labor Party has stated that it has the 30 per cent rebate under review. Abolishing the rebate will cost between $750 and $850 per year for a family covered by private health insurance. Will they take it off ancillaries? Doing that would mean Australian families would be $230 a year worse off.

Let me make one thing clear: there are no services for women suffering from the effects of domestic violence that are in any way affected by the PADV funding. PADV is a Commonwealth initiative of $50 million to find better ways of preventing and responding to domestic violence. We committed $50 million and we will spend $50 million. The senator asked me: can I confirm that this money will be put back? If the senator was a genius at looking at budget statements, I think she would be able to see that that is the case and that that is there. She nods. I do not know whether she is acknowledging that she sort of implied she could not read the budget papers but now understands that it is there.

The misunderstanding is this: services to women who have suffered from domestic violence are paid for by the states. It is a state criminal offence to beat someone up behind closed doors, and the states deal with it. The Commonwealth some time ago said, `We will help you find new and innovative ways of dealing with this. That money is not for recurrent funding of services but rather to find these new and innovative ways of dealing with and preventing domestic violence.' As to the spending on those recurrent services, I might point out—and I would have pointed this out to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin </inline>if they had bothered to ring and make some inquiries to get their facts right—that the Commonwealth does of course assist the states in some of the funding for domestic violence, namely through funding for SAAP, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. That provides shelters, which of course as you know, Senator, are a much-needed response to domestic violence once it has sadly happened and we have not been able to prevent it. The Commonwealth has had a very significant increase in its last SAAP agreement with the states, an increase which I note has not been matched by one single state.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11644</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

But let me also make clear to you that I have a commitment to this issue that goes well beyond simply saying, `We have spent this money.' I will not sign off on projects if I do not think they are going to deliver appropriate outcomes. I would rather defer the spending of the money and get a better project and get a better outcome for the money than say, `Quickly, let's spend the money this year.'

There is not a word about where he is going to get it from, not a word on how he is going to get the state Labor governments to restrict allocations to find the water that he is going to use to keep the mouth open, and not a mention, I might add, of the huge socioeconomic implications which can destroy farms and communities. </para><para>How is Mr Crean going to do this? Have a look at his speech in reply to the budget. He does have a simple solution. He is going to do it by preventing drought. That is how he is going to do it. He is going to prevent droughts in the future. I know he can pluck roosters, as Senator Conroy can well attest, but how is he going to prevent droughts? He is going to do that by ratifying a treaty—by signing a bit of paper. By signing that paper he is going to stop all droughts in the future. Never mind the disadvantage to Australian industry or workers' jobs. I might add that it will not have any environmental impact, because the big greenhouse emitters—the USA, Russia, China and India—are not restricted by this treaty. But he is going to do it by stopping drought and by throwing in $150 million. He does not say what that is for or where it comes from.

As I said earlier in answer to a question from Senator Eggleston, when I looked very closely at the data I was very concerned about the inequity of access and affordability for people on very low incomes, particularly people who had health care cards. Labor had never cared about that—they had done nothing about it. We inherited, as I have said over and again in this chamber, a maldistribution of general practitioners—far too many in the city, where we had very high bulk-billing rates, and too few in the country and outer metropolitan areas. Bulk-billing rates were very much reflected by the number of doctors in those areas. Labor never cared about it. I will not be so unkind as to say that that they did not care about it in rural areas because they have fewer constituents there, but senators have a responsibility to constituents in rural areas.</para></talk.start><para>I found that there were people who had very low incomes who had never seen the likes of a bulk-billing doctor. It did not seem fair to me that someone on our salaries or on my salary could be bulk-billed in downtown Camberwell and that people in rural centres had never ever seen a bulk-billing doctor. We introduced legislation to increase the likelihood of people on health care cards being bulk-billed by introducing targeted incentives to increase the likelihood of people on health care cards being bulk-billed. We have done an assessment which shows that the vast majority of doctors, if they were to sign up to the package, would be better off.</para><para>I am not going to make a comment about people's views about paying for health. We have one of the best health systems in the world. For example, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme people with a health care card pay $3.70 for the most commonly prescribed medications which cost $80 per person per month. We have just introduced onto the PBS a medication that costs about $26,000 per person per year. That is the level of assistance that people are getting under our health scheme—paying $3.70 on a health care card and paying $23.10 if they are not until they reach the safety net.  </para><para>It is a very generous scheme. But it will be very vulnerable if we do not care for it and look after it and if we do not make sure that people understand the huge benefits that they receive from the taxpayer through the MBS rebate for general practitioners' services, through the MBS rebate for specialist services, through the PBS and through the $42 billion we are offering the states for their public hospitals. It is an enormous contribution to health from the public purse. Australians understand and appreciate it, but we all have to understand that it is going up at a significant rate, particularly the PBS. I call on the Senate to reconsider the legislation before the chamber and to look at the modest increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to ensure that all our health system—across Medicare, the PBS, general practice, specialists and public hospitals—is affordable.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11650</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is important to have computerised information in a general practice, and we are ensuring that with our practice incentive payments which go only to doctors who have been accredited as practice incentive payment general practitioners. That means they have to go through an accreditation process and be involved in delivering better health outcomes in terms of asthma programs and mental health programs, which the Labor Party never cared about. They never funded doctors to deliver outcomes for people to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma and mental health. The practitioners who have taken up the Practice Incentive Program do things like recalling patients for pap smears or for extra visits for their asthma programs. This money came out of the PIP program and it was to assist doctors in upgrading, entering or improving their data. There will be further funding for which they will be required to give evidence that they have used that funding and how they are going to use the future funding. </para><para>The funding was to ensure that we have doctors as up to date as possible to reduce red tape. That is an issue that they have been concerned about. We now have a task force in my department, with various PM&amp;C representatives, to reduce red tape. The doctors argue that, as these programs have developed, they have increased their administrative load. This will be reduced the more that they are computerised. In fact, I went to a practice recently on the North Coast of New South Wales. The young doctor there has computerised her whole practice and also the Practice Incentive Program. She said that she does not see that she has a red tape problem. So we need to simplify the Practice Incentive Program and make sure general practitioners are as up to date as possible with their IT, because we will then be able to deliver better primary health care and better outcomes. That is what we are interested in.

In May of this year, for some unknown reason, Mr Cameron decided he needed his profile raised a little bit and he went and, no doubt, sought out Mr Matt Price from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>to add to the situation that the coalition was trying to foster in its changes to both health and education.</para><para>Mr Cameron said that baby boomers made him sick; they made him want to throw up.

In fact, Senator Hutchins is acting like a wounded bull this afternoon because he clearly backed the wrong horse yesterday, and that has shown up in his salacious allegations against the Hon. Ross Cameron, the federal member for Parramatta.</para><para>If you truly believe the wild allegations made by the Labor Party and some in the media with respect to this government's position on bulk-billing, you will think that we have actually cut funding to Medicare. What nonsense. Those opposite know it is nonsense because it is on the record that the proposal is for a $917 million injection into bulk-billing and Medicare and to ensure there are more GPs in rural and regional Australia. That is the condemnation that will be on their own heads. It is totally inappropriate to say these things when they know the facts. I say `res ipsa loquitur'—the facts speak for themselves: a proposal to increase funding by nearly a billion dollars. But according to the Labor Party and those others opposite who oppose this proposal we are cutting or slashing funding to Medicare and bulk-billing. </para><para>With respect to the Medicare rebate, let us have a look at the record since 1996 and then at the record under Labor. Under the coalition government, the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation has increased by $4.20, or 20 per cent. But what about under Labor? In the last six years of the Labor government the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation rose by only $1.70, or less than nine per cent. Those on the other side were talking about hypocrisy; they should take some of that medicine. We stand on our record of a 20 per cent increase compared with Labor's nine per cent.</para><para>Remember that in Australia today seven out of 10 services to the GP are still bulk-billed. All Australians visit their GPs, to the tune of almost $2.8 billion last calendar year. I want to highlight the fact that we are trying to get GP and medical services into rural and regional areas. Under this package, in places like Ross, Oatlands, Queenstown and St Helens, in Tasmania, we are giving $22,000 extra every year to those GPs who sign up. That is vital for those rural and regional areas to ensure that those health services are provided. Why won't Labor support it? In towns like Launceston, Burnie and Devonport $18,500 is being provided to those GPs who sign up. Come on, let's get real; let's get support for this package. With respect to increasing the number of doctors, 234 new medical places have just been announced. I congratulate Senator Kay Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, on that announcement.

That is an enormous real increase as well as a numerical increase. In fact, in the next financial year Western Australia will increase its health budget by over 9.5 per cent. These are all figures that are on the public record; yet the minister comes in here and bleats about how she cannot get a commitment up-front from the states and about how they are going to fund the delivery of health care services. This is at a time when she is reducing her commitment to the delivery of health care services and is placing added pressure on our Medicare system.</para><para>In the year 1999-2000, which is the latest year for which data is available, the Commonwealth spent $1,227 per person on health services in Western Australia compared to $1,370 per person nationally. It would seem there is a bit of an underspend from the federal government in my home state. If the Commonwealth had spent the national average in Western Australia, then it would have provided approximately $30 million more for the delivery of health care services in that year alone. Similarly, in 2001-02 Commonwealth expenditure in Western Australia under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, another scheme that everyone should be familiar with, averaged $189 per Western Australian compared to the national average of $214 per person. So how is it that the minister can keep coming in here saying that the problem is always with the states, that they are not committed to the delivery of health care services and that she is doing such a fantastic job?  </para><para>Add to that the decline in bulk-billing rates throughout Western Australia. Bulk-billing rates nationally have declined by about 12 per cent. In Western Australia the electorate that has been hardest hit with the decline is the electorate of O'Connor where you are lucky to have access to GP services anyway, never mind being able to find a doctor that bulk-bills. Add to that the difficulties that people have in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. If you go further north than the town of Geraldton, which is only a five-hour drive from Perth—so you can imagine there is a huge distance to go after that—you will not find the delivery of GP or private health care services anywhere. Every bit of the provision of health care services is done by salaried doctors or through the public hospital system.</para><para>Another area of disadvantage that Western Australians face at the hands of the Commonwealth government is in the allocation of HECS based domestic medicine places—and I am glad that Senator Barnett brought that up. In the year 2000, for example, the Commonwealth government allocated only 125 commencing undergraduate medicine places to Western Australian universities compared to 148 places allocated to South Australia. South Australia, I do not need to remind you, is a much smaller size and has a much smaller population than Western Australia. The minister with great fanfare announced recently that Western Australia would be allocated an additional 40 places in the new round—20 to the University of Western Australia and 20 to the full fee private University of Notre Dame. An extra 40 places does not go anywhere near the number of doctors we need to deliver health care services throughout Western Australia.</para><para>One of the other areas having a significant impact on the delivery of health care services is the funding crisis in the area of aged care. In Western Australia the state government expects to pay for 29,030 bed days in the hospital system for care-awaiting-placement patients this year. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>11656</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This debate is supposed to be about the answers of the Minister for Health and Ageing to questions about the health care system, but so far it seems to have been an opportunity, firstly, for Senator Hutchins to make a fairly visceral attack on the member for Parramatta and, secondly, for Senator Webber to engage in some special pleading for Western Australia. I would prefer that the Senate focused on the real issues inherent in the minister's answers to questions today, which are the future funding of public hospitals in Australia and the future of the Medicare system as a way of Australians being able to access essential health services both from GPs and in hospitals.</para></talk.start><para>What the government has announced in recent weeks constitutes, I think, the most significant platform of improvements and reforms that this parliament—certainly this country—has seen in a very long time. It has been met characteristically on the part of the Labor Party by a complete wall of deception and misinformation about what those changes represent. We have seen Labor claiming—and I have only this week in the ACT seen literature from Labor members—that under the government's reforms bulk-billing will be available only for concession card holders. We all know that is not true. The government is especially placing resources at the disposal of doctors to encourage them to ensure that their concession card holders are universally bulk-billed. There is nothing in this package that affects the capacity of doctors to bulk-bill other patients who come through their doors. Indeed, measures like the simplification of claims arrangements and the simplification of red tape associated with doctors' practices will mean that doctors have the capacity to bulk-bill more of their patients because it will be administratively easier to do so. </para><para>We heard the claim from Senator Webber that Senator Patterson is reducing our commitment to the health system in the payments to Western Australia. What absolute nonsense! The minister has announced $917 million extra for Medicare in this country. How is that a reduction in commitment to the health system? She has announced $10 billion extra for public hospitals in this country with the quite reasonable caveat attached to that spending that the states make some effort to match that funding in light of the fact that we have seen in recent years a number of states take the opportunity of increased Commonwealth funding to withdraw or reduce their own funding to their own services. Then they have the temerity to turn around and blame the Commonwealth for the declining availability of services in the public hospitals and in surgeries. Anybody who cares about the quality of health care in this country would have to see measures of the kind announced by the government as a very important step in the right direction. </para><para>I think that what the member for Parramatta was saying is that those who can afford to pay should and the government should target its assistance to those who cannot. The package the government has announced is doing precisely that. It is targeting those people who are concession card holders and providing them with the access to GP services which they are not getting at the moment. Let me remind members opposite that the decline in access to bulk-billing doctors is not a feature of this government; it has been a continuing feature since the earliest days of the Medicare system. It has been going on for a number of years. Access to bulk-billing doctors was declining during the Hawke and Keating governments as well.</para><para>What has this government done, not just in this most recent announcement but before that, to improve health outcomes for Australians? We have increased spending on Medicare by $2 billion, from $6 billion to $8 billion. We are investing $560 million in the Rural Health Strategy to target the health of rural and regional Australians. We have committed $80 million to an outer metropolitan program to encourage more GPs into those areas. Around seven out of 10 of all GP services are delivered at no cost to patients. Close to eight out of every 10 GP services to patients aged 65 years and over are provided at no cost to the patient. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>11657</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing. This is a government up to its neck in bad judgments and bad policies when it comes to the health portfolio. As we have heard today, the government has blown over $30 million by depositing an average payment of $6,800 into the bank accounts of general practices registered for the Practice Incentive Program, with nothing required or expected of them in return. The government argues that this money is to be used to upgrade patient record systems so that they are computerised. However, there is no mechanism at all by which the money will have to be repaid if practices do not upgrade their systems. Effectively, over $30 million has been handed out for nothing in return. This `no strings attached' payment, as doctors have called it, is just money for jam. It is an absolute disgrace. </para></talk.start><para>While the government hands out untied grants to doctors, the nationwide rate of bulk-billing continues to decline. In the March quarter, the rate of bulk-billing by GPs fell a further 1.1 percentage points to reach a new low of 68.5 per cent. Since coming to office, the Howard government has presided over a system in which the rate of bulk-billing by GPs has fallen by more than 12 per cent and the average cost of seeing a doctor who does not bulk-bill has risen by more than 55 per cent. Given these facts, $30 million in untied grants to doctors is an atrocious policy decision. $30 million would have been much better spent in funding over 1.2 million bulk-billing visits to the doctor.</para><para>This government has an awful track record on funding priorities, particularly when it comes to the health portfolio. It was recently revealed that $140,000 was spent by the government on consultancy fees to invent the Orwellian tag A Fairer Medicare and to sell the package to a sceptical Australian public. Those funds alone could have been used to support more than 5,500 GP visits. For a government that prides itself on supposed sound economic management, one can take little heart from the facts I have just presented. Moreover, the government has shown scant regard for the financial impact of its Medicare package, and is proceeding with it on the basis that it makes good ideological sense, not on the basis that it is sound economic and social policy. The government has failed to take into account when formulating its package the likely inflationary effects of the policy. It is blindly proceeding in the mere belief that fees will not rise, yet it has failed to produce any evidence or facts to support that belief.</para><para>As has been revealed, no regulatory impact statement has been prepared with respect to the so-called A Fairer Medicare package. This is another disgrace, given that the package is the most fundamental change to Medicare in decades. According to the Treasury, the RIS process is intended to ensure that a comprehensive assessment of all policy options and associated costs and benefits is undertaken. The information is then used to inform the decision making process. In that regard, it provides a comprehensive check list that outlines public policy decision making best practice. Why would the government fail to produce such a statement if it were satisfied the policy were financially and socially sound? I would suggest simply because it is not satisfied that that is the case.</para><para>This government's Medicare package is simply due to the Prime Minister's fundamental opposition to a universal health care system. During the 1980s, Mr Howard labelled Medicare `a miserable, cruel fraud', `a scandal', `a total and complete failure', `a quagmire', `a total disaster', `a financial monster' and `a human nightmare'. He threatened to `pull Medicare right apart' and to `get rid of the bulk-billing system'. Bulk-billing, Mr Howard said, was an `absolute rort'. The Howard government of 2003 is in the process of delivering on Mr Howard's 1980s threats.</para><para>In contrast, Labor's $1.5 billion Medicare plan will stem the catastrophic decline in bulk-billing and make it available for more Australians by immediately lifting the Medicare patient rebate to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee for all bulk-billed consultations. Labor would subsequently lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee. Labor would offer doctors powerful financial incentives of up to $22,500 to meet bulk-billing targets which are realistic and achievable and would provide for more GPs in the areas that need them and more nurses to assist GPs in their work. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Gambling</title><page.no>11659</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>11659</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to revenue from gambling taxes.</para></motion><para>I wish to challenge Senator Coonan on the issue of whose portfolio has responsibility for this matter.

It says:</para><quote><para>Although references are provided by the Minister for Finance and Administration, their content is usually decided in negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, conducted largely through their Treasuries.</para></quote><para>Clearly, the Treasury is involved in the Commonwealth Grants Commission arrangements and the minister should have been able to answer my questions.

It is outrageous, particularly given the Prime Minister's promise in 1999 that the federal government would take the lead on problem gambling. We have a perfect vehicle through which to do that—that is, the Commonwealth Grants Commission—but there are no incentives whatsoever for states to relieve themselves of revenue raised from gambling. There are no incentives to encourage states like New South Wales and Victoria, which have some of the highest per capita expenditures on gambling—there is nothing in the Grants Commission arrangements which would top up any efforts on the states' part—to reduce gambling revenue. We know that they are heavily dependent on that revenue to the point where the state government in Victoria has, according to reports, signed on for I think another 12 years with the two main poker machine providers in Victoria—a secret deal done without any sort of review of the existing arrangements with poker machines and certainly made with no regard for whether or not the states were beginning to deal with problem gambling.</para><para>We know it is a problem. The Productivity Commission said in 1999 that $3 billion a year was being spent by problem gamblers on gambling. That was the figure that so outraged the Prime Minister and encouraged him to do something about this scourge. He said then that the Commonwealth would lead the way. They have not; they have done nothing, in effect. In fact, from when the Productivity Commission report and the data on which that report was based came out, up to 2001 we have had a 39 per cent increase in profits taken from poker machines in pubs alone. We have had 10,000 extra machines put in two years after the Prime Minister made that commitment. It is an outrage that the government is not seriously looking at this question. There was a lot of hoo-ha and a lot of press when the Productivity Commission report came out, so we saw a knee-jerk reaction. </para><para>We cannot even manage to spend the money which was set aside for research on this subject. For two years the Commonwealth has been trying to organise a memorandum of understanding between it and the Victorian state government just to conduct research. No research has been done because we are still arguing about the arrangements for it. So that money sits in a trust somewhere. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth promised that it would conduct a Ministerial Council on Gambling and they would meet every six months. They have not met for almost two years. That is because the Minister for Family and Community Services decided to shove this off to an advisory body that she set up and stacked with industry people. She then said to them, `You go off and work it out, and come back and tell us when you have reached an agreement on how we solve problem gambling.' Of course, they could not because, as I said, it was stacked with industry people. Their interests were diametrically opposed to one another. It was never going to work. Finally, the minister acknowledged this in an estimates hearing a couple of weeks ago.</para><para>No action has been taken on ATMs. I congratulate, here and now, the National Australia Bank for withdrawing its licences progressively as they come due from poker machine venues. This is a terrific move but the Commonwealth and the Prime Minister promised that the federal government would start talks with financial institutions to get this under way across the board. We have seen one bank do it and they did it voluntarily. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>11660</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>11660</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus</inline> to move on Monday, 23 June 2003:</para><quote><para>	(1)	That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:</para><para>	(a)	the most appropriate process for moving towards the establishment of an Australian republic with an Australian Head of State; and</para><para>	(b)	alternative models for an Australian republic, with specific reference to:</para><para>	(i)	the functions and powers of the Head of State,</para><para>	(ii)	the method of selection and removal of the Head of State, and</para><para>	(iii)	the relationship of the Head of State with the executive, the parliament and the judiciary.</para><para>	(2)	That the committee facilitate wide community participation in this inquiry by conducting public hearings throughout Australia, including in rural and regional areas.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on Monday, 23 June 2003, from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm, to take evidence for the committee's inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Legal and Constitutional References Committee be authorised to hold a private meeting otherwise than in accordance with standing order 33(1) during the sitting of the Senate on Wednesday, 18 June 2003, from 5.50 pm.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ridgeway</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes that: </para><para>	(i)	over 20 000 hectares of native forest is logged in Tasmania each year,</para><para>	(ii)	Tasmania has the second highest rate of land clearing in Australia,</para><para>	(iii)	the level of logging of native forests in Tasmania is threatening the natural and cultural heritage values of Tasmania and is contributing to increases in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and</para><para>	(iv)	earlier this year, El Grande, one of Australia's largest trees, was damaged, and possibly killed, when a regeneration burn conducted by Forestry Tasmania breached containment lines in the Florentine Valley;</para><para>	(b)	condemns Forestry Tasmania and the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board for their regulation of forestry operations and management of Tasmania's native forests, in particular Forestry Tasmania's conduct of management activities and the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board's failure to ensure that a robust Forestry Practices Code is effectively implemented; and</para><para>	(c)	calls on the Tasmanian Government to: </para><para>	(i)	ensure logging of high conservation value old-growth forests ceases immediately, in accordance with the goals of the Tasmania Together process,</para><para>	(ii)	amend the Forestry Practices Code to ensure greater protection for the natural and cultural heritage values of Tasmania's forests, and </para><para>	(iii)	review the regulation and management of the Tasmanian forestry sector to ensure that forestry operations are carried out in a more sustainable manner and with greater regard to the natural and cultural heritage values of Tasmania's forests.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the following bill be introduced: A bill for an Act to subsidise students' purchases of educational textbooks when studying at education institutions, and for related purposes.

I am sure Senator Ian Campbell will be able to at least convey to the relevant minister the requirements that are being sought there by the relevant shadow minister.</para><para>To give one last example to make three that might be able to be attended to within this sitting fortnight, No. 27 relates to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer dealing with a ministerial responsibility order for production of documents. It is one that is now also somewhat old but still within the current period—it is dated 12 December 2002. It relates to a matter that is under the responsibility of the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan. I am sure that Senator Ian Campbell can encourage the minister to provide at least an answer to that order for production of documents rather than have me stand here and ask about all of them—which I will have to do unless at least some effort is made by the government to ensure that there is transparency and accountability in the production of these documents or there is at least some communication with the relevant shadows about how they can comply and what the problems might be if there is a hold-up. That sort of communication would be helpful, but if it is not forthcoming, I have chosen three at random that Senator Ian Campbell might be able to take on board and see within this relevant period if he can encourage his ministers to produce them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>11664</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the government for that quite voluminous return to order on Hill and Knowlton.

In my own experience—and I have delivered most of them—we have delivered interim responses where we know we cannot comply. If we know we cannot comply, our regular practice is to come in here, make an interim response and try to advise the Senate when we think we will be able to comply. If you read through the outstanding list, there are a number in there that have basically become irrelevant by the passage of time. Perhaps one of the things we need to look at is a procedure for clearing these off the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. I am informed that you could use a resolution to clear this material. </para></talk.start><para>In particular, No. 27, which is in relation to Senator Coonan, related to events that in my mind seem to have been resolved many months ago. I also note that on page 37 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> there is a list of outstanding orders from previous parliaments. One that comes to my attention is from 23 May 2001 and relates to HIH insurance. This is a notice that relates to events that were obviously very topical at that time and that have since been investigated by a royal commission. They were the subject of extensive investigation by the royal commission, an extensive and excellent expert report and announcements by the government to not only change the Corporations Law but to see the corporate regulator prosecute many of those offences. It is clearly a matter that should no longer be on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. It is just a matter of tidying it up. In the general run of things, the government does seek to comply with Senate orders to the best of its capability and in a timely manner. There are obvious ones where we have not been able to comply in a way that the Senate would prefer. They are matters of contention that we have to deal with. No. 22, in relation to ethanol, is a continuing bone of contention for Senator Kerry O'Brien. I have had the wrath of his displeasure in relation to that one. I can say on behalf of the government that we assiduously ensure that the ministers are aware of their responsibilities and encourage them to comply as much as possible.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11665</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs References Committee</title><page.no>11665</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Meeting</title><page.no>11665</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MACKAY (Tasmania) (3.51 p.m.)—At the request of the Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Hutchins, I move:</para><motion><para>That the Community Affairs References Committee be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on Thursday, 19 June 2003, from 3.30 pm, to take evidence for the committee's inquiry into poverty and financial hardship.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Select Committee on Superannuation</title><page.no>11665</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>11665</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MACKAY (Tasmania) (3.51 p.m.)—At the request of Senator Sherry, I move:</para><motion><para>That the draft Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003 and the draft Retirement Savings Accounts Amendment Regulations 2003 be referred to the Select Committee on Superannuation for inquiry and report by 21 August 2003, with particular reference to:</para><para>	(a)	the extent to which portability of superannuation benefits already exists;</para><para>	(b)	the role of current, and likely future, barriers to portability, including exit fees;</para><para>	(c)	the desirability and practicality of the portability regime contained in the draft regulations, particularly in the context of the existing structures of the superannuation and financial planning industries;

As is the case now, general practitioners will be free to bulk bill whomever they choose—but for the first time, the Government will provide an incentive to participating general practices to strengthen the availability of bulk billing for pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders.</para><para>The Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003 contains measures to make medical services more affordable. The bill does this in three ways.</para><para>First, general practices that sign up to the General Practice Access Scheme will benefit from the convenience of new electronic billing arrangements. The new arrangements will be more convenient for both patients and general practitioners. If the participating general practitioner chooses to charge a fee above the Medicare rebate or “gap”, as they can now, patients will have reduced up-front costs. Instead of paying the general practitioner's full fee, then claiming back the Medicare rebate, patients assign their Medicare rebate to the general practitioner and only pay the gap. Patients leave with no more to do and no more to pay. </para><para>Secondly, the bill safeguards people covered by a Commonwealth concession card against high out-of-hospital Medicare costs that add up over time. </para><para>The bill provides a new safety net whereby the Government covers 80% of out-of-pocket expenses to pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders when their cumulative out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare services is in excess of $500 in a calendar year. Out-of-hospital services for which a Medicare rebate is payable covers, for example, services by general practitioners and specialists, ultrasound, diagnostic, pathology and radiation oncology. This new safety net provides an extra protection for the seven million Australians covered by a pension or a Commonwealth concession card.</para><para>Thirdly, this bill enables registered private health funds to offer insurance plans to cover all out-of-pocket expenses for out-of-hospital Medicare services in excess of $1000 in a calendar year. </para><para>This new private health insurance product will cover the same wide range of Medicare funded services as the concessional safety-net. </para><para>The Government's 30% Rebate on private health insurance will apply to these new health insurance products.

Labor supports strong security laws to protect the Australian people from international terrorist threats. That has been Labor's consistent position since March 2002, when the first antiterrorism bills were introduced into parliament. It is just over 21 months since the tragic events of 11 September 2001 in the USA. It is just over eight months since the terrorist atrocity in Bali on 12 October 2002. Labor strongly supports the activities of our police and intelligence agencies in targeting terrorists and protecting Australians from terrorism. In particular, we support the work of Australia's police and intelligence agencies along with support from other countries in targeting terrorism in our region. International cooperation is the most effective weapon against international terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>We support the extra resources provided to our intelligence agencies in the budget. Their ongoing work is an essential part of our defence against terrorism, and the opposition welcomes extra resources being provided to them. Now that the newest form of international terrorism has shown its ugly face, we support sensible enhancements to ASIO's powers to question people and to gather intelligence in relation to potential terrorist acts.</para><para>The threat of terrorism has brought home the realisation that distance from the front line is no guarantee of safety. In fact, there is no front line against terrorism. Labor has consistently argued that ASIO needed new powers. We made that clear from the outset. Our starting point in considering the ASIO bill was to ensure the right balance was struck between taking effective measures against terrorists and preserving Australia's hard-won democratic freedoms. Unfortunately, the government's starting point was very different. If they had taken a more responsible and less political approach, the ASIO bill would not have been as controversial as it has been and ASIO would have been on the job with its new powers 12 months ago.</para><para>To illustrate my point, I would like to remind the Senate of what the provisions of the ASIO bill were when the bill was introduced on 21 March 2002—that is, what the government said it really wanted. The original bill did not place any age restrictions on who may be detained by ASIO. It would have allowed ASIO to indefinitely detain any Australian without charge or even suspicion. While detained, they could be strip searched, questioned for unlimited periods and prevented from contacting—even to say that they had been detained—family members, their employer or even a lawyer. I remind the Senate that, under the government's original ASIO bill, a 10-year-old girl could have been held in detention by ASIO in secret and alone. The only concession was that a child's parent would have to be present for the strip search. The parent would then have to leave, and they did not have the right to be present during questioning. What a farcical proposal! That was an unbelievable position for the government to propose. One can only wonder why such an irresponsible position was even written down, let alone presented as government legislation. The detention would have been in secret and ASIO's handling of these new powers would also have been kept a secret. There were no proper review mechanisms and no review by the courts. </para><para>It is fair to say the original ASIO bill was perhaps the worst drafted bill ever introduced into the Australian parliament. It would have given ASIO extraordinary powers with almost no safeguards. It would have made ASIO more like a secret police force than a specialist intelligence agency. The government's original ASIO bill proposed that people could be detained indefinitely incommunicado without access to legal advice. No other comparable Western country permits citizens who are not suspected of any offence to be detained in secret without access to a lawyer. Why would Australia permit such a thing? Quite reasonably, Labor asked: should we stop innocent people who are not even suspected of an offence having a lawyer when murder suspects or terrorists can have a lawyer while being questioned? Our answer was a resounding no. The United States and Britain do not, and Australia certainly should not. We rejected the government's incommunicado detention regime and insisted that anyone being questioned by ASIO should have access to legal advice for the duration of questioning.</para><para>Two scathing bipartisan committee reports in 2002 brought the government closer to reality on the ASIO bill. When the ASIO bill was debated in December 2002, gone from the bill was the power for ASIO to detain and strip search young children, gone was the complete denial of legal representation and gone was the capacity for ASIO to hold someone indefinitely in secret. But there were still some serious problems in the bill debated by both houses in December 2002, namely the absence of a sunset clause, the supervision of questioning by a legal officer of little standing, the absence of written protocols governing how questioning would be conducted and, importantly, the absence of guaranteed legal representation. </para><para>In December 2002 the Senate offered the government significantly enhanced powers for ASIO, with a tough new questioning regime and equally strong protections for Australians who might find themselves subject to those powers. The Senate's main concerns were in relation to access to legal advice, the structure of the questioning regime and the exposure of young children to ASIO questioning. Yet, as the ASIO bill stood in March 2003, only three months ago, the government still did not want people being questioned by ASIO to have access to legal advice for the first two days of their detention. It still wanted to keep them in secret. This approach would compromise one of the fundamental principles of our system of justice: the right to legal advice of choice when being questioned. We are glad the government has now come to its senses on this matter.</para><para>The opposition argued that the period and conditions of questioning should be comparable to those permitted under the Crimes Act and to those used by other agencies whose task is to investigate crime. We proposed an alternative compulsory questioning regime which, in the most extreme circumstances, would allow for a person to be questioned for up to 20 hours. We made it clear that it was 20 hours of actual questioning which could, once breaks for rest, meals and legal advice were taken into account, add up to more than two days in custody in an exceptional case. We welcome the government's changed approach on this matter and support the government's proposal for questioning to be conducted, if absolutely necessary, over three separate eight-hour questioning periods. I note that, according to the protocols, the maximum period of continuous questioning would be limited to four hours with breaks for meals, rest and other normal personal requirements. However, we do not believe the maximum period of detention should be seven days. Given that the absolute maximum time for questioning sessions would be 24 hours, the opposition think it far more reasonable to set the maximum time for detention at 72 hours. Such a period would allow for sufficient rest for the subject during questioning and would also allow ASIO to cross-check and analyse the information provided. The opposition will be moving an amendment to set the maximum time for detention at 72 hours. </para><para>Labor did not accept that the government's incommunicado detention regime should apply to children. The initial proposal by the government had no age limit for detention and provided for strip searching of children as young as 10. Under pressure from the scathing bipartisan parliamentary committee report, the government revised the ASIO bill to put in place a lower age limit for detention of 14. The government claimed, in a two-hour burst of histrionics on 12 December last year, that Labor's approach in the Senate was wrecking the bill. We all saw the mock fury coming from Mr Howard, Senator Ellison and even Attorney-General Williams, but it was just so much political bluster as the government's bottom line on the ASIO bill has become clearer.</para><para>The government has tried to play politics with the ASIO bill and it has failed. Sensible and balanced editorials in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> on 16 December and the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on the 17 December dismissed the government's assertions. Numerous independent observers, including some of this country's most eminent lawyers were similarly appalled by the government's approach and argued that the government should have accepted sensible modifications to its bill. Let there be no misunderstanding: the Howard government deliberately passed up the opportunity on 13 December to give ASIO strong powers to combat terrorism with equally strong safeguards to protect our democratic rights. It left the public in the lurch for six whole months. The government has always claimed that the bill is both necessary and urgent. When it was introduced on 21 March last year, the Attorney-General said:</para><quote><para>The Howard government has been vigorously pursuing important measures to ensure that Australia is in the strongest possible position to protect the Australian people and Australian interests.</para></quote><para>The government stubbornly rejected sensible bipartisan recommendations from two parliamentary committees. The government rejected amendments by the Senate that would have given ASIO strong powers coupled with strong safeguards. I stress that the safeguards the Senate was insisting on were no more than those which apply in similar countries around the world. The government waited another six weeks after parliament started this year to reintroduce the bill. If the bill was so urgent, why was it not reintroduced in early February this year? Why did the government wait until the second last day before a six-week break to bring this bill on for debate in the House of Representatives? When the Attorney-General brought the ASIO bill back into the House on 12 December, he said:</para><quote><para>This is an important bill that has become a test of commitment to the security of the nation.</para></quote><para>Mark Riley from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> was spot-on when, on 7 March, he wrote:</para><quote><para>It is clear the Government has failed Williams' test. Its chief commitment with this bill has been the security of its future electoral options.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister said on 13 December:</para><quote><para>If this bill does not go through and we are not able to clothe our intelligence agencies with this additional authority over the summer months it will be on the head of the Australian Labor Party and on nobody else's head.</para></quote><para>In fact, the government withdrew the bill and then cynically waited for the full three months required to establish a double dissolution trigger before reintroducing it. In the interim, ASIO has never been so much in the media. Reports of ASIO activities over the period 12 December to 12 March—the three months the bill was set aside—were in the media on most days. ASIO was certainly very busy. During those same three months, what was the government saying about the extremely important ASIO bill—the bill that had to be rushed through by Christmas to protect Australians over the summer months? Nothing. The Prime Minister did not mention it once. The Attorney-General broke his silence on only one occasion when addressing a private gathering of Young Liberals in Adelaide—but that was it. Suddenly this supposedly very important bill slid off the government's public agenda entirely. </para><para>The silence of the government on this most urgent of bills speaks volumes. Once the ASIO bill was negatived in December, the Prime Minister did not want to talk about it. He did not want to talk about it because he did not want to reintroduce the bill until it met the requirements of a double dissolution trigger. Had the government accepted Labor's amendments when they were offered, ASIO's new investigation powers would have been in place before Christmas last year with strong and appropriate safeguards to protect democratic freedoms. Over the last five months, ASIO would have had the power to compel people to answer questions about possible terrorist activity. ASIO would have been able to exercise that power with strong bipartisan support. They could be using those powers today to gather intelligence that could help prevent a terrorist attack on Australians. Thanks to the government's bloody-minded and politically-driven approach, ASIO did not have that power because of the government. ASIO could not compel people to answer questions about possible terrorist attack.</para><para>Let me now turn to Labor's approach to the bill and the government's amendments, which have been circulated. The bill before the Senate, with the government's amendments, is a radically different bill to the one presented in March 2002. It is a radically different bill in many ways, but let me highlight just six of them. Gone from the bill is the power for ASIO to detain and strip search young children. Gone is the denial of legal representation. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone indefinitely. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret. Included is high-level judicial supervision. Included are three strong review mechanisms, namely: a three-year sunset clause; a review by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD of the operation, effectiveness and implications of the act after three years; and a requirement for ASIO to provide detailed statistics in its annual report on the number of warrants, questioning times and the prescribed authorities who were used. That report has been tabled in parliament.</para><para>The regime now being proposed by the government is more of a questioning regime than a detention regime. Importantly, there is no secret incommunicado detention. Labor has successfully insisted persons being questioned by ASIO should have access to legal advice for the duration of questioning. Labor has successfully insisted that young children are not exposed to this regime and that the age limit should be 16. I might add that 16 is the age at which young adults acquire certain legal freedoms. It is, for example, the age of consent. It must be remembered that only 16- to 18-year-olds who are suspects—not non-suspects—can be questioned by ASIO. We have successfully insisted that detention be supervised by former or current judges—that is, by experienced judicial experts independent of ASIO, independent of the government of the day and not vulnerable to political pressure or prime ministerial displeasure. We have successfully insisted on a sunset clause of three years. The government wanted their regime to continue indefinitely. A sunset clause will allow parliament to monitor the effectiveness of the regime and scrutinise any allegations of abuse of the regime. We have successfully argued that ASIO's new powers should be granted only for a limited time and that the necessity of having such powers on the statute books should be reassessed at regular intervals.  </para><para>With the amendments we are moving today, the government has the opportunity to consider some outstanding matters covering the detention period: an appropriate offence to deal with unauthorised disclosure of information, the removal of the reversal of the onus of proof in relation to two of the offences, and technical amendments dealing with lawyers and the onus of proof. But I want to be up-front about our approach to this bill now that the government has made such significant compromises. Labor's bottom line is that Australia's national security should be above party politics. Labor has not played politics with the ASIO bill at any time, and we are not about to start now. </para><para>We have argued for significant changes to the bill and significant changes have been made. These changes will ensure even greater confidence in the community in the operation of ASIO's new powers. We would still prefer other changes to this bill and we will propose amendments to achieve an even better outcome. But I make it clear that the opposition will not be insisting on its amendments if the government rejects them. We are urging the government to go the extra yard and address the areas of concern which still remain. Given that we will not be insisting on the amendments, I acknowledge that there is no political necessity for the government to do so. But we want the government to give those matters serious consideration—they are serious amendments moved in good faith in an attempt to wrap up over 15 months of heated debate with a more bipartisan bill. </para><para>The opposition supports strong, balanced security laws to protect the Australian people from international terrorist threats. We support strengthening the capacity of ASIO to investigate potential terrorist activity. Although the government's proposals do not include every safeguard we would want included, we recognise that the bill now before the Senate is a massive improvement on the bill that was originally proposed in March 2002. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> It is a radically different bill. I urge the government now to go the extra yard and address the areas of concern which still remain. I hope that the government will see the sense of Labor's amendments, and I commend this approach to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>11673</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In December last year, the government urged the parliament to pass the <inline ref="R1763">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, which is once again before us, albeit altered somewhat, claiming that it was desperately needed to protect the Australian community over the summer months. As we know, the bill was not then passed and Australians remained safe from terrorism nonetheless. In saying this, I do not want to suggest that we should take our safety for granted or fail to recognise that terrorism is random, indiscriminate and brutal. There is no doubt that terrorism presents a very real threat to the Australian community and that, as a parliament, we have a responsibility or a duty to think carefully about how our decisions impact upon the safety and security of all citizens. But the government's pre-Christmas warning illustrates the way in which it has sought to radically increase its powers since the tragic events of September 11 two years ago. </para></talk.start><para>Of course, events like September 11 and the subsequent Bali bombings frighten the community. They remind us of the unpredictability of terrorism and the fact that Australians are not exempt or immune from such tragedies. But, instead of seeking to alleviate this sense of insecurity, the Howard government has exploited that fear to some degree in a quest for increased powers. It has tried to frighten us into believing that we must sacrifice our fundamental rights and liberties in order to be safe. The truth is that human rights and civil liberties were established precisely to protect us from threats to life and freedom. A world in which rights and liberties are respected is a world better equipped to meet the threat of terrorism.</para><para>One of the important themes to emerge from a number of submissions to the committee's inquiry into this bill was that if the government intended to mount such an assault on the rights and liberties of Australians then it bore the burden of proof to demonstrate why this was absolutely necessary. In other words, it was for the government to show exactly why it needed these powers and how they would help to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism. More than a year after this bill was first introduced, the government has still not discharged this burden. Perhaps this is because it simply cannot demonstrate a genuine need for such unprecedented and draconian powers. The fact is that this legislation is not necessary to protect Australians from terrorism.</para><para>That is not to deny the need for Australia to seriously examine and assess its intelligence capabilities. Of course our intelligence agencies must be able to operate effectively to protect the safety and welfare of the community. But increasing their powers in the manner set out in this legislation is not, I believe, the answer. The bill before us is poorly targeted and disproportionate. It goes much further than any comparable jurisdiction has been prepared to go, yet the government has presented no compelling case as to why this is necessary. </para><para>In a presentation hosted by the Parliamentary Library last year, Professor George Williams warned that we should be wary of placing too much confidence in the ability of legislation to prevent terrorist acts. While there may well be a need for some kind of legislative response, we must remember always that the law is only one means by which to combat terrorism and that it clearly has limitations. We must adopt a broad and comprehensive approach when assessing the capability of our intelligence agencies to prevent acts of terrorism. </para><para>A recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> suggested that there are serious deficiencies in ASIO's ability to protect Australia against terrorist attacks. However, the article did not highlight the need for more extensive powers as the source of the problem. Rather, it suggested that ASIO is suffering from a severe lack of resources. Surprisingly, the resourcing of ASIO is an issue that has received very little or almost no attention in the debate over this legislation. Without making any direct observation about ASIO's funding on this occasion, what I would say to the government is that it should be very careful that it does not seek to address what is essentially a funding and staffing issue by radically increasing the powers of ASIO's current staff, particularly when such powers will enable ASIO to infringe well-established rights and liberties, because that is exactly what the legislation does. </para><para>Let us look for a moment at some of the more disturbing aspects of the bill. Firstly, the bill will enable ASIO to detain individual Australians incommunicado for up to a week for the purpose of interrogation. They will have no right to silence and no privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, they will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they do not have the information ASIO is seeking, effectively reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, which is a departure from established legal principles. While detainees will now have access to a lawyer of their choice—subject to a number of conditions—there is no obligation to inform them of this right when they are first brought before a prescribed authority. </para><para>Foreign nationals who might be detained will not be permitted to advise their embassy of their detention. Those who require an interpreter will not be granted one upon request, but will have to rely upon the assessment of the prescribed authority. Of course, the government still wants this regime to apply to young people under the age of 18—indeed, 16 is the minimum benchmark. Although the Democrats do welcome the government's amendments to exclude children under the age of 16 from the regime, we still maintain that it is unacceptable for the bill to apply to anyone under the age of 18.</para><para>Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this bill, certainly from our perspective, is that it applies to every Australian whether or not they are suspected of involvement in terrorist activity. What this means is that, if there is a chance that you have some information that would be useful to ASIO, you can be detained against your will for interrogation. You will have no right to silence and only a limited right to legal representation. If you do not have the information ASIO is after, you will have to prove it and, if they do not believe you, they can keep you locked up for a week to continue interrogating you on this point. And all of this would take place under the threat of five years in prison if you do not cooperate.</para><para>This is not the kind of Australia most Australians want to live in. Like most Australians, I want to be safe from terrorist attacks. I want my family and my friends to be safe as well. But I want to live freely—with dignity and respect for the rights and the liberties that ought to be a fundamental tenet of a healthy democracy—not under threat nor under intimidation whether from terrorists on the one hand or from intelligence agencies on the other. I know that many Australians share this view. Hundreds of them expressed their very real concerns in submissions to the various committee inquiries into the bill and hundreds of them wrote to me or telephoned my office, as I am sure they did to other senators in this place.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party have expressed concerns about the application of this regime to non-suspects, and we hope that this is an indication that they will support our amendment to reduce the scope of the bill by narrowing it to suspects only. I would like to look for a moment at what some Labor MPs have said on this point. In the second reading debate on this legislation in the House of Representatives, Mr Melham said:</para><quote><para>Terrorist suspects must be identified, hunted down and arrested—but only terrorist suspects. Labor is determined to protect law-abiding Australians from grievous infringements of their rights.</para></quote><para>On the same legislation, Ms Tanya Plibersek observed:</para><quote><para>... it still ignores the fundamental principle that in Australia we do not drag non-suspects in off the street for questioning. Remember that these people are not people who are suspected of crimes; they are people who are suspected of knowing something that might help ASIO.</para></quote><para>As we begin to debate this bill for a second time, I indicate that the Democrats will give the Senate an opportunity to consider, debate and address what we argue is a fundamental flaw in the legislation. The Democrats will move an amendment to restrict the application of this legislation, if it is to become law, to those suspected of involvement in terrorist activity, and I will argue strongly for the Senate to support that amendment. The Labor opposition has made it very clear that it opposes the interrogation of people who are not suspected of offences. So I take the opportunity to challenge Labor to vote accordingly. This time round, we have the opportunity to address the most significant flaw in the legislation. So I ask both the government and Labor, but Labor essentially, not to just complain about the bad aspects of the bill but to help us to fix it up. </para><para>The Democrats will once again move amendments which seek to ensure that people who are detained will be advised of their right to legal advice when they are first brought before a prescribed authority; that they will have access to an interpreter upon request; that foreign nationals will have the right to inform their embassy of their detention; and that there are appropriate limitations on the way in which information obtained by ASIO can be used against the person who has provided it. We are committed to protecting the rights and liberties of all Australians, and this will be at the forefront of our consideration of this bill.</para><para>Once again, I take the opportunity to express the Democrats' disappointment that Australia remains one of the very few common law countries that lack a bill or charter of rights. The debate around the ASIO legislation is taking place in that vacuum. The government appears to be taking no action whatsoever to address this stark omission from our body of law. The bill before us illustrates clearly that the rights and the liberties of Australians are not inalienable under our present arrangements but can be overridden by clear legislative intent. It is precisely because bills of rights operate in other jurisdictions that those jurisdictions could not have enacted similar legislation, even if they had wanted to. There is no compelling reason whatsoever why Australians should be exposed to potential derogations of their fundamental rights and freedoms when the citizens of other common law countries are not. In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Prime Minister made the observation that it would be: </para><quote><para>... a terrible, tragic, obscene irony if, in responding ... to these terrible, terrorist attacks, we forsook the very things that we believed had been assaulted ...</para></quote><para>The Democrats agree and believe that this bill is a terrible and an ironic response to those events. It is misdirected and disproportionate. For these reasons, the Democrats will hold firm in our opposition to this legislation and heed the call of the many Australians who rightly have called on the parliament not to pass this legislation into law.</para><para>In closing I say in all seriousness that I do commend the government for their significant concessions. I acknowledge them and I acknowledge, in particular, the role of the Senate in bringing that about. It strikes me as important that, while the Prime Minister has in recent weeks criticised the Senate for its role and function, the legislation we have before us today, changed and amended as it has been over recent months, has come about as a direct result of the scrutiny, observation and intervention of the Senate. I do not think anything else in recent times—certainly during my term in this place over the last four years—better illustrates the incredibly important role that the Senate can and does play in modifying harsh legislation and in better voicing the views of the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11676</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak briefly on the <inline ref="R1763">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. It is very important and I thank Senator McGauran for giving me the opportunity to speak, because time is of the essence here. I cannot let Senator Greig's comments go without making the point that, while the Democrats might believe that we live in an ideal world where we do not need security services, we do not. We do unfortunately need security services. There is no legislation that we could possibly put up, Senator Greig—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—that you would find acceptable, because it would still be completely alien to the sort of society you might hope to achieve but which is not the case. Governments are about making decisions that are important for the Australian community—and, substantially, our political opponents agree with that. They have been helpful in putting forward a number of proposals and amendments, some of which we have been able to accept and some of which we have not been able to accept. </para></talk.start><para>This legislation will strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities by enhancing ASIO's investigative powers. The tragic events of September 11 marked a fundamental shift in the international security environment, and the more recent tragedy in Bali brought the realities of terrorism to our doorstep. The point that is always worth making is that the terrorist threat we are facing now is not a conventional terrorist threat. Where once we were dealing with people who had a political agenda, now we are basically dealing with people who for one reason or another do not like us, do not like Western values and do not wish to negotiate—they just want to kill us. Never forget that. I cannot understand why. One can perhaps justify it in some way. But these are not the conventional or traditional terrorist threats of the past that we understood.</para><para>These inexcusable atrocities show us that no country is safe from the devastation of terrorism and the terrorist acts that are inflicted upon people. You only have to look at the Amrozi evidence in the Bali trial over the last couple of days. It shows how completely out of line with our way of thinking terrorism is that he could have given the evidence he did. He said he planted the bombs in Bali because there were a lot of Westerners there and he disagreed with the way Westerners lived their lives. He wanted to kill people—indiscriminately. That is the sort of threat that we are dealing with, and that unfortunately is the world in which we find ourselves since September 11.</para><para>The government has consistently taken a strong, decisive and balanced approach to strengthening Australia's counter-terrorist capabilities. On the legislative front, the government enacted a package of counter-terrorism legislation—which all senators would know, as it passed through this place last year—to ensure that Australia, through our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, is in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. This was in line with a number of UN resolutions, which Australia was a party to—one example that comes up quite frequently these days is the government's capacity to proscribe terrorist organisations.</para><para>This bill is part of that legislative package. Its primary purpose is to protect our community. In developing this legislation, the government has been conscious of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly or unnecessarily encroaching on the individual rights and liberties that are fundamental to our democratic process. I want to make that perfectly clear. This is a very fine act; it strikes the right balance with the legislation as well as with the law enforcement agencies and the people who run the intelligence agencies—all of whom, in my experience, are first rate, well trained and committed and have a very keen understanding of the rights and liberties in the legislative program under which they operate. </para><para>In the process of developing this bill, the government has done everything it can to ensure that concerns raised about the bill were taken into consideration; the government has included significant safeguards in the bill to ensure that rights and liberties are appropriately protected; and the government has made significant amendments to the bill to address concerns that have been raised. For example, in an effort to achieve opposition support for the bill we have agreed to a three-year sunset clause, despite the fact that we definitely do not believe that a sunset clause is appropriate. But in the interests of getting the legislation through we listened to the opposition's concern about this and provided a sunset clause. It is messy, but it was provided because it is in the interests of the community that the bill be passed. </para><para>The opposition has continued to insist on amendments to the bill that would render it operationally unworkable. In an attempt to break this deadlock for the sake of community safety, the government has developed a set of amendments that address the opposition's key sticking points without destroying, we believe, the workability of the bill. These amendments are in addition to the substantial number of amendments that we have already agreed to in an effort to secure the bill's passage, including that the bill, as I mentioned, will sunset in three years time.</para><para>There are three main amendments proposed now to facilitate the passage of the bill. Firstly, there was some concern about the application of the bill to young people—namely, the ability to detain and question anyone over 14 years of age. The age minimum is no longer 14 years of age; it has been increased to 16 years of age. Secondly, there is the questioning regime. The amendment provides for a warrant that allows for a total of 24 hours of questioning in eight-hour blocks over a maximum period of seven days, subject to the protocol governing the questioning process. The existing significant safeguards covering the questioning process, including the presence of current and former judicial officers overseeing the questioning, will continue to apply.</para><para>Thirdly, there was understandably a lot of concern about access to lawyers. The amendment provides access to a lawyer of choice, with safeguards to protect security sensitive information and increase secrecy offences. There was a problem of course, when you are dealing with somebody in such a difficult area, in that unfortunately not all lawyers might be as trustworthy as they should be in terms of the national interest. We found a compromise on this and lawyers will be available, as is the right at common law, to give legal advice to people who are detained in one form or another under this legislation.</para><para>The government have shown yet again that we have a cooperative attitude and are more than willing to work with the opposition to ensure that Australia has the best tools to fight the potential threat of terrorism. It is certainly time that the opposition turned its focus away from political point scoring and worked with the government for the safety that this whole suite of security legislation, and particularly this piece of legislation, will provide.</para><para>What the opposition proposed last year and continues to insist upon would have rendered this bill unworkable. We could not accept that. Instead we have put together a workable compromise that will give ASIO important but workable tools to assist it to get on with its job. The amendments proposed in this legislation are consistent with what we want but they endeavour, in a sensible way without undermining the bill, to meet some of Labor's concerns. They are a further demonstration of our good faith and desire to give ASIO decent and workable legislation that is so plainly in the national interest. </para><para>The government are committed more than ever to the safety of the Australian community. We are committed to giving ASIO—full of the capable and decent people that it is—the tools that it needs to find out about planned terrorist attacks when it is most important; that is, before Australians are hurt or killed. We are dealing with people who will kill and maim indiscriminately and who do not wish to negotiate or think about things in the same way as anybody in this chamber might.</para><para>Whilst the powers provided to ASIO and our security services may appear out of step with the way that most Australians look at things, they are necessary. They have been tested and looked at and they are appropriate. For that reason, we have put together this legislation with its changes and amendments. We are very optimistic that the opposition will demonstrate that they are serious about national security and support the bill. That is my wish and the wish of government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>11679</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Greens absolutely oppose this legislation. The <inline ref="">Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> gives the secret agency unprecedented powers that cut right across time-honoured, centuries old, hard won rights which are fundamental to Australian democracy, our sense of freedom and the belief Australians have that our country expresses democracy second to none in the world.</para></talk.start><para>Today the opposition has fallen in line with the amended ASIO bill. It is remarkable that it did so unanimously—according to its own spokespeople—and that there was not one person in the Australian Labor Party caucus who stood up against this most serious erosion of these basic civil liberties for Australians. It is a derogation of the obligation of opposition—and not least that of a Labor opposition, which has traditionally stood in defence of the rights of ordinary Australians.</para><para>Government members might be now coming to the defence of the opposition on this, but the opposition today became a pale shade of Howard. The Howard government has moved to take up many of the precepts of One Nation—now defunct, because it had no breathing space—and the opposition has moved again to be shoulder to shoulder with the Howard government on this legislation. It is not acceptable, and the Labor Party knows it is not acceptable. That is why, extraordinarily, it had only one speaker on this bill, who said, `It has been amended. The government played politics, but we have fixed it up.' Let me tell every member of the Labor Party in this place: you have not fixed it up. You have caved in to the Howard government in this most serious erosion of the rights of Australians. In that way, you have caved in to what we all fear, which is that if we give way to terrorism we will lose our freedoms. This is giving away at the back door what we are trying to defend at the front door.</para><para>Let me predicate what else is to be said by saying this: there are extraordinarily strong criminal laws and surveillance laws in this country for dealing with those who might plot terrorism. The public has not seen the half of it. The surveillance reach given by this parliament to our intelligence agencies is quite extraordinary, greater than ever before in history—to watch, track down, listen to and assess people who might be plotting injury to the wider community. On top of that, through the Criminal Code, there are strong powers to arrest, arraign, detain and imprison people not only who may be acting in a terrorist fashion but who are plotting the same. They are very strong powers indeed. </para><para>What we have here is something different. We have now laws being brought against innocent Australians who, under this legislation, known to be innocent by the authorities of any crime or potential crime, can be picked up off the street or in their homes, detained and interrogated day after day—three blocks of eight hours of intensive interrogation—without the right of their legal representative to intervene and without the reason for them being picked up given to that legal representative so that any argument can be put forward to seek the release of this innocent person. Indeed, the right is vested in ASIO to veto that person's legal representative. So any citizen who thinks that they are free from the reach of this law had better think again.</para><para>You can be detained—and Labor likes this—not just for two days before a new authority is given but for seven days while this process takes place. And you can be a child under the law. You can be 16 or 17. I might say to the opposition: `You railed against that and said that children should not be subject to this law, innocents who can be picked up, but here you now have this law applying to 16- or 17-year-olds who are thought to be involved in some way or other.' That is a breach of the International Covenant on the Rights of the Child, a la the Labor Party, at the behest of the Howard government, in this great Australian democracy of ours, and the Greens will not support it—not now, not ever! The Labor Party might, but we will not.</para><para>Just today, for those who may have heard the<inline font-style="italic"> World Today</inline>, there was a report of a meeting of lawyers and community groups in Melbourne which made an eleventh hour plea to the Labor Party because they said that the legislation as amended will make Australia more like Stalinist Russia. Those might be effusive words, but let me go to the specifics. Nicole Bieske from Amnesty International, that wonderful organisation that works against dictatorships, police states, torture and terrorism wherever it might occur in the world, had this to say:</para><quote><para>Amnesty International is concerned that if this bill becomes law, innocent people could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, you go out for dinner at a restaurant. Somebody next to you, at the next table, is being surveyed by ASIO. You get picked up the next day because ASIO suspects you may have overheard something, and you can be detained for up to seven days because they suspect you might have overheard something at a restaurant that you innocently went to for dinner.</para></quote><para>She is right.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Give me a break!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Give these people a break.

Goolam Laher from the Islamic Council of Australia feels that the new laws will be used to discriminate against individuals in our Islamic community. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The Islamic Council of Victoria, as a peak Islamic representative group, remains concerned that this piece of legislation is being introduced at a time when the Islamic community is being marginalised and being treated and labelled as terrorist. It is quite clear from the reading of the bill that the word `terrorism' is a non-neutral term and already there are those stereotypes that are in fact making the connection between terrorism and Islam, yet the government has not addressed those issues and have not approached the community or the Islamic community on the need to address those issues. How would Islamic women be treated? Will they be undressed in the absence of another woman? Will they be touched? </para></quote><para>These are very important fundamental issues for Islamic people and for many others. Are they addressed in this legislation?

She said not only can teenagers be detained for seven days and interrogated but also they can be strip searched. She said:</para><quote><para>The Government has, for a long time now, shown with its policy of detaining children asylum seekers that it does not intend to protect the rights of young people and does not take seriously its obligations under the convention.

It is easy to say, `These are difficult times, different times.' They sure are. We have been through a number of wars in the last century as well, and they too were difficult times for this nation. But this legislation is breaking new ground in terms of repression of time-honoured rights in Australia, which have been fought for in those very conflagrations.

The Australian government is cutting into civil liberties by taking up a One Nation point of view, and it is now being aided and abetted by the Labor Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It is a real threat, Bob.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Yes. The honourable member opposite says that there is a real threat out there. There is, and it has not been helped by the course of this government. It is important that we look at terrorism and it is important that we are strong. It is important that we deal strongly with those who would plot or try to carry out terrorism in our country. We have to expect that that is what is happening, and will happen down the line. That is why we have tough laws under the Criminal Code and under the laws which empower our surveillance community and organisations. There is a tension here between our freedoms and rights and the wish of terrorists and others to take them away. What I am saying is that, at the backdoor, we have the big parties eroding those rights in a way which is not necessary, given the strong powers that this parliament has already enacted, and which is not commensurate with what is happening in other democracies. This is a very serious debate, but the opposition present one person to speak in it. Why should they have more? They are unanimous.

Where is he? Where is his spirit? I am sure that he would be very worried by the process that has taken place here today. Where is the spirit of those conservatives who in the past have crossed the floor to defend fundamental freedoms in this country? It is not here. It is en bloc; that bloc and this bloc creates one bloc. That is why it is essential that we see alternative voices available here to make the defence and to put forward the plea that we are hearing from community groups and legal experts that the opposition should think again, that it should search its conscience. I am aware that this is one of the shortest—if not the shortest—speaking lists in history on a matter as important as this. Seven people are speaking in the Senate on this extraordinarily important bill because the big parties, having now got together on it, want to get it through, want to get it off the plate, want to get it done with. There is an attempt to do that today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The best the Australian Greens can do is draw out this debate in the committee stages. Senator Nettle has important amendments to put forward. I note that Senator Greig, on behalf of the Democrats, also has important amendments to put forward. They must be and will be taken seriously. It is not going to be a case of simply having this ramrodded through this parliament because the big parties want to get it off the plate now. Today is a very sad day and a very dangerous day for rights in our democratic country. I am appalled by the opposition. I am appalled by Mr Crean's new leadership. I thought there was going to be a difference opening up between the Crean Labor opposition and the Howard government. But the first thing we see is a collapse into one—an indistinguishability between the big parties. </para><para>What is going to be the outcome from the Senate today? I recognise that Senator Faulkner said they had got big concessions. No—I disagree. The fundamental problems in this legislation remain. The concessions are nowhere near enough. The Labor Party should be here with the Greens solidly opposing this bill. But they are not. Right across the board, including the journalists and the media of Australia, is a sense of enormous foreboding about the potential misuse of this legislation in the future simply because people have information.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—The ABC.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—No, not just the ABC.

So there will be universal agreement on that, I hope. Agreement is what we need to pass this legislation. For far too long in these times of international danger and national peril, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens have combined to ensure that this bill has been kept in limbo.</para><para>That is a very direct answer to one of the questions that has been asked by Senator Brown in this debate, the question that he posed only a few minutes ago. We have debated the contents of this bill for days. I well recall last year at the very end of the session when we sat for more than 24 hours straight and considered the contents of this bill as it came backwards and forwards between this place and the lower house and the debate raged. In fact, I remember you doing then what you promise to do today—to filibuster, to take up precious time—in terms of preventing this parliament from enacting a bill that is as important as this. That is one of the answers. It is your right to do what you have promised to do. Nobody, including me, will ever deny you that right. I am a true democrat to that extent. What I say in response to you, Senator Brown, is that this bill has been debated ad nauseam. What we are now doing is putting the final touches to it after extensive consultation that you claim has not occurred. We are now proceeding with finalising the bill.</para><para>It could be expected that the Democrats and the Greens would fail to see—no pun intended—the wood for the trees. On their record, they certainly would not believe that the famous Clausewitz maxim—if you entrench yourself behind strong fortifications, you compel the enemy to seek a solution elsewhere—has any currency today. But the Labor Party, being a party of government, certainly does, even if for political reasons today it might prefer to pretend by its action that deadly serious security issues do not exist or are less major than most people believe and the evidence would indicate. That makes the position the Labor Party took on this bill—together with the Greens and the Democrats, I should add—and in the community contemptible. It stands condemned for opting for inaction over action. It stands condemned for having resigned from national leadership yet again. It was apparently too busy fighting its alphabet war—the ABCs, the BBBs et cetera—to spend much time deliberating on its obligations to the people in relation to the real one. </para><para>The amendments the government is moving to the bill now being debated should resolve that dilemma. They address the concerns that some people had put up that, in attempting to counter terror, Australia was forgetting its human duty. On this side of the chamber we never thought that this was a valid argument. Nonetheless, it is essential that this legislation be passed and that it becomes law at the earliest possible moment. There is direct evidence in that court in Bali today that whether we like it or not—and, of course, no-one likes it—Australia and Australians are potential targets of terror. In the nature of democratic politics—and it is, in the end, democracy that we are fighting to protect, as well as our lives—one compromises not on principle but on detail.</para><para>The government amendments substantially meet the demand from some quarters that young people who might be detained as possible terrorist suspects or persons with potential knowledge of terrorist plans be given special consideration. It will obviously not settle everyone's fears—that is obvious from the debate that has taken place here today. I see that in Queensland, civil libertarian Terry O'Gorman says the measures—under which the authorities will not be able to detain anyone younger than 16, questioning will be limited to three eight-hour sessions in a week and detainees would have immediate access to lawyers—are still unacceptable. That is a real pity. I hope that Mr O'Gorman's touching faith in the principle that one should avoid detaining young people even if they are planning to blow you up is never put to the test.</para><para>According to Mr O'Gorman, it is apparently surprising that we should be attempting to protect ourselves through the imposition of a law that does not exist in either America or Britain and where ASIO's equivalents in the US and Britain are not seeking such a law. That is of interest to Mr O'Gorman and others like Senator Brown as a debating point. But Britain and America have their own ways of dealing with deadly threats from the disaffected, whether or not these people are simply murderously or also suicidally inclined. The fact is that the sort of terror threat this legislation seeks to combat is very likely to be posed by quite young people. In the Middle East the average age of suicide bombers is less than 25. In fact, as Senator Brown would know, some are considerably younger. Some are of the age captured by the legislation we are debating today—some of those who would have knowledge of an impending outrage in the planning stage certainly would be.</para><para>It is plainly apparent, given the horrible and shocking events of September 11, 2001, in New York and Washington, and those of October 12, 2002, in Bali, that Australia requires additional protection against terrorism of the sort this bill would mandate. Only recently a report regarded in intelligence circles as credible was published in a Saudi Arabian newspaper that said that al-Qaeda had created a new operational structure and was preparing a new attack against the United States on the scale of the September 11 atrocities. That is the security environment which we live in. This is the reality—the reality of threat that we must be equipped to investigate and eliminate—with which we have to deal.</para><para>Australians who believe that their country or its interests—and Australian interests are, indeed, global—are somehow immune or at significantly lower threat from international terrorism are fooling themselves. It is an almost certain bet that there are among us people who support the principle of committing acts of terrorism and who in some cases are active partisans for their cause and some who are quite possibly sleepers—in the sense of being operationally inactive but ready to roll—on behalf of some organisation or other that would like to kill Australians and other people here in Australia. Australians today are certainly not a protected species. We know from horrific experience that not only do Australians face the same level of threat as any other people but also, as was the case in Bali in October last year, they are very specific targets. </para><para>The bill we are debating today is part of the essential upgraded suite of legislation designed to protect Australia and Australians from the mass murderers of the terrorist underworld. Much of this legislation has been passed through the parliament. There is general community agreement that, however regrettable it might be, in times of threat one must accept some restrictions on the personal freedoms democratic societies afford their people, for the sake of security. What has happened is that the government has faced up to the reality of the world security environment that was changed forever by the horrific events of September 2001.</para><para>Following the New York and Bali attacks, the government made it clear that it saw its first priority as being to provide for the safety and protection of the Australian people. This approach has been multifaceted. It involves not only a comprehensive legislative package, including this bill we are again debating today, but also appropriate levels of increased funding. The government is very conscious of the need to protect the Australian community from the threat of terrorism, without unfairly or unnecessarily encroaching on the individual rights and liberties that are fundamental elements of our democratic system—indeed, they are not negotiable; things that we would never surrender. The level of the government's commitment to enhanced security against the threat of terrorism cannot be doubted and should not be challenged, particularly by those opposite, who long ago abandoned the field of national debate to concentrate on their own party intrigue. After September 11, the government committed $1.3 billion over five years to strengthen Australia's domestic security. After the Bali bombings, this substantial outlay was reinforced by an allocation of a further $100 million.</para><para>Australia's domestic security arrangements remain under constant review. This particular bill was introduced on 21 March 2002. It was referred to both the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Australian Secret Intelligence Service and Defence Signals Directorate. The parliamentary joint committee reported on 5 June 2002 and the Senate committee on 18 June 2002. The Labor Party then referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee—this, of course, was a delaying tactic—and in December last year the ALP chose politics over community safety and rejected the bill. In doing so, it showed complete disregard for protecting the community in emergency terrorist situations. Thanks to Labor, ASIO still does not have the powers it needs to question people who might have information about possible terrorist attacks or to gather the details we need to prevent such attacks. Amendments originally moved by Labor would have rendered the legislation completely unworkable. The government amendments now before us represent a compromise that Labor has finally accepted—and I state for the record that that is good.</para><para>The counter-terrorism package, including the ASIO bill, provides our security and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to identify and prevent terrorist acts wherever possible and, if necessary, punish those who are responsible for them. It is also a deterrent. It sends a clear message to those who might commit or support acts of terrorism that Australians will simply not tolerate their activities in this country. It is essential to enhance the powers of ASIO to gather vital intelligence in this area of operations. When he introduced this legislation in March, the Attorney-General said: </para><quote><para>In the process of developing this bill, the government has done everything it can to ensure concerns raised about the bill have been taken into consideration. The government has included significant safeguards in the bill to ensure rights and liberties are appropriately protected. And the government has made significant amendments to the bill to address concerns that have been raised. For example, in an effort to achieve opposition support for the bill we agreed to a three-year sunset clause, despite the fact that we do not believe that a sunset clause is appropriate.</para></quote><para>Opponents of the bill have sought to create a picture of it as legislation that will mandate the midnight knock on the doors of innocent and law-abiding citizens by security operatives engaged on wild goose chases or acting on unfounded suspicions. Much of this criticism from outside the parliamentary environment undoubtedly is well meaning. I have received—and I know that all other senators in this place will have received—communications from members of Amnesty International making very reasonable points; we acknowledge that. They are points that one would readily concede were it not for the fact that terrorism is not a normal war. Terrorists are not normal combatants. The only rule in the war against terror is that there are no rules.</para><para>That does not mean we must abandon our law, ignore our commitment to human values or break the covenant we keep to treat people in custody appropriately and humanely. Australia certainly has a moral and legal obligation to uphold international law. It has an obligation under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to protect the best interests of all children. These are things that come naturally to any Australian and certainly to any Australian administration—and so they should. But we have an equal obligation to ourselves to ensure that Australians are as protected as they possibly can be from those who would do them harm.</para><para>I do not believe anyone really thinks that as a result of this legislation, or any other that democratic people could ever countenance, there will be goon squads running around our cities and towns arbitrarily abducting people who might conceivably be harbouring terrorist thoughts. That is not the purpose of the legislation, it is not the intent of the legislation, it will not be the effect of the legislation, and all those opposite—including members of the Greens in this place—know that very well. But at the same time, in the painful circumstances in which we must now contemplate matters of national security and personal safety, it is plain commonsense to require people in our country to provide any assistance requested of them by the security services. There are no grounds in law for concealing knowledge of a proposed criminal offence.</para><para>The member for Banks, the shadow minister for justice and customs, said in the other place on 26 March during debate on the bill:</para><quote><para>Terrorist suspects must be identified, hunted down and arrested—but only terrorist suspects.</para></quote><para>He continued:</para><quote><para>We must be diligent in protecting the community from terrorist threats, but we must be equally vigilant in protecting civil liberties and democratic freedoms from assault.</para></quote><para>I do not believe that anyone on this side of the chamber—or indeed anywhere—would argue with the words the shadow minister chose to use on that occasion of 26 March. But as well as life and limb it is civil liberties and democratic freedoms that terrorists seek to destroy. It goes without saying that international terrorism constitutes a far greater threat to the liberty of Australia than does the judicial application of necessary additional security measures such as those contained in this bill. </para><para>The shadow Attorney-General, the member for Barton, relied on the Magna Carta and Sir Robert Menzies for his defence of Labor's position. He even dragged Prime Minister William Pitt, the famous Pitt the Younger, into his argument. Chapter 29 of the Magna Carta—which is an assurance that action will not be taken to the detriment of an individual without due process of law—is of course a fine principle, but it is in no way infringed by the bill before this chamber. The Menzies quote he chose is from the speech the then Prime Minister made when he introduced the National Security Act 1939 after the commencement of hostilities in World War II. It is to this effect:</para><quote><para>... the greatest tragedy that could overcome a country would be for it to fight a successful war in defence of liberty and to lose its own liberty in the process.</para></quote><para>Yet in 2003—as in 2002, when the Labor Party first had an opportunity to reconnect with commonsense in this area, as had the Greens, the Democrats and the other minor interests represented within this place—the liberty of Australians is not threatened by legislation. It is threatened, in part, by people who may have information about a planned or proposed terrorist act and do not intend to disclose this to the authorities at the earliest possible moment and of their own volition. Some 200 years ago, Pitt famously said, as the member for Barton recalled:</para><quote><para>The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter, the rains may enter—but the King of England cannot enter; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.</para></quote><para>Today we are not talking about seditious thoughts. The very concept of sedition is one planted in an earlier and alien age and long withered on the vine. People can think and say whatever they want in our democracy. What we are talking about here today is risk. It is a small one—we hope—but nonetheless it is a risk against which the prudent will wish the government to ensure that, within some modern, Antipodean version of Pitt's ruined tenement, evil people are not plotting mass murder by stealthy and cowardly terrorism. With the amendments now before us, the Labor Party can finally reconsider its position and vote for this bill. I believe, from indications, that it is going to do so. Such an act would be a civil virtue on the part of the Labor Party. It will be a service to the nation and it will be good commonsense.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11687</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In recent years—and I think this is acknowledged by all in this chamber—life has changed in the Australian community, and we have certainly been warned constantly that our way of life is under threat. Just in case we forget that for a moment, we have many reminders, including fridge magnets, to be alert and alarmed. I asked a question of the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women today about the funding that came from domestic violence prevention programs to assist with the production of those magnets. Certainly it is a very different definition of `alert and alarmed' that some women in our community have to deal with every day of their lives as they fear male violence.</para></talk.start><para>I do not want to trivialise or underestimate here today the threat of terrorism. Many Australians have been directly and, indeed, tragically affected by it. But I do believe that there are some aspects of our response to terrorism that have been of grave concern, including this legislation. Terrorists threaten lives, but our response to terrorism can also threaten our way of life. On the line are long-established rights and freedoms and the important role that they play in promoting accountability and decentralising power in our democratic system. Since September 11, global leaders have relied upon the mantra that the world has changed—and indeed it has; no-one disputes that—but what has also changed is the way that we talk about the world. The threat of terrorism, although very real, is also vague. This has resulted in a widespread debate over how exactly we should define terrorism. </para><para>Following the passage of the government's package of antiterrorism legislation last year, our Criminal Code now includes a very broad definition of terrorism. It is a definition that implies the threat of terrorism—that it is insidious, pervasive and that we can be neither certain that any particular place is safe nor confident that even the person we are standing next to is not a terrorist. This is a message that has been perpetuated by the government's antiterrorism campaign. We are told to be alert but not alarmed, but no-one really knows exactly what we should be looking for. If the so-called information handbook is any guide to Australians, we should look out for people whose lifestyles do not add up or who may have suspicious accommodation needs. In that case, just about anyone can be under suspicion.</para><para>Of course, terrorism does emerge in many different contexts. Previous terrorists included members of the IRA, Anglo-Americans such as Timothy McVeigh, and of course Islamic extremists such as Mohammed Atta. Terrorism has been used in the name of many and various causes and terrorist acts, as we know, have ranged from car bombs to anthrax in the mail, right through to flying aeroplanes into skyscrapers. Clearly, terrorism is not limited to any particular cause, any type of perpetrator or form of violence, although, as we know, stereotypes have been rife in this context. Because the threat of terrorism is so nebulous, it can be drawn into and used in almost any particular debate. It can elicit fear among the community, and governments can capitalise on that fear.</para><para>Since September 11 we have seen this occur at domestic and international levels. For example, during the last election campaign we were confronted by the veiled implication that asylum seekers could be terrorists seeking to enter Australia through the back door. It is all about fear. Anyone who has been looking at Michael Moore's <inline font-style="italic">Bowling for Columbine</inline>, a popular culture reference, would recognise how our governments manipulate that fear. At an international level we have seen the desperate attempts of President George Bush to establish a connection between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in order to justify the illegal attack against Iraq. </para><para>This culture of fear perpetuated by some governments and some elements of the media has wide-ranging implications for civil liberties. In the past the civil liberties movement has benefited from a degree of cynicism that the citizenry has had regarding the state. For example, the greater push for privacy protection was, in part, fuelled by those conceptions of the Orwellian <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</inline> Big Brother and most conspiracy theories have involved the state in some capacity.</para><para>The threat of terrorism enables governments to deflect this fear to other objects and to cast itself as the protector of the community. In this capacity it could get away with a lot more than it could when the community was more wary of it. Here we are debating legislation which will enable the government to detain innocent Australians incommunicado for up to a week, taking away their right to silence and forcing them to prove that they do not have the information that ASIO is looking for. It is interesting to note that one of the reasons—and this has certainly been alluded to in the previous contributions—legislation similar to this could not be passed in other jurisdictions such as the United States or the United Kingdom is the bill of rights that operates in other countries. I recently had the opportunity to hear Ms Cherie Booth QC, who gave a speech on the British Human Rights Act and the ways in which it has been applied to address human rights violations since its enactment. She made a compelling argument for a bill of rights in Australia. Unfortunately, the government's record on human rights does not suggest it is likely to move on this issue for some time, if at all. This is despite the fact that Australia stands virtually alone among common law countries in its lack of a bill of rights.  </para><para>The ASIO bill is the latest example of this government's increasing disregard for human rights, civil liberties and, indeed, democratic processes. As we know, this government locks up those who are fleeing from persecution. Our Prime Minister has told us that these are not the kinds of people he wants in Australia. He cast doubt on the veracity on their claim for asylum and he argued that we had to go to war to liberate them from the torturous regime of Saddam Hussein. Yet this is the same government that has refused to support the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and, indeed, has voted against a motion to hold a special sitting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to consider the human rights and humanitarian situation in Iraq. When it comes to protecting the rights of women, the government has refused consistently to support the Optional Protocol to the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women—not a proud record for a country that, at the moment, holds the position of the vice-chair for the Human Rights Commission. Our government is permitting the United States to hold Australian nationals indefinitely and without charge at Guantanamo Bay, having concocted a new category of detainee simply in order to avoid its human rights obligations under international law and the United States Constitution. The government is also considering entering into an agreement with the United States to grant US nationals immunity from being tried in the International Criminal Court for potentially the very worst crimes against humanity. </para><para>In Australia, on the domestic front, our government is busy winding back hard-won human rights and those institutions that advocate and protect them. The government's proposed changes to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will severely undermine the commission's independence and capacity to protect the human rights of all Australians. The government has also cut off funding to the United Nations Association of Australia, which, as all senators would know, plays an invaluable role in educating the community about the UN, international law and human rights.</para><para>The government's appalling record on human rights was documented recently in an extensive report by the Australia Institute. The report demonstrated the pattern of Australia's retreat from a position of leadership on human rights to the position now where it routinely ignores criticisms of the UN, choosing instead to blithely follow the path set down by the United States in its support for unilateral approaches. As Professor Zifcak, the author of that report, states:</para><quote><para>Australia's commitment to the observance of the universal human rights standards and its cooperation with the international institutions established to monitor them has been one regrettable casualty of this emerging populist foreign policy position. </para></quote><para>Professor Zifcak refers to the political advantages of pursuing such a strategy when a pervasive sense of insecurity grips the community. This is exactly why it suits some, why it suits government, to let this sense of insecurity and fear continue. While it does, the government as a consequence is in a better position to increase its power at the expense of the rights and freedoms and the liberties of ordinary Australians.</para><para>We hear a lot of rhetoric about the need to find an appropriate balance between safety on the one hand and security, rights and liberties on the other. We have heard a lot about that in this debate, particularly from the government members. The truth is that human rights and civil liberties are not a liability in this so-called fight against terrorism. On the contrary, why doesn't the government view them as what they really are, and that is as a powerful weapon? A strong culture of respect for human rights will help to address the root causes of terrorism, not just their devastating effects as this legislation seeks to do.</para><para>The bill seeks to stop terrorists from committing terrorist acts. But we need to address and focus on how to stop terrorists from becoming terrorists in the first place. Evidence tells us that terrorism is more likely to breed where poverty and injustice abound and where there is little respect for human rights. So this suggests that one of the best ways of preventing terrorism is to seek to eliminate poverty and to invest in good governance and human rights. </para><para>Unfortunately, our government seems to be taking the exact opposite approach. Not only does the government continue to argue that human rights need to be sacrificed in the name of security but its lack of commitment to reduce the level of global poverty is appalling. Australia, once a leader in the provision of overseas aid, is rapidly falling to the bottom of the ladder. The United Nations recommends that 0.7 per cent of GDP or gross national income be allocated to overseas aid. The Australian government opposed a committee recommendation recently that the government lift its level to even just half of that amount. The Howard government is failing in its commitment to honour the millennium development goals, which aim to halve poverty by 2015. Our current commitment of 0.25 per cent of GNI is shameful and it does not reflect the generosity that has long characterised the Australian community, evidenced by of course the extraordinary personal contributions that we see community members make to humanitarian and other organisations. </para><para>So this government, coupled with its complete lack of commitment to the poorest people in the world, has now spent millions of dollars in waging a war, along with the United States, against Iraq. Experts say that the Prime Minister's decision to participate in the war against Iraq has now put Australia as the No. 4 terrorist target in the world. Yet this government wants us to believe that it is committed to protecting the safety of the community, surely the primary obligation of any government. It wants us to trust it when it says that these new powers are necessary. It wants us to trust it when it says that it will not abuse these powers. The decisions of this government have increased the likelihood of Australians becoming a terrorist target. Having put us in this position, the government's solution is now to infringe the rights and the liberties of all Australians.</para><para>Earlier this year I was fortunate to have a parliamentary intern. I am sure many honourable senators have benefited from the research work that has been done by interns in the parliament. Ms Philippa Watson prepared a comprehensive research paper on this bill and its effects particularly on human rights and civil liberties in Australia. I seek leave, Mr Acting Deputy President, to table a copy of that report. I have received permission, I believe, from the government, the opposition and the Greens.  </para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Thank you. Ms Watson's conclusion at the end of her paper was that the dangers of the ASIO bill are manifold and manifest. The powers provided by this bill could abrogate civil liberties, violate international law and would not necessarily increase Australia's security. That is why this legislation is bad. That is why even the most extensive amendments to this legislation are not acceptable, and they will not make the legislation acceptable. That is what people who are grappling with their consciences today have to recognise, because the legislation is based on a fundamentally flawed approach, a flawed approach to the whole concept of the threat of terrorism.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is not a filibuster; this is an opportunity to put on record my views, as other parties, particularly minor parties, have done in the Senate today. I hope to hear the rationale of the opposition to this legislation. I am proud of my civil libertarian roots. But by the same token I think any Australian, whether a civil libertarian in this chamber or a person who does not have a strong commitment to civil libertarian views, could recognise the warning and danger signs today. Any senator who has a commitment to those hard-won rights and liberties today has an obligation, a responsibility, to their fellow citizens to vote against this legislation. Shame on those who will not vote against this legislation. This legislation is an absolute line in the sand for Australians today and will impact on the rule of law, civil liberties and human rights. The legislation is fundamentally flawed, it should be opposed and, for that reason, I will vote against it in good conscience, as will my colleagues. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11691</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is vital that, in order to protect those civil liberties that Senator Stott-Despoja has referred to, we have the interests of Australia at heart. In fact, the <inline ref="R1763">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> is vital in order to arm our security agencies with strong tools to prevent and deter terrorism. We are not overstating the threat. Indeed, one just has to look at recent history to see what has occurred—September 11, which was referred to by Senator Faulkner; and, closer to home, the Bali bombing, which occurred only eight months ago. As well as that, there have been recent attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco which have killed people, some of them Australians. </para></talk.start><para>We are not overstating the situation when we say that we live in a climate where there are security threats to this country, and of course we have seen domestically where those threats have been present. So it is all the more important that we arm ASIO with the tools it needs to gather important intelligence in relation to terrorism and to prevent potential perpetrators from carrying out their terrorist crimes. This is not only about detection of those who have carried out terrorist acts but also about prevention.</para><para>I note that Senator Greig said that there was not really a need for this legislation. One can be only incredulous at that remark because we have seen in other countries, including those in our region, and domestically threats to our nation's interests. Of course, it follows that we have to give ASIO the powers it needs to do its job properly. The purpose of this bill, as I say, is to arm ASIO with the tools it needs to gather important intelligence in relation to terrorism and potential acts of terrorism. That intelligence gain can be used to intercept terrorists as they go about their evil plans or to capture the perpetrators of previous atrocities or simply to warn Australians against visiting the site of a likely terrorist attack. All Australians would expect that their government would ensure against this and advise the community appropriately. </para><para>It is pleasing that the opposition has finally come to its senses and agreed to support passage of this vital piece of legislation. Australia's need for optimum counter-terrorism capabilities has never been greater. Our profile as a terrorist target remains, and we have this country on a heightened security alert. We need to be well placed to respond to this new security environment in terms of our operational capabilities, infrastructure and legislative framework.</para><para>One thing which is interesting to note in all of this is an absence of a reference to the safeguards that we are putting into this legislation. At the outset, the Senate needs to be reminded of the fact that during any questioning which is envisaged pursuant to this proposed legislation a prescribed authority would have to be present. A prescribed authority is not just anyone off the street; a prescribed authority can be a Supreme Court judge, a County Court or District Court judge, a former judge or, as I recall, the President or Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So you are dealing with people of stature and integrity, and their presence during any questioning period ensures that there is the balance that we have referred to—the balance between the need to carry out the questioning concerned and the protection of the individual.</para><para>Although ASIO can seek other types of search warrants, it is not presently empowered to obtain a warrant to question a person. In order to prevent terrorist attacks, it is crucial to be able to question would-be perpetrators of terrorist offences or those who may have knowledge of planned terrorist attacks. One could be forgiven for being amazed that ASIO does not have this power for a warrant to question a person. After all, if you are in the business of gathering intelligence, one would think that one of the most rudimentary ways of gaining intelligence would be to question someone and to have the means at your disposal to do so.</para><para>This is different to arresting a suspect as you would see in the criminal jurisdiction. This is about gathering intelligence in order to protect your citizenry and to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. This bill establishes a warrant process to allow ASIO to question a person who may have important information relating to a terrorist attack. The government has bent over backwards to include workable safeguards in the bill and to consider workable compromises. In the committee stage, I will be moving government amendments which do just that. In developing our proposals, we worked with ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department to develop a workable compromise. We are pleased that the opposition is no longer insisting on the unworkable amendments which it insisted on previously and that it has now indicated that it will support the passage of this bill.</para><para>The amendments I have mentioned fall into three categories. Firstly, the government will be moving amendments to the current regime under which a warrant may be sought, allowing for a total of 24 hours of questioning in eight-hour blocks over a maximum period of seven days, subject to the protocol governing the questioning process. Secondly, the government will also be moving amendments allowing persons detained under a warrant to have access to a lawyer of choice, subject to a range of safeguards to protect the disclosure of sensitive information. Finally, we will also be moving amendments so that warrants cannot be issued in relation to a person who is under the age of 16 and may only be issued in relation to a person between the ages of 16 and 18 if the Attorney-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorist offence. </para><para>Clearly these are situations where the Australian community is exposed to grave risk. A young person who is the subject of a warrant has the right to contact a lawyer and to have a parent, guardian or other representative present at all times. Warrants issued under the bill will be tools of last resort. It is anticipated that they will be used rarely and only in extreme circumstances. I repeat the fact that, in the process of all questioning, you will have present a prescribed authority.</para><para>The government has gone to great lengths to ensure that the bill contains significant safeguards, as I have mentioned. In particular, it provides for significant penalties for officers who do not follow the stringent processes and safeguards set out in the bill. This is something that the public would expect. It would expect a government to take responsible measures such as this to protect the national interest. It would expect those safeguards to achieve a balance between the protection of the individual and the need for security, and of course it would expect that there would be significant penalties for officers who abused the powers which had been bestowed upon them. I will not go any further in relation to those amendments. Suffice to say that we have here a balance between what is necessary for the protection of this country and the protection of civil liberties in our community. I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator Cook)

As I was also saying, the truth as to who is right and who is wrong, where the money is and how much whoever should be putting in is putting in—the truth as to where all the arguments finish—is somewhere between what the states and the federal government are claiming.</para></talk.start><para>I certainly feel that the states should match the Commonwealth funding. Perhaps if this works—if we have the states and the Commonwealth putting in the same amount of funding and have that locked in—we might in the future see a reduction in long-term conflict and all those allegations. There is also then the problem of buck-passing and cost-shifting between the states and the Commonwealth, which wastes an enormous amount of money and resources. This can only be reduced, if not avoided altogether, if we involve ourselves in some serious debate and discussion about reforming our health system.</para><para>For a number of years now I have been advocating the need to restructure the system to a regional model. I note with interest that there is now forming a cooperative group of a number of health organisations who are also calling on the minister to look at restructuring our health system. It is still a very good system, but it is a system in which cracks are appearing. The system that I advocate is a regional system of funding for our health services. We would pool Commonwealth and state funds, and the decisions about delivery of services would then be made at a local level. I argue that this is a far better way of delivering appropriate and timely services and ensuring that the health dollars—often what few dollars there are when compared to what is needed—are spent wisely and in the most effective way.</para><para>A regional model of health funding would build on the strengths of the existing Medicare system by combining all government moneys now directed at health, aged care and community care into a single pool of funding. That source would bring with it increased purchasing power and at the same time eliminate the incentives for cost shifting from one level of government to another. I believe it would also assist in the reduction of administrative duplication.</para><para>Under this system, funding would be allocated on a per capita basis and also on a specific special needs basis. This would go directly to regional areas and they would then use the funds to provide medical, hospital, allied health, aged care and community care services for their populations. Individual communities could then respond to the specific health care priorities within their populations and focus on preventing future health problems. One of the problems within our existing system is that it does not reward prevention; it rewards or pays on the basis of treatment of illness. Some services would still be offered centrally—in particular, high-level care, crisis care for premature babies, intensive care facilities et cetera—but base facilities would operate at a regional level. I think there would be a far greater incentive and far greater opportunities for work force numbers to be matched with need far better than they are now. This regional model focuses on matching people with health services, not the other way around.</para><para>Going back to the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, I believe that the states should immediately commit to matching what the Commonwealth has put on the table and that the Commonwealth should increase the amount that it is offering to put on the table by the roughly $1 billion that has been deducted over five years. It is clear that this money has gone. If you look through the forward estimates, in 2003-04 it is down $108.9 million; in 2004-05 it is minus $172 million; in 2005-06 it loses $264.6 million; and in 2006-07, $372.9 million less is being offered. This is a total of $918.5 million for the Commonwealth which the government calls `savings'. I must say here, as others have pointed out, that this is a very similar amount to the $917 million over five years that was announced for the Fairer Medicare package. </para><para>In this bill there is also a second line of appropriations for projects or programs, including the Pathways Home program announced in the budget. I flag again that when we get to the committee stage of the bill—if we get there—I have some questions that the minister will hopefully be able to answer about the Pathways Home program, as the department was not able to answer them during estimates. There is also funding for mental health and palliative care.</para><para>I restate my commitment to an adequately funded, high-quality public hospital system. The level of funding in this bill for our public hospitals is putting them at risk. There is clear evidence that it is the responsibility of public hospitals to provide the broad, 24-hour, highly intensive accident and emergency services and the critical care services. That they have long waiting lists for elective procedures and often for a range of other treatments, including urgent cancer treatment, is not in dispute. There can also be a long waiting list for specialist appointments, and then you get on the next waiting list if you actually need an operation.</para><para>The Minister for Health and Ageing has had to go looking for excuses to make cuts. They are not based on facts—on the needs of our hospitals. She has been told by Treasury that the bottom line is the priority and that she has a certain amount of money to allocate where she can within her portfolio. Hospitals have been put under more pressure by the reduction in bulk-billing rates. As people face higher and higher costs, they are moving over to access the public hospital system. I am only in the process of tabulating the results of my Medicare survey—results are still coming in—but in answer to the question, `Have you visited a public hospital accident and emergency service because of the cost of visiting a doctor?' quite a few people in Adelaide have ticked the `yes' box.</para><para>Now we see through the reduction in funding for public hospitals that the hospitals are being put under further pressure by the government trying to repair the damage they have already done through keeping GPs' salaries low. In order to get GPs back in their surgeries with a reasonable level of income, we are seeing public hospitals starved. I will not go further into whether what the minister is doing in that area will attract GPs back into general practice or attract young graduates to study medicine and go on to train as general practitioners; that is for the Medicare inquiry. We will revisit that entire debate when that legislation comes before the Senate. It will give us some insights into whether what the government is planning to do is actually going to work. I close by saying that I support this bill, but I express my disappointment in, firstly, the continuing battle between the states and the Commonwealth; secondly, the reduction in funding the Commonwealth is offering; and, thirdly, the lack of interest generally in remodelling our health system to improve the delivery of appropriate services in a timely and cost-effective manner. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11696</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make some comments about the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I think it is crystal clear to anyone who has paid attention to the budget this year that the Commonwealth government has no new money for health. In fact, there is even less money for public hospitals. We knew that somehow we had to pay for that war—a war that so many Australians did not want. One way to do this seems to be for the government to provide less money for hospitals and health, forcing Australians to pay more for their health care. But what about the Australians who cannot afford to pay? As a participant in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, I know these Australians exist. They exist in numbers much larger than we would like to think. The Senate poverty inquiry has revealed devastating accounts of what it means to be one of the many Australians who struggle on a day-to-day basis—and that is without the cost of seeing a doctor or the cost of seeking health care.</para></talk.start><para>In contrast to the government, Labor consider the health care of Australians to be paramount. We promise to put up a huge fight—and we are putting up a fight—against any measures that unravel a system that delivers quality health care to all Australians regardless of income. Forecasts for our current health system are rather gloomy. You have probably heard it before: bulk-billing rates are dropping at significant rates, we are headed for a doctor and specialist work force shortage and so on. Patients are paying more to see doctors, and soon it may very well be the case that they will be lucky to find a doctor, unless we do something now.</para><para>On the north-west coast, where I live, people are having difficulties finding doctors because a lot of the doctors have retired and we have not been able to get replacements. The local hospital is getting bogged down with people who would normally go to see a doctor but cannot afford to see one or cannot find one. Those people are going to the outpatients at the local hospital. There is another forecast that I want to pay more attention to, given today's bill. The newly formed Australian Health Reform Alliance last Thursday, 12 June described our country's public hospitals as `struggling in a spartan environment'. I will come back to this later.</para><para>Let us turn to the bill in front of us. This bill will set the framework for the Commonwealth government's ongoing contribution to the funding of state public hospitals under the Australian health care agreements. The current five-year agreement period expires on 30 June this year, and the new agreements commence on 1 July this year for a five-year period. This is all very straightforward, and the Labor Party support the legislative framework. However, we do not support the level of funding or the way in which the Howard government has found this funding.</para><para>In its analysis of the government's budget, Access Economics said:</para><para>... the $917 million new spending on Medicare almost exactly matches the $918 million cut to public hospitals in the new Medicare agreement ... the Government plans to cut public hospital spending and divert the savings to initiatives to increase bulk billing under Medicare and train doctors.</para><para>The government is finding the money to fund its unfair Medicare package by taking money away from other health priorities—this time, our public hospitals. This is not good enough at a time when public hospital waiting lists around Australia have not decreased and we have not seen a reduction in the number of admissions to public hospitals since the introduction of the private health insurance incentives. Patients are still relying on our public hospitals, even though, as noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> on this bill, since the introduction of the private health insurance incentives, private hospital admissions have increased substantially. </para><para>Commentary from doctors suggests that, as patients are finding it harder to see a bulk-billing doctor, more patients are going to our public hospitals for immediate medical attention or are delaying seeing a doctor at all and then ending up in the emergency wards of our hospitals. At this time it is not a responsible or fair measure for the government to take money away from our public hospitals when they are so heavily under pressure. And it could be argued that it is the government's lack of commitment to the universality of bulk-billing that directly contributes to this pressure.</para><para>This pressure is being felt all around the country. Earlier this month, St John Ambulance services director, Bob Barker, commented that about four times over the past few months in Perth they have had to bypass one of the city's hospitals. On about six occasions all tertiary hospitals have asked to be avoided. This was because the emergency departments of those hospitals were too busy. Also, during one of the nights in May of this year, four big public hospitals in Sydney were forced to turn away all ambulances apart from those bearing patients with life-threatening conditions.</para><para>I use these examples—and other examples can easily be found—to show that our public hospitals simply cannot cope with the number of patients that are relying on them for medical attention. Our public hospitals need more money, not less money. Therefore, it seems very strange timing for the government to take away money from our public hospital system. Our public hospitals are surviving in a spartan environment and the effect of this unfortunately will be that Australians who cannot afford private hospitals and have to rely on public hospitals will receive a quality of care that is compromised due to this pressure.</para><para>And why are we taking money away from our public hospitals? To fund the government's unfair Medicare package—a package that will offer incentives to doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders only. In the eyes of the government, other struggling Australians without a health care or concession card can fend for themselves—and fending for themselves is going to be more difficult as the AMA has confirmed that, as a result of the government's scheme, doctors are likely to increase their charges. This package is going to make a visit to the doctor difficult unless you have the money to pay. The Labor Party looks forward to strongly opposing this package when we come to debate it.</para><para>Returning to today's bill, the approach of the government in its negotiations with the states and territories on our new health care agreements has not been inspiring. On two occasions Minister Patterson has refused to attend ministerial meetings to discuss the agreements. What could have been an opportunity for the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers to work on much-needed structural reform in our health system has instead been a lost opportunity. The Commonwealth government has offered an ultimatum to the states that will, in effect, mean less money for public hospitals. We are all eagerly awaiting the next meeting between the ministers on 31 July to see how this agreement can be resolved.</para><para>Labor oppose this bill today as we strongly believe in delivering better health outcomes for all Australians. We have a responsibility to ensure that our public hospitals are able to provide quality health care to all Australians. We do not believe that a bill that takes away $918 million from public hospitals is the way to achieve this. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11698</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to contribute to the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and indicate to the chamber that it is One Nation's position that a government, once elected, ought to have a surety of supply. It is on that basis that One Nation will support the bill, but we will also point out some of the areas of concern that have been raised.</para></talk.start><para>The government is removing money from health in one sector and transferring it into a different area. It is claimed that this appropriation will provide a 17 per cent increase in funding, but the states and territories have pointed out that it has been a decrease of $918.5 million. You do not have to be Einstein to work out where the money has gone when you see that the Fairer Medicare package is worth approximately $916.7 million. So why is the government cutting the health care budget and whittling away Medicare? These are two of the most common questions that are asked by constituents throughout Queensland.</para><para>The subversion of public health insurance and the deepening cuts into health care budgets are part of a global phenomenon, a worldwide trend towards privatisation of the health care sector. Canada, New Zealand, the US, the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Austria, Germany and Britain, to name a few, have slashed health funds in recent times and this government is slavish in following the trend. Multinationals are actively lobbying for the deregulation of public health care under GATS. They want to control health care, a very profitable and lucrative business. The institutions of the welfare state are to be scrapped. This is why health services are being starved of funds and this is why the coalition appears to be subverting Medicare.</para><para>The big stick is the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services. This agreement is transforming services such as health care into tradable commodities. Service sector jobs including personal services like health care could be sent overseas and provided electronically, while service sector workers can be imported to provide care for less money with fewer labour protections. Once a country commits a sector to GATS, it cannot reverse or introduce new measures that would violate the agreement's far-reaching restrictions on government oversight and intervention. </para><para>The government declares that it has made no commitment to GATS in relation to health care, but the running down of our national health care system is merely setting it up to be privatised via GATS. That is typical of what a government does when it wants to sell an asset. It lets it wind down to the extent that it is not worth saving and it is handed to the private sector on a silver platter—and then come the increases to customers. Transforming health care into a tradable good requires transforming the way governments structure and regulate it. When Australia signed on to GATS, negotiated under Labor, we agreed to make it easier for foreign service corporations to compete in the domestic market. Also, subject to a wide array of laws and consumer and worker safeguards, we agreed to scrutiny by international tribunals whose proceedings are closed to the public. WTO members agree that government regulations in these areas must not interfere with the abilities of foreign corporations to compete, even if such regulations treat foreign and domestic hospitals, schools and utilities as the same. It will not be long before GATS negotiators consider a strict test for regulations that could put the burden on governments to prove that health care and other regulations are necessary. </para><para>The WTO has already identified key health regulations as inherent barriers to international trade. For health care professionals, these regulations ensure quality and professionalism and more equitable access to services. To corporations and their champions in the WTO they are obstacles to trade and they must be weakened. Under GATS, rules on domestic regulation and licensing requirements can interfere with foreign workers and provide for competition in the service sector. To health care professionals and customers, the quality control and oversight provided by professional licensing of doctors, nurses, paraprofessionals and health care facilities is a key consumer protection. In order to achieve the trade goals of importing foreign workers and providers—we have seen an example of that recently with Telstra importing foreign workers under GATS natural persons provisions—the WTO has called for recognition of foreign licensing requirements as equivalent to one's own, even if the foreign requirements are substantively weaker. </para><para>Consider this in the context of the nursing shortage here in Australia. Provider associations will be agitated to import workers from overseas so that they can pay less. To the extent that licensing requirements interfere with the flow of labour, industries will be pushing hard for Australia to recognise foreign standards that may be lower. If GATS is revised so as to require domestic regulations to be less burdensome to trade and even pro-competitive, principles which underlie health care being accessible to all could be restricted. Cross-subsidising—through which one service effectively subsidises another—is such a principle. There would be no place for uncompensating health care, unprofitable admissions to hospitals, research, education or public health activities—all chronic losers from a business point of view. </para><para>What we are seeing here in Australia is the development of a two-tier system which is aligned with GATS. The for-profit sector will cream off healthy and wealthy patients, public subsidies and staff, leaving the reduced public sector to deal with emergencies, to train staff and to cope with the elderly and the chronically sick and poor—the ones who need health care more. It is not just at the hospital level but also at the general practice level. There will be one tier for people who hold Commonwealth concession cards and one for those who do not. This creates the likelihood of a two-level general practitioner system: one for those GPs who, through their practice demographics, either are forced to or can afford to opt into bulk-billing for cardholders and another for a group of general practitioners whose practice, population or business practices limit their ability to maintain a viable business by opting in. The policies of the current federal government are driving us towards a more privatised health system, leaving the public system as a very poor cousin. </para><para>The government is shifting costs and responsibilities to the private sector. The issue of cost shifting between federal and state governments remains unresolved. In Queensland, the outpatient and paediatrics clinics at the Maryborough Hospital have been shut down. Closing down these clinics means that new and follow-up patients have to be seen in specialists' private rooms or by staff specialists in private practice clinics. This is privatisation by stealth. Regarding pharmaceuticals, the Queensland government has encouraged hospitals to move patients out as day patients. When the patient returns to access the hospital, the cost of pharmaceuticals is shifted to the federal government. This is one reason why there are now such short stays in hospitals. Patients should not become yoyos as a result of the fiscal policies of federal and state governments. </para><para>The government may be funnelling money out of this appropriation and into A Fairer Medicare, but the doctors, surprisingly—and it is surprising to me—do not like it. I have contacted more than 2,000 doctors in Queensland alone, and the responses that I have received so far indicate that they are totally against the Fairer Medicare package, with the exception of doctors in remote rural areas, for whom it would be an advantage. The government's package would see the need to seek doctors from overseas who would be willing to practise for a pittance. Again, this is GATS in action.</para><para>As I commented earlier, as we privatise our hospitals we create a situation where corporations are forced to move or they choose to move into only the areas of higher profitability. We then end up with a situation where private hospitals provide extensively in those areas where there are considerable margins and the public sector are left to provide for those that are less profitable. As I said earlier, on a profit and loss basis, hospital admissions, research that does not result in a positive outcome and the education of our doctors and nurses are all areas of chronic loss from a business point of view. The government's attempt to shift costs to the private sector is not being done in an equitable manner. Only the highly profitable areas are being shifted across and our public hospitals are being left disproportionately worse off.</para><para>For ordinary people, this budget continues the relentless process of gutting public health in order to transfer vast resources to private health companies. One Nation believes that we must retain publicly funded health and publicly provided health care services. We must modernise and improve them on the principles of democratic accountability, effective delivery, adequate funding, fairness at work and equality of access. There can be no other alternative but to reject the WTO's prescription for privatisation—reject it outright. The message has been carried very clearly in the responses of my constituents that to save the public health system we must pressure our representatives to withdraw Australia from the WTO without delay and cancel our membership. It can be done. All it takes is an act of parliament. As I said earlier, One Nation will support the bill, but only because One Nation and the people of Queensland believe that, once a government is elected, that government should be assured of supply.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>11700</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to comment on the impact of the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> on the Northern Territory. This bill seeks to amend the Health Care (Appropriation) Act. It is, of course, the means by which the government is able to have moneys appropriated in this parliament and a means by which the provision of health care is provided, under a legislative basis, for grants of financial assistance under the Australian health care agreements. The amendments to the original bill extend the operation of the act for a second five-year period commencing in a few weeks time, on 1 July 2003. This bill enables the Commonwealth to enter into a new Australian health care agreement and, one would argue, to maintain funding to the states, pending settlement of any existing agreements. As I said, this bill provides the legislative basis for grants of financial assistance for the provision of hospital services or projects or programs that will be conducted during the coming five years starting 1 July 2003. This extends these agreements for a second five-year period.</para></talk.start><para>There are other minor legislative changes in terms of the administrative arrangements of this act, but the fundamental issue about this act and the issue that has been the source of much attention around the nation for the last few months is the appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund of an amount, according to this bill, not exceeding $42 billion for hospital services provided. On the face of that one might say that that is a fair amount of money and a fair commitment from the federal government. But if you have a look at the history of this health care agreement you will know that this is in fact $1 billion short of what the federal government had promised state and territory ministers. </para><para>I will give a bit of background to what this is going to mean for states and territories, not least of all for the Northern Territory. The states and territories have had many discussions and meetings with the federal minister, Kay Patterson—when, of course, she bothers to attend—in relation to the details of this funding. On 2 May this year, a joint communique was distributed by the state and territory health ministers. It says:</para><quote><para>Federal Health Minister Kay Patterson today confirmed the Commonwealth's health care funding offer represented a $1 billion real cut to the States and Territories.</para></quote><para>Of course health ministers unanimously rejected this offer at a meeting in Canberra on 2 May 2003, a meeting that was held to discuss the next Australian health care agreements. Ministers from the states and territories went on to say that in the federal budget this year there is an attempt by this government to kill Medicare and that the health minister has `tried to bury public hospitals'. The state and territory ministers have continued their fight for the right of ordinary Australians to affordable and accessible health care following the federal government's move to dismantle Medicare, as we saw in the announcements of the budget some weeks ago, and the real cut in funding to the states of the money that is to be appropriated through this bill to the state and territory health care agreements. Let us have a look at what some of the state and territory ministers have had to say. They say that the key principles that should underpin the Australian health care agreements include:</para><quote><para>*	Maintaining and developing Australia's health care system based on the Medicare principles of universality, equity and access;</para><para>*	Maintaining and developing the key components of Australia's health care system, including Medicare, sustainable public hospital-related services, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, aged care services and the public health system in general; and</para><para>*	Recognition that the policy decisions of the Commonwealth do not exist in a vacuum and can have serious consequences for State and Territory-based health services.</para></quote><para>In respect of the Northern Territory, the consequences are severe. A $1 billion cut from this health care agreement or $1 billion not realised as promised by the federal government—a federal government that has refused to ensure an additional $1 billion in its health reform package—so an agreement that consists of $42 billion rather than $43 billion, translates to a shortfall in the Northern Territory of $16 million. The impact of this government not realising its promises under the state and territory health care agreement is a shortfall of $16 million in relation to the Northern Territory. This government would say: `All right. States and territories now have to make up that funding shortfall themselves. They now have to put on the table a commitment for money to make up the difference. We have taken our hands off the wheel here. We are not going to take full responsibility for funding your public hospital system. You've got to find some of the money yourself.'</para><para>Let us have a look, though, at a profile of the Northern Territory. Eighty per cent of the funding by which the Northern Territory government has to operate comes from the federal government by virtue of the fact that we are a territory and not a state. In the other states, Commonwealth moneys coming to the state are around the 40 per cent mark. We in the Northern Territory rely very significantly on the money that is appropriated through the Commonwealth government. When you have a shortfall of $16 million in the Northern Territory, you have to ask yourself where or how do you find that shortfall when you already rely on 80 per cent of your funding coming from the Commonwealth for all services across the board. </para><para>The other thing in the Northern Territory is that there is one private hospital based in Darwin offering a very, very limited range of services. It does not offer an intensive care service or a neonatal intensive care service. It offers very limited services in terms of emergency procedures or extensive and complicated procedures. By and large, the fact that you have private health care cover in the Northern Territory can mean very little if you live in a remote community, if you live on one of the islands or if you live in a place like Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or Gove. There is very little benefit in having private health insurance. Therefore we cannot have an answer that simply says: `We will take the strain off public hospitals and encourage people to go to a private hospital—that is the answer. Reduce the money from the public hospitals and put the onus and the responsibility onto a private hospital. People will then go to a private hospital. It will take the strain off the public hospital.' It does not work like that in the Northern Territory—never has, never will—because of the lack of private hospitals, the lack of access to the provision of private services and the extreme overreliance that all of the public in the Northern Territory have on the public health system. They have a reliance on the federal government supporting them and committing to ensuring that the public health system is fully resourced, funded and supported.</para><para>Let us put on top of that the complicated layer of statistics we have for Indigenous health. I do not have those statistics with me here tonight—that will incur another 20-minute speech at another time. Everybody knows that Indigenous people rely very heavily on the public health system and the public hospital system. That is the only system they rely on. We know the figures when it comes to Indigenous health across a whole range of issues—renal health, diabetes, heart disease, rheumatic fever and even access to the provision of specialists to assist with a whole range of other areas. They are a total group of our population that rely 100 per cent on the public hospital system.</para><para>We have a government here that want to get state and territory ministers to sign up to a state and territory health care agreement that has $1 billion less than they had promised originally, which has a dramatic impact on the Northern Territory to the tune of $16 million. The states, as I understand it, are pushing ahead. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> last Saturday said that state and territory health ministers voted only last Friday to continue their campaign to ensure that this agreement is not signed and that they will press ahead with further discussions to try to get this government to understand that there is a need to ensure that the public hospital system and the public health system are adequately funded. I understand that, in relation to the $1 billion less than promised for health, the federal government are claiming that the extra money is not needed because the private health insurance rebate is easing the burden on the public hospital system. That is not an excuse, when you look at the profile of the health system in the Northern Territory and the reliance on the public health system in the Northern Territory.</para><para>Let us just take an example of what has been happening in the Northern Territory in the last six months in relation to health. We know that this year's budget—the 2003 budget—shows a withdrawal of funding from the public hospitals. It is already in the forward estimates, and it is to fund the so-called A Fairer Medicare package. Instead of recognising the pressure that emergency departments in public hospitals face, this government is diminishing the funding to public hospitals by $918 million over four years. We know that emergency departments in private hospitals are overloaded simply due to the fact that Australians, and in particular Territorians, are finding it harder to see a doctor who bulk-bills. Of course, we do not have an emergency department at a private hospital in the Northern Territory. Our people up there, everybody up there—Indigenous and non-Indigenous people—are solely reliant on the public hospital system. We know in the Northern Territory that 90 per cent of patients who are presenting to the Royal Darwin Hospital's accident and emergency section each night after the hours of six o'clock are presenting with non-emergency assistance—that is, the accident and emergency departments at the Royal Darwin Hospital and, more than likely, the Alice Springs Hospital are full of patients that present with GP related and minor problems. </para><para>The changes that the Howard government are proposing will simply place a further burden on our already overworked public hospitals. Parents with sick children are waiting at the hospital for hours at night simply because they cannot afford to see a doctor during the day or the few doctors who bulk-bill in the Northern Territory are booked for several days in advance. The situation in the Northern Territory is literally at crisis point. We have, of course, the outrageous situation where the shadow minister for health in the Northern Territory, Sue Carter, is laying the blame for all of this at the feet of my colleague Minister Jane Aagaard in the Northern Territory government and is suggesting that the new and refurbished accident and emergency department that was planned under the Country Liberal Party has not gone ahead and at fault is the Labor Party since it came into government in 2001.</para><para>As Minister Aagaard was able to reveal on 30 April during a debate in the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory, the accident and emergency section has been rebuilt and has been refurbished and, yes, there is a delay in opening it. It is not going to be opened in the coming weeks as planned, and why is that? It is because the Country Liberal Party were so inept and so negligent in their forward planning that in their forward estimates and budgets they simply budgeted for a building to be built and not for any ongoing recurrent costs. They put no money aside in the following years for staffing, airconditioning or equipment. The Country Liberal Party were only able to find money for a building. There was no money for forward on-costs, for forward operating costs. And they now seek to lay the blame at Minister Aagaard's feet for the fact that this A and E department is not going to be opened on schedule; they want to lay the blame for all of that at the feet of the Labor government in the Northern Territory. Not only is this is a Country Liberal Party that could not manage their own health system up there; they cannot even seem to manage their own leadership problems at this point in time.</para><para>We have a chronic situation in the Northern Territory when it comes to access to doctors and to services. People are going to the public hospital after hours because they cannot afford to go to a doctor. There are no doctors who bulk-bill in the Northern Territory who are taking on new patients. The situation is at crisis point. Therefore, in order to get attention for your children after hours for minor problems, you have to present yourself at the hospital. As I said, 90 per cent of the people who present themselves to the accident and emergency departments in Darwin and Alice Springs are not presenting because they have been in an accident or they have an emergency; they have GP related problems. In the Territory our public hospital is bottlenecked; it is crammed. It is at crisis point. On top of that, we have a federal government that wants to sign up to a state and territory health care agreement that has $16 million less in its bucket of funding for the Northern Territory. As well, it purports to have released A Fairer Medicare package that is going to relieve the burden on people in the Northern Territory. It simply will not. </para><para>I recently conducted a survey in Palmerston, which is a large city outside of Darwin, and although not surprised at the responses regarding the decline in the bulk-billing rate I was alarmed at the fact that 67 per cent of the people said that there had been occasions when they had deliberately not been to see a doctor because of the prohibitive cost. So 67 per cent of people were telling me that they do not go to a doctor because of the cost of visiting that doctor. So what do they do? They wait till after hours. They wait till after 4.21 p.m. and present at the accident and emergency department of Royal Darwin Hospital. They are prepared to sit there, along with 90 per cent of the other patients who turn up, for hours at a time to see someone. They present if they feel sick in the stomach, if they have the flu, if they have a headache or if they have other minor symptoms that should be treated on a day-to-day basis by GPs—if this government took hold of the health care system in this country, shaped it and formed it and produced something that was actually meeting the needs of the Australian public.</para><para>We have a bill before us that wants to appropriate money to the state and territory governments—$1 billion less than was initially promised—and the impact of that is $16 million less for the Northern Territory. As I said before, in the Northern Territory we have a situation where the Country Liberal Party is happy to point the finger at the Labor Party locally for the problems at the accident and emergency department, but those problems stem from Canberra. The problems are initiated here by this federal government—a federal government which is refusing to accept the fact that this agreement does not give the state and territory ministers the money they need to have a decently funded public health system, a decently publicly funded public hospital system. That $16 million less for the Northern Territory is a huge amount when it comes to looking after the needs of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people there. We already rely on the Commonwealth for 80 per cent of our funding. We do not have a private system on which we can rely; we are solely reliant on the public hospital system. This is a government which refuses to acknowledge that, refuses to fund the public hospital system properly and refuses to ensure that the Northern Territory government has got the resources it needs to provide a fair, equitable and accessible health care system to everybody in the Northern Territory, no matter the size of their wallet and no matter where they live in the Northern Territory.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>11704</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe I only have about 2½ minutes to speak, so I might just reply to what Senator Crossin has said. It is always interesting to hear people make comments—you can always twist things to make them fit the story you want to present—but Senator Crossin failed to acknowledge that, since coming to government, the Howard government has almost doubled funding to Indigenous health services. As Senator Crossin knows, a significant number of people in the Northern Territory—especially in very remote areas like Katherine and a number of other areas which I will not go through but which I have visited—have had their health services significantly improved as a result of the coalition increasing the funding and almost doubling it. </para></talk.start><para>It is very easy to come into the chamber and make quick, cheap points about what the Commonwealth is not doing without actually indicating what it is doing. Some of the other speakers here today—and maybe I should go into this debate in more detail tomorrow morning so that my speech looks a bit more coherent in one piece—have said that money has been taken out of the health care agreements. I absolutely refute that. The Commonwealth has in fact offered $10 billion more. That is a 17 per cent increase over and above inflation from the current health care agreements. How that can be taking money out of the health system beggars belief—a 17 per cent increase. It does not matter; the people on the other side still make the comment that it is taking money out of the health system. We actually gave the state health system a $2.5 billion windfall in the life of the last agreement. I have not heard one member on the other side get up and say that. They say we are taking money out when it is a 17 per cent increase over and above inflation in the next five years. How that is a decrease beggars belief. They do not mention that there was a $2.5 billion windfall to the states when we did not claw back funding, as agreed in the life of the last health care agreement.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>11705</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>—Order!

There was a significant victory on budget night—a further victory indeed for General Douglas MacArthur. The Howard Government agreed to provide $350,000 towards the development of the MacArthur Museum in the Heritage listed MacArthur Chambers site in central Brisbane. The other milestone was the handing over by the Brisbane City Council to the General Douglas MacArthur Brisbane Memorial Trust of the MacArthur Museum floor site. This handover took place at City Hall in Brisbane just last week. </para></talk.start><para>It was of course from the premises in Edward Street that General MacArthur directed the Allied war effort in the South-West Pacific during the dark days of 1942 to 1944 when Australia was under direct enemy threat and actual attack—and in my part of Australia, Queensland, particularly so. We must always remember our history, for history is not just a collection of dry facts but indeed the story of our nation's life. It is a proud story and none more proud than the part in which the Americans played such a significant and, indeed, a lifesaving part during the Pacific war, from 1941 to 1945.</para><para>Tonight I want to give honourable senators an overview of this magnificent project and also place on the record the thanks that are due to a great many people whose dedication, energy and fortitude have brought the project to its present point—and I will come back to that in a minute. I thought too that this would be an appropriate time to make some comments about friends and neighbours, about steadfast allies and brave defenders of democracy. It is an appropriate time too to say a little about the heritage that the great English, Scots, Welsh and Irish diaspora of the past four centuries has brought us. It is time to say something about how we 21st century Australians have benefited so greatly from the global dispersion of English-speaking and Gaelic-speaking people and the precepts that brought democracy and true people's rule to the wide swathes of our planet. We in Australia, from whatever background we may come, are protected by that heritage and, by our actions and our way of governing ourselves, we protect it in its turn. We are a proud and very effective part of that global enlightenment. </para><para>Sixty years ago, at a time of great peril, Australia and America stood shoulder to shoulder in the Pacific to beat back tyranny. The bonds we forged then between our nations still endure and will, I believe, endure forever, just as will our bonds with Britain. You might indeed say that we are part—a proud and independent part—of an enduring empire. The empire of decency, democracy and common law, the rule of law, the supremacy of the ballot box and the determination to stand up for those in peril from others are all things that we share. They are an indelible part of our shared history and common culture. Let no-one ever get away with saying that time and events have reduced these gifts we hold in common and in trust for future generations to the status of a historical footnote or the irrelevance of a marginal comment.</para><para>At this time 60 years on we are again shoulder to shoulder with the Americans and the British in defence of liberty and the global assault on murderous terror. The events that have so shockingly opened the 21st century add a particular poignancy and a pointed relevance to our celebration of the great cause in which we, the Americans and ourselves, made a stand together six decades ago. Projects such as the MacArthur Museum give a much needed and very valuable public dimension to these links. </para><para>On completion of the building works at MacArthur Chambers, the MacArthur Museum will be open to the public as a managed wartime display. It will be an integral part of Brisbane's Living Heritage Network. Public interest in and educational exposure to Australia's heritage, Brisbane's military history and Queensland's tourist sites are increasingly evident in both our own and the international community. This is indeed an idea whose time has come.  </para><para>The idea of course is not just to create a memorial to one fixed time in history. The MacArthur Museum, and indeed the whole MacArthur Chambers project, will go beyond a public display of Brisbane's involvement in the critical phase of the war in the South-West Pacific. It will add immeasurably, in my view, to the rich portfolio of sites in Brisbane's Living Heritage Network and social history. It will raise awareness of the heritage sector and its valuable contribution to the city of Brisbane. It will provide a focus on the historical awareness of visitors and the community, particularly our youth. It will provide a central point for military research and study. It will link sites such as the Australian War Memorial, Queensland's John Oxley Library, the Queensland University of Technology, the MacArthur Foundation in the USA and other military history related sites. </para><para>That the project has got to this point and will now move on to fruition is to the great credit of a large number of people. In particular, it is appropriate to mention the steering committee which is chaired by Major General M. Blake AO, MC. In the context of the steering committee, I want particularly to give credit to my friend Mr Geoff Thomas, Chairman of CapitalCorp Financial Services and, as well, Queensland's Special Commissioner to the United States, where his political and business connections are impeccable. Mr Thomas is truly a quiet achiever. He is also a very hard man to say no to, as will have become obvious very quickly to those he tirelessly lobbied on behalf of this great project. He approached me about the MacArthur Museum 2½ years ago and provided me with additional awareness of the project. Throughout this period he has pushed and encouraged me to never give up on pursuing financial and other support for the project. Those who value the MacArthur Museum project, I am sure, value Mr Thomas's interest in and support for it.</para><para>Also on the steering committee is Mr Geoff Rodgers, Managing Director of the Rowland Communications Group, who is deputy chairman. I have previously in this place recognised by name the other members of the steering committee and I again pay tribute to them tonight. In particular, I mention two other individuals: Lieutenant Colonel J.P. Dwyer AM, who is the executive officer, and the Patron of the General Douglas MacArthur Brisbane Memorial Trust, Major General Peter Arnison, the Governor of Queensland. I again recognise that the Queensland government and the Brisbane City Council have been behind the project from the start and, of course, so has the federal government, as has been newly demonstrated by the $350,000 grant made available in the recent federal budget.</para><para>The chairman of trustees is Sir Leo Hielscher, Chairman of the Queensland Treasury Corporation. The other trustees are the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Peter Beattie, retired US Major William A. Bentson, Major General Digger James, Dr Leo Keliher as Director-General of the Premier's department, and Mr Ken Talbot of MacArthur Coal. It should also be placed on the record that the MacArthur family in America has given permission for the family name to be used in the Brisbane project. Under the development program, establishment of the full museum is contingent on recurrent funding, although the refurbishment of the MacArthur Chambers site commenced in late 2001 under commercial developers. </para><para>Phase 1 includes the restoration of General MacArthur's World War II office and refurbishment of the eighth-floor museum. The MacArthur Museum project has a target of $1.7 million to establish the displays. For many years there has been public interest in providing recognition of the presence in Brisbane of General Douglas MacArthur and the headquarters of Allied forces in the South-West Pacific area during 1942 to 1944, a crucial period in Australia's history. The MacArthur Museum project is a fine example of the kind of historically based, built-environment concept that deserves full support and whose proponents and backers deserve full credit. </para><para>Also tonight I want to say a few words about another aspect of Queensland's indelible connection with the events of the Pacific War—the Bakers Creek air crash in 1943, which killed 40 people and is still, 60 years later, Australia's worst air disaster. Because of wartime censorship the story of the crash—it was an accident, not resulting from enemy action—was to all intents and purposes suppressed. It was suppressed to the extent that the relatives of the dead—Americans—never actually knew what had happened to their loved ones and even where they met their deaths.</para><para>In recent years the story of the tragic crash has been brought into public view, and strong links have been established between the RSL in Mackay and an American group formed in 2000, the Bakers Creek Memorial Association. The purpose of the association is to publicise the Bakers Creek air crash story in the United States; to assist the work of the Mackay RSL historian, Col Benson, to locate family relatives of the B-17C crash victims; and to raise funds to donate a scale model replica B-17C to the Bakers Creek Memorial near Mackay for the 60th anniversary commemoration.</para><para>The 60th anniversary went ahead as scheduled last weekend and I had the honour of meeting the American party here in Australia for that occasion in Brisbane last week. The `Bakers Creek Pilgrims' were led by Alvin `Mo' and Vera Berg, from Texas. I hope that the true Australian, true Queensland, hospitality we showed the participants will be a fond memory for them. There was a solemn purpose to the visit. On Saturday, 14 June a memorial was dedicated at the crash site and the scale model of the B17-C was placed on a plinth there. A report of the occasion and photographs can be viewed at www.ozatwar.com, a website operated by Peter Dunn. Among Americans also present were John B. `Skip' Hall Jr, a retired United States Air Force lieutenant general, who lives near Washington; Robert S. Cutler, professor, management of technology, at George Washington University; and Eileen A. Malloy, United States Consul General in Sydney. In the party, too, were Professor David Myers, publisher and founder of Central Queensland University Press; Mrs Jan Cardwell, manager, customer service at CQU Press; and Air Commodore Stewart Cameron of the RAAF, Commander Combat Support Group at Amberley near Ipswich. Once again we are reminded of the deep and abiding links between our country and America. These links are tremendously important and span the generations. They will endure. We shall all be grateful for that in the years to come.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Karratha and Port Hedland Airports</title><page.no>11708</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11708</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk about a quite serious problem that is faced by two of our great north-west cities in Western Australia, the cities of Karratha and Port Hedland. Last week I visited both centres. Both centres are thriving and there is a strong outlook for their local economies. The important element of both cities is that they are located in an area where Australia's great resource development projects are located. Karratha is the main residential dormitory centre for the North West Shelf, and all the offshore development associated with that, and for the Hamersley iron port of Dampier, which serves the inland mining towns of Paraburdoo and Tom Price. Port Hedland is the main centre for BHP's mining operation and serves the inland mining centre of Newman.  </para></talk.start><para>Karratha and Port Hedland are the major export earners for resource earnings from foreign trade in Australia and they are quite sensitive from a national security point of view. Their link to the rest of Australia and the outside world is mostly through their airports, although they are served by road and by sea as well. But their airports are the key link. I discovered on my trip that, by virtue of a cynical cost-cutting decision by the federal government, the fire brigade services provided to the airports are to be terminated on 30 June. </para><para>Airservices Australia charged airlines a levy on a landed tonne basis to provide for the fire brigade services at the airports. As a result of a CASA regulation, inspired by the cost-cutting approach of this government, the threshold passenger load for each airport has been raised to 350,000 passengers, well beyond what the airports at Karratha and Port Hedland currently bear. Karratha has a passenger load factor of about 170,000 passenger movements a year and Port Hedland has a passenger load factor of 80,000 passenger movements per year at the present time, although I will say something about those figures in a moment. So putting the bar at 350,000 passengers means that the airlines will not collect the levy and, as a consequence, the dedicated firefighting facilities at both airports are to be terminated. </para><para>The only alternative now for any firefighting necessary at the airports is to call upon the town based volunteer fire services. People work for these fire services on a volunteer basis. I have great admiration for their dedication and for their skill. Their skill and training is about suburban and country firefighting. The extra level of skill necessary to deal with airport fires based around aviation movements is another matter. They would require extra training in order to bring themselves up to the necessary skill level to deal with airport fires. Those resources will have to be found from the local community. </para><para>At the Karratha airport the response time is about 90 seconds, according to an outstanding figure in the north-west of Western Australia, the President of the Roebourne Shire, Kevin Richards. The firefighting unit at the airport can respond to any fire on the premises within that time. If the airport has to obtain the fire service from the town of Karratha, which is located some distance from the airport, then it could take up to 45 minutes, since it is a volunteer service. The same is true if one applies those figures to the major centre of Port Hedland. If there is a fire disaster at either of the airports, there will be a much longer wait—a considerable wait—before there will be the ability to deal with and remedy that situation, and during that time any amount of devastation could be wreaked.</para><para>I said that at Karratha the annual passenger load factor was about 170,000 passengers. This is a centre where most of the fly-in, fly-out passengers come to serve on the offshore oil rigs. So now a key work force dealing with an international exporting venture like the North West Shelf is to land at an airport without a proper airport fire service. That is a concern in itself. Of course, I would prefer that the work force lived in Karratha, but the fly-in, fly-out situation is an option that the company has exercised.</para><para>The other thing is that, in determining what the passenger load factor might be for the airport—and the figure has been raised to 350,000—CASA does not consider helicopter movements. Rotary-wing movements are not counted for the sake of this figure; only fixed-wing movements are counted. Therefore, all of the passenger traffic—which is quite considerable—to the offshore oil rigs and to nearby Barrow Island by helicopter is not included for the sake of this calculation. Only a Canberra bureaucrat, not someone that lives in the north-west, could come up with that sort of grotesque calculation. Only someone not associated with the difficulties that north-west people find in moving around Australia could come up with that sort of calculation. Nonetheless, they have—and, as a consequence, the funds are not going to be available. </para><para>I said that Port Hedland's passenger load factor at the present time was 80,000 passengers per year. That is quite a sizeable traffic. The Port Hedland council want to develop their own region and they see Port Hedland as a gateway to Australia from Bali and from nearby Indonesia. They are negotiating charter flights with Sempati Air and Merpati—Indonesian airlines—to bring passengers into Port Hedland. The fact that, from 30 June, because of cynical cost-cutting by this government, there will not be a full-time, fully trained emergency firefighting service on the ground at the airport—rather than 45 minutes away in Port Hedland—means that the cost of providing that service for international passengers as well as domestic passengers has to be met. For international passengers there has to be a fire service at the airport, which means making a special arrangement just for international flights.</para><para>Regional Australia deserves a break, and regional Australia ought to be given a break by this government. This government talks tough about what it is going to do to help regional Australia, but when you actually look at its performance there is very little there. By removing the fire service, it is inhibiting the ability of the town of Port Hedland to successfully conclude an international charter agreement with Indonesian airlines to bolster the regional economy. To not face up to the need to provide an airline service in the case of both Karratha and Port Hedland ignores the very sensitive national security issues for both of those centres, but it is also a brake on their development and means a higher cost and a levy for people living in the north-west of Western Australia.</para><para>With this government I always say, `Don't listen to what they say; watch what they do.' In watching what they do here, we see a clear case of a particular penalty being applied to those Australians who perform the role of developing this wonderful country of ours, living in remote areas of Australia and working to develop Australia. Robyn Crane, who is the acting chief executive officer of the Pilbara Development Commission, said to me just last week, `I can't understand how the federal government can sanction not having firefighters at Karratha Airport.' Barry Haase, the member for Kalgoorlie, spent $416,000 on postage prior to the last election. If that money had been spent on providing airport fire services, those two airports would have a fire service now able to meet the needs of the local community and give the reassurance necessary for passengers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Justice for Cleaners Day</title><page.no>11710</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>11710</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to congratulate members of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union and its sister union in the United States, the Service Employees International Union, on their campaign demanding decent wages and conditions for cleaners employed in the more than 120 Westfield shopping centres around the world.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday, on 16 June, cleaners around the world celebrated International Justice for Cleaners Day, or Justice for Janitors Day, as it is known in the US. This day commemorates the struggle of cleaners in Los Angeles who were attacked by police in 1990 during a peaceful demonstration against a cleaning contractor. Community outrage after this incident led to the formation of union locals that, over the many years of the Justice for Janitors campaign, have been highly successful in achieving improvements in wages, conditions, health care and job security. The leadership and rank and file of the SEIU are to be commended for their tenacious efforts in achieving these improvements. </para><para>The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union is marking International Justice for Cleaners Day by launching a campaign calling on Westfield chairman Frank Lowy to agree to minimum standards in the awarding of cleaning contracts, which include abiding by award conditions, ensuring basic occupational health and safety standards are met and guaranteeing that companies who are awarded cleaning contracts are meeting their commitments, such as workers compensation premiums, superannuation payments and appropriate taxes. I hope this campaign is successful, and I find it hard to imagine that, when it is put to him, Frank Lowy, the CEO of Westfield, will disagree with it.</para><para>Cleaners in our shopping centres are an invisible force. Multinational giants like Westfield rely on these workers being efficient and reliable and maintaining an environment that allows the company to charge topnotch rents. In return, shopping centre cleaners are amongst the most exploited workers in the Australian community. According to the ABS, over 95,000 workers are employed in the cleaning industry in Australia, including over 8,600 in my home state of South Australia. This industry is dominated by women and includes many workers from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Only 22 per cent of workers in this industry enjoy full-time employment, with the other 78 per cent employed on part-time or casual bases. Even taking into account the most recent living wage increase, which we note the government opposed, cleaners earn the princely sum of $12.38 an hour. Many of them do not work many hours a week. Make no mistake, on these wages and with the hours worked, many cleaners in Australia are working and living in poverty. Those senators involved in the Senate poverty inquiry would have heard horrific stories of the day-to-day struggle to live in dignity that workers like these have to endure. This is also the section of the community that the Howard government has in its crosshairs in its plan to destroy Medicare and make higher education the preserve of the wealthy.</para><para>Prior to entering the parliament I had the privilege of representing some of these workers in legal disputes, often surrounding unfair dismissal or a failure to pay correct entitlements. From this experience I have seen companies like Westfield adopting an aggressive policy of increasing profits by awarding contracts solely on price, creating a downward spiral where cleaning contractors inevitably make their own profits off the backs of low-paid workers.</para><para>Like many of the workers who clean his shopping towns, Mr Lowy came to Australia as a migrant with little other than a determination to work for a better future for himself and his family. That spirit, displayed by many migrants into Australia, has helped build the country we know and love, yet increasingly that spirit is not being rewarded with the opportunities it deserves. Cleaners are often caught in poverty cycles, not being able to afford basic health and education. No doubt, Westfield will argue that the wages and conditions of cleaners have nothing to do with the owners of the shopping mall because it is the contractors who are the employers, but it is Westfield who selects the contractor and in these shopping centres the contractor acts in the name of Westfield. It is Westfield who selects the contractors on the basis of price, pushing wages and conditions downwards. Westfield has a responsibility to ensure workers are treated decently and that contractors are meeting their minimum legal obligations. </para><para>It seems inconceivable that Mr Lowy, when presented with these facts through this campaign, would do anything other than immediately take steps to rectify the problems occurring on his property. It would seem inconceivable that Mr Lowy, whose story epitomises the migrant's dream and who is now amongst the richest people in Australia, would want to treat others worse than he was treated. Mr Lowy is one of the success stories of our post-war immigration policy, arriving from Europe in 1952 with no capital and poor English skills—an identical situation to that of many of Australia's cleaners. However, in those days Australia enjoyed a centralised wage system that acted as a genuine safety net, a springboard where new migrants like Mr Lowy were able to earn a decent wage and participate not only in the economy but also in the society more broadly.</para><para>In 1950 the pay differential between average wages and the salaries of CEOs was about one to five. Over the past six years the Howard government has torn the industrial safety net to shreds. Rising wealth inequality and ballooning executive salaries have seen this differential grow to a point where CEOs earn on average 400 times more than a cleaner in a Westfield shopping centre. This divide has been further compounded by an attack on essential public services, health and education. I congratulate LHMU members on their efforts in this campaign. I join with them in calling for Westfield to sit down with the relevant unions to negotiate a global protocol on service sector tendering. The fact that a service is contracted out is not an excuse for minimum wages and conditions to be avoided.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Greening Australia</title><page.no>11712</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11712</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin my remarks by making a short reference to the comments of Senator Cook, who is no longer in the chamber. In his speech he made reference to a Canberra bureaucrat having been responsible for some decision of which he disapproved. First of all, I do not know whether the bureaucrat of whom he complains was a Canberra bureaucrat or perhaps a Perth bureaucrat, but I would hope that a former minister of the Crown in this country would acknowledge that he has had many Canberra bureaucrats provide him with dedicated and loyal service and would be a little less likely as a result to refer in that disparaging way to bureaucrats who happen to live in Canberra. I hope that he is listening to these remarks and is taking note.</para></talk.start><para>My comments this evening are not, however, about Senator Cook but about the work of Greening Australia. In 1982, the International Year of the Tree, a small community based group called Greening Australia was formed to raise concerns about tree loss and to organise the mass planting of trees. I am not sure whether Bob Hawke's prediction of planting one billion trees before 2000 came to fruition, but if it did Greening Australia can take a large part of the credit.</para><para>Just last month I attended the 21st anniversary celebrations of that organisation, and I think it is fair to say that Greening Australia has been one of Australia's great environmental successes. Today it is an organisation with some 300 staff and a national role focusing on issues such as water quality and salinity, biodiversity and community capacity building. It has formed constructive partnerships with government, fellow environmental groups and industry. </para><para>I have to say that I see some environmental organisations in the community which appear to be more interested in environmental politics than the environment. Those organisations attract little respect from people like me. I have great respect for Greening Australia because it gets on with the job of protecting and enhancing the Australian environment.</para><para>Greening Australia is an organisation that is particularly well respected in the bush capital, and it has been an important part of the ACT's environmental recovery following the 18 January firestorms. Greening Australia is rare among environmental organisations. It enjoys universal support, is non-political and, most importantly, achieves tangible benefits for the environment. In 2001-02 Greening Australia planted over two million seedlings, collected 2,400 kilos of native seed, conserved almost 180,000 hectares of native vegetation, erected over 3,500 kilometres of fencing to conserve native vegetation and trained and educated 19,418 people—an impressive achievement.</para><para>Of course, statistics have a limited impact on the public imagination. It is only when you see the results of Greening Australia's work that you begin to understand the magnitude of its contribution. For example, Greening Australia has been part of the Saltshaker project in the Boorowa catchment, north-west of Canberra. It has tackled salinity in more than 200 sites in the catchment. One farmer commented on this by saying, `Saltshaker has been fantastic. In this paddock I had three trees. Now I have got 3,500.'</para><para>This project was funded through the Howard government's $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, the largest environmental rescue effort ever delivered by an Australian government. In the 2001 budget the government announced an extra $1 billion for the trust, which extends funding through till 2006. Another Greening Australia initiative that has been funded by the Natural Heritage Trust has been the Bidgee Banks project, which has tackled erosion in key areas in the mid and upper Murrumbidgee catchments. This project has particular significance for the people of the ACT. Like countless other Greening Australia projects, this project was successful because it encouraged participation from all stakeholders, not just Landcare groups. It won a Banksia award last year, which is a significant achievement in environmental circles.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge some recent Natural Heritage Trust backed projects in the ACT region, some of which Greening Australia has been involved with. The Gudgenby Bush Regeneration project continues the re-establishment of native vegetation close to the Namadgi National Park. The Creel and Recall Survey for Lake Ginninderra undertook an independent survey of recreational fishing in Lake Ginninderra. The Waterwatch Resource Centre in the Tuggeranong Valley is a project where staff and students from Lake Tuggeranong College monitored water quality and initiated awareness raising projects due to rapid expansion of Tuggeranong and its accompanying young school-aged population. The Vegetation Investment Project will enlarge key vegetation patches and establish 240 hectares of links between remnant vegetation in the southern ACT region. The Waterwatch program in the Ginninderra catchment aims to improve water quality in the catchment. The upstream urban stormwater in Ginninderra Creek flows into the Murrumbidgee River and the severely degraded Murray-Darling system, which gives the project extra significance. Ten schools and five Landcare groups have been involved in this project. </para><para>In 2002, a three-year, $69 million contract was awarded jointly to Greening Australia and Job Futures to run the Green Corps program. It shows that Greening Australia is not only a body with environmental expertise but also one which has some financial nous. About 85 per cent of Green Corps projects are located in rural and regional Australia. This is justified not only because of the environmental problems facing non-urban Australia but also because of the comparative lack of work experience opportunities for young people in these areas. Nevertheless, the ACT will soon benefit from a Green Corps project that will assist in recovery from the bushfires in the upper Murrumbidgee catchment. In conjunction with the ACT Rural Lessees Association, this project will assist farmers with refencing, vegetation surveys to determine more fire resistant species, seed collection, combating erosion, and carrying out water quality testing. The young ACT residents who participate in this project will also learn occupational health and safety procedures and basic first aid and will gain career guidance.</para><para>This speech has predominantly sung the praises of Greening Australia. I hope it has also given the Senate further evidence of the national importance and professionalism of this organisation. Apart from immediate challenges, such as its involvement in the Green Corps and the Natural Heritage Trust, Greening Australia sees its greatest medium-term challenge as developing more effective partnerships between governments, business and the community. I wish them well in this. It is this type of partnership that can provide Australia with a secure economic and environmental future. I want to thank the many staff and volunteers of Greening Australia who, through their actions, have made a practical expression of their commitment to the environment over many years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Depleted Uranium</title><page.no>11714</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>11714</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 6 August this year it will be Hiroshima Day, 58 years after the first dropping of an atomic bomb in 1945. To mark that anniversary, the Democrats are calling on the government to use its influence on the world stage to do two things: firstly, to push for a global ban on weapons containing depleted uranium; and, secondly, to urge the United States to not go on with its nuclear Star Wars program. I will come to that issue later this week but first I want to talk about depleted uranium—DU.</para></talk.start><para>Thirteen years after Australia stopped using depleted uranium in ammunitions, Australian troops sent to Iraq—as well as Iraq's civilian population—were exposed to DU used there by allied forces. We think it is time that our defence forces put DU weapons in the same category as cluster bombs. We do not use them and we do not support their use by the United States, the United Kingdom or anyone else, for that matter, and for very good reasons. Australia has a worthy history of opposing the use of landmines—indeed, our technical forces have been very active in de-mining many countries around the world. That has not been enough, of course, as there are still more landmines being planted than we can de-mine, but their efforts have, no doubt, saved lives on many occasions.</para><para>We could add to that history by urging that depleted uranium weapons are explicitly included in non-proliferation treaties. The Australian government used depleted uranium in weapons from 1981, and the Democrats first questioned the government about this in parliament more than 20 years ago. Thankfully, Australia stopped using DU ammunition in 1990, acknowledging that this was for health and safety reasons. We know it is highly likely that DU is at least a contributing factor in Gulf War syndrome. The use of DU munitions raises major concerns not just about the effects on all combatants but also about the long-term health of civilian populations which live in the affected areas well after the conflict is over. </para><para>DU is used in weapons because it is heavy, it is hard and it is very cheap. What is more, it is an intractable waste product, which makes getting rid of it in other countries a highly attractive proposition for those who have it. But there are alternatives to DU, such as tungsten, which is more effective and safer but, of course, much more expensive. DU is pyrophoric—in other words, it ignites and burns upon hitting a hard target. When DU weapons hit a target, a fine aerosol of uranium oxides is emitted. Most are small enough to be readily inhaled by humans, and the very smallest can lodge deep in the lungs. Once released, these fine particles can be spread by the wind or by vehicle and personnel movements.</para><para>Two months ago I wrote to the Minister for Defence asking for Australian troops to be blood tested for chromosomal aberration as a result of DU exposure. The United Kingdom has announced that British troops are to be offered DU testing. This comes after the UK's Royal Society were asked to look at the impact of depleted uranium—a source of radiation—on health. The Royal Society basically said that more research was required. They said that we need to be cognisant of depleted uranium and we need to administer the survey tool to our people to identify those who might have been exposed. So the UK government has gone ahead with this, and I think it is reasonable for us to ask the Australian government to do likewise.</para><para>At the budget estimates hearings for the Department of Defence of 4 June this year, Senator Bartlett questioned officers and officials, General Cosgrove and Defence Minister Hill about a number of issues, including exposure to DU. General Cosgrove provided the sorts of answers that we are accustomed to from government ministers—in other words: `Trust us. We trust the United States government.' He said:</para><quote><para>I am quite confident that the way we employed our people would not have led them into exposure of any significance to DU effects.</para></quote><para>We were told in estimates that Australia was waiting on US data about where environmental threats such as DU existed, and Defence will assess that data against Australian troop deployments. If they may have been exposed, there will be urinary DU screening. The people of Iraq of course do not have access to these maps showing where there was risk of DU exposure, and few of them will be able to access urinary DU screening.</para><para>A Defence officer told us that Australia had piggybacked on the US led coalition's `robust' efforts to put environmental people on the ground to conduct routine soil, water and air sampling. They are linking that with geospatial data so they are able to identify what environmental threats were at play in that location, even down to things like overlaying satellite imagery to show the presence or absence of oil fire smoke plumes. We will have access to that data for our deployed personnel, where the Americans did the monitoring. Apparently, we are in the process of acquiring that data from the United States. It will certainly make for a very interesting map of the environmental hazards in Iraq not just for our troops but for the Iraqi population.</para><para> Dr Doug Rokke, an expert on the use of depleted uranium in US armaments, is presently touring Australia. Dr Rokke was also a major in the United States armed services, was a military physicist in charge of the clean-up in Kuwait, has since become an outspoken opponent of the use of DU weapons and is a strong advocate of clean-ups in the name of human and health rights. He knows only too well that these weapons can do great harm. He and his team of 100 men brought out some of the tanks and other vehicles that had been hit by DU weapons in the first Gulf War. Thirty of his team have since died, and Dr Rokke himself is ill. </para><para>In the first Gulf War, soldiers were told there were no adverse health effects from DU. Subsequently Dr Rokke did studies of Gulf War veterans, who now in their many thousands have cancer related illnesses. He has also done work on the effects of the first Gulf War on the health of people from southern Iraq and Kuwait, and more recently he has done similar work in Afghanistan. There was a lot more depleted uranium used in the recent Gulf War, much of it in civilian areas.</para><para>Dr Rokke's tour has been organised by Australian peace groups. If members of the public would like to hear him speak, he will be addressing a public meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall on the evening of Tuesday, 24 June; at the University of Tasmania on the evening of Friday, 27 June; at Sydney University on Tuesday, 1 July; at Fremantle Town Hall on the afternoon of Saturday, 5 July; and in Adelaide on Thursday, 10 July. He will be speaking tomorrow night at the Brisbane Town Hall. I will be meeting Dr Rokke in Melbourne and I would encourage government MPs and others in this chamber to do likewise. I am sure what he has to say will be of great interest to people in this place.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Wentworth, Hon.

William Charles Wentworth. So much of Bill's life was devoted to the service of the people of Australia that his passing marks a notable point in our history of the period during which he was such a remarkable contributor. While I started my parliamentary career just as Bill was finishing his, we nevertheless became good friends through regular correspondence and meetings on a range of economic issues we had in common, such as the need for budget surpluses, the concerns of current account deficits, the plight of manufacturing in Australia and tariffs, to name but a few. I believe we both enjoyed the opportunity to debate these issues, even if sometimes it was only with each other. My problem was always how to singly deliver what Bill wanted, a frustration for Bill and an embarrassment for me.</para></talk.start><para>Bill's brilliance could be seen in his views, which were certainly well ahead of his time and the conventional thinking of the period. Born in Sydney to a historical family that included colonial explorers and newspaper proprietors, he was educated at the Armidale School and later obtained his Master of Arts at New College in Oxford. Upon returning home, he was an economic adviser to the New South Wales Treasury from 1933 to 1936.</para><para>In fact a lot of people remember Bill from his exploits with the Army Reserve—exploits that at the time were unconventional but certainly very effective. How he managed to avoid being court-marshalled is testimony to the message of his campaigns about the hopeless state of the adequacy of Australia's defences at the time, particularly around the large cities. In 1941 he enlisted with the Army Reserve and rose to the rank of captain, 1st Division Headquarters. It was here that he displayed the rebellious streak that I am referring to. On one occasion he led a party that captured the Waterfall police station to demonstrate the inadequacies of home defence. There is mythology surrounding some of the other exploits.</para><para>Bill was elected on 12 occasions to the federal parliament. As one of the forty-niners, in 1949 he was elected to represent the people of Mackellar and held the seat for 28 years. He has been described variously as an occupational rebel, even within his own party. Perhaps this rebellious streak was something that endeared him to so many Australians. As a critic of the Menzies government, he was not appointed to a ministry until the election of John Gorton as Prime Minister in 1968. Bill served as the first person to be specifically responsible for Aboriginal affairs, and this is certainly a historic achievement. He deserves special credit for his important achievements during his tenure—very brief; only three years as minister. In promoting the recognition of Aboriginal people, he persuaded Menzies to agree to the important referendum that included Aborigines in the census, which was finally held under Prime Minister Holt in 1967. </para><para>Bill was absolutely passionate about equal rights for Indigenous Australians—a view not strongly held at the time. He strongly supported moves towards granting land rights and steering policy from outright assimilation in favour of integration. On this note, an example of the unwillingness of the people of his era to treat him seriously was when Bill was completely left out when the Labor government celebrated the referendum's 25th anniversary in 1992.</para><para>Another story—as his nephew Mungo McCallum, a journalist in this place, recalls—occurred when the ceremony to celebrate the standardisation of railway was held. Bill was not invited to attend, despite his strong advocacy for decades about the need for standardisation of the Melbourne-Sydney gauge. As the determined driving force behind this issue he was obviously very hurt, but his wife came to the rescue. She appeared on the platform bearing a placard which demanded, `Where's Wentworth?' Its publication in many newspapers no doubt got the point across, such was the unconventional nature of the Wentworth family.</para><para>Regardless of the topic of discussion, Bill was passionate, independent and vigorous in debate. Many members of parliament have recalled Bill as a very colourful person during their tributes this week. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop recalled Bill's passion for economics and mathematics, with him mentioning to her once that he was engaged in correspondence with a particular professor concerning the method of calculating infinity. Perhaps that is an indication of his life at Oxford, looking at philosophical issues.</para><para>According to the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, in the other place yesterday, Ian Sinclair was in cabinet when Bill was a minister from 1968 to 1972 and Ian remembers:</para><quote><para>... Bill Wentworth had a thousand solutions to every problem—forty or fifty of which would be quite brilliant.</para></quote><para>Ian also recalls that `Bill Wentworth insisted on personally writing his own cabinet submissions', which were `discursive, wide-ranging and idiosyncratic—something of a reflection of their author'. Many people say that Bill inherited many of his qualities—including a strong will, passion and independence—from his great-grandfather, William Wentworth, who was amongst the first colonial explorers to cross the Blue Mountains. </para><para>In hindsight, perhaps Bill's major error was in breaking away from the Liberal Party for a time. No doubt it was a reflection of the fact that many Liberal Party leaders in his era really had difficulty in coping with his exceptional brilliance. They found it hard to accommodate so many of his views or even to harness some of his extraordinary energies—with the exception perhaps of the late John Gorton when he was Prime Minister. Bill's propensity to debate issues was a highlight of his career. He rarely stepped back from issues he thought needed airing and his contribution to the nation, especially through his Aboriginal affairs work, was remarkable for its vision. He carried on with this work with Aborigines well after he left parliament and into his later life. </para><para>The late William Charles Wentworth was a fantastic Australian, a great parliamentarian and a brilliant man. I consider it my great fortune to have counted him as a friend. It is with great sympathy that I offer my condolences to his wife, Barbara, who was a great help to him, and to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren in their loss. Bill, we salute you.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.43

question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (AFFA) made a major contribution to developing and implementing a strategy to attempt to influence the US Farm Bill. This was done in close cooperation with the Commonwealth Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian Embassy in Washington, and a wide cross section of Australian agricultural industry. Core elements of the strategy were developed through the Agricultural Trade Consultative Group (ATCG), which is co-chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, The Hon Warren Truss MP and the Minister for Trade, The Hon Mark Vaile MP, and through its Steering Group, which met frequently and is chaired at Deputy Secretary level.</para><para>(2)	Details of the strategy included</para><para>Research and Analysis</para><para>·	Closely monitoring the debate and policy process in the United States (US) in conjunction with DFAT and the Australian Embassy in Washington;</para><para>·	Developing common messages associated with the Farm Bill which were used to put Australia's case in Washington by both Government and industry. This included Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) research and publications which showed, amongst other things, the deleterious implications of the proposed Farm Bill on the domestic US economy and on international agricultural markets, and World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiating environment; and</para><para>·	Identifying key players in Congress and the Administration with potential to influence the US legislative processes as the focus of our lobbying efforts; </para><para>Communication of Messages</para><para>·	Meeting regularly with key industry representatives to assess the situation and respond to developments in Washington;</para><para>·	Delivering Australia's messages in a coordinated and timely manner in conjunction with industry; </para><para>·	Reinforcing to the Administration and key Congressional figures the links between a protectionist Farm Bill and US leadership credibility in the WTO Doha round of agriculture negotiations; and</para><para>·	Producing, in consultation with DFAT, “Farm Bill Newsletters” to ensure that the key stakeholders were kept informed of the latest US Farm Bill developments.</para><para>Mechanisms </para><para>·	Regular consultations in Washington with local agents of Australian agricultural industry;</para><para>·	Encouraging other Cairns Group countries to make similar representations about the Farm Bill; and</para><para>·	Assistance to Ministers, including letter to counterparts and planning and implementation of a government/industry delegation led by the Hon Warren Truss MP to Washington to lobby Congress and the Administration.</para><para>(3)	Two important objectives were achieved in that the duration of the Bill was limited to 6 rather than 10 years and built-in constraints were included in the Bill to ensure that certain program spending does not breach US WTO commitments. Feedback has been received that the strategy successfully placed Australia's concerns about the Farm Bill in the minds of US policy-makers.</para><para>During Minister Truss' visit to the US in December 2001 to lobby US Administration, key Australian industry representatives provided positive comments supporting his efforts. Industry's support for the initiative was also reflected in a letter to the Office of the Prime Minister dated 24 September 2001 in which the National Farmers' Federation indicated it fully supported high level government representation in Washington to lobby key members of the US House of Representatives.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services: Farm Management Deposit Scheme</title><page.no>11721</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 955)</subtitle><id.no>955</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11721</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	On what date did the department first become aware that some Farm Management Deposit (FMD) products may not comply with legislation applicable to the Governments FMD scheme.</para><para>(2)	(a) What was the source of this information; and (b) in what form was this information conveyed, for example, correspondence, e-mail, telephone conversation or direct conversation.</para><para>(3)	What was the nature of the problem specifically identified in this information.</para><para>(4)	On what date did the department inform the Minister, or his office, of this problem.</para><para>(5)	Did the Minister, or his office, receive advice about this problem from a source other than the Minister's department; if so: (a) on what date was this information first received; (b) what was the source of this information; (c) in what form was this information conveyed; and (d) what was the nature of the problem specifically identified in this information.</para><para>(6)	(a) On what date, or dates, did the department take action in response to this identified problem; and (b) what action did the department take.</para><para>(7)	(a) What departments, agencies, banks or non-bank financial institutions did the department communicate with in relation to this matter; (b) on what date, or dates, did that communication occur; and (c) what form did that communication take.</para><para>(8)	(a) What responses, if any, has the department received in respect to those communications; (b) in what form have those responses been received; and (c) what was the content of those responses.</para><para>(9)	What action has the department taken in response to communications from departments, agencies, banks or non-bank financial institutions.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11721</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Acting Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The issue lies outside the Department of Transport and Regional Services area of responsibility.

The RAAF Base Williamtown Instrument Approach Procedures are publicly available in the Australian Defence Force Flight Information Publication - Terminal Australia and can be obtained from RAAF Aeronautical Information Services in Melbourne.</para><para>(7)	In the past 12 months Hawks have flown the following profiles at SAWR:</para><para>(a)	30deg Application bombing</para><para>(b)	45deg Application Bombing</para><para>(c)	10deg Application Bombing</para><para>(d)	10deg Application Strafe (no actual firing)</para><para>All of these profiles are illustrated in the Hawk EIS. Aircraft transit over the entire Williamtown restricted area and therefore it is impossible to draw all tracks flown by Hawks around Williamtown (in the last 12 months).</para><para>(8)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>(i)	The aquifer at the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAWR) is tested for aluminium levels on a quarterly basis. The Department of Defence also tests the Hunter Water Corporation monitoring wells both upgradient and downgradient of SAWR.</para><para>(ii)	The results indicate that the concentration of aluminium in the groundwater at SAWR is consistent with the background levels on the Tomago sandbeds.</para><para>(b)	Defence does not hold national figures for aquifers, and as such, is not able to provide detail of average Aluminium levels in aquifers across Australia.</para><para>(9)	(a) and (b) No.</para><para>(10)	Yes.</para><para>(a)	The Base Commander at RAAF Williamtown received an e-mail message on 22 July 2002 from a civilian (Mr Mark Valentine) living near the SAWR claiming that he had been tested positive for elevated toluene. Mr Valentine requested that the Department of Defence arrange for himself and his family to be tested for exposure to fuel additives. This was followed up with a letter from Dr Soraya Felix (Mr Valentine's family doctor) on 5 August 2002 to the Base Commander at RAAF Williamtown requesting the department consider payment of costs associated with the testing for toluene. </para><para>(b)	The Base Commander forwarded the request to the Defence Claims Management office who subsequently passed the claim to the Directorate of Litigation for a response. The Directorate of Litigation advised that, owing to the minimal (if any) levels of toluene in the fuels used by military aircraft, and the use of toluene as a common solvent in both domestic and occupational circumstances, the prospect of Mr Valentine's positive result being solely due to aircraft activities at RAAF Williamtown is negligible, and declined the request.</para><para>(11)	No. Toluene is a common solvent and is found in many consumer products such as vehicle fuel, nail polish, cosmetics, rubber cement, paints and thinners, stain removers, inks and adhesives. Toluene in combusted jet aviation fuel is present (if at all) in trace amounts only (that is, &lt;0.025%) as it is steamed off during the distillation process. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the general population, including people living near the SAWR, would be exposed to toluene as a result of the activities of any aircraft, including activities involving the Hawk or other ADF aircraft.</para><para>(12)	No. A copy of the Defence Instruction has been forwarded separately to your office.</para><para>(13)	(a) and (b) No changes have been made to the referred Defence Instruction.</para><para>(14)	No.</para><para>(15)	SAWR is not cleared for laser operations. Only practice bombs (BDUs) which are not fitted with laser guidance systems are used at SAWR.</para><para>(16)	The latest endorsed 2002 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast map. This will be replaced with the updated ANEF map which will be promulgated on completion of the EIS for Hawk operations at RAAF Base Williamtown and the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range in near future. The new ANEF map will be provided to the local council for their use as a land management tool. Port Stephens Council has been provided with Australian Noise Exposure Concept maps for RAAF Base Williamtown and SAWR, which will form the basis of the revised ANEF map.</para><para>(17)	To effectively manage noise issues in cooperation with the State and local Governments, while maintaining the Defence capabilities. ANEF maps are provided to local Government.</para><para>(18)	Yes, automatically.</para><para>(19)	Yes.</para><para>(20)	No.</para><para>(21)	(a)	In December 1998.</para><para>(b)	Additional information become available which required amendments to the unendorsed 2005 ANEF.</para><para>(22)	(a)	On 18 December 1997 Defence provided Port Stephens Council with the 2005 ANEF and stated that “ANEF Report undertaken by the Department's consultants... has now been completed.”</para><para>(b)	Defence had not endorsed the 2005 ANEF at the time of distribution.</para><para>(23)	On 24 December 1998 Defence wrote, “...the draft 2005 ANEF for RAAF Base Williamtown was prepared in 1997 and has not been finally endorsed by the Department.” This was followed up with a letter on 14 July 1999. In March 2000 Defence wrote to Council again, stating “Because the exact locations of the Hawk flight paths will not be able to be confirmed until Hawk has been in operation for some time, it is not possible to produce the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) at this time.”</para><para>On 23 January 2001, the draft 2010 ANEC for RAAF Base Williamtown was provided to Port Stephens Council. The ANEC, which is included in the Hawk EIS, was provided to Port Stephens Council in 2002. </para><para>(24)	No.</para><para>(25)	No. All matters Environment Australia identified as requiring clarification were addressed in the Supplementary Report and Defence's response factored into the assessment report prepared by Environment Australia for the Minister for Environment and Heritage.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligent Island Program</title><page.no>11787</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1448)</subtitle><id.no>1448</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11787</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the $8 million grant to Intellinc under the Intelligent Island Program:</para><para>(1)	How much of the $8 million Commonwealth funding grant to Intellinc was allocated to the construction of the call centre at Triabunna, Tasmania.</para><para>(2)	(a)	Who brought the proposal to establish a call centre to the board; and</para><para>(b)	what was the basis of the decision made by the board to locate a call centre at Triabunna.</para><para>(3)	Was a client for the call centre at Triabunna identified before the decision to locate such a facility at Triabunna was made.</para><para>(4)	What has the record of occupancy at the call centre been since its opening.</para><para>(5)	What is the ongoing cost of security and maintenance for the call centre, given that it has no clients.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11787</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Nil</para><para>(2)	(a)	A proposal to establish a call centre in Triabunna has never been taken to the Intellinc board.</para><para>(b)	Intellinc does not have and never has had any interest or relationship with the Triabunna call centre.</para><para>(3)	As the Triabunna is not a beneficiary of the Intelligent Island program, I am unable to provide this information.</para><para>(4)	See answer to part (3).</para><para>(5)	See answer to part (3).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligent Island Program</title><page.no>11787</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1449)</subtitle><id.no>1449</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11787</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Intelligent Island Program:</para><para>(1)	What performance evaluation has the Commonwealth conducted in relation to the $40 million Commonwealth grant made to Tasmania under the program.</para><para>(2)	Who has represented the Commonwealth on the board of the program since the resignation of former senator Brian Gibson.</para><para>(3)	How has the $8 million grant from the program to Intellinc been divested.</para><para>(4)	Has Intellinc applied for, or received, any further funding under this program or any other Commonwealth funding program; if so, how much.</para><para>(5)	Has Intellinc generated a profit since its inception. </para><para>(6)	What is the remuneration to directors of Intellinc.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11788</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Commonwealth has received regular six-monthly reports on progress from the Intelligent Island Board.
