It is the view of the Prime Minister and it is my view as well that, during his tenure as Governor-General, Dr Hollingworth has fulfilled his statutory responsibilities in a way that has been more than satisfactory, and there is nothing arising out of the fulfilment of his duties that would warrant his dismissal. In relation to the matters that were considered by the so-called Aspinall report, there were statements made by the Governor-General at the request of that inquiry and there were findings resulting from consideration of those statements by the two inquirers, but they were not tested in a way that gave Dr Hollingworth an opportunity to respond to them. Even if they were, I do not think that they could be regarded as the equivalent of judicial findings and, therefore, they are really just the views or impressions of these two individuals who were giving advice, in effect, to the Anglican Church. The fact that they might disagree with conclusions that were reached by Dr Hollingworth is a matter of interest, but I certainly do not think that it suggests in any way that the Prime Minister should take action to dismiss him. </para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10537</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President.

The Australian Defence Force made a substantial contribution to the coalition combat operations to disarm Iraq and to liberate the Iraqi people. There is no doubt that our force punched well above its weight, as has been acknowledged by many. The maritime task group was the forefront of coalition maritime operations at the top end of the Persian Gulf. As we know, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Anzac </inline>used naval gunfire to support the United Kingdom forces. <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>'s captain was the coalition commander in the north Persian Gulf during the conflict. The work of <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>'s crew in discovering mines on an Iraqi barge may have avoided an absolute catastrophe. The Navy clearance diving team was integral to clearing the Umm Qasr port and its connecting waterways to allow humanitarian supplies to begin flowing in quickly. The special forces task group built around the SAS squadron, supported by a reinforced commando platoon, also performed admirably, particularly in preventing the launch of ballistic missiles at neighbouring countries. It conducted aggressive reconnaissance from the very beginning of the combat operations, involving numerous contacts with the enemy. A highlight of its contribution was the capture of over 50 MiG aircraft at Al Asad air base and the apprehension of 59 fleeing Fedayeen and suspected Ba'ath party members. I can mention also the eight CH47 Chinooks and the work they did in support of our forces and also the nuclear chemical defence troop, which also assisted the special forces.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the Air Force, the deployment of 14 FA18s was the first time that Australian fighters have operated in a war zone since the Korean War. The Hornets flew over 670 sorties, including defence counter air missions to protect high-value coalition assets, strike missions against targets throughout Iraq and close air support missions in support of coalition ground forces. They dropped some 122 bombs, all precision guided weapons. No civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure was observed or reported as a consequence; in other words, they went about their task in a highly professional and capable way. Australia's three C130 aircraft have flown in excess of 130 missions, carrying three million pounds of cargo and 1,500 troops. The two P3C maritime surveillance aircraft have flown over 70 missions in support of coalition maritime operations in the gulf.</para><para>All Australians can be very proud of the performance of the ADF. The government accepts, however, that the task for Australia in relation to Iraq is not at an end. We recognise our responsibilities and will make an appropriate contribution to coalition efforts to stabilise and rehabilitate Iraq. In particular, we can advise that we have put in place some 60 military air traffic control personnel to support the orderly flow of aircraft at Baghdad International Airport. We have also provided 16 specialists to help the coalition search for and investigate Iraq's weapons of mass destructions. We have provided ADF officers to the US Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. We have provided a military security detachment to support the establishment of Australia's diplomatic mission in Baghdad. Not only, therefore, did the ADF perform admirably during the combat but also they continue to make a major contribution in this important area.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Governor-General</title><page.no>10539</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>10539</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister representing the Prime Minister.

Certainly there are issues in that report that the Governor-General has already sought to address and will continue to address. He sought to address them firstly in acknowledging an error of judgment in relation to his decision to keep the priest by the name of John Elliot in office for a further period after about 1995.

As senators know, the Treasurer tonight will in the other place bring down the Howard government's eighth budget. I am pleased that the Senate will be spared the pain of having to listen to me read it in this place simultaneously—a historic moment. The budget that the Treasurer will bring down is against the backdrop of an Australian economy which continues to show extraordinary resilience in the face of domestic and international shocks. After all, we have experienced the worst drought in a century, weak global demand and uncertainty arising from the recent conflict in Iraq, and we have had a period of quite high oil prices.</para></talk.start><para>To illustrate the extent of the challenge presented by the drought, I remind you that in the December quarter agricultural production fell by no less than 14 per cent—or 24 per cent over the year to December—grain exports were down 31 per cent and employment in the farm sector was down nearly 20,000 people. So the drought has been very severe and very harsh. It has impacted on the March quarter CPI, and oil prices have also impacted on that CPI. Despite these challenges, our economic performance remains remarkably strong. Our GDP growth really is the highest in the developed world. We have low interest rates, low inflation, strong investment and unemployment falling. The IMF, the OECD and the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine all confirm the extraordinary and resilient growth in the Australian economy. They are all forecasting for the calendar year 2003 growth of around three per cent plus, which, as I say, will be the strongest in the developed world.</para><para>These results do not come about simply by accident. What is most particular about the Australian economy is our resilience to these shocks, and that is a result of the difficult but principled economic reform initiated by the former Labor government and continued by the Howard government. In our period we have of course finished the business. We have had workplace relations reform, tax reform and bringing the budget back into surplus and repaying debt. We have cut company tax. We have cut capital gains tax. We have cut personal income taxes and had the most drastic reform to Commonwealth-state financial relations in a generation. But, of course, that record of very responsible and very disciplined economic management can only come about if you have a long-term strategic plan for the economy and it is a part of a coherent, consistent and proactive reform agenda. I have to say that the Labor Party in opposition—the alternative government, we are told—shows all the signs of continuing what has been for seven years an inconsistent, incoherent and reactive agenda in opposition.</para><para>Just in the up period we have had the opposition leader running around launching a new truck every week—the new truck policy. And he calls simultaneously for both more spending and lower taxes—the old Labor con trick. We had the shadow Treasurer putting out press releases saying that Australians will in fact accept higher taxes—which I say, if Labor ever gets back, they will no doubt get. The member for Lilley proposes tax credits. The member for Brand wants a whole new Commonwealth department to look after homeland security. So we seem to have as many policies and conflicting policies coming from the Labor Party as we do leadership aspirants. We do not know yet but we all await Mr Crean's great speech on Thursday night, in which he might explain to us how he is going to simultaneously cut taxes, increase spending and deliver surpluses. But all we have heard are conflicting Labor policies from all their leadership aspirants—no coherence whatsoever.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Governor-General</title><page.no>10541</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10541</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women.

I answered a question from Senator Murray late last year—or last year some time—in relation to this matter where the Queensland minister admitted herself that there was not enough money and they were not doing a good enough job. The unions—in which you would be interested, Senator—were complaining on behalf of their workers because their workers were going to work stressed as the children they were looking after might not be there the next day.

The authors' objectivity and the methodology used should be questioned. There is inherent bias in involving this group of people who have been found to not be refugees in a study questioning the appropriateness of mandatory detention. It is also worth while remembering, as the researchers admit, that there could have been some exaggeration in the answers to bolster their case. The researchers also admit that there is no way of verifying many of the claims. These are very important points, which should be borne in mind when Senator Bartlett raises this issue.</para><para>It is understood that an immigration detention environment has the potential to have an impact on children. It is known, however, that many factors affect children's mental health. Parental support, family structure and relationships, access to development opportunities, including education, and general health all influence a child's mental health. The department and the services provider have sought to ensure that, wherever possible, the effect of risk factors is minimised and protection factors are maximised or enhanced in the immigration detention environment. For example, detainees have access to psychiatric and psychological services. Wherever possible, families are accommodated in family compounds, which provide a more community oriented environment. Children are given the opportunity to go on excursions and there are programs for children, including cultural and lifestyle classes, sporting activities, games and arts and crafts. Importantly, over three-quarters of children in detention are now spending most days outside detention centres in local schools.</para><para>Whilst every effort is being made to provide protective factors for children within these detention centres, the government is also taking innovative approaches to alternative detention arrangements. All women and children likely to spend more than short periods of time in detention have been given as a matter of priority the option of accommodation in a residential housing project. In this debate, it must be remembered that it has been the parents' choice to bring their children to Australia illegally, often through dangerous people-smuggling networks. Parents can also decide to return their children to their country of origin.</para><para>Senator Bartlett raises an issue which is regarded seriously by the government but, when one looks at this report and the research that has been undertaken, one must take into account those aspects which I have outlined to the Senate.

Rolling trials of course will ensue. This is the culmination of an extensive investigation in which Australia and Indonesia have worked very closely. Since October 12 last year, it is no secret that the Australian Federal Police has been heavily involved in the investigation of this matter, along with state and territory police from across Australia. We acknowledge, and have acknowledged on several occasions, the great cooperation that we have received from the Indonesian authorities in relation to this matter. As far as the prosecution is concerned, the Australian Federal Police has a team assisting with the Indonesian prosecution. We have said throughout that whatever assistance they might require from us we will give to them. That team has to date collected 49 witness and victim impact statements in Australia, along with 32 forensic statements and reports for use in support of the prosecution. It is not yet known if there will be a requirement for any of those witnesses to actually attend and give evidence in the trials in Indonesia.</para></talk.start><para>In support of this process, the Australian Federal Police has also established a dedicated family liaison team, with officers throughout Australia. These officers have responsibility for liaising with families of the Bali victims and ensuring that they are provided with accurate and timely information regarding the investigation and potential prosecution. I might add that we are providing assistance for members of families of victims to go up to Bali to be there for the trial, although the Australian Federal Police has stressed that, of course, the trial will be conducted in Indonesian, it may be difficult to follow proceedings and the proceedings can be adjourned from time to time. Members of the family liaison team will be in Bali during the trial periods and will provide briefings and assistance to those Australian family members I have mentioned in relation to trial proceedings. The AFP will also provide up-to-date information about the Bali trials on their web site. For those families who do not have Internet access, arrangements have been made to ensure that they are updated.</para><para>Although the trials have commenced, the investigations are still ongoing. In the last fortnight there were 17 arrests, with three people suspected to have been directly or indirectly involved with the Bali bombing. We still have in Indonesia 36 Australian Federal Police personnel involved in Operation Alliance. Recently, at the people-smuggling conference that we co-hosted with Indonesia, I met with some of them and obtained first-hand accounts of the investigations that are ongoing. There is still work to be done in relation to that, but certainly the fact that we have now reached the trial stage is significant and points to the great work that has been done by both Australian and Indonesian law enforcement. It is worth while noting that, to date, Operation Alliance has resulted in the expenditure of some $12 million, with over 170,000 hours of work being attributed to Operation Alliance. All in all, it has been a great effort by Australian law enforcement and also by victim identification and forensic experts, many of whom gave their time free.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Governor-General</title><page.no>10548</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>10548</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister representing the Prime Minister.

In fact, last week at the conference on people-smuggling and human trafficking I raised this with a number of our regional neighbours. It was part of my address to that conference. I also took it up with American representatives there. Australia needs to work with our neighbours in the region. I believe that there is a mutual concern with other countries in the region in relation to this issue. It is not something that we can deal with on our own. I would also say this: it is not something that the federal government can deal with on its own. In some states we have the regulation of the sex industry by state governments. Really, the question of prostitution is a state matter. If anyone is being detained or confined, that is a deprivation of liberty which is per se a state offence. We do need also the cooperation of the state and territory governments on this issue, and I will be raising this at the Police Ministers Council when we meet in early July this year.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10549</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Australia has one of the toughest therapeutic goods regulators in the world. It has some of the toughest rules about pharmaceuticals in the world. When the Therapeutic Goods Administration was undertaking the task of investigating Pan Pharmaceuticals, it was required to have an absolutely watertight case before it withdrew Pan Pharmaceuticals' licence.</para></talk.start><para>With respect to the question that the honourable senator has asked about people being able to seek recompense, of course all of these issues have to be addressed in terms of the company's responsibility to the consumer and also the cost to the Australian public of the advertising of the over-the-counter preparations, the complementary medicines, which were withdrawn. The Commonwealth stepped in. It was a requirement that the sponsors—they are the companies that use the manufacturer; a sponsor may in fact have one over-the-counter complementary medicine made by two or three manufacturers, different batches being made by different manufacturers—advertise. That would have meant that consumers would have had to go through hundreds of lists of advertisements by the sponsors, which they would have found very difficult.</para><para>The TGA made the decision, in order to help consumers—and we are talking about consumers and assisting them—to list all of the products as we got information about them. We had hoped that it would have been faster, but there are a whole lot of reasons why we had to advertise a number of lists, and I can go into that in more detail, as it will be gone into in estimates. Also on the web site—and I want to compliment the TGA on this—the TGA listed the products in alphabetical order and in numerical order, so it made it much easier for people to find if they had an over-the-counter, complementary medicine in their medicine cabinet or at home, or for pharmacists and people in health food shops to locate which batches were manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals.</para><para>It is the responsibility of the company. All of those issues are being addressed in terms of what responsibility the company has to the public for the fact that it has breached the licensing requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I have to say again that I compliment the TGA on the fact that they had a watertight case. You can imagine the outcry if they had had a recall without the sort of watertight information that they had obtained and there had been an appeal and Pan were continuing to produce and manufacture; given the standards that they were manufacturing under, we would have been lambasted. So I compliment the TGA for the work that they undertook. They investigated this thoroughly and had a watertight case. That is what is important for the consumer, as is the fact that we have among the toughest regulators and regulations in the world.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10551</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

When we came into government we had a total maldistribution of general practitioners. There were far too many in the city and too few in rural areas. We are spending $562 million on attracting doctors into rural areas. We have increased the number of doctors in rural areas by 4.7 per cent estimated full-time doctors in the last 12 months. We have now seen the number of young people from rural areas studying medicine in our medical schools go from eight per cent to 25 per cent. </para></talk.start><para>It was indicated to us that we needed to increase the medical work force. I did that. On a request from the state ministers that they needed more doctors in their hospitals immediately, Mr Ruddock and I changed the immigration regulations to allow young doctors who had studied in Australia to stay on. We produced 93 doctors almost overnight. This package—worth $917 million—has about $500 million dedicated to increasing the work force. With regard to the number of doctors on the ground next year, there will be 150 new general practitioners in specialist training, particularly in areas of work force need. Eight hundred practices will benefit from practice nurses to assist doctors, to relieve their load in areas of work force need. Also, there will be 234 new medical students in medical schools around Australia as at the beginning of next year. They will be bonded to areas of work force shortage on the basis of their specialty. If they choose to be a specialist GP or a specialist of some other sort, they will be bonded into an area of work force need. This is a long-term plan to address full access.</para><para>With regard to affordability, never in the history of Medicare has there been any incentive for doctors to bulk-bill in areas where there are fewer doctors. There are some people in rural areas who have never seen a bulk-billing doctor. The Labor Party goes on about bulk-billing figures, but they have an unfair distribution in terms of people in rural and outer metropolitan areas who do not get access to a bulk-billing doctor, particularly if they are on a low income, particularly if they are on a health care card. It does the Labor Party no service—and it does the Australian public a disservice—when they use public funds to advertise in open letters to Western Australians. The Western Australian and Victorian senators on the other side ought to hang their heads in shame.

Dr Hollingworth has acknowledged that he made an error of judgment—that is not in dispute. The gravity of that error of judgment is not in dispute.

Following Senator Brandis's comments, I say: yes, this is a matter of very serious regret. The points that we are now seeking to raise are not about cheap point-scoring. They are dealing with the fact that the man involved in this case in the Aspinall report that we have been commenting on is still the Governor-General of Australia. That is the point. Nobody doubts or disputes that there are many other serious, atrocious examples of child sexual abuse, but the point here is that this case relates to the current Governor-General. Senator Brandis claims that, if you read this case, it shows an error of judgment. Let me put this to senators: please read this case and understand. This case should be a case study for anybody learning about child sexual abuse, covering about practically every error of judgment that you could apply. Let me list a few, because they dispute what Senator Brandis just put to us. Let us read what Dr Hollingworth describes as the major difficulty at hand in this case. His letter to the respondent in 1993 says:</para></talk.start><para>The major difficulty is that in not taking disciplinary action I and the Church could subsequently charged with culpability ...</para><para>As Senator Hill said, he was meant to be concerned about erring on the side of forgiveness and reconciliation. No—what this correspondence shows is that he was more concerned about potential culpability. But the whole point of this matter is that this case shows that what the Governor-General did not apply was compassion for the victims of sexual abuse. There are a lot of examples of very poor process in managing these cases. You might anticipate that that would have been the case perhaps 20 or 30 years ago when child sexual abuse was regarded by much of the community as taboo, but we are talking about dealings with this matter less than 18 months before he became Governor-General. Should we accept what the Governor-General says when he says that he has learnt from his past error of judgment? Certainly his performance on the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story </inline>program gave us no confidence. Maybe he has had a crash course, but I tell you that what is written in this report leaves us highly sceptical of that point. Let us look at one example at 8.6 in the report. It quotes the Governor-General's response to the inquiry where he says that he `personally carried out a detailed pastoral and disciplinary investigation'. There is nothing in this report that shows a detailed pastoral investigation.</para><para>Dr Hollingworth did not even seek to test the allegation. He did not seek to test the allegation of the perpetrator that there had been no other children involved in child sexual abuse. There had been no attempt to test that point at all. He denied that he was told that information, but he did not attempt to test that claim. Now we know that this man—the perpetrator—has been jailed for multiple cases of sodomy. Why did the Governor-General back then not test that simple claim by this perpetrator?

That was the point of my question to Senator Vanstone, the point she missed.

All through the weekend the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, whenever he made television appearances, showed his obsession to link all this to John Howard's choice. That is where this debate and this issue is heading.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran, you might withdraw that reference to Senator Faulkner.

The trouble there is that the opposition will just sink themselves lower than they already are. The opposition will go lower than they already are and, in fact, the Leader of the Opposition will go lower, if that is possible, than he already is. That is the last thing the Australian people want. They will be awake to that sort of political tactic, of the opposition dragging this sensitive issue into the political arena for their own rank advantage. The Australian people will wake up to that and condemn them for it, and that is quite obviously where this debate is heading.</para></talk.start></continue><para>From what we heard from the questioners today in question time, I have no doubt that Senator Faulkner read the report. Among the questioners, he is quite obviously the only one who has read the report. Senator Hill certainly flushed that out from some of the questioners in question time. They have not really read the report; at best, they have read a summary of the report. When you look at the report, there were some nine complaints inquired into by the Anglican Church. You will find that, of those nine, Dr Hollingworth has acted properly on eight occasions. Of course, the occasion on which the report concluded that he did not act fairly, reasonably, properly and correctly was the well-known Elliot case, which is complaint No. 5.</para><para>In raising this issue, the opposition always read selectively from the report; they never read the whole paragraph that brings Dr Hollingworth into criticism. I am going to read for the record that whole paragraph, because the selective reading is not a fair analysis of the report itself. In some respects, paragraph 15.9 brings things into perspective. It states:</para><para>Dr Hollingworth's decision, whilst made in good faith, and in consultation, and without demur of the bishops whom he consulted, and in the belief that precautionary conditions imposed minimised the risk of recurrence, was untenable. Thus the Board finds that this complaint was not handled fairly, reasonably and appropriately.</para><para>Quite correctly, they have come to that conclusion. But, when you are debating this issue, that whole paragraph needs to be read to put it into some perspective. Complaint No. 1, which I believe was probably the issue that triggered this report, was the Toowoomba Preparatory School issue. Again, it has to be read in its full context. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>10557</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to take note of answers given by Senator Hill to questions asked of him in relation to the conduct of the Governor-General, Dr Peter Hollingworth, as highlighted in the Aspinall report. This is a serious matter facing the nation; it is one of child sexual abuse, its perpetrators, paedophiles and also those who protect the perpetrators of these crimes. It is clear that this government will not face up to its responsibility to address this serious matter which was raised in the Aspinall report and raised in the Senate today by way of the opposition's questions. These matters in the Aspinall report that we have heard of today bring into serious question the behaviour of the existing, serving Governor-General of this nation, and they provide clear reasons for him to vacate the office of Governor-General.</para></talk.start><para>The Hollingworth crisis has left Australia in a state of constitutional limbo. The Governor-General has decided to step aside, pending the resolution of the rape allegations that have been made against him in the Victorian Supreme Court. If this were the only cloud hanging over the Governor-General's head then it might well be appropriate for him to step aside in such circumstances. But, as we know, this is not the only cloud hanging over the Governor-General. It is not the only reason for him to vacate the office of Governor-General. As we heard today, the independent report of the board of inquiry of the Diocese of Brisbane, known as the Aspinall report, found that, as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth allowed a priest to remain in the ministry after an admission of sexual abuse. The report found that Dr Hollingworth's decision in this regard was untenable. Before that, there were concerns about Dr Hollingworth's conduct, as revealed in the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story </inline>last year. Senator Collins referred to that in her remarks a moment ago. The findings of the Aspinall report and the conduct of the Governor-General as revealed in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> are the reasons why Hollingworth must resign as Governor-General. He must do so for the reasons that were clear last week, before the rape allegations before the Victorian Supreme Court became public. He must resign for the reasons highlighted in the independent Queensland report, the Aspinall report, whether there is any substance to the rape allegations or not. I have no knowledge of the matter; no-one does. The matter is yet to be heard, and no judgment can be made. Nevertheless, the Governor-General must resign. The reason is that there are existing grounds for his resignation. Resignation is the only course of action for him to take.</para><para>Senator McGauran spoke to us today about Labor emphasising that it is all about the Prime Minister's choice in this matter. That is quite right: it is solely the Prime Minister's responsibility. Under our Constitution, it is for the Prime Minister to both appoint and remove the Governor-General. The Prime Minister is the only office holder who has any bearing on this matter, and that is why action must be taken. If the Governor-General, Dr Hollingworth, refuses to resign then the only course of action is for the Prime Minister to demand his resignation. A failure on the part of the Governor-General to resign in these circumstances will only continue the already significant damage that this crisis has caused to the office of Governor-General.</para><para>We all know that the Governor-General has, through his own conduct, lost the support of a majority of Australians. Although I usually would not advocate looking to opinion polls to determine the future of an independent office holder, it is pretty clear that, in the case of the office of the Governor-General, the Governor-General must have community support to fulfil its symbolic and ceremonial functions. It is not acceptable for the Governor-General to stand aside while the rape allegations are dealt with and then, if he is cleared, to resume office. That is unacceptable, for the reasons I have stated. There are already sufficient grounds for him to vacate the office. If he remains in the office he will do damage to it. It is clear that he can no longer exercise his constitutional duties as required of him. He no longer has the support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: People-Trafficking</title><page.no>10558</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>10558</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Greig today relating to the practice of `trafficking' in women for prostitution.</para></motion><para>I want to take note of answers given by Senator Chris Ellison in relation to questions I asked today on the topic of sexual servitude, sexual slavery and trafficked women. In doing so, I want to touch briefly on some of the answers given by Senator Hill in relation to opposition questions on Dr Hollingworth, because it seems to me that there is a connection, however loose, between both issues. The connection is, as I would describe it, the abdication of duty and wilful blindness. I found it quite extraordinary that Dr Hollingworth could argue that it would not be worth pursuing someone known to have been involved in child sexual abuse on the basis that they were about to retire. When questioned about this, he confirmed that it was an error of judgment. I think that borders on criminal behaviour. These are issues that do not warrant reconciliation and forgiveness; I think they warrant justice.</para><para>I would argue the same for those women who have been—and who continue to be—trafficked to this country against their will, under appalling circumstances, and who are then forced to work as sexual slaves. We do not know whether the number is 1,000 women, as has been predicted, or fewer than that, but I do not care if it is only one woman. Yet when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, was questioned in detail for the first time, the answers he gave to these important questions were alarmingly thin. He was questioned on 7 May on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program, where he demonstrated, I think, a significant indifference to the issue.</para><para>When the minister was asked, for example, if his department had been deporting women who might otherwise be giving evidence against their traffickers, he replied, `Not to my knowledge.' When he was then asked if children were being brought into Australia to work as sex slaves, he replied, `Not to my knowledge.' And when he was questioned about the case of a 13-year-old Thai girl brought to Australia to become a sex slave—a question raised in this chamber and others—and asked if the Attorney-General, a colleague, had raised this issue, the minister said:</para><para>Well, if we want to get pedantic, he may have included that in a speech.</para><para>When asked what the sex slave trade might be worth in Australia each year, the minister replied that he did not know. It seems to me that the responsibility here fundamentally lies with the immigration minister, and that is where I take issue with Senator Ellison, who argued today that this is very much a matter for the states because prostitution is a state based issue. I acknowledge that, but trafficking is not, people-smuggling is not and immigration is not. Therefore the responsibility for those key aspects of this appalling scenario rests with the government and, most particularly, with the minister. Senator Ellison repeated today that existing Australian law was aimed at dealing with this issue, and he talked in particular about the introduction of the Commonwealth's Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act 2000. While I acknowledge that the legislation has merit, the fact is that it has been unsuccessful in prosecuting a single person—not one trafficker. While Minister Ellison made a point of saying there were some 19 investigations under way, nine of which are ongoing, we still have not had one prosecution.</para><para>I argue that the legislation is inadequate. I argue that we need a review. I argue that we need some kind of inquiry or investigation, whether that be through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation or References Committee or perhaps even through the new Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, which has evolved out of the old National Crime Authority committee. Australian law-makers have gone some way towards addressing the problem, yet we know that the legislation does not fully reflect new international agreements and standards set out by agreed-to trafficking protocols. The very starting point for us is to stop treating these women as criminals and rather as victims. We need to make sure that we can keep them in Australia, look after their welfare first and foremost, provide them with the opportunity to give evidence against their traffickers and then go after the traffickers. We need better procedures, better processes and better legislation, not more wilful blindness or abdication of duty.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>10559</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title><page.no>10559</page.no><no.signed>41</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>1M6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Allison</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and the Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>Whereas the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following Motion:</para><para>That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking political asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life;</para><para>and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</para><para>We, therefore, the individual, undersigned Attendees at:</para><para>The Baptist Church, Armadale, Victoria 3143;</para><para>Kingsley College, a Wesleyan Methodist Bible College, Glenroy; and</para><para>Evening Mother's Union, St Paul's Anglican Church, Ringwood</para><para>petition the Senate in support of the abovementioned Motion.</para><para>And we, as in duty bound will every pray.</para><presenter><no.signed>41</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id></talker><para>Senator Allison (from 41 citizens).</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Immigration: People-Smuggling</title><page.no>10560</page.no><no.signed>14</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate</para><para>The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate:</para><para>That on Friday 19 October 2001, a grossly overcrowded boat, known as SIEV-X, carrying approximately 397 asylum seekers sank in international waters between fifty and sixty-five nautical miles south of Java, in an area that was at the time under intense surveillance by the Australian Defence Forces as part of Operation Relex; with the loss of approximately 353 lives; and that Australian authorities were aware of the departure of SIEV-X from Sumatra on 18 October, and yet there was no attempt by the Australian Defence Forces or Coastwatch to locate or intercept this boat, with a view to ensuring the safety of the people on board;</para><para>That during 2001, the Australian Federal Police conducted a secret People Smuggling Disruption Program in Indonesia, in cooperation with selected elements of the Indonesian Police Force and various other individuals; and that an Indonesian-based informant of the Australian Federal Police, Kevin John Enniss, has claimed to have sabotaged and sunk boats carrying asylum-seekers;</para><para>That there is a growing belief in the community that the Australian government and/or its agents deliberately neglected to ensure the safety of the lives of the asylum-seekers on board SIEV-X, and may even have been in some way responsible for the sinking of the boat as a deterrent against unauthorised asylum-seekers attempting to come to Australia by boat from Indonesia</para><para>Your petitioners therefore ask the Parliament to urgently pass a motion calling on the Prime Minister to establish an independent judicial inquiry with full powers to subpoena witnesses to investigate all the circumstances surrounding the disruption, departure and sinking of the asylum seeker boat known as SIEV-X, and all activities of the Australian Government, its servants, agents and collaborators in regard to SIEV-X, including:</para><para>1.

follows—</inline></para><para>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 will strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities by enhancing ASIO's investigative powers.</para><para>The horrific and tragic events of September 11 marked a fundamental shift in the international security environment. </para><para>The more recent tragedy in Bali brought the realities of terrorism to our doorstep.</para><para>Those inexcusable acts of atrocity showed us no country is safe from the devastation terrorist acts inflict.</para><para>And the current security environment makes passage of this Bill more important than ever.</para><para>The Government has consistently taken a strong, decisive and balanced approach to strengthening Australia's counter-terrorist capabilities. </para><para>On the legislative front, the Government has enacted a package of counter-terrorism legislation to ensure that Australia, through our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, is in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. </para><para>This Bill is part of that legislative package—its primary purpose is to protect the community.</para><para>Let that be clear. </para><para>In developing this legislation, the Government has been conscious of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly or unnecessarily encroaching on the individual rights and liberties that are fundamental to our democratic system.</para><para>In the process of developing this Bill, the Government has done everything it can to ensure concerns raised about the Bill have been taken into consideration.</para><para>The Government has included significant safeguards in the Bill to ensure rights and liberties are appropriately protected.</para><para>And the Government has made significant amendments to the Bill to address concerns that have been raised.</para><para>For example, in an effort to achieve Opposition support for the Bill we agreed to a 3-year sunset clause, despite the fact that we do not believe that a sunset clause is appropriate.</para><para>The Government's position on this Bill has always been consistent and clear.</para><para>Our intelligence agency needs this Bill to give it the tools it needs to help fight terrorism.</para><para>The Government is committed to protecting the Australian community against terrorism.</para><para>And the Government is committed to providing these tools.</para><para>But we are not prepared to accept amendments that will render the Bill impotent or unworkable.</para><para>Our intelligence agency has indicated that it would rather no legislation at all than a fig leaf.</para><para>We intend to do whatever we can to deliver workable and appropriate legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Scrutiny of the Bill</inline></para><para>Let's not forget that this Bill has been subject to the highest levels of scrutiny. </para><para>It was considered by three parliamentary committees.</para><para>And the reports of those Committees were invaluable in assisting the Government to refine the Bill.</para><para>For example, in accordance with recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the Bill will not apply to anyone under 14.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Warrants </inline></para><para>The Bill empowers ASIO to seek a warrant which allows the detention and questioning of persons who may have information that may assist in preventing terrorist attacks before they occur. </para><para>In order to prevent potential terrorist attacks, we must enhance the powers of ASIO to gather relevant intelligence in relation to terrorism offences.</para><para>While ASIO is empowered to seek search warrants, computer access warrants, tracking device warrants, telecommunications interception warrants and to inspect postal articles, ASIO is not currently empowered to obtain a warrant to question a person who has information about a potential terrorist attack.</para><para>The Bill establishes a warrant process to allow ASIO to question a person who may have important information relating to a terrorist attack. </para><para>A person subject to a warrant may be detained by police for up to 48 hours to allow ASIO to question them.</para><para>The Government recognises the need to do everything it can to ensure the security of the community while not encroaching unnecessarily on individual rights and avoiding the potential for abuse. </para><para>The Government has done everything it can to achieve those aims.</para><para>It must be remembered that these warrants are a measure of last resort. </para><para>It is anticipated that they will be used rarely and only in extreme circumstances.</para><para>The Bill contains a significant number of hurdles that must be achieved before a warrant is issued.</para><para>In order for ASIO to detain and question a person, the Director-General of Security must obtain the consent of the Attorney-General before seeking a warrant from an `issuing authority'.</para><para>The Attorney-General must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective.</para><para>If the warrant being sought requires a person to be taken into custody immediately and detained, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied of a number of conditions.</para><para>Importantly, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the person may alert another person involved in a terrorism offence of the investigation, or the person may fail to appear before the prescribed authority, or the person may alter or destroy a record or thing that they may be requested to produce.</para><para>Without this provision, terrorists could be warned before they are caught, planned acts of terrorism known to ASIO could be rescheduled rather than prevented, and valuable evidence could be destroyed.</para><para>If the warrant concerns a person between the ages of 14 and 18, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence.</para><para>An `issuing authority' will either be a federal magistrate, a federal judge or another authority set out in regulations. </para><para>In the extraordinary situation of a warrant resulting in a person being detained for more than 96 consecutive hours, only a federal judge or another authority specified in regulations can be the issuing authority.</para><para>An `issuing authority' may only issue a warrant if it has been requested in accordance with the proper procedure and it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important to a terrorism offence.</para><para>A warrant issued under the Bill will require a person to appear before a `prescribed authority' to provide information or produce documents or things. </para><para>A prescribed authority will either be a person who has previously been a judge of the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court, Supreme or District Court of a State or Territory. </para><para>If there are insufficient people in this category, the Attorney-General may appoint a person currently serving as a judge in a State or Territory Supreme Court or District Court, or, as a final choice, the President or Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>The warrant may request that a person appear at a particular time or order the person to be taken into custody to be brought before the prescribed authority.</para><para>If a person is to be taken into custody immediately and detained, this will be the responsibility of the police, normally the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>In some situations, a person with highly relevant information may refuse to volunteer it.</para><para>For example, a terrorist sympathiser who may know of a planned bombing of a busy building, but who will not actually take part in the bombing, may decline to help authorities prevent the attack.</para><para>In order for the new powers to be effective, penalties must apply to those who fail to answer questions accurately or produce documents or other requested things.</para><para>The maximum penalty for the offences will be five years imprisonment.</para><para>A person will not be able to decline to give information or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to incriminate them.</para><para>However, evidence obtained as a result of the questioning will only be available for use in offences related to non-compliance with a warrant issued under the Bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Safeguards</inline></para><para>The Bill contains a number of safeguards to ensure that ASIO's powers are exercised reasonably and that a person is treated fairly whilst in custody or detention.</para><para>Questioning of a person under a warrant will always take place before a prescribed authority.</para><para>When a person first appears before the prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant, the prescribed authority must explain what the warrant authorises ASIO to do, the period the warrant is to be in force and the possibility of facing criminal sanctions if the person does not cooperate.</para><para>It must also advise the person that they have the right to seek a remedy from a federal court in relation to the warrant or their treatment under the warrant and this information must be provided when the person first appears before the prescribed authority and at least once in every 24 hour period subsequently.</para><para>A prescribed authority may also give directions under the warrant regarding the detention of the person, including permitting the person to contact another person. </para><para>The directions must be consistent with the warrant and any changes to the warrant approved by the Minister in writing.</para><para>The Bill includes a special regime for questioning young people. Warrants cannot be issued in relation to a person who is under the age of 14. </para><para>A warrant may be issued in relation to young people between the ages of 14 and 18 only if the Attorney-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence. </para><para>Access to a lawyer can not be delayed for young people.</para><para>And young people questioned under a warrant will have the right to contact a security-cleared lawyer and to have a parent, guardian or other representative present at all times.</para><para>All persons detained under a warrant will have the right to contact an `approved lawyer'.</para><para>All warrants authorising the taking of a person into custody and detaining them must provide that the person may access an approved lawyer. </para><para>An `approved lawyer' will be a legal practitioner of at least 5 years experience who has been approved by the Attorney-General after undergoing a security clearance.</para><para>In exceptional circumstances, access to an approved lawyer may be delayed for up to 48 hours. </para><para>In order to delay access to an approved lawyer, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that it is likely that a terrorism offence is being or is about to be committed and may have serious consequences. </para><para>However, after 48 hours, all persons will have the absolute right to contact an approved lawyer.</para><para>A person subject to a warrant has a right to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) in relation to ASIO, and to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in relation to the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>The IGIS will be empowered to advise the prescribed authority of any concerns he or she may have about the legality or propriety of ASIO's actions. The prescribed authority may direct that the questioning be suspended until it is satisfied that the IGIS's concerns have been addressed.</para><para>The person must also be treated with humanity and with respect for human dignity, and must not be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, by anyone exercising authority under the warrant or implementing or enforcing a direction of the prescribed authority. </para><para>In addition, the Director-General must ensure that video recordings are made of a person's appearance before a prescribed authority for questioning and any matter or thing that the prescribed authority directs to be recorded.</para><para>There are significant penalties for officers who do not follow the stringent processes and safeguards in the Bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Additional safeguards</inline></para><para>During debate on a previous version of the Bill, the Government moved a number of amendments to the Bill that added to the already extensive safeguards contained in the Bill.</para><para>The Bill now clarifies that an ordinary or frisk search of a person must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex.</para><para>Significant amendments were made to the `prescribed authority' provisions.</para><para>For example, the Bill now explicitly requires the prescribed authority to explain the warrant to the person being questioned, outline that person's rights, and explain the role of the prescribed authority and the role of every other person present during the questioning.</para><para>There are new safeguards to ensure that an interpreter must be provided at the request of the person being questioned.</para><para>The interpreter will also be provided at the request of the prescribed authority.</para><para>The Bill now requires that there be a written statement of procedures which must be followed in the exercise of authority under a warrant.</para><para>And no action can be taken under a warrant until these procedures have been adopted in accordance with the requirements of the legislation.</para><para>If these procedures are contravened, a person will have the right to lodge a complaint with the Inspector-General or the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</para><para>The Bill includes important measures to ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the exercise of powers under a warrant.</para><para>ASIO's unclassified annual report must include a statement of the total number of requests made to the Attorney-General and to issuing authorities for warrants during the year and the actual number of warrants issued during the year. </para><para>The annual report must also include the number of warrants issued during the year that require a person to appear before a prescribed authority and the number of warrants issued that authorised a person to be detained.</para><para>And ASIO will now be required to publish (in the Organisation's unclassified report to Parliament) statistics including the number of hours each person appeared before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant.</para><para>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate will be asked to review the new provisions and provide a report on their operation.</para><para>The Government is mindful of the need for strong laws to protect our national security, yet preserve individual rights.</para><para>The Bill achieves those aims.</para><para>This Bill was not created on a whim but in response to identified needs.</para><para>Australia's profile as a terrorist target has risen and we remain on a heightened security alert. </para><para>In November 2002, the Government issued a security alert in response to credible information of a possible terrorist attack in Australia at some time in the months following November.</para><para>Our interests abroad also face a higher level of terrorist threat.</para><para>Terrorism is not like ordinary crime.</para><para>The way terrorist networks are organised and the destruction that acts of terrorism cause, distinguish terrorism from other types of crime.</para><para>The Howard Government takes very seriously its responsibility to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests against the threat of terrorism.</para><para>That is why this Bill was developed.</para><para>That is why the Government has cooperated as far as is possible in ensuring the legislation addresses legitimate concerns without making the Bill unworkable.</para><para>That is why the Government pursued discussions with the Opposition for months in order to find a way to negotiate passage of the Bill. </para><para>It is regrettable and alarming that, in December last year, the Opposition chose politics over community safety, and attempted to amend this legislation in a way that would have made it unworkable. </para><para>The Opposition denied the community vital protection at a time of continuing grave uncertainty in the international security environment.</para><para>And that uncertainty has not abated.</para><para>This Bill is a decisive, yet measured response to the new security environment.</para><para>When the Bill is enacted, we will have appropriate laws to protect the community from terrorism while ensuring that the rights of individuals are not unnecessarily impeded.</para><para>I call on the Opposition to support this vital legislation and not delay its passage any longer.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate

2002</para><para>The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is the central element of the Commonwealth and State legislative package to implement the April 2002 Leaders' Summit agreement.</para><para>The Bill will draw on references of State power in re-enacting terrorism offences enacted earlier this year.</para><para>The federal legislation enacted earlier this year creates a number of offences in relation to terrorist acts, terrorist organisations and terrorist financing.</para><para>Those offences were based on existing Commonwealth constitutional power.</para><para>As the Commonwealth Constitution does not give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to `terrorism' as such, the offences rely on a `patchwork' of existing constitutional powers.</para><para>The patchwork of existing Commonwealth constitutional powers is extensive but it is also complex.</para><para>It is impossible to rule out unforeseen gaps in the coverage offered by offences based on existing powers.</para><para>Arguments about possible gaps could be exploited by people trying to avoid prosecution.</para><para>The reference of powers by the States, and the enactment of this Bill, will rule out these kinds of arguments.</para><para>It will ensure comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences.</para><para>The Bill will re-enact Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, which contains the terrorism offences enacted in June and amended in October this year, so that it attracts the support of the State references of power.</para><para>The Bill will, in effect, re-enact the terrorist act offences in Division 101, terrorist organisations offences in Division 102, and the financing terrorism offences in Division 103.</para><para>Once re-enacted, terrorism offences will be capable of operating throughout Australia, without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers.</para><para>The Government is committed to ensuring that our laws are as watertight as possible. </para><para>This Bill and the referral of powers by the States will do just that.</para><para>They will rule out arguments about potential gaps in the Commonwealth's powers in certain specific circumstances.</para><para>The States will have referred powers to the Commonwealth, so that there can be no question over the legitimacy of the counter-terrorism laws.</para><para>The Bill does not affect the substance of the current offences.</para><para>The re-enacted offences will be in the same terms as the current offences, but for the constitutional `reading down' provisions.</para><para>The Government has already taken action under the current provisions.</para><para>Regulations have been made specifying organisations as `terrorist organisations' for the purpose of the terrorist organisation offences.</para><para>The Bill includes transitional provisions so that these regulations will continue to have effect after commencement of the new provisions.</para><para>In addition to referring the `text' of the federal legislation, the States are also referring the power to amend the legislation.</para><para>The Bill reflects the Commonwealth's agreement with the States and Territories that future amendments will not be made without the approval of a majority of the States and Territories (and of at least 4 States).</para><para>An inter-governmental agreement is also being developed to support this understanding.</para><para>The Bill includes provisions to prevent any inadvertent displacement of State laws.</para><para>It allows for the concurrent operation of State offences that might deal with similar activity.</para><para>It also includes a regulation-making mechanism to `roll-back' aspects of the provisions to accommodate certain specified State and Territory legislation if that should prove necessary or appropriate.</para><para>The new Commonwealth provisions will commence on a date to be proclaimed.</para><para>This is to ensure that all States have enough time to complete their references.</para><para>I welcome the action already taken by the States to implement the agreement reached at the April 2002 Leaders' Summit.</para><para>References of power have been passed, or are awaiting assent, in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia. </para><para>Reference legislation has been introduced in the Western Australian parliament.</para><para>Victoria is yet to introduce, but has indicated it will do so.</para><para>Since the September 11 attacks, the Howard Government has acted swiftly to introduce new policy measures and legislation, and to provide more resources for our security and intelligence agencies to bolster Australia's ability to combat terrorism.</para><para>The recent attacks in Bali have strengthened our resolve to put these measures in place as a matter of urgency.</para><para>The Commonwealth appreciates the States' efforts in responding quickly to the national need, and I look forward to the commencement of the legislation as soon as possible.</para><para>This Bill is part of a counter-terrorism legislative package that delivers on the Howard Government's commitment to ensure we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism.</para><para>—————</para><para>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</para><para>The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002 forms part of the arrangements to provide a funding mechanism for the wheat industry to meet the operational costs of the Wheat Export Authority (WEA). In order to raise the main stream revenue for the continued operation of the WEA it is proposed that a charge will be applied to all exports of wheat, commencing during the first half of next year. This would be implemented through regulations under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999.</para><para>The Bill's main purpose is to provide for the appropriation to the WEA of monies paid to the Commonwealth as the wheat export charge amounts. </para><para>With the privatisation of wheat marketing and financing arrangements in 1999 through the grower controlled company, AWB Ltd, the regulatory and monitoring activities associated with the single desk for export wheat were passed to the WEA which operates under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. AWB (International) Ltd (AWBI), the wholly owned subsidiary of AWB Ltd responsible for maximising net returns to growers through export sales and pooling, was granted the single desk export right for wheat which had been held by the former Australian Wheat Board.</para><para>The Government has repeatedly confirmed its support for the wheat single desk while ever there is a benefit to Australian wheat growers and the nation's export performance. At the same time it is recognised that there needs to be flexibility to allow other exporters to take advantage of market opportunities. This is an important function of the WEA through its consent system which allows for both long term (12 month) and short term (3 month) consents. These principles as they apply to the this function of the WEA will be spelt out in the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 through an amendment included in the current Bill.</para><para>The other key functions of the WEA are monitoring AWBI's export performance and reporting on the benefits to growers; and conducting a review before 2004 of AWBI's use of its export rights. The opportunity has been taken with this Bill to make a number of minor amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to improve the operational efficiency of the WEA and to strengthen its powers to monitor compliance by exporters.</para><para>It is appropriate that the wheat industry rather than the Government should fund the WEA since wheat growers are the main beneficiaries of the WEA and the single desk. Although the Government receives a monitoring report each year from the WEA on AWBI's performance, it is growers and the industry which receive the potential benefits from that performance. A separate report is made available annually by the WEA to all growers so that they can make an assessment of the value of the management of the single desk to their interests.</para><para>Industry funding is consistent with the situation prior to 1999 when growers paid for the regulatory aspects of the single desk through pool administration costs. Similarly, the $6 million interim `seed funding' for the WEA came essentially from grower money held in reserves of the former Australian Wheat Board. This initial resource is expected to be fully utilised by WEA around the end of its 2002/03 financial year which is why a new, on-going funding arrangement is required if the WEA is to continue to undertake its statutory functions.</para><para>An export charge on wheat, combined with the introduction of application fees for consents through separate regulations not related to this Bill, provides an equitable and simple means to ensure that those who benefit from the services of the WEA will meet its costs. To the extent that the charge is deducted from pool returns by AWBI, or from grower sales to exporters, only those growers who produce wheat for export, rather than those servicing the domestic market, will be funding the WEA. Consideration will be given to allowing growers some say in recommending an appropriate level of charge to meet the reasonable budget requirements of the WEA. </para><para>The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 already provides for the introduction by regulation of an application fee for consents. It is intended to activate these provisions from next year, even if the fee is only for a token amount. This will ensure that the WEA's costs related to processing consent applications will be recovered, at least partly, from those who directly benefit from the availability of export consents. A fee will also discourage non-genuine applications which could disrupt the WEA's administration and raise its costs unnecessarily.</para><para>The WEA's monitoring role and annual report to growers are important means to ensure the management of the single desk delivers the potential benefits available. These findings will feed into the 2004 review which the WEA is required to conduct under the wheat legislation. That review will examine AWBI's use of its single desk rights and not the existence of the single desk itself. It will provide a basis for growers to decide whether or not the current arrangements should remain or be modified. If needs be, they can bring forward a case for the Government's consideration.</para><para>This Bill, when combined with proposed export charge and consent application fee regulations, reflects the Government's commitment to the future of the wheat industry and the single desk. It provides the means to secure the on-going funding of the WEA. The wheat industry has a significant influence on the well-being of regional Australia as well as being a major contributor to Australia's export earnings. The 2004 review by the WEA of AWBI's use of its export rights will provide the opportunity for a rigorous assessment so that grower and community interests will continue to benefit from the arrangements.</para><para>—————</para><para>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2002</para><para>The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 makes a series of minor amendments to the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.</para><para>Schedule 1 to the Bill makes an amendment to the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 to enhance the operation of section 54 of that Act. Section 54 empowers the Australian Communications Authority to make a written determination defining expressions used in its legal instruments. Due to the effect of sections 46A and 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the ACA cannot apply, adopt or incorporate certain documents including legal instruments within a determination made under section 54 of the ACA Act 1997.</para><para>The proposed amendment contained in Schedule 1 to the Bill will allow the ACA to incorporate other documents by reference when making a written determination under section 54 and, in doing so, will make section 54 consistent with the existing determination powers under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992.</para><para>Schedule 2 to the Bill also makes a number of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to exempt from the application of that Act certain documents related to the administration of Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act, which has operated since 1 January 2000, provides the regulatory framework for the control of illegal or offensive online material. This framework enables the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate complaints from the public about online content, including material that is, or would be, refused classification or classified X by the Classification Board.  </para><para>Since the release of material acquired during the course of an ABA investigation would undermine the policy and objects of the framework, it has become necessary to ensure that such material in the possession of the ABA is adequately protected. Once material is released under the FOI Act, the subsequent use or dissemination of that material cannot be controlled. The amendment contained in Schedule 2 to the Bill will ensure that material containing prohibited, or potentially prohibited, online content or the means of accessing such content is specifically exempt from disclosure under the FOI Act.</para><para>Schedule 3 to the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 in relation to law enforcement bodies. Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies use licensed radiocommunications devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal and anti-corruption investigations. Covert surveillance devices are usually operated under warrants issued by Commonwealth, State or Territory courts and for evidentiary value must also be properly licensed under the Radiocommunications Act.  </para><para>The proposed amendments contained in Schedule 3 to the Bill will enable the ACA, by disallowable instrument, to exempt the personnel of certain law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies from the operation of some sections of the Radiocommunications Act dealing with unlicensed transmissions, equipment standards and interference emissions. These bodies do not fall within the traditional definition of a “police force”. </para><para>The amendments to the Radiocommunications Act will also streamline the licensing provisions of the Radiocommunications Act to enable specified bodies to lawfully operate covert surveillance devices for the specific purpose of investigating serious crime and corruption. </para><para>The proposed provisions will also expand the objects clause of the Radiocommunications Act to provide that an object of the Radiocommunications Act is to make adequate provision of the radiofrequency spectrum for use by agencies involved in the defence or national security of Australia, law enforcement and emergency services and for use by other public or community services. </para><para>Schedule 4 to the Bill makes one amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1997 to abolish the specially-constituted Australian Communications Authority. In 1998, a `specially-constituted ACA' (SC-ACA) was established under the Telecommunications Act comprising the Chairman of the ACA and six specialist `eligible associate members'. The primary purpose of the specially-constituted ACA is to consider carrier applications for facilities installation permits under Schedule 3 to the Telecommunications Act. In the SC-ACA's four years of operation, no such applications have been made. Accordingly, it is proposed to abolish the `specially-constituted ACA' , by repealing clause 40 of the Telecommunications Act with effect from 1 April 2003, the date on which the appointments of the eligible associate members expire. The Australian Communications Authority will then assume any residual responsibilities. </para><para>Schedule 5 to the Bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 in relation to the National Relay Service, the revocation or variation of a customer service guarantee standard and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Scheme.  </para><para>The National Relay Service or NRS provides people who are deaf or hearing or speech impaired with access to a standard telephone service on terms comparable to the terms on which other Australians have access to that service. The NRS is provided by the Australian Communications Exchange under contract with the Commonwealth and is funded by a quarterly levy imposed on telecommunications carriers, with contributions based on shares of telecommunications revenue.  </para><para>The collapse of One.Tel highlighted problems with the existing funding arrangements for the NRS as One.Tel continued to accumulate an NRS levy debt under the existing provisions of the Act which could not be reallocated to other carriers and had to be absorbed by the Commonwealth.</para><para>The proposed amendments in Schedule 5 to the Bill will improve the mechanisms for the effective funding of the NRS and provide for a carrier's NRS levy liability to be determined by reference to the carrier's operation in the industry in the period for which the levy is assessed. It will also allow the Minister to modify, by written determination, the formula for calculating each carrier's NRS levy contribution and enable the ACA to vary assessments of a carrier's NRS levy contributions.</para><para>A customer service guarantee standard made by the ACA under section 115 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The proposed amendment to section 125 of that Act will clarify that a revocation or variation of a customer service guarantee standard made under section 115 is also a disallowable instrument.</para><para>The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) was established in 1993 under the Telecommunications Act 1991 as a free dispute resolution scheme for residential and small business consumers. All carriers and eligible carriage service providers (including Internet service providers) are required to be members of the TIO scheme.</para><para>A TIO member is charged a complaint handling fee when the TIO receives a complaint from one of the member's customers which acts as an incentive for members to develop and maintain effective complaint handling and customer service procedures. Since there have been instances where the TIO complaint handling fee has been passed on to customers, the Bill contains an amendment to clarify that end-users are not liable for any charge in relation to complaints made to the TIO about their telephone or Internet service.</para><para>The Bill also makes an amendment to clarify that paragraph 128(6)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides that the TIO scheme must not investigate complaints on tariff levels, does not preclude the investigation by the TIO of complaints about tariff levels pertaining to charges or fees not directly related to the supply of telecommunications carriage services, such as early contract termination fees for mobile phone services. </para><para>—————</para><para>TERRORISM INSURANCE BILL 2002</para><para>Since the terrible events in the United States of 11 September 2001, we have witnessed a world-wide withdrawal of commercial insurance coverage for terrorism risk. </para><para>In Australia, there is virtually no traditional terrorism risk insurance available for commercial properties and infrastructure. What limited cover is available is generally regarded as too expensive by the market, and remains unsold. </para><para>The withdrawal of terrorism insurance results from a market failure—the lack of adequate information to price the risks arising from terrorism. The risks are very difficult to assess for insurance purposes as terrorist events may be infrequent, but are likely to result in significant consequences.</para><para>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority advises that the potential for a high payout from a low probability event is not a risk that can be managed through increased capital or through increased premiums.</para><para>As such, an adequate supply of terrorism risk insurance does not appear likely to return in the short-to-medium term—in either the domestic or global markets.</para><para>The Government is concerned that this lack of comprehensive insurance cover for commercial property or infrastructure may lead to less financing and investment in the Australian property sector; and consequentially, wider economic impacts.</para><para>Commercial property owners, banks, superannuation funds and funds managers have been forced to assume insurance risk as existing policies reached their expiry date and were renewed excluding previously-provided terrorism risk cover. These institutions are not set up to manage insurance risk, and in the case of some bodies, notably superannuation funds, are specifically precluded from absorbing such risks.</para><para>In addition, the Australian Bankers' Association has advised that there is a risk that financiers will be unprepared to provide finance to some large projects or large scale infrastructure if terrorism cover is withdrawn and the new assets are exposed to an uninsurable risk. In the United States, such risks have already materialised, with one recent survey estimating that $US15.5 billion worth of construction projects have been suspended because of a lack of comprehensive insurance cover. </para><para>Until such time as the risks from terrorism are considered sufficiently small that insurers are willing to cover them once again; or until the industry develops an appropriate method for pricing those risks, Government intervention will be needed to fill the gap. </para><para>To ensure comprehensive coverage, terrorism risk cover will also need to be extended to cover business interruption and public liability risks associated with commercial property.</para><para>A number of our OECD counterparts have reached this same conclusion. France, Germany and the United States, for example, each recently established Government schemes to address the current problem of lack of commercial insurance for risks arising from terrorism. </para><para>In establishing this scheme to provide reinsurance for terrorism, the Government is mindful of the need also to foster the re-emergence of a commercial insurance market in this area. The Government therefore will be closely monitoring developments in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets both domestically and globally. The Government intends to wind-down its scheme, and ultimately withdraw from the market completely, once adequate commercial provision of terrorism risk insurance has re-emerged.</para><para>Debate

unprecedented in the 102 years of the Australian Senate's existence. It is a motion that calls for the resignation of a Governor-General. This motion catalogues a sad chain of events which has affected many people and has led to this week's constitutional impasse. The Senate must not be distracted by the current Victorian Supreme Court action involving Dr Hollingworth, where he is absolutely entitled to a presumption of innocence. The motion I have moved addresses the actions of Dr Hollingworth both as Archbishop of Brisbane and as Governor-General of Australia. The scourge of child abuse in the Anglican Church began well before Dr Hollingworth's time as Archbishop of the Brisbane diocese. But, when the truth came to light, it was Dr Hollingworth's failure to respond properly to the abusers and their victims which has cast grave doubt on his ability to fulfil the office of Governor-General.</para><para>Every Australian is touched by this debate about the fitness of Dr Hollingworth to stand at the apex of our constitutional system. The recent independent report into incidents of child abuse in the diocese of Brisbane has exposed a shameful series of events, a human tragedy of abused children, betrayed trust and grotesque disregard for pastoral care. And it has raised very serious concerns about Dr Hollingworth's conduct. Mr Howard announced his decision to appoint Dr Hollingworth at a press conference on 22 April 2001. At that press conference, Mr Howard said:</para><para>Look I will expect Peter Hollingworth to be his own man ... He understands the Constitution. He understands that the role ... does not invest him with the executive and political power which properly belongs to people who are accountable to the voters and not to the people who gain office according to the processes that have led to his appointment ... We've talked about it and I have no concerns ... at all. I am sure he will be the essence of a very Constitutional Governor-General.</para><para>He went on:</para><para>... when I was asked about who the next Governor-General might be I said that I would say nothing other than it would be an eminent Australian and that's really all I'm going to say about the selection process. There's just no point in questioning me about the selection process. I gave the whole matter a lot of thought. I believe that the person appointed will do an outstanding job. I believe his appointment will be warmly received in the Australian community ...</para><para>Almost a year later, in February 2002, when the sad facts about Dr Hollingworth's stewardship of the Brisbane diocese were revealed, Mr Howard added to the details about his selection process. At a press conference he was asked what sorts of checks were needed before appointing a Governor-General. This is what he said:</para><para>... of course I did not ask Archbishop Hollingworth whether there was something. I made a judgement about the man and I stand by that judgement and if that judgement is seen by some to have been fallible, well, so be it. I am not going to try and pretend. He had a high public reputation, he continues, in my view, to have a very high public reputation. But if you are asking me did I send him a form to fill out? No.</para><para>In other words, Mr Howard did not ask anyone. We know Mrs Howard is adamant that she was not taken into Mr Howard's confidence. Apparently, it was the Prime Minister alone who dreamed up the idea of appointing Dr Hollingworth. They had a quiet chat to make sure that Dr Hollingworth would not interfere in the Prime Minister's political agenda, that he would not meddle. It looks like he did not even phone a friend to check if there were any skeletons in the closet. He certainly did not agree that the onus was on him to check things out. Mr Howard said, `There's just no point in questioning me about the selection process,' and that is because there was no process, just a cosy chat. The truth is there are no selection criteria or records of process for the selection of our head of state. The appointment of the Governor-General is a matter only for the Prime Minister.</para><para>Mr Howard is not the only Prime Minister to make a grievous mistake on the appointment of a Governor-General. In last year's documentary <inline font-style="italic">Gough Whitlam</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> In His Own Words</inline>, Mr Whitlam talked about the background checks he failed to make on John Kerr. He said that it was obviously a mistake. I ask the question: has history repeated itself; has another Prime Minister failed to check the background of his choice as Governor-General?</para><para>Of course, other prime ministers have made excellent choices of Governor-General. The best recent example is the appointment of Sir William Deane by former Prime Minister Keating. We have had governors-general in Australia who admirably filled the role—non-partisan, unpretentious and admired, even loved, by the Australian people for their dedication to the strength of our democracy—governors-general who understood the constitutional prerogatives, who would have had the capacity to resolve a constitutional deadlock in satisfactory terms, who were thoughtful people, who the public could look up to. That is not the situation that we have today.</para><para>The current crisis embroils the courts, the church, the legislature, the executive and the vice-regal office. Because the letters patent have to be amended in England, it has even embroiled the Queen. The Prime Minister's response to this crisis—to stand Dr Hollingworth aside for an indeterminate period of time—is simply not good enough. The Governor-General should be a symbol of strength and unity for our nation, and that is something that Dr Hollingworth cannot be. The opposition believes that the Governor-General should resign.</para><para>The report of the diocesan board of inquiry commissioned by Archbishop Aspinall into the past handling of abuse complaints in the Brisbane diocese documented two cases in which Dr Hollingworth's judgment was found wanting—that of the Reverend John Elliot and that of Bishop Donald Shearman. The report states that in 1993 Dr Hollingworth allowed the then Reverend John Elliot to continue on in the ministry for nine more years, despite knowing that two young teenagers were sexually molested by Elliot over a number of years in the 1970s. Dr Hollingworth spoke to Elliot about the matter, and Elliot confessed to him that he had committed these crimes. Dr Hollingworth allowed a known paedophile to remain in the ministry.</para><para>It is clear from reading the Aspinall report that this was not a simple error of judgment. The way Dr Hollingworth handled the Elliot case was totally inappropriate. The Aspinall report documents a 1995 letter to Dr Hollingworth from one of Elliot's victims expressing his hurt and frustration that Dr Hollingworth would harbour a man who he knew had sexually assaulted children for years. In response, Dr Hollingworth wrote that Elliot was:</para><quote><para>... now getting close to retirement and the disruption and upset that would be caused to the whole parish as well as to him and his family would be in nobody's best interests.</para></quote><para>In the Shearman case, the Aspinall report found that Dr Hollingworth did not provide `compassionate recognition of the wrong that the complainant had suffered'. This case concerned a 15-year-old who, while resident at an Anglican hostel, had a sexual relationship with Bishop Donald Shearman—at the time an assistant priest in his late 20s working at the hostel. In 1995 the matter was referred to Dr Hollingworth for mediation. In 1996 and again in 2001, Dr Hollingworth failed to apologise or show compassion to the complainant. In 2002, Dr Hollingworth, by now the Governor-General of Australia, revealed his true feelings about this case on national television. The ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> indicated the Governor-General's view was:</para><quote><para>... this was not sex abuse. There was no suggestion of rape or anything like that. Quite the contrary, my information is that it was, rather, the other way around. </para></quote><para>After the airing of <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline>, there was a national outcry from the public. Many believed that Dr Hollingworth was defending child sex abuse. Only then did Dr Hollingworth apologise to the complainant, but he made this apology within the context that his comments on the program had been misconstrued. He claimed that he had misheard the question and had actually been referring to an adult relationship. This was just not true. The unedited tape of <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story </inline>indicated that Dr Hollingworth's comments were very clear. He was not referring to an adult relationship but to the relationship of a priest and an under-age girl.</para><para>In relation to the Elliot case, the Aspinall report has found that the Governor-General has at best a faulty recollection of events. The report goes as far as to question the content of a statutory declaration provided to the inquiry and signed by Dr Hollingworth while Governor-General in April 2003. The report says:</para><para>The Board finds that Dr Hollingworth's recollections are faulty, and that he has apparently reconstructed what he believed he was told, rather than recalled what in fact was said. Dr Hollingworth has made a statutory declaration that he believed at the relevant time the abuse was an isolated occurrence ...</para><para>The report goes on to say that the board is satisfied he was told the details of repeated abuse. It continues:</para><para>There was nothing that could have entitled Dr. Hollingworth to believe otherwise ... The Board considers that no Bishop acting reasonably could have reached the decision to continue a known paedophile in the ministry. There were no extenuating circumstances nor can the Board imagine any ... </para><para>The Aspinall report also found that Dr Hollingworth's treatment of the Elliot sexual abuse complaint was untenable. Two weeks ago, when the Aspinall report was tabled in the Queensland parliament, Dr Hollingworth expressed regret at the way he had handled the Elliot matter and he apologised to the complainant and their family. But then last week, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper of 8 May, Dr Hollingworth indicated to an unidentified close friend that he had been subjected to `illegitimate pressure'. He even compared his situation to that of Jesus Christ when he was crucified.</para><para>If Dr Hollingworth does feel he is under pressure, perhaps he can also think of the pressure that victims of sexual violence are under. Freda Briggs, one of the authors of the Aspinall report, said as much in a recent interview on ABC radio when she indicated that the prolongation of the publicity surrounding this is damaging to victims and that victims want the Governor-General to resign. In our view, these serious matters have been handled inappropriately by Dr Hollingworth, not only in his position as Archbishop of Brisbane but also while he has been Governor-General. On these matters the Governor-General's position is untenable, and I believe the Governor-General has no alternative but to resign. The vast majority of Australians have lost confidence in the Governor-General. The vast majority of Australians believe the Governor-General should go.</para><para>The office of Governor-General should be a symbol of unity and strength for the nation. The incumbent of that office has a grave and serious responsibility to preserve, protect and honour the dignity of that office. The incumbent of that office must put the interests of that office above their own interests. I also want to say this: a Prime Minister should put the national interest first. A Prime Minister must accept his responsibilities when he makes a catastrophic appointment to the highest office in the land. A Prime Minister must be able to ask for the resignation of a Governor-General who is no longer fit to hold office. A Governor-General must be impartial, independent and beyond reproach. A Governor-General must be beyond controversy. When it comes to controversy and reproach, I regret that the current incumbent will never escape either. The dignity of the office of Governor-General has been diminished enough. We must restore the sense of strength and unity that surrounds that office. If Dr Hollingworth will not resign, there is no alternative but for the Prime Minister to dismiss him. I ask the Senate to support this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10598</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This motion has been moved by the Labor Party with the support of the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats, and therefore they have the numbers for its passage.

That subject could be dealt with separately and distinct from any matter relating to the Governor-General. One would have thought that efforts would be made by those who support this motion to make out the case for a royal commission into child sex abuse in Australia. I failed to hear that case being made by Senator Faulkner.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—You will hear it shortly.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—He tells me that others are going to take up that part of the motion. But that is the first thing that is being sought by the movers of this motion. The second part of the motion that the proponents ask to be carried is that the Senate urge the Governor-General to immediately resign or, if he does not, urge the Prime Minister to in effect dismiss him or have him dismissed by the Queen.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will set aside the first part of the motion—that relating to the royal commission into child abuse. I will come back to that, because I do not think there is any dispute that the issue of child abuse is very serious, probably as serious an issue as anyone could think of, and the real issue is what could be achieved through a national royal commission into that subject. Senator Faulkner has principally dealt with the second part of the motion because the other issue was dealt with when the parliament last met. He argued that the matter of the priest Elliot arising out of the Aspinall report is so serious that Dr Hollingworth should resign as Governor-General or, if he does not, that the Prime Minister should dismiss him. Senator Faulkner has not sought to make out that any conduct of the Governor-General in the normal execution of his functions as Governor-General warrants that. It seems to relate back to Dr Hollingworth's administrative functions as the Archbishop of Brisbane in handling the Elliot case.</para><para>The first point to make is that I think anyone who has read the Aspinall report would feel that Dr Hollingworth made a serious error of judgment in that matter. The matter was brought to his attention by another bishop. It was a long time after the events had occurred; nevertheless, it came to the attention of this bishop that there had been abuse of a child or children by a Mr Elliot, as he was then. Mr Elliot had subsequently become a priest, and the matter was brought to Dr Hollingworth to deal with because the bishop to whom the complaint was made felt that he was too close to the family, particularly the wife of the then Reverend Elliot. The issue became whether this man, who was within a couple of years of retirement, should be allowed to continue his ministry or be dismissed by Dr Hollingworth. Dr Hollingworth referred him to a psychiatrist, Dr Slaughter. Dr Hollingworth took the advice of this psychiatrist, who seems to assist the church in these matters, and also consulted with two bishops.</para><para>At the end of that process, he decided that the Reverend Elliot could continue and complete his term before retirement—which was to be about two years later, at age 65—on certain conditions. Dr Hollingworth would have to tell Elliot's wife about what had occurred and seek the wife's assistance in the matter. From memory, I think a regional bishop was to play a supervisory role. There were certain matters that were attended to in such a way that Hollingworth believed he could be confident there would be no recurrence of the abuse. In these circumstances, he seemed to place weight on his responsibility as a priest, as I said in question time, to seek to forgive such a person and to seek reconciliation. That was where he concluded the matter. Obviously, there were other abuses by this man, because he was subsequently prosecuted for them. There was no suggestion that they had been brought to the attention of Dr Hollingworth.</para><para>Most people would say that it really is untenable to have someone who admits to child abuse remain as a priest. On reflection, clearly Dr Hollingworth has also reached that conclusion, because subsequently he has said that he now recognises that he made a serious error of judgment in this matter. The Aspinall report finds that he made a serious error of judgment. Dr Hollingworth accepts that he made a serious error of judgment: he believed that it was tenable for this person to continue in the priesthood whereas really he should have been removed from the priesthood and, one might have thought, also referred to the police. But one might also ask why the parents of the children did not refer it to the police when it came to their attention at that time. But, anyway, that is beside the point. My reaction would be that, if something like that comes to your attention, you would call in the police and, if the person is in a position of trust, you would get them out of the position of trust. I do not think there is any doubt about that. Also, Dr Hollingworth now accepts that that would have been the right course of action to take.</para><para>He made an error of judgment. He was not a perpetrator of any child abuse himself. There is no evidence to suggest that he condones child abuse in any way. What he did was make an error of judgment in keeping this person in the priesthood. Should he be dismissed from his subsequent office as a result of that? That takes us to the point regarding Dr Hollingworth. Senator Faulkner has been very critical of Dr Hollingworth as a result of this particular error of judgment. What Senator Faulkner has not sought to do is balance that against his lifetime contribution to our community. Why was Dr Hollingworth appointed to this job? It was not because he was an archbishop; it was because he had given a lifetime of service to the community, particularly to the poor.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—How do you know that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—Because it is on the public record.

You can criticise him on the basis of the report, but if you want to be fair in this matter—and I suggest that all parties should seek to be fair in this matter—you should also take into account his lifetime of commitment to the poor and the downtrodden and the reasons why he was regarded as a person of significant enough standing in our society that you could consider him as eligible for such a high office as this. I must say, seeing that we are all laying ourselves out here, that that was my view. My first reaction to the appointment of somebody from the church was one of some worry about potential conflicts of interest. But I saw Dr Hollingworth in a different category because—and I hope this is not misinterpreted—he was not just a priest. In terms of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and so forth, he had given his whole life to social service and was highly regarded for that public contribution. I did not hear anybody saying anything to the contrary at the time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Here we have a case of somebody who made an error of judgment, albeit acknowledged as a serious error of judgment, in his administrative function as an archbishop. He should have removed the priest Elliot. He did not do so. We now have to determine whether that error of judgment is such that it disqualifies him for his subsequent job. What I am saying is that, when one considers that, one should at least make an effort to balance it against all the good that Dr Hollingworth has done within our community—much more good than I would ever claim to have contributed. Each senator and each Australian will seek to make a judgment on that. Dr Hollingworth is obviously considering the matter also, and that is appropriate. The fact that he has been able to stand aside, not to focus on what I really think is, in some ways, an unfortunate distraction—that is, the case in Melbourne—and to focus on the issues that have arisen out of the Aspinall report is, I think, a good thing as well.</para><para>So the issue is whether he should resign. There is nothing in his conduct as Governor-General that would suggest he should resign. The issue is whether his error of judgment in a previous life was such that it has so tainted him that he should resign. As has been said, in the opinion of the Prime Minister—and it is an opinion I support—that is something for Dr Hollingworth to decide.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—You are happy with his stat declaration?

You can be critical of a number of aspects of the inquiry, but I have not sought to be critical of that because I think it really misses the point. The real point is whether the error of judgment was such that it requires him to resign.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party, obviously, is primarily interested in the Prime Minister; this is an opportunity to attack the Prime Minister. Senator Faulkner was good enough to acknowledge in his contribution that that is the case, because he says it was the Prime Minister's appointment and that the Prime Minister made a terrible error of judgment. I do not think he did make a terrible error of judgment. On the basis of the information that was available at the time, he had a candidate who, in my view, was well qualified for the task. Maybe he was different from other appointments: he did not have a military or legal background or whatever. His background was social service but, in my view, he was well qualified for the task. So now the issue is not whether an error of judgment was made at the time—that is just a smart shot—but whether the revelation of an error of judgment is such that it should lead to a different course of action.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—The protection of paedophiles.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—It is easy to say that.

In some ways, when there is a problem it is easy to say that the solution is to have a royal commission. That does not actually lead to any better outcome at all because, in this instance, we largely know what the problem is. The principal source of child abuse is actually within the home, quite often within the family. When it occurs and it is discovered it should be prosecuted; that is Mr Beattie's job. The federal government can do things. Senator Vanstone is responsible for certain intervention programs in relation to social security. There can be prevention programs. The Commonwealth can take responsibility, and we believe that we do have programs that are assisting in that regard. If it can be argued that those programs can be improved, then we would like to hear that. That would be policy that the Labor Party could actually advance. You do not need a royal commission to tell you what is the appropriate policy. That is what politicians are supposed to do.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to institutions, the problem within the churches, for example, has been acknowledged and I would like to think that, through such as the Aspinall report, the churches are making a real effort to identify their problem and to move in a way that will put children less at risk. That is certainly what they are claiming to do. I would like to see out of this a better balance, in the eyes of the church, between the victim and the perpetrator. Certainly the perpetrator might have problems and society may have some responsibility for the perpetrator, but the victim should be of primary concern. I think that within the churches that balance is sometimes being got wrong, but the churches seem to be making an effort.</para><para>There have been major issues relating to state institutions in the past.

I know that Senator Faulkner has said that the Labor Party has not yet sought to make out its case for a royal commission. We are going to hear that from subsequent speakers. I am sure that all honourable senators have thought about this matter. I know that even within the Labor Party there are differences of views on the royal commission.

All honourable senators would abhor child abuse. All honourable senators appreciate that if physical violence is involved it is a criminal offence and we would like to see the full force of the criminal law applied. We do not want to see any child abuse condoned within institutions, and we are pleased to see that there seems to be a greater community effort to face up to these issues and responsibilities.</para><para>On the call for a royal commission, the case has not yet been made. On the issue of Dr Hollingworth's conduct as Governor-General, no effort has been made to make a case for his resignation. It really comes down to a judgment as to whether, as a church administrator, his error of judgment in the Elliot case outweighs his other contributions to society that are of a positive type. Individuals can make that judgment, but in the end it is primarily for Dr Hollingworth to make that judgment, and no doubt he will. In conclusion, all I say to the Labor Party is that they might think they can win some political points against the Prime Minister on this matter, but I will be very surprised if it works out that way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10603</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I rise to speak on this motion, as will some of my other colleagues. I indicate at the outset our support for this motion. I think it is a good and comprehensive motion. It is a historic motion. It concerns matters that are very serious for the office of the Governor-General and, even more importantly, in terms of child sexual assault. It concerns issues that are often very emotional and very dark. I will try to be measured in my contribution, but I think the deep significance of the issue should not be swept aside in the interests of simply trying to appear unemotional on an issue.</para></talk.start><para>I have a bit of extra feeling for, or interest in, the specifics of the allegations in the Aspinall report, given that they relate to the Brisbane archdiocese, where I have lived my entire life, and to schools that I am very familiar with. Indeed, in Senator Hill's comments about the particular needs for Queensland especially—perhaps more than other states—to get to the bottom of issues to do with child sexual assault, I do not know if he is suggesting or implying that there are more serious issues in Queensland than in other states, but I do think some issues of history do suggest that Queensland very much could do with an inquiry. But to say that that is a matter for Peter Beattie and the Commonwealth government washes its hands of it is a cop-out.</para><para>I am very much of the view that this issue is of significance nationally and would be best dealt with nationally rather than by six or seven different state based inquiries. Whether or not there should be a state based inquiry, to try and leave those thousands of survivors of sexual assault without justice simply because the government feels that the state should do something about it is really to say to them that they do not matter, that they can be swept aside and that we will just point the finger somewhere else. Child sexual assault survivors are a bit sick of the finger being pointed somewhere else; they would like to be taken seriously.</para><para>As I said, this is a comprehensive motion and it has a number of points. I will simply refer to the ones which I think are most significant. Firstly, there is the introduction, which notes that the government has failed to respond adequately to evidence of sexual abuse of children in our society and within our public institutions. I believe that that should be supported very strongly. There has been action, particularly by the Senate. I note and commend the work of my Democrat colleague Senator Andrew Murray, who has been the prime initiator of a Senate inquiry into treatment of children in institutions who were brought to this country as orphans. Only through that inquiry was an enormous amount of material able to be made public for the first time. There is another Senate inquiry now into the treatment of other children in institutions in Australia and again, that will be very valuable for many people, but it has to be said that that in itself is not enough. This is why a national royal commission is so important. All of us in this chamber know a Senate committee can only go so far. It cannot realistically compel witnesses to appear, particularly in issues such as this. It cannot compel witnesses to answer. It cannot compel people to produce documents. It cannot use search warrants to investigate people's places. It can give parliamentary privilege to evidence, but that evidence cannot then necessarily be used in a court of law if there is a prosecution relating to it. So it is inadequate in many ways when you are talking about issues and crimes such as sexual assault.</para><para>The recent church inquiry by the Brisbane archdiocese was in itself inadequate, not through any fault of the church but because they could only do so much. As the Prime Minister, astonishingly, said last weekend, it was only a private inquiry and did not have legal standing. Of course, we all know that the only reason it was a private inquiry is that the Prime Minister refused the request of the Anglican Church to establish a judicial inquiry or a royal commission. If he had done that in the first place we would have been able to have a legally based inquiry—many more people would have had the opportunity to provide evidence and we would not have had all these red herrings about natural justice suddenly being thrown out.</para><para>I suggest that it probably would even have been in Dr Hollingworth's interest to have a broader and fuller inquiry into the whole situation rather than simply focusing on a few cases surrounding him. That is another error of judgment this Prime Minister has made. It highlights again why a royal commission is the only way to get to the bottom of this issue comprehensively, completely and effectively, providing justice and a platform for the survivors and providing a fair process and all the protections of an inquiry and the legal process for any people who are accused. It is astonishing, I believe, that the Prime Minister is continuing to ignore what is so clearly a fundamental and serious area.</para><para>Other parts of the motion, parts (1)(f) and (1)(g), relate specifically to the Governor-General and state that in the opinion of the Senate:</para><para>the Governor-General is now no longer able to fulfil his symbolic role as a figure of unity for the Australian people.</para><para>That is quite clear. Whether or not that is fair is an issue I will get to later, but it is simply a matter of fact. In addition, the following paragraph states:</para><para>the Governor-General is now no longer able to exercise the constitutional powers of the Office in a manner that will be seen as impartial and non-partisan;</para><para>Again, that is clearly just a statement of fact. The constitutional powers of the office may not be used that often, but when they are they are very important and to have any taint of partiality in those decisions is a serious matter indeed. It is the highest office in the country. The functions of the office are wide ranging and the powers are significant—they may not be used often, but they are significant. The Governor-General is the one person who has the power to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister. He is responsible for assenting to every new Australian law and he has the power to dissolve both houses of parliament if certain constitutional requirements are met. It is fundamental that the person who fills this office hold the respect and confidence of the majority of the Australian people. I believe a lack of confidence in the Governor-General casts a significant shadow on the foundations of our system of government. That is partly why this motion is so important and so serious. It has been moved in a house of the Australian parliament—the Senate, which reflects the views and composition of the Australian people more directly than does the lower house—and notes that the Governor-General is now no longer able to exercise the two major aspects of his role—his symbolic role and his constitutional role. Whether you call that a censure motion or a no-confidence motion, as the Democrats initially flagged some weeks back—and I would suggest that this is probably even stronger than a no-confidence motion—it is very comprehensive, and that is why we support it. </para><para>There have been some critics in the community. One of those critics, who comes from Queensland, is Terry O'Gorman. He has a strong record as an upholder of civil liberties over many years and has been outspoken for some time about the need to ensure that the rights and civil liberties of accused sex offenders and accused paedophiles are protected. It is important that we get the balance right. In my view, the balance has been wrong for many years, protecting the accused and known offenders at the expense of victims and survivors. We still have a way to go to get that balance right.</para><para>I totally reject suggestions that these debates about the Governor-General are somehow a witch-hunt. This is a public office. This is the highest office in the land and you cannot expect that office to be immune from public commentary, particularly when it is an office that the public have no say in appointing. We cannot criticise and then vote out the Governor-General; the Governor-General is appointed solely on the say-so of one person, the Prime Minister. To suggest that this office, which in some ways is meant to represent us all as a nation, is immune from public criticism is simply extraordinary. To suggest that we cannot raise an issue as fundamental and as serious as child sexual assault when there are clear questions around the actions of the person who currently holds that position because we might get accused of conducting a witch-hunt is, again, simply of no foundation.</para><para>I do not enjoy criticising individual people in any context. I certainly do not enjoy calling on people to resign from positions or publicly criticising them strongly, as I have been doing, but as leader of a parliamentary party, I have a responsibility—and I believe we all have the responsibility—to remember the many thousands of victims of sexual assault who have not had their voices heard, who have been ignored and who have not been treated seriously. I admit that I am more concerned about those damaged people who need support than I am about the Governor-General. I am sure he is much more able to answer for himself, for starters, and to be in a position where he can have people defend him. Many people who have survived or endured child sexual assault have had nobody to defend them or stand up for them and it is well and truly beyond time that we now start to do so. Again, the other part of the motion that I believe is most important and significant is the call on the Prime Minister to establish a royal commission into child sexual abuse.</para><para>I have made my view clear—as have the Democrats, as have many other people around the country—that the Governor-General should resign. Other people have a different view. In my view, if the Governor-General stays in the office, the office will continue to be severely compromised and the Prime Minister will be seen to be continuing to not address the issue. If the Governor-General stays in the office, I believe it will continue to send a signal that the Prime Minister and the Governor-General do not believe child sexual assault is a serious enough issue and that it can just be dismissed as not that big a deal.</para><para>That is a terrible message to the Australian people. I think it will send a particularly painful message to people who have been touched by child sexual assault, whether they are survivors or the families of survivors. But that is even less important than the need to address this issue on a comprehensive basis. If the Governor-General stays in office, it is unfortunate; it is not the end of the world. But it is quite literally the end of the world for many people if they cannot get their voices heard about this issue.</para><para>The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, mentioned that the Governor-General came from a social services background, rather than some of the other traditional backgrounds for governors-general. I think that is probably a good thing. As people may know, my background is in social work and community work. I do not profess to be a complete expert on the issue, but I have had contact and done work with individuals who have had their lives absolutely destroyed by sexual assault and sexual abuse. That basic fact should not be forgotten. This destroys lives, and that is why it is literally for some people the end of the world, the end of their world, if they are not able to get justice.</para><para>Another reason why the Democrats believe a royal commission is so important is for the children of today and the future. In some ways, it is too late—far too late—for many people, but we must do what we can to ensure that everything is done to prevent this occurring. We all live in an imperfect world. I am not being utopian. There will always be these sorts of acts committed. But we can do an enormous amount better. It is true, as Senator Hill said, that the majority of sexual assaults and sexual abuses occur within families or extended families, amongst people known to the victim. There are issues there as well.</para><para>But we also need to look at our institutions, both those institutions that care for children and those various departments that work with families. We see repeated inquiries, repeated acknowledgements by governments, by people in the field that the resources and the processes of those departments are not adequate. To say that is just a state issue is simply a cop-out. This federal government provides enormous amounts of funding. Some may argue about whether it is enough in specific areas, but we provide an enormous amounts of funding at the Commonwealth level to states to undertake certain activities.</para><para>What this federal government should be doing—something a royal commission can quite comprehensively do—is putting in place a set of standards, of benchmarks that must be met, whether it is by state departments, whether it is by churches, whether it is by sporting groups, whether it is by schools; you do not get money, you do not function, you do not have the right to oversee the care of children unless you have your act together.</para><para>Some organisations have got better in recent years—we have started to move towards screening of people who have contact with children, with criminal checks, character checks, mandatory reporting, putting in place procedures for dealing with complaints—but I do not think anybody could suggest that we do not still have a long way to go. I would suggest that it is not only clearly in the interests of survivors and institutions but in the interests of the government to have a proper, decent, comprehensive inquiry that can look into this fully, because there are plenty of other instances out there. Anybody in this place who has raised these issues—and I am sure Senator Murray would affirm this—knows that all you have to do is show an interest in trying to raise these issues and promote these issues and you will have people coming to you who are desperate to get their situation addressed, to be acknowledged.</para><para>There are plenty of other cases, other situations, other dioceses, other churches where cases will come to light in the future. If the government wants to have them dribble out, case by case, instance by instance, month after month, year after year, repeatedly being shown that they could have acted and have not, I would suggest that is not in their political interests. Of course, I am not particularly interested in the political interests of the government, or the rest of us, when we are talking about this issue; I am interested in getting action to try to prevent this sort of issue from coming to the fore.</para><para>There have been over 100 clergy from the Catholic and Anglican churches alone who have been convicted of child sexual assault in the past five years with thousands of assaults on children, allegations that have been put forward by the Voices group in Australia's first sexual assault class action. The particular report and incident we are talking about relate to simply one diocese of one church in relation to a small number of cases in a specific period of time. There is an argument that has not been put forward today but has been put forward by some in the community that we should stop criticising the Governor-General because, sure, he made a mistake but it was a long time ago; standards were different back then. Firstly, I do not think 1993 was that long ago; nor was 1998 or 1999. The fact is that hundreds of thousands of Australians are still paying a terrible price for these so-called standards. I am not sure that they were ever official standards—in fact, they certainly were not; they were unspoken, institutionalised standards—but they deserve to be highlighted as completely inadequate and should be condemned. The only way of doing that is by sending a message that the government should take this seriously. The Senate certainly takes this seriously.</para><para>We can all say individually that this is a serious issue, but that does not cut it with people anymore. People want action; people want direct acknowledgment. We have to acknowledge that the actions of Dr Hollingworth in his previous role were not that long ago, were grossly inadequate, put children at risk and put the interests of the institution and the perpetrator—someone who was later convicted—ahead of the interests of the victims. We as a house of parliament or as people who are in leadership roles in the community cannot simply wave that away as a simple error of judgment. That is why I believe we as a Senate need to send a strong message, and that is why I believe the Governor-General and the Prime Minister should send a strong message. It is not pleasant; no-one is suggesting it is. I am not saying the Governor-General should be tarred and feathered for the rest of his life. All I am saying is that he is no longer adequate to perform in the position that he is in. It would send a very strong positive message about child sexual assault if he were to recognise that and stand down.</para><para>In any case the Democrats—and I urge others in this chamber to do the same—continue to push for action on the issue of a royal commission because it is what we believe is necessary. We believe that it is the best way forward on this issue. It should continue in many ways beyond the debate about the Governor-General—that simply serves to draw attention to the importance of the issue. We need to get action for people. The Prime Minister said today in question time, `Some people say you're better off spending $60 million on services than on a royal commission.' If that means the government is going to announce an extra $60 million in spending, that is great, but let us have a royal commission as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>10608</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think anyone in this chamber would quarrel with the proposition that child sexual abuse is one of the most repulsive crimes that one can imagine. We now know from recent painful episodes and a lot of heart-rending stories that it can often have devastating and lifelong consequences. I do not think we should proceed on the basis that it is necessary to have a royal commission when in recent years there has been almost an avalanche of evidence to indicate the nature and extent of the problem. One can always say that there may be more to be uncovered, but the real issue is how you tackle that. Difficult though it may be, the problem is multifaceted and in many respects originates from family problems. That being the case, there is a very good argument that more attention should be given to devising solutions that are likely to deal with the problem.</para></talk.start><para>I remember the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which I think cost the Commonwealth some $60 million. It came up with a whole series of recommendations which did not shed any serious light on what most people in the community already appreciated. It did not do anything to alleviate the problems, although it certainly made a lot of lawyers a bit wealthier. But, at the end of the day, I do not think anyone would seriously argue that it was a major step forward in trying to address a very serious social problem.</para><para>Firstly, we are being asked to establish a royal commission and, secondly, the Governor-General is being called on to resign immediately. This has to be seen in the context of recent events. Certainly, there is no doubt that in recent days events have moved very quickly. Regarding the decision by Dr Hollingworth to stand aside, particularly to give himself more time to defend himself against the allegations that have been made in respect of events occurring some 40 years ago, and which may well result in serious litigation in Victorian courts, and also for him to ultimately consider his overall position with regard to the importance of the role that he occupies, I would have thought that was a fair and just approach to a very difficult problem.</para><para>When we look at some of those who have expressed a view in recent days, we find the former Governor of Victoria, Dick McGarvie. He has been described as a constitutional expert, but I think it is also fair to say in this context that Dick McGarvie is one of those people who can claim very serious credit for having turned the Labor Party around in the sixties. He was one of those instrumental in reforming the stranglehold that the Left had on the Labor Party. Having worked with him in the courts and having known him for very many years, I can say that he has been a voice of moderation and someone who has always had the national interest at heart. In his view, Australia would face its worst constitutional crisis if Dr Hollingworth was forced to resign. He says it is entirely appropriate that he stepped aside. He says:</para><para>A forced resignation would do untold damage to the office of the Governor-General and deliver inappropriate power to the media and opposition.</para><para>I say in passing that it is very easy to make sweeping statements that one of the highest positions in the land can be devastated unless someone immediately takes some action that happens to suit their political purposes. It is very easy to have rhetoric on either side of the argument, but I do not think that Dick McGarvie is someone who is given to grandstanding rhetoric at all. He is simply expressing a very considered and thoughtful view.</para><para>Sydney University Associate Law Professor Don Rothwell described yesterday's decision as a wise circuit-breaker, and the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney said the right decision had been made. Of course, we have had people like Terry O'Gorman, with whom I would not always agree, characterising what is going on now as little more than a witch-hunt. It is very important that Dr Hollingworth not be hounded from office, that we look at how we are in this current position. One of the things that I think really ought to exercise the minds of the Labor Party is the role played by Lindsay Tanner, because this is a full-frontal attack on some of the most important institutions in our community. People have an entitlement to apply for suppression orders. They are entitled to argue their case. It is a matter for the judges to make a decision. You can appeal those decisions if necessary. But there is no right at all for a member of parliament to simply flout that power of the court and say, `I believe it is in the public interest.' Often when politicians use that term they are really saying, `It is to our political advantage.' But let me read from a letter which I thought was very instructive for Mr Tanner and those who might be inclined to support him, because this is clearly not from a coalition supporter:</para><para>Lindsay Tanner's cowardly move against the Governor-General again reveals federal Labor's front bench as a group of opportunistic head kickers, devoid of constructive policy initiatives.

Therefore I think it is instructive to look at what Mr Tanner has said. What he told Alan Jones the other day was that ultimately it is open for the courts, but of course he has done precisely the opposite. He was asked:</para></talk.start></continue><para>But you know yourself that, once his name—</para><para>that is, Dr Hollingworth's—</para><para>gets into the public place in relation to such a serious and grievous charge as rape, you can talk until the end of your life and you'll never be able to expunge some references to that and its association with you.</para><para>Mr Tanner said:</para><para>Look, I think that is probably fair comment ...</para><para>Finally, he said:</para><para>If there are legal proceedings on foot then it is wrong for a party who is in one of the most senior positions in the land like the Governor-General to seek suppression orders with respect to those legal proceedings.</para><para>I do not know whether Mr Tanner is unaware of it, but the fact seems to be beyond doubt that Mrs Jarmyn was the one who sought the original suppression order. We know from some newspaper reports that she felt very passionately that it was in her interest not to have these matters in the public arena prematurely. That being the case, one would have thought that her wishes, and presumably the wishes of those who might inherit any legal rights in respect of the action, should be acknowledged and respected, but that is not what Mr Tanner has done at all.</para><para>Mr Tanner has effectively taken it upon himself to say that he does not give a damn about the rights of citizens or litigants; if there is a public figure involved then they ought to be outed. That of course is in the context where we are talking about an action being taken by a private citizen against a public figure, and it is very difficult—almost impossible, I would have thought—to say on the one hand that matter ought to be exposed but at the same time you can protect the rights of that individual, who in this instance clearly wanted the matter not to go public. What you are effectively doing is saying, `If I think there is a big fish there, I will put my interest in exposing that person ahead of the interests and concerns of the private citizen.' I do not think that is a very healthy sign of a democracy at all.</para><para>I leave it to the courts. If the parliament wants to say that it is not open to public figures to obtain to suppression orders, let it say that. If people want to argue against public figures being entitled to benefit from suppression orders, they have a right to do that. Of course, ultimately, judges are much better qualified than any of us to make those decisions. They can take account of the public interest, they can take account of the rights of the parties and, as I say, you can appeal those decisions in any event.</para><para>By placing questions on notice for purely political purposes, Mr Tanner clearly intended to render a legal suppression order ineffective. That is a matter of enormous concern. If we are talking about someone resigning, it should be Mr Tanner, because Mr Tanner is a serial offender. I am sure that members of the Senate will be aware that, on 19 March, he said in relation to Ron Walker:</para><para>Ron Walker has effectively used Grand Prix and taxpayers' money to buy his way onto the Fairfax board.</para><para>That is in the face of Fairfax absolutely disputing that, in any shape or form, Mr Walker had anything to do with the placing of the advertisements, Mr Walker himself saying that on the public record, Fairfax contacting the office of Mr Crean and advising him, and Mr Crean's office—I think Mr Crean personally—saying that he would not allow it to go further. Yet what has happened? Mr Tanner is able to say these things with impunity.

To effectively put that into the public arena against the wishes of the parties and the courts seems to me to be utterly indefensible. I am simply saying that I think the proper course of action is not to be calling for more blood at this point but to allow everyone to settle down and have some clean air, allow Dr Hollingworth to properly defend himself and consider his position and, for those who want to seriously address problems of child abuse, to really look seriously at some of the issues that governments have a role to play in solving.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>10612</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—From the outset, let me say that parliament has virtually no powers in relation to the Governor-General. The Senate has no role in the appointment of a Governor-General. We are not required to confirm executive appointments as the US Senate does. The dismissal of a Governor-General is clearly not a function of parliament. I have no regrets that this is in fact the case. It is, however, quite within the purview of the parliamentary process for it to express a view on the performance or otherwise of a Governor-General. The effective operation of the provisions of the Constitution is always relevant to the parliament. Furthermore, the Australian government often has to make representations on human rights issues. For instance, we are constantly making representations in Cambodia, on people-smuggling and on the eradication of Australian paedophiles operating in that particular area. What credibility do we have when our own head of state has question marks hanging over his head in relation to this?</para></talk.start><para>Governors-general are appointed by executive government. Indeed, it is really almost now evolved as an appointment and prerogative of a Prime Minister. Over many years prime ministers almost themselves have appointed governors-general. It is ratified by cabinet, but all the spadework is done by a prime minister. I, as deputy leader in the Senate, was certainly consulted on the matter of Bill Deane, as were the leader in the Senate and the Deputy Prime Minister. But it was then put to cabinet as an appointment without further consultation. On this occasion we have heard from the Prime Minister's own lips that Dr Hollingworth was appointed by him, and him alone. Not even Mrs Howard, rather strangely, had a say on this occasion.</para><para>It is also true to say that such appointments are formally approved by the Queen. But it is many years since a royal head has sought to interfere in the choice of Governor-General. When an Australian Prime Minister, James Scullin, decided to appoint Australia's first native born Governor-General he was met with virulent opposition from his then conservative opponents. That happened again when Bill McKell was appointed. The conservative antecedents of the Liberal Party opposed it. But, more interestingly, in the case of the Scullin appointment, George V and the palace also opposed it rigorously. It was only through the firm intervention and the firm arguing of James Scullin that Isaac Isaacs was appointed as Governor-General. </para><para>Dr Hollingworth's appointment attracted some criticism. Some people harped on the fact that church and state should be separate, without ever demonstrating that Dr Hollingworth's appointment in some ways abrogated that principle. To me it was an indication that this country was over sectarianism, that it is possible to have a senior religious leader of whatever persuasion as head of state. The Constitution, practice and commonsense all dictate that a Governor-General's tenure is a matter for executive government. In turn, executive government must take responsibility for their appointments, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. Governments must ensure the integrity of the office of Governor-General. Failure to remove a flawed Governor-General may leave the government open to the charge that such a Governor-General will be indebted to the government and not able to properly exercise those powers granted by the Constitution.</para><para>The Senate, of course, does have one area of scrutiny available to it with regard to the office of Governor-General, and that is the examination of its funding and the acquittal of its expenditure. It has never been properly established whether a Governor-General has the right to expend public funds to defend himself in what are essentially private matters. For instance, should the office have the right to hire without tender public relations gurus at several thousand dollars a day at taxpayers' expense? This is not to be critical of Mike Smith or Andy Reynolds—they were hired to do a job and they gave it their best shot—but their role was about spin. It was about protecting a position, not about revealing the truth or compensating victims.</para><para>Those coalition members who were critical of the funding of some aspects of Carmen Lawrence's legal costs are now notably silent about the expenditure on behalf of the Governor-General. Such expenditure might be justified if an individual were embroiled in a dispute because of the office that they held. It is a pity some Liberal Party members were not mature enough to understand this in the case of Ms Lawrence. It is becoming clear, however, that the Governor-General will meet his own legal expenses in the Melbourne court case. The opposition has not hesitated to scrutinise expenditure by the office of the Governor-General, and we have always received courteous cooperation. I might take the opportunity here to pay tribute to the outgoing Official Secretary to the Governor-General, Mr Martin Bonsey, the timing of whose departure has nothing to do with current events. He has been a model public servant who has faithfully and competently supported the last two governors-general. </para><para>The motion we are considering today was always going to be debated in this chamber, irrespective of the allegations relating to rape that emerged last week. It is essential to keep this issue separate from those matters pertaining to paedophilia and the Anglican Church. The Governor-General should have stood aside or resigned over those Queensland matters the moment the board of inquiry published its findings. The rape allegations will be settled through the judicial process. Dr Hollingworth must be given the presumption of innocence. If civil proceedings in Melbourne fail on a technicality, this will leave Dr Hollingworth in the intolerable position of the allegations having been made without the opportunity for him to disprove them in a court of law. There may be a myriad reasons why such allegations did not emerge at the time of the alleged event, but trying to assess evidence 38 years later, based on one photograph, makes justice difficult to contemplate.</para><para>I find it hard to understand why he has to stand aside now rather than when the court case was taken. Clearly, the Prime Minister's motive is to take political pressure off himself rather than to assist the Governor-General. The Prime Minister has totally failed to explain why he did not ask the Governor-General to stand aside either when the allegations were first made or when they were first taken to court. Nor is there any explanation as to why the Prime Minister did not inform the Leader of the Opposition of these allegations. Such low-rent behaviour from the Prime Minister surprises nobody on this side of the chamber. The real explanation for the Governor-General's standing aside lies not in the rape allegations but in the findings of the diocesan board of inquiry. It was not just dealing with the far distant past, as has been mentioned, I think, by Senator Bartlett; it was dealing with events that occurred within the last 10 years.</para><para>If Dr Hollingworth was not able to honour the position of public trust that was vested in him as Archbishop of Brisbane, then there is no certainty that he can do so as Governor-General. It was his decision to put the protection of the institution of the church ahead of protecting vulnerable minors that disqualifies him from public life. Allowing a priest to remain in the ministry in the knowledge that he had committed sexual abuse was a serious error of judgment or more. The board of inquiry found that this decision was untenable. Dr Hollingworth himself has admitted that he made a serious error in doing so. What we do not know, what is not clear and what we cannot establish is why Dr Hollingworth did not intervene. In the absence of a credible explanation, one can only assume that the good of the church was placed ahead of the good of certain individuals. The Governor-General was tardy in dealing with these paedophilia allegations; he was never tardy when it came to appointing a PR expert to defend himself. Using <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>as his first line of defence was tactically inept. Either you have an open press conference or you speak to no-one at all. Setting up preconditions where you are protected from scrutiny but get your story over was bound to fail. Having to reshoot certain aspects of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> episode also greatly dented the Governor-General's credibility. Ascribing blame to a 14-year-old was inept indeed. This lack of sensitivity was further reflected in the now revealed correspondence with the victims' families. These families need more than just sympathy. They do not require revenge, but they do require understanding.</para><para>It has now been revealed that the Governor-General is unhappy with the board of inquiry. The claim is now made that natural justice has been denied to him. It is claimed that there was no opportunity for cross-examination. One wonders why these objections were not made when the inquiry was set up. There was every opportunity for Dr Hollingworth to give extensive evidence to this inquiry or fully participate in the inquiry, yet he chose not to do so. It is hard to blame the Anglican Church in Brisbane. They wanted an official inquiry into all of this, but the Howard government declined. Yesterday the Prime Minister virtually endorsed the Governor-General's legal critique of the board of inquiry, conveniently forgetting his own refusal to countenance a government endorsed inquiry. Indeed, yesterday he could have called for such an inquiry. Today he could set up such an inquiry, but he fears the results of such an inquiry.</para><para>Supporters of the Governor-General claim the whole issue is a witch-hunt. There is no doubt that the feeding frenzy in the media has been most unedifying and that Dr Hollingworth would be stunned by some of the vitriol directed towards him. His close family in particular have complained, and one has to acknowledge the pain that they have and are suffering through all of these events. That is the nature of Australian public life and that is the nature of the Australian media: to turn so viciously on anyone when the smell of blood is in the air. The way the media interfere in these particular matters is not a particular tribute to our way of life. Nevertheless, if you take a public job, you are open to public scrutiny, and you should know that before you sign up.</para><para>Dr Hollingworth's family are not the only family to have suffered. There are other families that have suffered. Children have suffered because society and the Anglican Church failed to protect them, and there has to be some accounting of this. It is not that the media has been totally one-sided. Most of the right-wing hack columnists have supported the Governor-General, not on the issues but out of tribal loyalty. One has only to look at the puerile conspiracy theories of Mr Piers Akerman to see that the debate has been debased. This has been matched by some of the republicans, who just want to belittle the office of Governor-General and, again, do not address the issues. In the end, only Dr Hollingworth can determine his future. If he wants to rely on the current Prime Minister, he has found a poor ally. Political expediency will be paramount when it comes to the prime ministerial advice on what the Governor-General should do.</para><para>I have no doubt that there have been worse governors-general than Dr Hollingworth. In the past, they were not subject to the brutal scrutiny that applies today. Weaknesses were overlooked or, indeed, covered up. We will not get much scrutiny from coalition members in this parliament on these issues. They have been directed by their chief whip not to comment publicly on this matter. So the party of individuality has become the party of conformity. We know that Dr Hollingworth is gone. How do we know it? The old defence team, Senator Hill and Senator Alston, has come down. The old Mal Colston defence team is here, with the same inept performance. I feel sorry for Dr Hollingworth that that is the best defence he will probably have. We will not, of course, see the Inspector Javert of paedophilia, Senator Heffernan, down here, because this is an appointment of the Prime Minister's. Those issues will not be exposed and pursued by him, because they are too close to home.</para><para>One issue that has arisen—and Senator Alston certainly commented on it—is: should parliamentary privilege be able to override a suppression order issued by a court? I have no doubt that parliament has that right. The question is: should it exercise it? Is there a distinction between criminal and civil cases? If it is not an abuse of privilege, is it a misuse of privilege? It may well be an issue that we should reflect on, not in these circumstances, but over a longer period of time. It may well be that either the House of Representatives or the Senate privileges committee should examine this. But, at the moment, there is no standing order that would prevent a senator or member from raising, under the cloak of privilege in the parliament, matters to do with a suppression order. Whether they should or should not do so we should look at in the long term.</para><para>This motion calls on the government to have a royal commission into child sexual abuse. It is probably the only way that one can properly deal with these issues. Royal commissions were not always witch-hunts. If you look at the record on them prior to the Second World War, they concentrated on solutions rather than on apportioning blame. It was from the time of the Petrov royal commission that they became debased. We must be cautious in advocating a royal commission as they can be catastrophically expensive. Just look at the cost of the HIH royal commission, let alone the building industry one. The biggest weakness of royal commissions is also their strength—they operate on the basis of lesser standards of evidence than courts or other judicial inquiries. This allows them to get a much wider range of views. But, on a delicate subject such as paedophilia, hearsay evidence can unjustly destroy reputations. It is essential that counsel assisting carefully sift potential evidence before calling it before a royal commission. I do not have time to list the various abuses committed by royal commissions over the last few decades in terms of hearsay evidence. Most senators would be aware of them and most senators would not approve of them.</para><para>In assessing the issues surrounding the fate of the Governor-General, the opposition will always be accused of partisanship. For the record, I have never met or had any dealings with Dr Hollingworth. I did not oppose his appointment. But there is no doubt in my mind that his credibility to hold a high office has been mortally wounded. Given all that has happened, I hope the Governor-General takes into account item (2)(b) of this motion and resigns forthwith, if only to uphold the esteem of the office he now holds.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>10616</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the speech by Senator Ray. It was a most positive contribution to a very difficult debate. It outlined very cogently some of the difficult matters that we have all had to consider before this motion came before the Senate and that we will have to consider in deciding whether or not to support it. The Greens will be supporting the motion. It urges the Prime Minister to establish a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Australia. Secondly, it urges the Governor-General to immediately resign or, if he does not do so, requests that the Prime Minister advise the Queen of Australia to terminate the commission of the Governor-General. We are at the moment in an unprecedented and terrible situation as far as the governor-generalship is concerned. No motion such as this has ever come before the Senate. It cannot be and is not being taken lightly and a lot of consideration has gone into it.</para></talk.start><para>I want to deal with each of the sections of the motion. The first is that the Governor-General should immediately resign or, if he does not, the Prime Minister should terminate his commission. This matter cannot be confined to narrow legal or even political matters. It is to do with the office itself, which should be unifying, celebratory and beyond controversy for this nation. The Governor-General is not elected and cannot be dis-appointed by the people of Australia. It is a decision, as we have heard, made by the executive, and on this occasion made solely by the Prime Minister without reference to others. Therefore it is logically a matter for the Prime Minister to consider when the Senate calls for that commission to be terminated. I noted in Senator Faulkner's speech the remarkable quote from 15 months ago when the Prime Minister, when questioned about that appointment, said:</para><para>... of course I did not ask Archbishop Hollingworth whether there was something.</para><para>He also said that he did not send him a form to fill out. The Prime Minister might quite rightly be asked, `Why did you not ask him?'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—As Senator Murray says, he does that for ministers and sets out requirements for ministers. But the responsible question for any potential contender for the position of Governor-General ought to have been—as it is routinely for any appointment to any job if it is responsibly done, and none more importantly than to the highest position in the land—`Is there anything that you know about which would make difficult or obviate your appointment to this position?' But the Prime Minister did not do that. Then the course of events we are all so familiar with took place. In particular, the diocesan board of the Anglican Church in Queensland found that the Governor-General's behaviour during his period as Archbishop of Brisbane had been untenable. This related to a direct request to Dr Hollingworth from victims of sexual abuse to have action taken on their behalf. That request was not responded to in the way it should have been. Senator Murray indicated by interjection that it should have been a matter put into the hands of the police, and I agree with that. The difficulty has come from that situation and other matters that members have brought up.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is the Governor-General ought to have stood down from his position when these matters first came to the fore and certainly when that diocesan commission made its findings. But there is a tendency now to bring in legal and public relations assistance and to tough it out. One cannot fail to commiserate with His Excellency the Right Reverend Peter Hollingworth and his family for the torment they must be going through at this time. But as other speakers have said, the office is beyond that. It is for the Governor-General to step down in defence of the office and the rights of 20 million Australians to believe that that office is beyond the conjecture and controversy now surrounding it. The obvious question is: how many people have been and are suffering simply because of this controversy, because they have been victims and even perpetrators in the scourge of paedophilia in our society?</para><para>That brings me to the second point of the motion, which is the establishment of a royal commission. The question here is for the Prime Minister. The request is being made to the Prime Minister, because the Senate cannot of itself establish such a royal commission. There will be some debate about whether that would become a witch-hunt or not. I would counsel very strongly that the major direction for a royal commission, and the major term of reference to a royal commission, would be to find those ways of best ameliorating, minimising and preventing child abuse in the future while bringing succour and help to people who have been victims and perpetrators of paedophilia in the past. Royal commissions can do that. I believe there should be a national royal commission.</para><para>The argument from Senator Hill was that it was a state matter. I do not believe that is the case. At the moment we have different laws in different states. In an interview with a radio station in Western Australia today I was acquainted with the fact that there is no requirement for mandatory reporting of paedophilia in that state. I understand that it is not universal elsewhere in Australia either. I remember, as a young doctor, when that was first mooted for the medical profession way back in the seventies or eighties. It was hugely contentious that there should be intervention between the client and the doctor. But let me say it has been hugely important for both that the client's best interests are protected and the matter is brought to the surface because, firstly, it has the flow-on effect of protecting others in the future and, secondly, the terrible decision is taken off the shoulders of the medical practitioner, the teacher or the other responsible person as to whether or not they should inform the police. To do so would have the ramifications that are argued about—that is, unsettling family, causing public odium and getting out of hand. It is important that mandatory reporting be part of the suite of measures taken to reduce and eliminate paedophilia, which is so damaging to young people. But even that needs to be understood as always having an impact on both victim and perpetrator which can be extremely damaging. There has to be very deft and experienced handling of that.</para><para>There is a wealth of experience in our community. Let it be brought together. Let it be canvassed and analysed. If something good is to come out of this terrible set of circumstances, let it be a new national direction to prevent the sexual abuse of children in our great nation in the future. I think all of us are concerned that the matter should go before a royal commission, with the extraordinary powers that it has. My concern is that if it does not go to such an inquiry we will not take this opportunity to reassess where we are and to minimise harm to not tens, dozens, scores or hundreds but thousands of children who are at this moment trapped in circumstances where they are being taken advantage of by an adult, most often in the home. Let us not forget that. Let us find measures to help overcome the difficulties which come from the secrecy, the sense of shame and the power of adults to frighten the young into submission and secrecy against their own interests and in a way which traumatises them for the rest of their lives. We have to do more about that. I believe we have the information to do it, but we have to find better ways of ensuring that no child is beyond the reach of the best help that is available.</para><para>I support the motion and appeal to the Prime Minister to consider both parts of the active components of this motion. Ultimately, a very great responsibility is on Prime Minister Howard to give effect to this motion, whether or not it passes the Senate. He has an enormous responsibility to reconsider the position of Governor-General Hollingworth, who was, after all, appointed at his sole behest. He has a huge deal of thinking to do about what we as a nation can do to minimise absolutely the damage done to young people—and therefore to people all their lives—through abuse, which is unwanted and damaging to children. I believe that, if there is a better option to a royal commission, to draw all the strings together and to find the best answers, it is incumbent upon those who oppose it to come up with that option. As it is, I join the appeal to the Prime Minister to take that option for us—in terms of a royal commission—to go through what will be a travail, as well as, hopefully, by the end of it, an enlightening and positive process for the nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>10618</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the chamber knows, I do not come to this debate as a novice, in that I have now been on a five-year campaign in relation to issues of child abuse and the consequences of it. Despite my institutional background, which the chamber is also aware of, I was not really acquainted with more than a general knowledge in these areas. It is only by my exposure through the Senate and various inquiries that I have come to the fairly deep understanding that I now have. I regret sincerely having to get involved in many of the issues that I have, simply because of the horrible stuff you have to read and the horrible circumstances you have to live through when, as a consequence of their experiences, adults, some of them grandparents, tremble and weep in your office. It is not something that will ever leave me.</para></talk.start><para>I want to commence by making some remarks about the government record in this general area, and in doing so I am not going to reflect on individuals in the coalition, because many of those individuals in the coalition that I have talked to have been deeply moved on, and are deeply concerned about, this issue. I have had people at the highest levels weep with me. So these remarks do not reflect on all. Nevertheless, governments as a body have to be accountable.</para><para>In the last five years this government has vigorously opposed the child migrant inquiry. It never facilitated and was extremely lukewarm about the third inquiry, which is now before us, in the trilogy, inquiring into institutionalised Australian children in the last century. It has been defensive on the stolen generation. With respect to one of the recommendations of the child migrant inquires, it has refused to petition the Queen to knock the infamous Brother Keaney off the honours list, despite leading a paedophile ring in one of the worst annals of child abuse in this country—and that was a unanimous recommendation by all parties.</para><para>The coalition have a record of being harsh on children in detention. They have a very recent record of being delinquent in addressing the trafficking in women and the prosecutions that should arise from that. Having themselves initiated some groundbreaking law, they did not provide the means to prosecute those laws. I have no obvious memory in my mind of them being any good in this area, of having any programs to address this child abuse area. I think they have had programs to address rape and violence in the home, but with the broader issue of child abuse they have simply passed the buck.</para><para>My message to the coalition is this: it is no good being men of steel in war but marshmallow men in matters of child abuse; it is no good having lots of ticker but being seen as having no heart; it is no good being tough on crime but soft on child abuse. In the face of massive national concern on this issue—and it is massive, because many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, are affected—this government has shown no leadership. Frankly, I think it should. Those individuals amongst the government who are concerned in this area need to carry the torch a little stronger.</para><para>Much has been made of the fact that these events occurred before the Governor-General came to office, but his conduct on these matters while in office has been poor. That is best exhibited by his performance on <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> which exposed terrible judgment and a terrible lack of sensitivity. For somebody who is a former social worker, and is therefore trained in and understands these issues, that is a very poor attitude. His evidence to the church inquiry exposes him in a serious manner. But, more importantly, if you have conducted yourself before you reach office in such a way as requires you to resign from that office, you would have to do so. A number of speakers, including most recently Senator Brown, have made clear their view that you should be properly checked for any high office. If the Prime Minister was discovered to have concealed a major crime in a previous life, the whole parliament would demand that he remove himself, and quite properly so.</para><para>I will quote briefly from pages 48 and 49 of the report. It states:</para><para>Dr Hollingworth, through his solicitors, has contended that he based that decision upon his understanding that the sexual abuse was an isolated occurrence.</para><para>I remind you that this is a social worker; I think he would know different. It goes on:</para><para>The complainant on the other hand contends that he told Dr Hollingworth the details of the abuse, and that it involved repeated criminal acts.</para><para>The very essence of paedophilia is that it is repetitive. Senator Brown, as a doctor, has indicated his knowledge of that. It then states:</para><para>The Board finds that Dr Hollingworth's recollections are faulty, and that he has apparently reconstructed what he believed he was told, rather than recalled what in fact was said.</para><para>You could be much stronger in your language but we all know what that implies. It goes on:</para><para>The board considers that no bishop acting reasonably could have reached the decision to continue a known paedophile in the ministry—</para><para>because they will repeat the crime. I want you to contemplate the crime.</para><para>Moving on from those brief quotes from the report, the Governor-General has confounded many of us by clinging to his office in the face of huge public dismay. Quite frankly, any person in public office knows that you have to resist the baying of the mob, but this is the expression of public opinion as a result of a revulsion at the way issues were handled. If the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, the President of the Senate or the Speaker—or I—had to deal similarly with issues of this sort, I think we would be gone pretty quickly. Why? Because we are accountable. The difficulty with the Governor-General's office is that he is not accountable; he just needs the support of one man—and even then that man, the Prime Minister, can be defied.</para><para>The Democrats, Labor and many others have called for the Governor-General to resign. He can of course resign of his own volition. Either privately or publicly, the Prime Minister could request him to resign; he could defy that, although you would expect him not to. If he refused to resign, the Prime Minister could petition the Queen to remove him and she would undoubtedly do so in those circumstances. There is no provision for impeachment. The parliament of Australia has no powers either of appointment or dismissal. The house of the executive, which is the House of Representatives, will not take action if the Prime Minister does not want it. The Senate, as it is doing now, can pass a powerful but powerless symbolic motion of no-confidence or a motion of condemnation.</para><para>The one action we can take is to go directly to the Queen using the device of an address to the Queen. I think that would produce a fascinating constitutional situation as to whether the Queen would feel obliged to reject or accept the Senate's view in the face of prime ministerial support. Neither I nor anyone else has yet contemplated that the Senate do so, because we hope that good sense will prevail and the Governor-General will understand he must go.</para><para>For the public, the issue is huge. There are not many things that get people quite as angry as the sexual assault of children. Note that I and the members of my party consistently use the words `sexual assault'. It is a criminal act. It is not abuse; it is assault. And that it is of children is abominable. Put bluntly, for Peter Hollingworth—the Governor-General now, the archbishop then—the general case that has been made is this: the sexual assault of children is a crime. As archbishop, he was the head of an organisation that did not report such crimes to the police or statutory authorities. The organisation protected the criminals responsible by concealing the crimes and, through retention or promotion, gave such criminals further opportunities to access further victims.</para><para>In a number of the cases that have been exposed, the archbishop was apprised of the circumstances, acted with the executive authority and determined the course of action. The cases covered by the church board of inquiry set up by the diocese of Brisbane do not include some exposed in the media, further cases before the courts or cases that complainants did not put before it but will pursue elsewhere. For instance, the diocese is reported to be dealing with 157 cases. In other words, there may well be more to come that concern the Governor-General. Just to remind senators of that quote from the board's findings:</para><para>The Board considers that no Bishop acting reasonably could have reached the decision to continue a known paedophile in the ministry.</para><para>The public do not think the constitutional consequence of the Governor-General resigning more important than being rid of someone that they believe is unsuited as a result of those actions and events precedent and subsequent to his high office. The public at large do not think Archbishop Hollingworth's conduct was a blemish, as I have heard it described, or a simple error of judgment; they think it was a disgrace. In my view, the archbishop does not have the judgment or character required for someone in the office of Governor-General, and he should go.</para><para>Writing more generally of church behaviour concerning child abuse and to put the matter in a little more perspective, in an article titled `Church needs the law of man' in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 6 June 2002 Dr Chris Goddard, the Director of the Child Abuse and Family Violence Research Unit at Monash University, said the following:</para><para>There appear to be many opportunities for the full force of the criminal law to be brought to bear upon those in positions of power who have not taken reasonable steps to protect children. Surely, the bishop who has transferred from one parish to another a priest who is the subject of complaints has failed in his duty of care to the children of the next parish? Aiding and abetting, being an accessory after the fact, obstructing the administration of justice, compounding a felony, even criminal conspiracy, are crimes that would spring to mind if it were drug dealing or car theft that we were concerned about.</para><para>There have been questions as to why there should be a royal commission. An inquiry into the scale of the sexual assault of children and the concealment of crimes within churches or other institutions could only ever be successfully pursued through a royal commission because of the powers attached and to issue warrants, pursue discovery and initiate a thorough investigation. A royal commission is ordinarily appointed when there is no other way to deal with a major social problem and there is widespread national concern.</para><para>The fact is that a royal commission has investigative powers. As has been discovered in America, only when you can get into the filing cabinet and get people to give you the information or disclosure that is necessary are you able to establish the scale and nature of the problem. The scale of the problem is not understood by politicians and policy makers in general, which is a question of ignorance and not of malice. Until they understand the scale of the abuse and sexual assault of children, they will not be able to move from perceiving it as an occasional occurrence requiring criminal charges and perhaps a social work remedy to seeing it as a problem with huge social and economic costs that requires significant government and other programs to address it. That is why it is a national issue. That is why this government should take the lead. You cannot ask six state royal commissions to be set up—what a ludicrous idea. You have to have the means to measure this nationally. It is not an issue principally of the past, because its knock-on consequences affect another 40 to 50 years of adult life and can affect the children—that is, the third generation—as well, because of the effects on people's emotional, mental and physical states.</para><para>Then there is the question of concealment. We are talking about criminal conspiracy for the large scale protection of paedophiles by church and other institutions—not by a majority; of course not. The majority of priests and the religious are not part of this, but a minority are, and they have had terrible effects on our society and other societies. The Australian experience is similar, and it is no accident that most of these complaints are from within churches. Just think: 157 in the Brisbane diocese alone have come to the surface. Just try to work out all the other dioceses and churches that are involved. They settle these claims confidentially to protect their money and to protect the institution. The victim comes last. The problem is that for governments the social and economic costs are so major that, unless you attend to those costs, you will not realise the problems that you are not facing up to and their effects on society. So my view is that only once the scale and the nature of the problem have been properly exposed can you deal with the remedies and policy changes that are necessary.</para><para>Obviously, the terms of reference for any royal commission would need to be carefully developed in consultation with advocates, experts and campaigners in this area. I concur with Senator Ray that the rules of evidence should be extremely carefully set for such a royal commission. You have to be very careful about people's reputations and these matters, but you cannot squib on this issue and its scale. When I heard that the Prime Minister—and I hope I am not misquoting him—had stated that he would prefer to spend $60 million on services rather than line the pockets of lawyers by way of a royal commission, I was absolutely shocked at the insensitivity and the priorities that that indicated. Somebody who can spend $60 million on the Cole royal commission and then say, `You can't spend $60 million on an inquiry into child abuse,' exhibits an attitude that the Australian people will punish this government for. It does not matter what party or what age group they come from; they will not put up with a government that has not realised it must put children first.</para><para>The consequences of the actions of the Governor-General when he was archbishop, or others who have allowed paedophiles to continue, need to be understood—and the scale needs to be understood. I sometimes remind people that the figures we have indicate that up to 10,000 child migrants, 40,000 Aboriginal children and as many as 100,000 non-Indigenous Australian children were institutionalised last century—that is up to 200,000 children, many of whom were abused. That is just in the institutions, never mind the boarding schools and all the other places where these things went on. So, literally millions of Australians have interactions with the hundreds of thousands who have been exposed to a variety of abuses, from emotional deprivation all the way through to sexual assault.</para><para>Let me give you an idea of what happens when you let paedophiles abuse people. There is a knock-on consequence—80 to 85 per cent of women in Australian prisons have been victims of incest or other forms of abuse, according to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Alternative Law Journal </inline>in 1994; another Australian study of 27 correctional centres in New South Wales found that 65 per cent of male and female prisoners were victims of child sexual and physical assault; the New South Wales Child Protection Council reported in 1992 that the probability of future delinquency, adult criminality and arrest for a violent crime increased by around 40 per cent for people assaulted and neglected as children.</para><para>Institutionalised children or people subject to abuse indulge in substance abuse—44 per cent of fire injuries have been found to be associated with alcohol. In Ireland they found that, of people who had suffered this abuse, 14 per cent ended up as prostitutes; 68 per cent ended up needing health board care and experienced homelessness; 66 per cent of those who left their special schools and had been abused ended up in prison or in other places of detention within three years. You cannot underestimate, when dealing with these issues, what the consequences are of letting a paedophile priest continue to practice. I would urge this government, firstly, to dismiss the Governor-General and, secondly, to institute a royal commission into sexual abuse.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>10622</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Murray has just made a very impassioned speech. This is a subject that he has spent a lot of time and a lot of effort on. We are all familiar with his background as a migrant from the UK. What he says in regard to paedophilia—abused children—is absolutely correct. No-one on this side of the Senate would not support him on those views. Everyone, on any side of politics, would be totally opposed to any form of paedophilia.</para></talk.start><para>But we are not debating paedophilia tonight. The opposition and the minor parties have put forward a very general two-page motion that attacks the Prime Minister for his choice of Governor-General and goes right through to calling for a royal commission. The Prime Minister made a choice, an open choice, six years ago of an archbishop who had a background of welfare and community support over 30 years, who subsequently has done nothing while in the office of Governor-General to remove him from that office. He has not offended in any way while he has been Governor-General. In the last week or so, what I suppose you could call a red herring case concerning an allegation of rape has been introduced, which has clouded the issue.</para><para>I think we ought to stand back and look at where we are at. The Governor-General is not in office. He will not be taking part in any duties. Those duties have been accepted by and transferred to the Governor of Tasmania, who is the senior state governor and who will fulfil the role of the position of Governor-General. The Governor-General has said publicly that he will place the dignity and protection of the office of Governor-General above all other considerations when he makes a decision. He gave that commitment to the Prime Minister, and so I think the timing of this motion is wrong.</para><para>You have had the Governor-General make that commitment and you have had the Prime Minister intervene and talk to him. The Prime Minister intervened at the earliest opportunity that was available to him when he returned from overseas. The Prime Minister dealt with the issue as soon as he returned to Australia. At the weekend, he immediately addressed the issue and received from the Governor-General the commitment, and I repeat his words: `I will place the dignity and protection of the office above all other considerations.'</para><para>So I do not think anyone can accuse the Prime Minister of being tardy or not taking the right action. The Prime Minister was on the spot as soon as he could get back and address the issue that was before the people. The Governor-General has given the commitment that, in considering his long-term tenure in that office, he will place the dignity and protection of that office above all other considerations. The Prime Minister has taken a serious step. This has never occurred before in the history of Australia, and I would think that we are not likely to have this occur again—and I certainly hope that we do not.</para><para>It has been said, and this has been repeated by the press on a number of occasions, that only the Governor-General can make this decision. Only the Governor-General can balance his conscience against the needs of Australia, and I think that is what he is doing at the moment. The agony that Dr Hollingworth and his family must be going through at the moment has been acknowledged by a couple of speakers who I have listened to. That is part of the public process in Australia; it is a boots and all effort with the press, and if they can expose something they will. We do have a vigorous press.</para><para>The institution of Governor-General has to deal with something it has never had to deal with before, and I think is better for the Governor-General to make that decision. I do not think he is taking it lightly. I think he needs a bit of clear air to make it. I had hoped that we would not have a motion like this, which I think politicises the office of Governor-General. I know that politics is a rough-house in Australia and that the opposition believes it will gain some tactical advantage by trying to raise this issue and score some political points off it. I am reluctant to get involved in that.</para><para>It is unnecessary to demand that the Prime Minister sack the Governor-General, because I think the decision is going to be made. The present Governor-General has already indicated that he is prepared to step aside when he balances the equation of placing the dignity and protection of the office above all other considerations. He has taken the decision that he is not going to hurt the office. I believe the issue is being dealt with responsibly by the Prime Minister, within the correct parameters and procedures of our system and by means within the system that respect and reinforce the institutions of government.</para><para>If the opposition were serious about this motion that they are moving in the Senate and if it were a matter of fundamental belief to them—a matter of such importance—why wouldn't it be moved simultaneously in the Senate and the House of Representatives? If it is a matter of high importance, it should be moved in both houses—in the house of the people and in the house of review.</para><para>This is an effort to embarrass the government—that is what oppositions are there to do. But there is more to this than embarrassing the government. We have a Constitution and we have a set of rules of government. Australia voted almost overwhelmingly—not quite overwhelmingly in some states, but overwhelmingly in others—that they wanted the present means of government, the constitutional monarchy, to stay in place. A referendum was held, the matter of a republic was put to the referendum and people supported the present system. By moving this motion—and I do not think it had to be moved; I think it will resolve itself—we place the institutions of Governor-General, the parliament and the division of powers between the judiciary and the parliament into a big melting pot and we do not know what will happen.</para><para>As a father and a grandfather, I cannot speak strongly enough against interference with children. Nothing makes me shudder more. I think every government has to address it. The real problem is that the state governments are in charge of social welfare, community services and education; about all of the areas where paedophilia is rampant, apart from in homes, are public institutions, and all of those public institutions are virtually controlled by the state governments. Criminal law, health, education and child welfare are all responsibilities of the state governments. It is not an issue that this government is directly responsible for. Our role in the political field is to implement policies that are in the best interests of Australia—to set budgets, as we will be doing tonight, and put down parameters. But the minutiae of government is really controlled by the state governments. I am not sure that the state governments want this. Mr Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, has called for one, but the Premier of New South Wales has not supported one, so there seems to be some division there.</para><para>The Prime Minister has acted as soon as possible to fix this very severe problem. He made a judgment of his candidate for Governor-General, and he based it on 30 years of public exposure. He based it on goodwill. The Governor-General himself accepts that he had a serious conflict in judgment. Therefore I think that we should accept the commitment that the Governor-General has given to the press and to the Prime Minister that he will examine his own conscience and will not allow the office of Governor-General to be denigrated. I believe the issue will be resolved in the not too distant future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>10624</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by Senator Faulkner in respect of the office of Governor-General. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of the Australian people, in my view, that the Governor-General should have taken the right decision and resigned. Regardless of the outcome of the case revealed by the lifting of the suppression order by the Supreme Court of Victoria, it is clear, at least to me, that a profound human tragedy has in fact occurred. </para></talk.start><para>The Governor-General, although stood aside, like all Australians is entitled to the presumption of innocence. The rape allegations brought to light over the past week are completely separate from the arguments that warrant the Governor-General resigning. In the absence of that happening, the Governor-General being dismissed by the Prime Minister is the next logical step that should be taken. It is no longer tenable for him to hold the position. I make no comment in respect of the court case that is presently on foot. It is not a matter that should be canvassed here at this time. My views were informed prior to that issue having been reported in the media.</para><para>The Governor-General should personify the conscience of the nation by showing sensitivity towards those in need. He could take a leaf out of the book of our previous Governor-General, Sir William Deane, who had the ability to represent all members of the community. His tenure as Governor-General was more in the role of a national moral guardianship, with the promotion of core moral values, for which Australians admired and respected him. Did Sir William Deane set the standard too high during his time as Governor-General? I do not believe he did. The media espoused his qualities, qualities that we have yet to see from the person currently appointed to the position. Sir William worked to bring public awareness to the plight of Australians in hardship. He was a true representative of the Australian people. He will long be remembered.</para><para>In contrast, it was said when Dr Hollingworth was first flagged as our Governor-General that it would be impossible for him to separate the church from the state and that his position as the representative of the Australian people to the Queen would be compromised by a lifetime of beliefs he had learnt and taught within the church. But it was also said that he was a tireless advocate for our underprivileged people, that his integrity was unquestionable and that a lifetime of service to the public would stand him in good stead with all Australians. I understand there were, however, rumblings by senior Anglicans, who saw the conflict for an ordained priest and consecrated bishop who held key positions within the church. Dr Hollingworth promised to place the dignity and protection of the office of Governor-General above all else. In truth, he has put at risk the office losing the respect of the Australian people. If his promise were true, he should have resigned when the allegations and, subsequently, the truth came out in December 2001.</para><para>The Prime Minister should have addressed the Governor-General on this issue when it was first raised. In my view, the Prime Minister has failed in his duty to the Australian people to ensure that the office of the Governor-General is not tarnished by scandal. The current controversy should be ended quickly, and the office of the Governor-General may be spared any further damage. It is in the hands of the Governor-General to resign or of the Prime Minister to demand his resignation. Dr Hollingworth must resign, because of his proven failure to appropriately deal with child sexual abuse and for his protection of an admitted paedophile.</para><para>The Anglican Church report was critical of Dr Hollingworth's handling of allegations of numerous cases of child sex abuse by members of the clergy whilst he was in charge of the Brisbane diocese. I underscore the point that the findings have been reached after lengthy investigation by an independent board of inquiry consisting of individuals of the highest reputation. I have no reason to doubt the board's fairness and impartiality. The Anglican Church inquiry report into victims of child sex abuse by the Anglican Church found that Dr Hollingworth failed to act against a known paedophile and that his actions were untenable. The board's report does contain criticism of Dr Hollingworth in respect of the handling of the Elliot matter. After weighing the information available to it, including submissions from Dr Hollingworth's solicitors—parts of which are reproduced in the report—the board said in section 15.8:</para><para>The Board considers that no Bishop acting reasonably could have reached the decision to continue a known paedophile in the ministry. There were no extenuating circumstances nor can the Board imagine any that could have justified his continuance.</para><para>At 15.9, on page 49 of the report, the board found:</para><para>Dr Hollingworth's decision, whilst made in good faith, and in consultation, and without demur of the bishops whom he consulted, and in the belief that precautionary conditions imposed minimised the risk of recurrence, was untenable.</para><para>In his media release, Archbishop Aspinall said:</para><para>... I believe it is incumbent on me as Archbishop to express my firm view that to allow Elliot to continue in office, following his admission of child sexual abuse, was a serious error of judgment. I take this view without expressing an opinion about whether or not the child sexual abuse was understood to be a long-past, isolated incident.</para><para>These comments were not easy for Archbishop Aspinall to make. In fact, he points out during his media statement his affection for Dr and Mrs Hollingworth. The Archbishop had a duty to inform the public and the parliament of the outcomes of the inquiry. It was not a witch-hunt against Dr Hollingworth but, rather, a truthful account of the shortcomings and short-sightedness of our Governor-General. On a third avenue of inquiry, regarding Bishop Shearman, Professor Briggs of the inquiry considered:</para><para>... that once Dr Hollingworth in his capacity as Archbishop was apprised of the serious misconduct of the Respondent, he should, in order to demonstrate proper moral leadership, have withdrawn the permission. Professor Briggs considers that in the circumstances Dr Hollingworth's failure to do so was inappropriate.</para><para>That can be found at 13.10, or pages 40 to 41, of the inquiry report. These were damning comments, to my mind. Why would the Prime Minister not demand in the face of that that the Governor-General tender his resignation? Why has the Prime Minister not acted since the release of the report to remove the Governor-General from office? How far does this government intend to let slide the good work previously attributed to the office of the Governor-General before it acts? The Prime Minister not only should act but must act. This is not about finding guilt, although it is around; it is about a government that is unwilling to take the morally correct steps to retain some dignity in one of our highest offices. For more than two years the public has listened in disbelief to the revelations as they have come to light. Now, with the release of the report, perhaps the victims and the church may be able to find a way to move forward. For more than two years our Prime Minister has hedged on the issue of retaining dignity and integrity within the office of the Governor-General. It is a simple matter. Why cannot our Prime Minister see that there is no option other than to demand the resignation of the Governor-General and end what some refer to as a constitutional crisis but what is in fact a crisis in the Prime Minister's own mind? Why did the Prime Minister refuse at first to table the report?</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00

At this time in particular, with the successful conclusion of war operations in Iraq behind us, it is a particular honour. Today's service men and women are tomorrow's veterans, and the Australian community is forever in their debt. In recent weeks I have attended four such functions, three of them as the representative of the Prime Minister and one representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</para></talk.start><para>The iconic event in Australia's remembrance calendar is of course Anzac Day. It is truly the one day of the year of legend. It is the most emotive—and most motivating—of occasions, particularly in relation to the dawn service. I represented the Prime Minister at the Brisbane dawn service this Anzac Day. When you stand in the official party at a dawn service and you look across the darkened cenotaph and the eternal flame and see the people in their thousands crowding the pavement and the surrounding area, you know that Australia is a unique and beautiful and brave land. You know that its people are unique and beautiful and brave. It is an immensely moving experience and one, whenever possible, not to be missed.</para><para>Each year the crowds are getting bigger, which says something else about Australia and Australians. And each year, too, more and more young Australians for whom the cataclysmic conflicts of the past are historic events—not things with which they themselves have a physical link—prove by their attendance at dawn services that, while time moves on, the spirit that moves us gets deeper and deeper into our national psyche. It says that the vast majority of Australians understand and honour the sacrifice that has brought us to where we are today.</para><para>On 30 April it was my honour and privilege to represent the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the Long Tan Bursary presentation in Brisbane. The bursary was introduced as part of the government's response to the validated findings of the Vietnam Veterans Health Study. It was designed to address the findings that suicide was three times more prevalent among the children of Vietnam veterans than in the general community of young Australians. This is the sort of practical measure that underpins the obligations the Australian people have to the veteran community.</para><para>The Long Tan bursaries, which were introduced in 2000 and are administered by the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust, assist the children of Vietnam veterans through their tertiary studies. They were named for the action in South Vietnam on 18 August 1966 when 150 Aussie diggers of Delta Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, came up against an enemy force estimated to have numbered at least 2,500. In those critical hours during which 18 Australians were killed in action, personal courage, teamwork, training, determination and straight-out bravery prevailed. In other words, ordinary blokes became extraordinary. Giving ordinary people an opportunity to be extraordinary is what Australia is all about.</para><para>The seven Queensland recipients of this year's bursaries were Anthony Branch of Carina, who is studying for a Bachelor of International Hotel Management degree at Southbank TAFE in Brisbane; Jessie Taylor of Eatons Hill, who is studying for a Bachelor of Primary Education degree at the Australian Catholic University in Brisbane; Katharine Regnart of Alderley in Brisbane, who is studying for a Bachelor of Biological and Medical Science at the University of Queensland; Jenna Wieden of Tamarind Gardens, who is studying for a Bachelor of Education degree at James Cook University in Cairns; Timothy Hamlyn of Toowoomba, who is studying for arts and chemistry degrees at the University of Queensland; David Rowe of Palm Beach, who is studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at Griffith University's Gold Coast campus; and Bettina Armistead of Kirwan, who is studying for a Bachelor of Psychology at James Cook University.</para><para>Also at the function, Helena King, a second-year Aboriginal student studying for a Bachelor of Health Science degree at the Queensland University of Technology, received the RSL Reg Saunders Scholarship. Reg Saunders wrote himself into the history of our country by becoming the first Aboriginal officer in the Australian Army. He served with distinction, commanding infantry troops in the Korean War. These young people are a credit to themselves, to their families and to Australia. It should also be noted that the government has expanded the Long Tan Bursary program, increasing the number of bursaries available nationally from 14 to 30.</para><para>On Anzac Day it was also my privilege to represent the Prime Minister at the National Reunion of Veterans of the Korean War 50th Anniversary of Cessation of Hostilities Commemoration in Brisbane. I place on the record my thanks to the Prime Minister for the honour he did me in asking me to represent him at this and other recent ceremonies of which I speak. I also recognise and applaud the role that Major General Digger James made as chairman of this important event. Digger's commitment to veteran matters is legendary, and his energy in advancing the cause of the veteran community, unflagging.</para><para>At this time, as we exit from the successful military air and naval campaign in Iraq, we can pause to reflect with pride that once again Australian armed forces have performed in an exemplary way in the pursuit of freedom for other people. That is precisely what we were doing in Korea half a century ago. We have every reason to be proud of our role in Korea. We have traditionally gone out to help those who are threatened or under actual attack. That is the Australian way. We have always accepted the noble challenge to help a mate. In Korea half a century ago and in Iraq this year we rose, as we have always risen, to that challenge. We put our blood and treasure on the line to give people the opportunity to regain their identity, to choose for themselves and to experience the full benefits of the democratic way of life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with fighting for freedom and democracy for others. In fact, there is everything right about doing so.</para><para>In Korea we fought successfully to make it possible for Koreans to prosper and benefit from their own brand of democracy. We helped make it possible for South Korea to build a renewed nation free from oppression and largely free from assault by the hermit kingdom that the rulers of North Korea have made of their country. In doing this, our Korean War veterans won honour for themselves and for our country. But it may be that they sometimes wonder, as Australian society and other Western societies become more self-critical—often, I fear, in a remarkably self-destructive way—whether it was really all worth it. I believe that history proves the point about past conflicts and shows that there is no reason for our country or our Korean War veterans to have any doubt at all as to the honour of the cause they served.</para><para>In March, I also had the privilege of representing the Prime Minister at the birthday celebrations of the Royal Australian Air Force held at the RAAF Memorial in Queen's Park, Brisbane. On that occasion, a special focus was placed on the women who have served our country in the Air Force, beginning with the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force in World War II. It was a particular personal privilege to be present on that occasion because my mother-in-law, Ruth Down, a World War II WAAAF and a stalwart of the veterans association afterwards, was in the contingent at the memorial.</para><para>Ruth was a wireless operator in the WAAAF, one of the many people in the critically important role of communications. Communications were vastly different in World War II from the secure data transmissions and digital equipment with which today's Air Force communicates. But it has always been the case that clear communications are essential to success, and Ruth and her cohorts did a grand job in very difficult circumstances. They deserve our continuing salute today.</para><para>It is also the case that these personal links, these family ties, help keep alive in every one of us the deep and abiding influence war service has on the lives of participants and on their contributions to the post-war world. Today, Australian women serve in combat arms of the Defence Force—in the Navy and the Air Force and, increasingly, in Army employments where you have to go willingly in harm's way. In World War II, in a different era, women were employed in support and administrative roles outside the scope of normal combat operations. They freed up a lot of male service personnel for operational jobs at the sharp end. Their service was invaluable and not without risk, from accidents and of course from actual warlike activity that from time to time invaded the so-called rear areas.</para><para>This year the Royal Australian Air Force reached its 82nd birthday. It was apposite that, as this milestone was being marked in Brisbane, the RAAF was in action over Iraq, where in World War I its precursor, the Australian Flying Corps, did a lot of difficult and dangerous work with the British and Empire forces operating against the Turks. Our Defence Force has a long and proud record of service in our national interest, and this deserves to be recognised frequently and remembered always. It has been my privilege to be able to add a little bit of that recognition tonight.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>United Nations Security Council</title><page.no>10631</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10631</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Our post September 11 world is radically different from the Cold War order formed in the years after the defeat of fascism in 1945. In the past, liberal democracies had to check the ambitions of authoritarian states through a deadly nuclear balance visible on a global stage. As senators would be aware, the present acquisition of the very same weapons of mass destruction by the new terrorist aggressors is not to secure the peace through deterrence but to bring about a new order, where free people are threatened in their daily lives and our democracies cast asunder. The new aggressors lurk in the fault lines of the post Cold War order. They hide in the shadows of the globe supported by rogue states, they fester in the cracks of international resolve and they are emboldened whenever there is a lack of global courage to combat them.</para></talk.start><para>This new threat grows stronger every day. And as the international community continues to fracture, our capacity to respond is further degraded. As the terrorist cells hear different signals from Paris and Berlin to those of London and Rome they gain new confidence. As the leader of a rogue state visits the United Nations Security Council and learns of its decade-long inability to secure Iraq's disarmament, he harbours more of the same cells. We must not let this division lapse into a course of appeasement. The graves of young Australians that stretch from northern France to South-East Asia and on to Bali countenance us against this. Indeed, keeping our minds beyond our shores, the ghosts of Auschwitz, Srebrenica and the Kosovo killing fields serve as an object lesson to all Europe of the dangers of appeasement's outcomes.</para><para>So, when the nations of the world meet to decide our global destiny and to use their influence on the future of peoples denied by dictators the right to determine their own, we must ask if our collective ambitions are best served through the constraints imposed by the five veto powers left over from the world in 1945. One does not have to look far to understand that some of their records are, at best, inconsistent and, at the worst, evidence of how these states can impair and retard crucial transitional stages in international affairs. In the long view of the world it is these stages, such as detente and the rise of arms control, that become the most salient in determining the shape of the world to come.</para><para>In examining the past we are often led to the conclusion that obstructionist states are driven more by the preservation of prestige than policy outcomes. In this sense, they are the conservatives of international relations, driven by their nostalgic desire for a period past rather than what is to come. If we consider the first major initiative of the United Nations as facilitating decolonisation in the 1950s and 1960s, we can readily find a record of obstruction by countries such as France in this new era. For France, Macmillan's <inline font-style="italic">Winds of C</inline><inline font-style="italic">hange</inline> glided gently by. This was despite decolonisation being recognised as a democratising process and self-determination becoming acknowledged as the right of all peoples. For example, in Indochina, France attempted to preserve its colonial rule against the will of the Vietnamese, withdrawing only after a prolonged war and eventual defeat in the 1950s. In Algeria, France was also out of touch with the international trend, sparking a civil war lasting from 1954 to 1962 and costing 45,000 lives. It is unfortunate that this eagerness to intervene in the affairs of other places did not translate to a more proactive posture in the Balkans during the wars from 1992 to 1995.</para><para>This concern for prestige and little more by France as a Security Council member can also be seen in its out of step approach to nuclear weapons testing in our region. Some senators may recall the legitimate outrage that these incidents provoked in Australia at the time. As the rest of the world was proceeding with the non-proliferation arrangements for nuclear weapons as well as ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, France was engaged in a series of nuclear explosions in the South Pacific, using its remaining colonial possessions as testing and dumping grounds. The world may wonder what sanctions these actions may have given to such states as North Korea and Pakistan to pursue their weapons programs in the latter half of the decade.</para><para>These examples of French behaviour beg the question as to why permanent rights in the Security Council should be accorded to the great powers of 1945 rather than a revised Security Council matching the contemporary global order. Surely some attempts at reform are required where a country so out of touch on these issues has the ability to deny UN legitimacy on a host of others. Is there any justification for the exclusion of India from permanent status on the Security Council? With over one-fifth of the world's population, and a nuclear capability, ought not New Delhi have as much a say as Paris? Or what of Japan's unique place in our region? And is it not time that the Asia-Pacific had a reasoned voice in world affairs?</para><para>It is only by reforming our global institutions like the UN that we can help mend the growing cracks in the resolve of the international community where the new aggressors fester. Through being a more inclusive forum the Security Council may be able to shake off the constraints imposed by the victors of World War II. No longer would rogue states find non-compliance with the UN an option. By bringing more nations to the table, the objections of obstructionists would be better balanced against the global interests and no longer would these same states feel encouraged to harbour those terrorists wishing to strike down a chance at a new and democratic peace.</para><para>I began by indicating how international disunity offers sanctuary to these new threats through breaking our resolve. It is in this very loss of courage that we are only one step away from appeasement through the constraints of inactivity. It was this danger that gave impetus to the UN. We must now give it a new meaning for a new time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Scoresby Freeway</title><page.no>10632</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10632</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to draw the Senate's attention to recent developments in relation to the government's mishandling of the Scoresby Freeway project in Melbourne. Whilst the Scoresby Freeway cum tollway has been the subject of a great deal of controversy recently, I would like to talk initially about how the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage has dealt with the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, otherwise known as the EPBC Act.</para></talk.start><para>Senators would first have heard about the proposed Scoresby Freeway in 2001 when the Liberal Party and the ALP engaged in a bidding war over the freeway in an attempt to win the Aston by-election. Both parties promised large sums of money for the road, without having any real appreciation of the broader implications of that project. It was a case of both parties trying to stare the other down in the hope, I think, that the other would scuttle the project and then one or the other side could claim victory and say it was the fault of the other. Of particular concern was the complete absence of consideration of alternative transport solutions and the need for better public transport in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. In the end, the federal government agreed to commit $445 million to the freeway project. I have not had a chance to look at the budget papers yet but I assume that this sum of money is still in there. Since then planning for the project has progressed with a significant proportion of the project subject to the EPBC Act's referral, assessment and approval process. </para><para>For these federal environment laws the Victorian government divided the project up into three stages and then referred just two of those stages to the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the act. We do not know why the freeway was divided into three sections as it was for these purposes, but the circumstances would strongly suggest that this was a deliberate ploy on the part of the Victorian state government to lower the chance that the project would require approval under the EPBC Act and/or to limit the scope of the act's assessment and approvals process. On this ground alone the federal minister for the environment should have refused to deal with those referrals that were made and he should have insisted that the whole freeway was dealt with in one action.</para><para>Astonishingly, the federal minister for the environment did deal with the two stages that were referred as separate actions rather than assessing the entire project as a single action, and he declared that one of the stages, the northern section, did not require approval and that the second stage, the southern stage, did. Only recently the minister has granted approval for the second stage, despite the fact that it is likely to have a significant impact on migratory birds species and the Seaford-Edithvale wetlands, which are included in the list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar convention. That final stage, being the section that will connect the eastern freeway at the Bulleen Road interchange to the Greensborough Highway, has not yet been considered under the EPBC Act. The minister's failure to treat the Scoresby Freeway project as a single action is another good example of how this government is undermining the effective operation of the EPBC Act. If the act is going to fulfil its environmental objectives, the Democrats say that there need to be drastic improvements in the way it is currently being administered.</para><para>Dr Paul Mees, a lecturer in transport planning at the University of Melbourne, recently uncovered another flaw in the handling of the Scoresby Freeway. The EPBC regulations require referral forms to state whether the action that is subject to the referral is related to any other actions or proposals in the region. The state government ignored this requirement and the referral documents prepared for the purposes of the northern section of the freeway did not reveal the fact that if the northern section of the freeway was built it is inevitable that the third stage of the freeway would also be constructed. Dr Mees brought this issue to the attention of the minister, who ignored his calls for action to be taken. Dr Mees then decided to take a challenge to the Federal Court on the legality of the referral documents prepared by the Victorian government. The Federal Court agreed with Dr Mees a week or so ago, holding that the failure to disclose this information rendered the referral documents misleading. It is important to keep in mind the fact that the provision of misleading information in referral documents not only creates difficulties for the federal minister but also diminishes the ability of the public to participate in the consultation processes under the act.</para><para>In light of the findings of the Federal Court, the Democrats are calling upon the minister for the environment to reconsider his original decision concerning the northern section of the Scoresby Freeway. We say that the minister should declare that the northern section requires approval under the act and should assess the action by way of a commission of inquiry. The commission of inquiry would enable a thorough investigation of the relevant impacts of the project, whilst also ensuring that members of the public are given an appropriate forum in which to express their views. It would also facilitate a detailed examination of whether or not there are feasible alternatives to the construction of the freeway that a more in keeping with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</para><para>As I noted earlier, the funding for this project was committed during the frenzy of a tight by-election campaign, and in this context neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party considered alternatives to the freeway, let alone bothering to consult the community to see what other transport needs there were in the area and what options were available. The Democrats called for a greater focus on public transport to give commuters in the area a real choice of leaving their cars at home and not joining the endless traffic jam that occurs in the morning and in the afternoon in that area. At the time, we called for funding to be committed to extend rail services to Rowville and tram services out to Knox, but the government, at both state and federal levels, opted for the old solution of freeways, which we know are unsustainable, ineffective and force commuters in the outer suburbs to be solely dependent upon cars.</para><para>We now have a situation where federal funds have been committed to the project, and the state government has, by introducing tolls, effectively said it does not want this money, so it will presumably sit there gathering dust in this very silly Mexican stand-off. Perhaps the government will choose to use this money on the Albury-Wodonga freeway, which now is going right through the middle of Albury. My latest information is that it is costing many more millions than the original estimates indicated.</para><para>Last month the Victorian state government announced that, due to budgetary constraints and to keep its budget in surplus, it would make the Scoresby Freeway into the Scoresby Tollway, effectively breaking, as I said, that funding agreement between the two governments. The money committed to the project from the Roads of National Importance scheme will presumably be allocated to another freeway project elsewhere in the country, leaving the eastern suburbs of Melbourne in the lurch—no freeway, no road improvements, no better public transport. I urge the government to allow commonsense to prevail. The federal government should recommit these funds to Melbourne's outer east, but it should do so for sustainable transport options. It should drop this idea of a freeway and persuade the Victorian government to do likewise.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Radioactive Waste Repository</title><page.no>10634</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10634</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to start my remarks tonight by quoting Senator Minchin. That is not something I would ever regularly sign up to do, so it highlights the importance of the issue. On Friday last week at a joint press conference in Adelaide with Minister McGauran, Senator Minchin said:</para></talk.start><para>But the point is, the decision will, as this one has been made, it will be made on the best scientific advice, not on the question of what political complexions might be put upon it. </para><para>Senator Minchin was of course talking about the storage of nuclear waste. Last Friday the government announced that they would be creating a low-level store for nuclear waste on a sheep property in South Australia. This proposal covers low-level waste, but the big unknown at this stage is where the intermediate waste will be stored. Minister McGauran stated in the same press conference that all states were under consideration for the storage of intermediate-level waste. </para><para>For those of us in Western Australia, this prospect revives some fairly scary memories of the proposal floated by the Court state government of a few years ago to create an international nuclear waste facility in Western Australia. This proposal, espoused by the then Premier, Richard Court, was about setting up a $10 billion facility in the outback of Western Australia. It was opposed by large sections of the Western Australian community, including the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Geoff Gallop. In 1999 legislation was passed by the state parliament banning importation, storage or treatment of international nuclear waste without the prior approval of both houses of parliament. Pangea, who were the proponents of the international nuclear waste facility, suspended the project in the face of overwhelming political opposition. </para><para>The writing is on the wall for the best scientific advice referred to by Senator Minchin if it advocates that Western Australia is the site for the intermediate waste dump. Western Australia did not want an international waste dump back then, nor does it want a domestic one now. No matter what carrots are going to be waved in front of the people of Western Australia, and in a $10 billion project, which is what the Pangea proposal was—there were lots of carrots waved—you cannot make people accept something that they recognise as inherently unsafe. Of course, we get a lot of rhetoric about the benefits of nuclear medicine; we also get a lot of rhetoric about selling uranium but not being concerned about the end product. Those arguments, when weighed against the shelf life of radioactive material and the risk of transporting it, do not cut it for our fellow Western Australians.</para><para>The Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, when in opposition, moved the private member's bill that I referred to earlier that resulted in the legislation passed in 1999 banning the international dump without parliamentary approval. I can assure those opposite that, on the supposed best scientific advice, now that Labor is in government in Western Australia it will also oppose this intermediate facility.</para><para>Indeed, it staggers me that Senator Minchin, Minister McGauran and the rest of the government believe that the Australian public will accept the notion that they are using scientific advice and that political complexions do not come into it. I say that the Australian people can see right through that feeble argument. When it suits the government's purpose, they use any expert opinion on the matter and, when it does not, they ridicule it. You cannot have it both ways. Either the only consideration is the expert advice or it is not.</para><para>You have only to consider the ridiculous history of the storage of nuclear waste in this country. At one stage expert advice was to site it near a rocket test facility. Now it is on a sheep station. Apparently, there was no political complexion to any of this. There is a neat three-card trick being used here. People are told that the proposals are safe. Of course, we can store it under proper conditions and there is no risk at all to the wider community, we are told. Of course, we can transport it across the country and we can do so because there is no risk, we are told. Of course, the best place to store it is in the middle of nowhere, but apparently there is no risk.</para><para>People are entitled to ask: how can we know all of this? We have had nuclear waste only for the last 60 years. How do we know that we can store it when in some cases it is still radioactive for a further 9,940 years? How do we know when there are hundreds of truckloads of material to be shipped that we can do so without any accidents or indeed terrorist incidents? Of course we are told that they will take it via a route that avoids people—it will just be bad luck if an accident happens near where you live or work. It is just plain dumb to ship this stuff from one side of the country to the other. Of course there is a political complexion to this—or is it just best scientific advice that says we should take it right across the country? Not that there is any political complexion to this debate, according to the government, but it is obvious that, politically, WA is very appealing to the government. The then Liberal state government were enthusiastic backers for the Pangea proposal, and even after the proposal was shelved they still run the line that nuclear waste storage in some form is good for Western Australia.</para><para>On 24 January last year Colin Barnett, the leader of the Liberal opposition in Western Australia, stated:</para><quote><para>As a signatory to nuclear non-proliferation treaties, it would be irresponsible of us to produce uranium and then not to concern ourselves with the end product. WA has one of the most stable geological structures and while I am not in favour of a Pangea type proposal we should consider a role in storing waste proportionate to the uranium we produce.</para></quote><para>This is a classic example of using the scientific fact that we are geologically stable with a moral argument that if we flog it then we have to store it. I would just like to point out to Mr Barnett that WA does not actually produce any uranium at the present time and that any proposal for it to do so would meet with overwhelming public opposition, along with strong opposition from the Australian Labor Party. I say to the government that the best scientific advice, unclouded by political complexions, should strongly recommend against Western Australia. But, regardless of any advice, the people and the government of Western Australia will reject any such facility.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adj</inline><inline

Telstra would discuss overcharging/product use whenever the customer raised a dispute on their ISDN/XSPC charges. It was at that point that any customer misuse or knowledge of the product could be raised to prevent any further occurrences. This issue was not treated as a billing problem by Telstra, simply a customer education and awareness process to ensure correct use of the product. As previously stated, Telstra's Business teams were made aware of the issues raised by certain customers on this product and accordingly communicated the findings from the project team.</para><para>(18)	Telstra advises that the complaint, if made by a business or Government customer, could be expected to have been discussed with the customer's B&amp;G account representative.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Palm Beach Office</title><page.no>10919</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1150)</subtitle><id.no>1150</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10919</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 6 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In relation to the Centrelink Office located at 1085 Gold Coast Highway, Palm Beach, Queensland:</para><para>(1)	What are the term and the expiry date of the current lease on the premises used by this office.</para><para>(2)	Is there any plan to relocate this office; if so, what are the details.</para><para>(3)	(a) What is the daily average number of face-to-face client contacts each working day; and (b) is there a day of the week or month when face-to-face contact peaks compared to any other day.</para><para>(4)	Have there been any incidents in the office or the immediate vicinity that have required the filing of an incident report by staff or the intervention of the police; if so, can details be provided of each such incident.</para><para>(5)	Have there been any complaints from the local community to Centrelink management regarding the behaviour of clients who visit this office; if so, can details be provided of each complaint and the action taken to address the community concerns.</para><para>(6)	What consultation has taken place with local businesses to assess the financial impact on their business due to the location of this Centrelink office.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10920</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The lease term is 3 years.

Finalisation figures might also be affected by factors such as starting dates for newly appointed members, finishing dates for existing members or the volume of other Tribunal work undertaken by members (for example, the Principal Member, Deputy Principal Member and Senior Members have management and administrative responsibilities, in addition to case work). Decision figures will also reflect the variable nature of individual cases. Finally, members are appointed on either a part-time or full-time basis, as noted in the table, and the number of days that part-time members are engaged varies according to their availability and the Tribunal's case load. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Table (1)(b): Migration Review Tribunal, </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Cases Finalised by Members in 2001-02 and 2002-03 (to 28 February 2003)</inline></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>No.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Member</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Cases Finalised: 2001-02July - June (12 months)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Cases Finalised: 2002-03July - February (8 months)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Comments*</para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Bail, J.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>131</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>117</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Full-time.

sickness. Finalisation figures might also be affected by factors such as starting dates for newly appointed members, finishing dates for existing members or the volume of other Tribunal work undertaken by members (for example, the Principal Member, Deputy Principal Member and Senior Members have management and administrative responsibilities, in addition to case work). Decision figures will also reflect the variable nature of individual cases. Finally, members are appointed on either a part-time or full-time basis, as noted in the table, and the number of days that part-time members are engaged varies according to their availability and the Tribunal's case load.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Nursing Home Type Patients</title><page.no>10949</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1240)</subtitle><id.no>1240</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10949</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 3 March 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What is the current number of nursing home type patients in public hospitals;

Although Australia may be able to maintain its current export levels given that ninety per cent of the Russian tariff rate quota will be allocated on the basis of historical imports, Australian exporters will still need to compete with other countries for a share of the tariff rate quota.

A tariff rate quota applies to raw sugar imports and under current Russian law no developed country supplier (including Australia) has access to this tariff rate quota.
