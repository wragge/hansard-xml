The legislation forms the central plank of the government's ethanol policy—a flawed policy designed to lend a hand to a mate of the Prime Minister that has not and will not assist the development of a diverse Australian biofuels industry. This second reading amendment addresses a key failing of the Howard government's flawed ethanol policy formulation—that is, its lack of accountability to the parliament and the Australian people on its policy motivation. The amendment does not constitute a rejection of the bills but a deferral of their consideration until such time as the government satisfactorily discharges its obligations to the Senate through compliance with an order for the production of documents related to ethanol excise and production subsidies. </para><para>I will address the matter of the Senate order shortly, but I firstly want to discuss what the Prime Minister likes to call `the context' of the ethanol issue—or maybe even the `totality of the context', as Mr Abbott put it in his embarrassing performance on ABC <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night. Over the past few weeks, the inner workings of the government's alternative fuels policy formulation process has been revealed—and it is not a pretty sight. It is a process in which good public policy has been put to one side and a fix to help a mate has been made a central policy objective. The government has developed a short-sighted policy package that has already backfired on it.</para><para>I know the government does not understand that the advantage of properly formulating public policy is that the resulting policy generally gathers public support and proves sustainable in the marketplace. But the government's ethanol policy has none of these characteristics. It is important to understand what the Prime Minister and the government wanted the parliament and the Australian people to know about the background to their policy development. Over three days last September, the opposition asked the Prime Minister whether he had had any communications with the Chairman of the Manildra Group, Mr Dick Honan, about ethanol policy. Over three days, the Prime Minister emphatically stated that he had not. But we now know that not only was there contact between Mr Howard and Mr Honan but there was a private meeting between the two men. To say it was not private because there was another person present is to ignore the fact that the other person was a note-taker from PM&amp;C.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—So they don't count?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—No, they do not count.

That tells us how private the meeting was. We know, through access to a document obtained under the Freedom Of Information Act, that the meeting included discussion about ethanol excise. The document refers to:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... the payment of a producer credit to ethanol producers to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with cheaper Brazilian product.</para></quote><para>That is how the meeting record prepared by that officer of PM&amp;C describes it. So, when the Prime Minister says he did not know anything about the threat of Brazilian imports when he met with Mr Honan, we are entitled not to believe him. How could the discussion on the point about support for Australian ethanol producers to assist them to compete with cheaper Brazilian product be read any other way? Also obtained under freedom of information is a series of documents outlining the intense lobbying by Manildra and the ethanol industry representatives up to and including the secretary to the Prime Minister's own department. These documents include handwritten notes that divulge questioning about cabinet processes and a request for the circulation of documents at a cabinet meeting. An email from industry representative Mr Bob Gordon sent on 21 August to government representatives—including the Prime Minister and the cabinet officer present at Mr Howard's meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August 2002—says in part: </para><quote><para>Our Association has, for some time, been advocating moving biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel from the existing excise scheme to a producer credit scheme funded by fuel excise revenues.</para></quote><para>Does that sound familiar? In fact, it advocates a producer credit scheme consistent with that pressed upon the Prime Minister by Mr Honan on 1 August 2002. On 28 August last year, Mr Honan wrote to the Prime Minister in similar terms. The letter—commencing with the words, `This is just a short note to let you know how much we appreciate your support for ethanol'—contains the following key request:</para><quote><para>We have proposed urgent consideration of moving ethanol and biodiesel from the existing fuel excise structure to a producer credit scheme.</para></quote><para>Lo and behold, what did the Howard government deliver in its decision of 12 September 2002, just weeks after Mr Howard's chat with his mate? It delivered a producer credit scheme for ethanol producers entirely consistent with Mr Honan's urgings and underpinned by the measures contained in the legislation before us today. Lest anyone think we are talking about a diverse industry, let us remember that, in the first 10 months of the government's new ethanol policy, Mr Honan's company, Manildra, received more than 96 per cent of all producer subsidies. The company received more than 96c in every dollar paid out in the last financial year under the subsidy scheme—that is, $20.8 million from subsidy payments totalling $21.7 million. That is the background of this policy. It is as shabby a policy background as you are ever likely to come across.</para><para>A key feature of the government's flawed defence of its ethanol policy has been its attempt to cloak its action in concern for the sugar industry. In this action, the National Party—a once great political organisation— has been complicit. This has been an example of the Nationals at their intellectual worst—and that is really saying something. The fact is that the government's ethanol policy has nothing to do with concern for the sugar industry. The regime put in place has benefited and will continue to benefit a company that produces ethanol from grain. Even with the introduction of capital grants, the prospect of any substantial benefit from the government's ethanol policy going to canegrowers is remote at best. On this matter I refer the Senate to coordination comments from the Treasury in cabinet memorandum JH02/0315, which was considered by cabinet on 10 September last year. Treasury said:</para><quote><para>Treasury notes that there are already lower cost feedstocks for ethanol production, including wheat starch and sorghum.</para></quote><para>Sugar does not get a mention. It is pointed out that wheat starch and sorghum are of lower cost than sugar. ABARE's 2001 report on the viability of ethanol production from sugar cane, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, gives a very mixed commentary on the matter. One key finding in the ABARE report is that investors in new operations for sugarcane based ethanol production will face disadvantages when compared to existing operators, including Manildra. According to ABARE, that is because Manildra is at the low end of the production costs scale for fuel ethanol. Not only does Manildra have the option of using capacity already in place and therefore only has to cover operating costs in order to justify continued operation; but also, in line with the Treasury's advice to government, Manildra uses relatively low cost non-sugar feed stock. Since ABARE made these comments, Manildra's advantage has, of course, been amplified by the massive subsidies the government has paid it.</para><para>Another argument used by the government to defend its ethanol policy is the supposed environmental benefits that will flow from it. A view is put that, because ethanol is not generated from carbon based fossil fuels, it delivers profound environmental benefits. But the CSIRO, amongst others, has authoritatively and effectively debunked what some describe as the ethanol myth. According to CSIRO, when you look at the life cycle utilisation of all the resources going to produce ethanol and at its relative fuel efficiency, there is no net environmental benefit to be gained. Let me go back to the cabinet memorandum of last September. Environment Australia advised cabinet: </para><quote><para>There is a limit to the capacity of fuel ethanol sourced from sugar feedstock using current technology to deliver significant air quality and any greenhouse gas reduction benefits, or to provide a cost-competitive fuel source.</para></quote><para>This growing controversy over the use of ethanol goes back to 1999 when, as part of its so-called Measures for a Better Environment package, the government promised to harmonise Australian vehicle emissions with European standards. To support this, the government promised to introduce fuel quality standards.</para><para>Historically, there has been no limit domestically on the amount of ethanol that suppliers can include in petrol blends in individual sales at the bowser. However, during consultation on the development of the national fuel quality standards in late 2000, Environment Australia proposed that a maximum cap of 10 per cent apply to ethanol. That was consistent with international standards, as I understand it. Vehicle manufacturers agreed, and argue now that ethanol blends of greater than 10 per cent will affect engine operability in components such as fuel lines. They provided advice to the government over an extended period of time that many manufacturing warranties only extend cover for up to 10 per cent blends. Beyond that, some warranties are removed completely, whilst others are removed for fuel line systems.</para><para>In March 2001 the government referred this issue to the ACCC through the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. The minister said that consumers have a right to know the extent to which their petrol is being mixed with ethanol, and they also have a right to know whether their engines are at risk of being ruined. This issue should have been dealt with in the development of the comprehensive fuel standards, announced in May 2001, but Mr Howard determined that the decision on setting a standard for ethanol limit in petrol be deferred for 12 months until May 2002. Now we know why that happened.</para><para>According to Bryan Nye, the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, told him on 21 August last year that the government would not take action that would adversely impact on Manildra, including the imposition of a 10 per cent cap on ethanol blends in fuel. At the time this advice from Mr Truss was revealed, the Prime Minister was keeping secret his 1 August meeting with Mr Honan. That decision provided short-term relief for petrol retailers who blended ethanol in excess of 10 per cent and, of course, Manildra, which supplied that ethanol. But, as we now know, it has proven to be a medium-term disaster for Manildra, and a self-inflicted political hangover for the Prime Minister. Blind Freddy knew that a 10 per cent cap was required, but the Prime Minister said no, obviously on the basis of the representation of one of the key vested interests—the one non-neutral participant in the special task force set up to look at this matter: the Manildra Group's representative.</para><para>The ACCC had formally advised the government in December 2001 that they had several fair trading concerns about the potential for misleading conduct by particular distributors and retailers. These concerns related to lack of disclosure to consumers, impact on vehicles and warranties and the reduction in fuel economy. Fuel economy is affected by the energy content of a litre of ethanol, which is about 30 per cent less than a litre of petrol. In May 2002, rather than setting the proposed limit, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced a $5 million two-year study on market barriers to biofuels, which included funding for vehicle testing and technical assessment of the use of 20 per cent ethanol blend vehicles. Fuel industry representatives have confirmed that it is simply a delaying tactic to allow a higher than 10 per cent blend to continue. </para><para>On 22 August 2002 the Australian Automobile Association, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Institute of Petroleum jointly called on the government to institute a 10 per cent limit. They also opposed mandating ethanol at any level. But it was not until April this year— eight months after that warning and years after the first concerns were raised—that the environment minister finally bowed to the inevitable and introduced a 10 per cent limit on ethanol levels in petrol. This was a position adopted by the Labor opposition more than six months earlier. Thanks to Mr Howard and this government, consumer confidence in the ethanol industry has been shot to pieces. The short-term strategy by Mr Howard to protect Manildra by allowing ethanol levels in fuel to remain above 10 per cent turned into a medium-term disaster as consumers rejected—and continue to reject—fuel that contained ethanol.</para><para>Having allowed the reputation of ethanol as a fuel to be all but destroyed, therefore facilitating a collapse in demand, on 12 September last year the government announced changes to excise arrangements and a short-term subsidy arrangement. In the 2003 budget, the government announced more changes to the ethanol excise and subsidy regime. In late July more changes were announced, including expediting subsidy payments, an exclusive commercial facilitator for Manildra and a capital grants regime almost completely lacking in detail. The minister's media releases announcing the latest components of the ethanol package did not come with a Manildra crest next to the Commonwealth coat of arms, which is surprising, but that was surely just an administrative oversight on the part of the responsible minister in these circumstances!</para><para>At the time these bills were considered in the other place, Labor did not have any objections to them in isolation. On their own, they subjected ethanol to the same excise arrangements as other fuels. For that reason, we did not oppose the bills. But at that time we did not know about the Prime Minister's secret meeting and we did not know how the government would continue to refuse to comply with an order of the Senate for the production of documents, an order that Senator Ian Campbell on a number of occasion assured the Senate the government would comply with. </para><para>For the reasons that I have outlined in the amendment that I have moved, I want to urge senators to support the deferral of consideration of these bills until such time as the government fully complies with the order for production of documents directly related to the legislation before us. There is the precedent of a very similar resolution, which was supported, amongst others, by most of the frontbench of the government in the Senate—and you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles—in the context of the debate on child-care legislation in 1995. This is an unusual step for the opposition to take but, in these circumstances, we think it is justified. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>13288</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1803">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 by imposing the same excise duty of 38.143c per litre as is currently applied to petrol, with effect from 18 September. The <inline ref="R1804">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> makes analogous changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with respect to customs duty for ethanol. Although the bills subject ethanol to excise and customs duty, the excise free status of ethanol has been effectively maintained through the introduction of a domestic production subsidy for new and existing producers of ethanol, applied at the same rate as the excise duty. The subsidy, however, is not available for imported fuel ethanol, so the government is effectively protecting the local industry from cheap imports, most of which would come from Brazil. The budget papers indicate that the cost of this subsidy will be around $27 million in 2003-04, $45 million in 2004-05, $61 million in 2005-06 and $62 million in 2006-07.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past 12 months or so we have watched consumer confidence in ethanol plummet in this country. It is my firm belief that both the government and the opposition must shoulder much of the responsibility for this. Both, in my view, have acted in ways that have undermined consumer confidence in this industry and have taken the industry back a long way in terms of its development in Australia. Currently, only about 60 million litres of ethanol are sold in Australia, and that represents 0.19 per cent of petrol and diesel use. When the orchestrated scare campaign about ethanol took hold in the national media, the government should have acted in the best interests of the industry and consumers, and should have imposed an interim cap at the agreed level of 10 per cent until testing into the effects of higher blends had been completed. If it had imposed that interim limit at that early stage, a cap would probably have restored consumer confidence in the product before it spiralled down out of control.</para><para>However, instead of acting promptly, the government sat back and essentially said that the jury was still out while the testing of higher blends continued. That approach was never going to assuage consumer concerns and, unsurprisingly, consumer confidence in the fuel fell through the floor. Only history will show whether the government's very recent decision to impose a 10 per cent cap on ethanol in petrol—which came into effect only last month—and its decision to require mandatory national labelling of the product have come too late, and whether irreparable damage has been done. I certainly worry when I see signs in petrol stations informing consumers that the station does not sell petrol with ethanol in it. Indeed, I am informed by industry people that sales of the fuel have fallen sharply and that they have nowhere near recovered to where they were in terms of selling this fuel prior to the onset of the scare campaign.</para><para>This brings me to the role of the ALP in this campaign. It is apparent to me that, rather than concentrating on the facts, the ALP has instead chosen to engage in cheap political point scoring. While it is appropriate for the opposition—as it is for the Democrats—to hold the government of the day to account and to have it not mislead the parliament about any issue, I think that it is not appropriate to use any industry as a political football, as it appears the opposition has done on numerous occasions in relation to the ethanol debate over the last 12 months. I think that the ALP has shamelessly used the ethanol industry to attack the government and to raise the level of fear in the community about the product, on the back of often false media reports about the damage caused to engines through the use of ethanol. </para><para>Over the past year the litany of uncorroborated reports that has been presented in the national media about the damage that ethanol has caused—despite the fact that the fuel in the examples presented in the media was not tested for the presence of ethanol—has been shameful. An example is the claim made earlier this year in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> that ethanol had caused $800 damage to a courier van and the loss of four days pay to the owner. However, when two samples of the fuel were subjected to independent laboratory testing, the fuel was found not to contain any ethanol at all. On this point I would like to make the observation that, in the eight years or so that ethanol blends have been on the market in Australia, there has been scant evidence of actual damage to engines having been done. We constantly hear about the damage that can be caused, but when you look at the raw data there is little to be found.</para><para>This brings me to the role of auto manufacturers in Australia. During this debate vehicle manufacturers have said that vehicle warranties could be voided if consumers used fuels at levels of more than 10 per cent ethanol. However, those same manufacturers have been reluctant to hand over the studies that they have done, which supposedly prove that more than 10 per cent ethanol is a problem. This place is no doubt aware that other countries allow 20 per cent and 85 per cent ethanol content, but cars there are usually modified to take this blend. In the United States flexible fuel vehicles—otherwise known as FFVs—are sold, which can automatically adjust to using ethanol blends of up to 85 per cent. Vehicle manufacturers in the US provide full warranties for the one million FFVs that are produced every year.</para><para>Ethanol is not a fuel that we ought to be scared of, but of course we do need to deal with it in a sensible way. The federal government needs to provide reliable information to the Australian public, and the Labor Party should stop its political point scoring and scaremongering so that people can have confidence that what they are putting into their tanks is better for air quality—as it is— provides opportunities for regional Australia and does not damage their car. It is not that difficult.</para><para>With respect to the environmental effects of the fuel, it is obvious that there are conflicting views among scientists and policy analysts about producing ethanol from crops. But, having said that, it is also fair to say that the use of ethanol can have important air quality benefits. Testing has established that the use of ethanol blends may reduce emissions of hydrocarbons, particulates, carbon monoxide and, in some cases, carbon dioxide. According to the federal government's latest review of worldwide research, reductions in oxides of nitrogen emissions are lower with 10 per cent ethanol but can increase again at higher levels. Fuel economy also appears to worsen over 10 per cent. On the flip side, higher ethanol blends reduce carbon monoxide, which in high concentrations causes asphyxia and nervous system damage. Higher ethanol blends can also lower carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas.</para><para>In the other place mention was made of the CSIRO's landmark report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Comparison of transport fuels</inline>. This report found that the use of ethanol as a transport fuel has a neutral or negative greenhouse benefit in comparison with unleaded petrol. However, this place may be interested to know that a more recent study based on Australian ethanol production in Queensland found that there was a four per cent higher greenhouse benefit for E10 than for unleaded petrol. The CSIRO report also found that, as a renewable fuel, ethanol produces significantly less fossil carbon dioxide than conventional fuels.</para><para>So the Democrats will be supporting both of these bills, but we have grave concerns about the campaign that has been under way so far. We also have concerns about the government's long-term plans with regard to the fuel taxation regime for alternative fuels. With respect to ethanol, the government announced during the May budget that it would change the excise and grants arrangements by reducing the grant in five even annual steps from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. The final rate of the grant is yet to be determined but we understand that it is likely to be announced by the end of the year. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>notes: </para><quote><para>... if implemented, these proposals would result in the withdrawal of assistance, resulting in a contraction of the ethanol industry. </para></quote><para>We are not sure what the government wants with regard to this, but it is clear to me that that is exactly what will happen—and not just with ethanol but with other alternative fuels as well.</para><para>It is instructive that, in other countries where alternative fuels represent more than just a token player in the fuels market, they have tax or other financial arrangements in place to promote their use—they do not just say that they are on a level playing field and let them test themselves in the marketplace; they actually promote their consumption. Take Germany as an example. In June 2002, the German government enacted legislation to provide a fuel tax exemption for ethanol and to extend biodiesel's exemption to December 2008. Germany currently has 19 biodiesel plants operating, with another five currently under construction. </para><para>Many other countries have mandated the use of ethanol. Brazil has enacted legislation requiring that all transport fuel must contain 20 per cent ethanol. In the United States the US energy bill mandates that at least 19 billion litres of ethanol must be used in petrol by 2015. The United States currently has 73 ethanol plants, with 12 new plants under construction. In India the government has mandated that petrol sold in nine states and four union territories must contain at least five per cent ethanol, which is about 380 million to 580 million litres of fuel per year. Tough goals for ethanol and other alternative fuel use have also been set. The European Union has a goal of increasing biofuel use from two per cent in 2005 to 20 per cent by 2020.</para><para>The Democrats have always been strong supporters of ethanol and ethanol production. We supported the ethanol bounty, which was additional to the previous excise exemption. The Howard government abolished that bounty, which was established by the Keating government at a time perhaps when the ethanol industry had more support from the ALP. We support ethanol because we believe that the greater use of ethanol in this country is likely to result in environmental and economic benefits in the long term, even in the short term. It is a grave disappointment to us, as I have said, that we have seen such a decline in the use of that fuel. </para><para>With regard to Labor's second reading amendment, I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting this amendment, and we will be supporting it for a range of reasons. I think it is time for the Senate to get tough with the government on returns to order in this place. We have seen total disdain—I think that is the best way to describe it—on the part of the government for providing documents that ought to be in this place. We will have a debate this afternoon on that matter, and I will talk in greater detail about the sorts of documents the government has refused to provide to this parliament and some of the very illogical and contradictory reasons that have been provided for doing so. </para><para>I do not think I am disclosing anything I ought not in this place, but Senator Campbell approached me earlier and suggested that we should not support this amendment because these documents had already been sourced by the ALP. If that is the reason that the government intends to pull this bill—as it is threatening to do—then I think it is pretty pathetic. What we are saying is that we agree that these documents should be tabled in the parliament. If they are available under FOI, and currently the ALP has copies of those documents, as I understand it—  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—Not all of them yet. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—That is another good reason for supporting this amendment. But I want to know that everyone in this place is entitled to see that document, not just the ALP because they have asked for it under FOI. If these are documents that are relevant to this debate, then let us have the debate when we have the documents. Let us treat this parliament as a part of the decision making in this country, which requires that all of the evidence necessary to engage in that debate and that decision making is available to us. If the government has something to hide in these documents, we ought to know that too. There is no way that the Democrats will not support a demand for documents which are relevant to the piece of legislation which is being debated.

Let me now speak to the actual second reading amendment. I realise that Senator O'Brien has spoken to the bills, so this may make it a little difficult to get an answer other than as an interjection, but the first issue I want to raise is: would Senator O'Brien commit a future Labor government to making public the notations that are made by a departmental person when they are in a private meeting with a future Labor Prime Minister of this country? If the Labor Party is not willing to commit to doing that, then this motion is a complete hypocrisy. One ought not ask of the present government something that one would not be willing to do oneself if one were the government. That goes to the total basis of this second reading amendment. We are exposing our public servants, who are working for us, to the possibility that they may be required to do that. I do not believe that that is in the best interests of the function of either this chamber or the House of Representatives. I hear what you say and I accept your rulings, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will rephrase what I said earlier in relation to making a precedent. No, this is not a precedent, but it is bringing forward very publicly a process under which bills could be held up— and this bill is particularly important. One Nation wants to place very clearly on the record that One Nation does support both of these pieces of legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will now commence my comments on the bill itself. It is very interesting to note that we have a lot of speculation about the possible damage that can be caused to motor vehicles with the introduction of ethanol. I think we need a history lesson. If we go back to when Henry Ford originally designed and built the model T Ford, it was designed to run on 100 per cent ethanol. Yes, we have had changes in technology, but if the original model T Ford had the capacity to run all those years on 100 per cent ethanol, to put it in very plain English, it makes it a little difficult to swallow the issue that is being bandied about that ethanol is bad for engines. As I said earlier, One Nation supports the development of an Australian fuel ethanol industry. I believe it is important to support the industry and One Nation also supports the mandating of ethanol content at a minimum of 10 per cent. Such a move would create 90,000 jobs and the vast majority of those would be created in regional Australia. </para><para>Most of our ethanol in Australia today is a by-product of the grains industry. It is part of the value-adding process of wheat. Ethanol is also produced from molasses for the chemical industry. Queensland cane growers currently receive no benefit from existing ethanol plants. However, there is a great potential for ethanol production to become an additional source of income for cane growers in the long term. Fuel ethanol cannot solve all of the problems of the sugar industry, but all the options must be considered. One Nation believes that the sugar industry needs to diversify its product range so that it is no longer totally dependent on the vagaries of a distorted world sugar price. The industry needs funding for the establishment of an ethanol industry and the development of biodegradable plastics, high-grade proteins and pharmaceuticals. Support from the federal government would be useful, as would mandating the use of ethanol. This would breathe new life into many regional sugar and grain based communities. As well as providing economic benefit for rural Queensland, ethanol will reduce our dependence upon petroleum products. </para><para>Australia's reserves of crude oil are considered to be low, with the reserves to production ratio estimated at below 10 years. This indicates that Australia's resource of crude oil will run down in the not-too-distant future. Many top academics and petroleum geologists are pointing to the fact that the world has reached the peak of oil production and our reserves are now slowly dwindling. The transition to other fuels is timely and a necessary step, but it is not necessary that the multinational oil companies should be in control of that transition. The transition to alternative fuels should be viewed as an opportunity for Australian owned businesses and Australian products to benefit. </para><para>I now comment on the bill. Let me summarise the current situation relating to the excise tariffs on ethanol. Firstly, the government intends to impose an excise on ethanol at the same rate imposed on unleaded petrol, taxing it at 38.143c per litre. At the same time, the government intends to introduce a production subsidy of 38.143c per litre for ethanol to offset that excise. Finally, the government intends to impose a duty on ethanol imports at 38.143c per litre. All of this will have the effect of protecting the domestic ethanol industry from imports. Let me reiterate: this will help our domestic ethanol industry by putting a tax on imported ethanol so that it is more expensive than the locally produced product. The situation raises some very important questions. The proposed subsidy is creating a protection regime. This must surely be at loggerheads with both the Liberal-National government stance on free trade and Labor's position. At APEC, via the Cairns Group and the WTO on a broader level, the Liberal-National and Labor parties have strongly supported the removal of protections—liberalisation for Australian industry and agriculture. We have only to look at our farming, textiles, clothing and footwear sectors to see the awful impact of that liberalisation. Letting industry compete in the global market places it without any protection. That is usually the death knoll of any industry. That is the reason our farmers are working away from their land. It is the reason our industries are moving to the Third World, where companies can access sweatshop labour. </para><para>But here we have a bill to protect domestic industry—a bill that demonstrates that the government is capable of protecting an industry. The bill indicates that we do not have to kowtow to the WTO's trade liberalisation agenda. Through you, Madam Deputy President, I ask the minister how she is going to explain to the struggling farmers in Queensland that the government can introduce a bill to protect domestic production of ethanol but is not willing to provide protection for other industries, such as the sugar and dairy industries.  </para><para>In Australia it is said that the ethanol industry could be of great assistance to our cane farmers, who are facing stiff competition from Brazil's sugar. Our cane farmers are paying First World costs and receiving Third World prices. Just to explain that, cane farmers in Australia pay current First World prices for all their fertilisers, chemicals, water and, more importantly, for their labour— the people they employ. Our sugar industry is being asked to pay all of those relative costs here in Australia but only receive the same payment for its sugar that a person in Brazil, or any other country, would pay in relation to their costs. </para><para>The government has argued that Australia must show the way for other countries in the global market, so it has removed tariffs for the sugar industry; yet here is ethanol production being subsidised and promoted as a diversification option for farmers. Quite clearly, ethanol has become a political football. You have to wonder whether the concern for ethanol is more a matter of meeting Australia's Agenda 21 commitments than a matter of getting the industry going in the long term. You have to wonder, given that the budget proposal mooted this year would result in the withdrawal of assistance for the ethanol industry by 2008. In other words, the industry would be left out in the cold after that date. </para><para>If our sugar producers in Queensland are to participate in a developed ethanol market, any revenue from ethanol production must actually flow through to the farmers. The returns need to go to mills that are cooperatively owned by farmers, not by corporations like Bundaberg Sugar or Tate and Lyle. In cooperative mills, the benefits that go to the mill from production from the by-products ultimately do assist the cane farmers. Where a corporate entity owns the mills, once sugar reaches the mill and goes through the first crushing process the ownership transfers to the corporate entity, and any benefits from that point on go to the corporation, not the farmers.</para><para>When the government look at any subsidies that are going to flow from this into the ethanol industry, it is absolutely critical they see that any assistance goes to cooperative mills to get the benefit back through to the farmers. I realise that state legislation affects that, and it would be necessary to address the issue through the Queensland Sugar Act. Resolving the issue would not be difficult or impossible, given the propensity of the federal and state governments to operate together on important issues through COAG.</para><para>Let me give a brief snapshot of the ethanol industry in Australia at present. The bulk of ethanol is produced on the east coast and sold in New South Wales through independent outlets. These outlets are in the main supplied by the Manildra Group, which manufactures ethanol from wheat waste in Nowra, New South Wales. The major oil companies are assessing the manufacture and supply of fuel ethanol, and BP is marketing a 10 per cent by volume ethanol blend fuel in south-east Queensland.</para><para>The use of ethanol in Australia at present is small. The total output is around 135 million litres, of which around 50 million litres is being used in fuel blending. A study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that if fuel ethanol were to capture 10 per cent of the petrol market by 2010 the annual loss to government revenue in the form of zero excise would be about $688 million. So here we see the reason for the proposed reintroduction of the excise, the production subsidy and the import duty and the reason why the subsidy will end in 2008. The government is having a bet both ways. If the price of petrol increases due to scarcity, ethanol may well be produced more cheaply than petrol, or at least on a par with it, and the government will win by obtaining excise. If the cost of producing petroleum continues to be less than the cost of producing ethanol, the subsidy can be removed, and the industry could quite quietly collapse. </para><para>In conclusion, the day of ethanol is dawning globally. The establishment of viable ethanol plants based on renewable products such as sugar cane has the potential to make a vital contribution to regional development and reduce Australia's dependency on costly oil imports. I place on record that One Nation will support both the government bills and vote against the second reading amendment moved by Senator O'Brien.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13295</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to address two main issues in summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R1804">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1803">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>. Firstly, I want to set the policy context for the consideration of these bills because, although I know it matters little to the opposition, I suspect Senators Allison and Harris will be interested in that. Secondly, I want to address the extraordinary political context in which these very sensible bills are to be held up. In doing so, I will certainly be appealing to the Democrats, through Senator Allison, to reconsider their foreshadowed support for the extraordinary amendment moved by Senator O'Brien on behalf of the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>I will go firstly to the policy setting. An efficient and competitive energy sector is a key priority for the government's strategic policy agenda. With advances in technology producing cleaner vehicle engines and with the continued emergence of alternative fuels, it is clear that Australia must have a more consistent and sustainable fuel tax regime. The existing arrangements have created taxation distortions in the fuel market, leading to inefficient investments in fuel production and equipment and uncertainty for users of fuels. These are not desirable outcomes. Accordingly, the government has announced important, long-term reforms to the excise treatment of fuels. The reforms establish a broad, sustainable taxation framework by addressing a number of current anomalies in the fuel tax system and providing increased long-term certainty for investors, while meeting the government's commitments and providing time for the industry to adjust.</para><para>The government's reforms of the existing fuel tax arrangements will bring all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines into the excise and customs duty systems by 1 July 2008. The introduction of excise for currently untaxed fuels will be accompanied by the use of subsidies that will reduce the effective excise for those fuels for a transitional period. These subsidies will be progressively reduced from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. The broad reform framework will be fully implemented by 1 July 2012, when all fuels used in internal combustion engines will be subject to excise and customs duty based on factors including energy content, providing tax neutrality between fuels.</para><para>Consistent with these broader arrangements, this bill amends the Excise Tariff Act to validate Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2002), which removed the excise exemption for domestically produced ethanol for use as fuel and imposed an excise rate equivalent to that of petroleum from 18 September 2002. Ethanol producers now receive a production subsidy which was due to end on 18 September 2003 to offset the excise of 38.143c per litre applying to ethanol. This rate of duty is the same as the rate currently applying to petrol. The government will continue this existing excise and grant arrangement for ethanol producers until 30 June 2008. From 1 July 2008 both domestically produced and imported ethanol will receive a grant which will be reduced in five even annual instalments from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. </para><para>To complement these excise changes, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which impose additional customs duty of 38.143c per litre on ethanol imported for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine. Together with the broader fuel excise package, these reforms will establish a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. They will provide the opportunity for currently untaxed fuels to establish their commercial credentials in the marketplace. The reforms fulfil the government's existing commitments concerning the tax treatment of fuels and deliver on the Measures for a Better Environment commitment, which I know is of great interest to Senator Allison, to encourage the production of alternative and renewable fuels.</para><para>The policy setting for the bills currently before the Senate for consideration really is unexceptionable. Indeed, the bills set out both a transparent and coherent fuel regime by which ethanol can be taken up in the market and used more appropriately. But what do we have? Currently, we have a political controversy for no good purpose and an apparent attempt to hold up the passage of these bills. It really comes down to, on any view, a pretty flimsy case. The first point is that there is a controversy about whether or not there was a so-called secret meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Honan. That really seems to be the nub of it. From what we now know and from what has happened over the past day or so it beggars belief that this can actually be seriously put up as a reason to hold up the passage of these bills. The meeting was not only not secret; it was attended by somebody who took a note and then that note was distributed to seven people within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. So we have a meeting that is minuted and the minutes distributed. Of course it is then made the subject of a FOI request, which was in fact granted. The document relating to the meeting has been produced under FOI.</para><para>The second subtext of all this is that somehow or other there is something sinister about business lobbying government. I can see those sitting opposite have never been in government. Should the Labor Party ever convince the Australian people that they would be capable of governing this country, let me assure them that business lobbying government is not only not unusual; it is par for the course. In my experience many thousands of Australians lobby the government on issues that affect them, and they are entitled to do that. There is nothing wrong with someone whose interests are going to be affected by a direction that the government might or might not take actually putting their point of view. Somebody explaining a position to you is one way in which you can actually learn something, as Senator O'Brien no doubt would appreciate.</para><para>But in this case there is nothing sinister about the meeting and there is certainly nothing sinister or unusual about any business interest lobbying the government. I think it can be accepted when you really strip it down to its bare bones that there is nothing about any of the policy direction or any of the political lobbying in this matter that is marked by any distinguishing or unusual feature. What really gives the lie to this extraordinary turn of events that unfolded in the House of Representatives yesterday and today in obstructing these sensible measures is that it is said that Mr Honan somehow or other got some great favours. If you really look at it, Manildra did not get all they wanted. I want to run through the demands that were apparently made and then inform the Senate where we have got to with these policies. It certainly in no way indicates that the wishes of Manildra were granted or even accommodated. </para><para>First of all, Mr Honan wanted mandated ethanol of 10 per cent. Did he get that? No, he did not get that. He did not get any arrangement from this government saying that petrol has to include, in this case, 10 per cent ethanol. That is the first request that has not been met. The second request was that Mr Honan wanted the excise exemption for ethanol retained. Ethanol had always been excise free in this country. It has never had an excise on it. We had given a five-year commitment that we would not change that situation without giving five years notice. We gave notice in this year's budget in May that the clock was ticking and that the five-year exemption was now running down. Far from keeping the excise exemption, the fact is that the clock is now ticking and the exemption is now running down until 2008.</para><para>Mandating was not granted. The ethanol excise exemption was kept but, certainly, for five years and in accordance with our election policy, and we have started the countdown in relation to that. The third thing that was asked for was a payment of a producer credit to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with cheaper Brazilian product, and that came about. The producer credit was promised in our election policy at the last election, so that also was hardly a secret. Recently the government have announced a capital subsidy for new and expanding biofuels production. The fourth thing, which Mr Honan did not want, that we have imposed is a 10 per cent cap on ethanol blended fuel. Did Manildra want a cap? No, it did not.</para><para>So when you look at what Mr Honan's lobbying got him, it got him a meeting with the Prime Minister—a very unexceptional meeting, and one like those that happen on dozens of occasions, no doubt, in every minister's office in this building and in other places around this country and overseas. Lobbying happens—that is what happens when you are in government. But if you look at what has happened to Mr Honan's requests, it is pretty obvious that he was not wholly successful in what he had sought. For the purposes of our further consideration of these two bills, it is necessary to bear in mind not only the policy regime that this government wishes to introduce to have a coherent regime for the treatment of fuels but also to isolate from it whatever may or may not be said in relation to these matters that involve the meeting—or the lobbying—of Manildra and the government.</para><para>Senator Allison has said that what she wants to do is get tough with returns to order, but I think these should not be the bills to hold up. If that is something that needs attention, there are better and more appropriate ways to do it. The fact is that this is really a political stunt. I think the political intent of it is pretty obvious, because there is a very flimsy connection to the actual second reading amendment. When you look at it, what is being suggested here is that the bills should not be passed until the government fully complies with an order for production of documents. The only connection—if there is any at all—between these bills and the substance of this motion is to be seen in items (f) and (g). Item (f) says: </para><quote><para>(f) it has been revealed that documents related to the order concern, among other matters, a meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Dick Honan, chairman of Manildra, on 1 August 2002 ... </para></quote><para>So what? What has that seriously got to do with the fact that the bill will give effect to a tariff proposal tabled in September last year? Item (g) says:</para><para>(g) passage of the bill now would be ill-advised in the absence of full information about the government's consideration of ethanol policy.”</para><para>Once again, what we have to bear in mind is that the bills validate the excise and customs duty which has been collected since 18 September last year. There are serious consequences to be had for the revenue and for the taxpayer, at least potentially, if these bills are very unfairly and unnecessarily held up on the most flimsy of grounds, where it is quite obvious that this is nothing but a political stunt. </para><para>It is the kind of stunt that really underpins the attacks on this very fine institution—that is, the Senate. The Australian people expect better of us, I believe, than that we would seek to make cheap political stunts out of a revenue bill—something that not only benefits the industry, because that is very important, and a coherent regime for the development of alternative fuels, which has very clear support out there in the electorate, but also actually raises revenue and affects the broader community. If we as the Senate wish to maintain our position—as I think we do most of the time—in refining legislation and properly inquiring into the intent of bills, this is not really a very creditable way to go ahead. It is not something that is likely, in the circumstances, to receive support when you look at the fact that there is absolutely no reason given for it—apart from the fact that there might be some connection and some political advantage in doing this. It is not something that I would have thought Senator Allison would really want to support. I am not taking issue with what Senator Allison refers to as some concern she has with returns to order at this point. I think that that may well be a legitimate concern, but there surely is a better avenue to raise it than through this legislation. For the purposes of summing up the second reading debate, I would ask them to reconsider. I commend these bills to the Senate.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

It is significant that on 25 June in this place the Australian Labor Party moved to condemn the government for further reducing workplace democracy by removing the right of employees to vote on whether a certified agreement should not apply following a transmission of business, and further increasing job insecurity by enabling the termination of certified agreements without employee consent, in corporate restructuring and contracting out. It is significant because in April 2002 the then shadow spokesman on workplace relations suggested the solution to the problem of arrangements following a change of ownership of a business would be for the incoming employer to negotiate a new agreement for their new business operation. In the absence of the member for Barton from the Labor shadow portfolio relating to workplace relations, the ALP has obviously not pursued this idea. </para></talk.start><para>The variation and termination provisions of certified agreements remain impractical for transmission of business purposes. The Labor Party knows this. The Labor Party must also know that, by continuing to stand in the way of reasonable progress towards the sort of workplace Australians demand and deserve in the 21st century, it is risking entrenchment of its irrelevance. That is a policy option that is open to the party leadership. It is a stupid policy option, of course, but then we live in a democracy and if the Labor Party and its leadership really want to be stupid the right exists for them to be so. For the benefit of the Labor Party, it apparently must be restated that the purpose of the bill is to deliver greater certainty for both employers and employees—and I underline `and employees'—in the context of a transmission of business. It will introduce provisions similar to those that already exist in relation to awards for certified agreements. The bill accepts that the principal responsibility for negotiating the terms of certified agreements rests with the parties but also recognises that there is a role for the commission in assisting the parties to address problems and anomalies that are beyond their immediate reach.</para><para>In other words, it is a facilitative measure. It is aimed at resolving difficulties that really should not be permitted to impinge on the legitimate business plans of a new owner of a business. The legislation gives employers the chance to argue that terms of agreement which they did not negotiate do not suit their business needs. This mirrors the position in respect of awards. It is a sensible proposition that recognises—as apparently the Labor Party refuses to recognise—that from time to time the world does move on.</para><para>There is an important point to understand here. It is that business prospers by creating the best possible conditions for profit. It is wholly unsurprising that a new owner of an existing business would have a different approach to that business from that practised by the previous operator. I am sure that business's employees would understand that and understand too that declarations of democracy—a great and indeed inviolable principle in how communities govern themselves— have a rather more limited application in business. That does not restrict their rights in law or under legislation. That is where the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, comes into play.</para><para>Labor seems to believe that business acquisitions should be pursued on the basis that existing arrangements within that business should not be altered. Perhaps it is that the ALP would like its union friends to think that that is what it believes. It can hardly be reflective of its actual belief, unless of course the sad situation is that the ALP is even further removed from reality than I had originally thought.</para><para>To go back to the basics of the bill before us, I return to the fact that when a transmission of business occurs the new operator of the business is bound by the awards and agreements that bound the former operator. Under section 149 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the commission has the power to order that the new operator is not bound by an award that bound the former operator. There is no similar provision that applies in relation to certified agreements. That is an inconsistency. That much at least should be clear to those opposite. It is also unfair, certainly to new operators of businesses who desire to make the profits from that business upon which their business plan is predicated. I suggest it is also unfair to the wider work force, which will profit in the long term from businesses that are able to maximise their returns. It is important to ensure that business returns are not adversely impacted by the sort of last century ideas we still see coming from the Labor Party on the question of workplace relations.</para><para>In essence, as I noted before, this bill is facilitative. It allows the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to assist parties in addressing anomalies and unintended consequences that may arise in the transmission of business processes. These difficulties frequently take the form of businesses finding themselves subject to multiple or contradictory certified agreements. So let us be quite clear about this, especially for the benefit of those opposite. The bill proposes to give the commission power to adjudicate—in other words, to assist. It is the umpire. That is its role, and it is a role that the government not only accepts without question but also actively fosters.</para><para>Nothing in the bill suggests that employees are to be abandoned on change of ownership of the business in which they work. Only the Labor Party has an interest in promoting that particular misreading of the government's workplace relations policy. Private sector employees have very largely abandoned the union framework that dominated the last century and that in its early days did a lot of good, as history shows. But again the world has moved on. Organised labour, in the sense of its being unionised, is now a minority approach to workplace relations in the private sector.</para><para>The task that confronts Australia—and it is a task that this government is addressing with vigour in a very public minded manner—is to create workplace conditions in which everyone can work as they are able and from which the maximum profit can be derived. This may be a slightly arcane way of expressing the point, but those opposite would do well to remember that what finally did it for the Roman Empire was its total inability to innovate and to move with the times. Its industrial technology and practices remained basically unaltered and its manufacturing output barely increased throughout its thousand-year history. Such atrophy is finally fatal to any society.  </para><para>In relation to this bill, the government rejects any suggestion that the current proposals are unfair. The commission's power to make orders in relation to certified agreements and transmitted business can only be exercised on a case-by-case basis and on the application of one of the affected parties. The government has deliberately not sought to confine the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's discretion in dealing with these matters in order to maximise its flexibility in devising solutions to what are often difficult and complex issues. </para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>13301</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Report</title><page.no>13301</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13301</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

I know it was the practice of the Labor Party to attack Max Moore-Wilton, when he was head of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and we assumed that was because he had not immediately come from within the public sector, even though he had given considerable service to the public sector in the past. But we thought that at least after Dr Shergold came in, and there was wider applause that somebody from within the public sector was being promoted to that job, the most senior job in the public sector, he would at least be respected and supported by the Australian Labor Party. That, of course, turns out to be too much to expect.

It is important to note that the Australian economy continues to show its resilience against a difficult international environment. The Reserve Bank statement released yesterday began by stating:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The year to date has been marked by a contrast between a disappointing global environment and a resilient domestic economy.</para></quote><para>The statement goes on to say that Australia is still on target for a growth of around three per cent in 2003, while the latest forecast for GDP growth in the G7 countries is 1½ per cent. I would have thought even Senator Cook would agree that that is a very good record. This is backed up by forecasters surveyed by the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine who expect Australia to be the fastest-growing industrial economy in 2003, with double the growth rates of the G7 countries. This is an outstanding result. Despite a weak global economy and despite the most crippling drought Australia has ever seen, the Australian economy continues to show its resilience. This is because, unlike the ALP, we are committed to responsible economic management. Unlike the ALP, we are committed to delivering surplus budgets and reducing the appalling debt that we inherited.</para><para>Unlike the ALP, we are committed to giving back to Australia the benefits of our hard work. These benefits were only a dream under the irresponsible and reckless ALP government and include benefits like: historically low interest rates, which will allow the Australian family to save $1,300 a month more than they did under the ALP when they suffered under crippling interest rates of 17 per cent; record low unemployment rates and the creation of 1.1 million jobs since the Howard government came to office, meaning that businesses are prepared to invest in the future of more and more Australians; personal income tax cuts worth $15 billion, giving millions of Australians more disposable income; and five budget surpluses, allowing us to spend money where it is needed and not waste it on unnecessary interest payments on accumulated debt. All these benefits are because of this government's responsible approach to managing the Australian economy. </para><para>What is the Labor Party's alternative, after seven years in opposition? The Labor Party's alternative, unfortunately, is again to whip out the government credit card. When there is a problem in education, you answer it by spending more. When there is a problem in health, the only answer for Labor is to spend more. How would this be paid for? Obviously, through the old recipe of increasing taxes and borrowing back. That would be back into the old way, which led to high interest rates, high unemployment, high inflation and crushing interest repayments.

On the face of it, that is a perfectly proper and understandable approach being adopted. It is not done at the behest of the minister; it is an initiative undertaken by the department because, in their own judgment, they thought it was necessary.

In relation to Senator Carr's suggestion that there is an adverse impact on higher education access by socioeconomically disadvantaged students, the fact is that—as I have already said—there are a number of methodological concerns about the research, including about the inclusiveness or relatively small impact of some of the findings. The government considers that the level of student contribution that will be asked for under the reforms is fair and reasonable. The government's reform agenda for HECS and student tuition loans through the new higher education loans program is designed to make the system more responsive to student choice and community need while enabling universities to respond more effectively to the labour market.

But I will conclude by saying that from 2005 some universities may decide to increase their tuition fees within the more flexible limits set by the government. It will be up to students to decide which institutions they want to study at.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I should also add this: the assertion that males from poor backgrounds were particularly hard hit by fee increases should be interpreted with caution. The observed effect relates to around 100 students. This observed decline may have been due to a number of factors. For example, the tighter coding requirements for universities that inevitably flow from the introduction of differential HECS may have affected the data used. Further, it is difficult to determine the impact of student preferences and the changes in HECS requirements for New Zealand citizens where they were no longer able to defer their HECS contribution. The department also has reservations about the definition of `low socioeconomic status'. This definition is based on postcode. This may be effective for use with large populations but may be subject to significant variation when small population effects are being analysed. The lesson really is: you have to do your homework, you have to be precise and you have to get it right. The broad brush approach simply does not work, and it will keep you where you are for a long time to come.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13304</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Is that now your view? Was it your view then? Has it always been your view, or is that simply the left-wing Victorian Albanian objective? It might be a factional philosophy, but it certainly was not the view of the Labor government—and it seems to have developed in recent times. I have had a good look at some of Senator Carr's musings over recent years, and I do not recall his ever raising this point, and he certainly did not when Labor were in government. All you can conclude is that what they say in opposition should not be taken as anything to indicate what they might do in government. I think Mr Beazley said that during the last election.

Acting Police Commissioner Ben McDevitt was sworn in as Deputy Police Commissioner of the Royal Solomon Islands Police and yesterday was made Acting Police Commissioner for a month while the commissioner is away on leave. That demonstrates the great cooperation and trust that exists between the Solomon Islands and the Australian Federal Police.</para></talk.start><para>A weapons amnesty has been announced for the community as well as a direction to the Royal Solomon Islands Police to surrender all weaponry previously taken or removed from the police armoury. I am pleased to report that, as of Sunday night, a total of 962 weapons had been surrendered. Of these, 793 were military style weapons and 47 were Royal Solomon Islands Police weapons. The amnesty will conclude on 21 August this year and after that date any person found in possession of a firearm will be prosecuted. </para><para>Planning is well advanced to commence investigations into significant and outstanding crimes. Police outposts have been established at Avu Avu on the Weathercoast and at Auki, on Malaita. Both have received favourable support from the communities there. We are also setting about establishing new discipline and professional standards for the local police. On 8 August this year, special coordinator Nick Warner and Acting Police Commissioner Ben McDevitt met with Weathercoast militant Harold Keke. Discussions are ongoing in relation to matters dealing with him, and the government regards these as serious matters that need to be resolved.</para><para>By early September we anticipate that the participating police force will amount to some 300 personnel. This will enable those people in the islands to carry out the mission we have given them. We look forward to a successful resolution of this mission and a return of all safely home. What we are doing firstly, though, is to install law and order and to make sure that the president, ministers and key facilities are protected. Of course, we have a longer term objective, and that is to enhance infrastructure in the Solomon Islands and to provide professional development and training to the Royal Solomon Islands Police. That will take more time and we realise that this involvement by the Australian Federal Police will not be a short one. It is not without its dangers, and we realise that, but the Australian Federal Police, Australian military personnel and the Australian Protective Service are doing a great job not only for the security of the Pacific region but also for the security of Australia. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Report</title><page.no>13306</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13306</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Alston, representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

Once again, one cannot simply conjure up what might have been provided by Senator Forshaw by way of information about who did what back in 2001. What I can say, from the letter from the secretary, is that, in November 2002 or thereabouts, the department took the decision to remove material regarding HECS that had recently become the subject of media reporting. The decision was made because of the department's concerns in relation to the methodological difficulties inherent in analysis of this kind and the incompleteness and inconclusiveness of some of the findings, which meant that it did not have a valid place in the report. If you do not agree with that logic then I would be very interested to hear your contrary approach. In other words, if you accept that there were methodological difficulties which did not convey a true and accurate picture then I would not have thought that you would be suggesting that they should have been left in the report.

The consequential amendments to the Charities Bill have not been released, but of course they do deal with a number of technical matters—the technical interaction of the exposure draft and the current law—so there is no substantive policy contained in the consequential bill, as you would appreciate. Senator Cherry's question is premised on a completely false statement; namely, that this government has cold-shouldered charities. That is an extraordinary notion when what has in fact been released is an exposure draft of the Charities Bill 2003. The exposure draft is in the public domain for the very purpose of public consultation—for the board to conduct consultations—and it is certainly not in any way a rebuff to charities.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, we announced the policy in August 2002, which is 11 months ago, and draft legislation has been released recently. The draft provides—as, indeed, is the current situation—that a charity must be not-for-profit, have a dominant purpose or purposes that are charitable and be for the public benefit. The definition follows the definition that has been in operation, in effect, for more than 400 years of common-law precedent. The draft legislation only widens the definition of `charity' to include not-for-profit child care available to the public, self-help bodies that have open and non-discriminatory membership, and closed or contemplative religious orders that offer prayerful intervention for the public.</para><para>I hope that there will be some people offering prayerful intervention for the Democrats, because nothing could be further from the truth but that this government not only understands the needs of charities but also has, in the move to the new tax system, specifically adjusted the tax law so that charities can effectively operate. In fact, the definitions that are now in the exposure draft simply take up what has always been the case. So recent criticism—I think Senator Cherry made some criticisms of the exposure draft—really has no foundation when you look at the draft and the words. The most important point of all is that this is, as it says, an exposure draft.

These have focused on examining the best way forward to meet the spirit of Senator Harradine's amendments and the need to define the exact nature of any regulatory changes, to ensure that Australia does not miss out on breakthrough products that hold the potential for significant medical and treatment advances because of requirements that prove impractical for the pharmaceutical industry to meet. Given that Australia represents only one per cent of the world pharmaceutical market, it is important that any regulation change supported by the government does not put at risk any access to such breakthroughs. However, where information is available, the government would consider changes that would be helpful to consumers and health professionals in making informed choices about the clinical options that are available.</para><para>There has been considerable agreement that the pharmaceutical companies should be able to provide advice as to what materials have been involved in the manufacture of medicines. However, the provision of advice for materials that might have been used in the testing and creation of these products is much more difficult to determine. Pharmaceutical products can take more than 20 years to find their way to market and their final marketing indications may be quite different to those envisaged at the time of their development. Careful consideration needs to be given to where the pharmaceutical companies would have easy access to records which would enable them to give undertakings in regard to materials that may have been used at any point in the testing of such products. That is the issue that we are finding the most difficult to deal with. When the regulatory options have been fully explored, a final report will be tabled in the Senate.

I also indicated yesterday that we already have in train a review of the recognised list of disabilities, and that will of course go ahead. However, we have decided, on the basis of material provided by the review of the 70,000 or so cases that have been saved and have not been looked at for five years, that there are some disabilities that we can, should and will add to the list of recognised disabilities. We will be adding Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, uncontrolled epilepsy, moderate haemophilia, phenylketonuria and fragile X to the list of recognised disabilities. Of course, there are other disabilities that might not be specifically mentioned as disabilities in themselves, but if those people who have a close interest in this area go to the list of recognised disabilities they will see that there is a number of opportunities for people who are so affected to be considered as having a recognised disability because of severe physical or neurological disability as a consequence of that condition. </para></talk.start><para>With over 40 per cent of the cases that were saved since 1998 now reviewed, a high proportion of children with those disabilities are passing the test and being reinstated. As I indicated yesterday, my advice is that no carer of a child with Down syndrome had, under the review, lost their payment as a consequence of the medical condition. Some may have because the child is no longer in care or for some other reason, but not in relation to the medical condition. We will also be ensuring that in the list of recognised disabilities not only are the recognised disabilities themselves looked at—and the intention is that this review will be completed by Christmas—but also the formal definitions are looked at and, in particular, I am thinking of the formal definitions of visual impairment or severe or multiple disabilities.</para><para>I raised an example yesterday of a form where a doctor did not tick a box for bilateral blindness.

Senator Jacinta Collins would not know this, but one of the problems is that somebody may be taking, for example, Alka-Seltzer with their medications not knowing that Alka-Seltzer has over 300 milligrams of aspirin in each tablet.

It needs the parliamentarians— and I wish you would behave as parliamentarians occasionally when there is an issue like the PBS—to take fiscally responsible decisions to make sure that there is at least a reasonable contribution from the person who actually takes the medication.

Part of the program we are running out is to give doctors information other than the information they get from pharmaceutical companies.

We have given information on medicines to consumers, and we have set up the Home Medicines Review program and residential medication management reviews. We have facilitated the use of a generic medicines program and put restrictions on prescription shopping and, through the National Prescribing Service, we run programs like `Common colds need commonsense' to reduce the use of antibiotics.

It was a very big deal.

In March 2002 two briefs were prepared for the minister: an alert brief and a longer brief. The then head of the department, Dr Peter Shergold, saw the report and he was not happy. He insisted that chapters 4 and 7 of the report be heavily edited. Line responsibility for this surgery was given to the current head of the higher education group, Mr Bill Burmester. Key sections of this report which challenged the oft repeated view that the Howard government's 1996 HECS changes had no equity impact were cut. The work showed that the HECS changes had discouraged students from lower socioeconomic groups and led to a sharp decline in the numbers studying high-cost subjects such as medicine, law and dentistry. The new research challenged the established wisdom on these issues. It shone a spotlight on the government's policy, and it did not look very good at all. It turned out that ability was not all you needed under a Howard government to get into university. It showed that a credit card was also required.</para><para>The data should have formed a critical part of the debate in the run-up to the government's Crossroads review. The public should have known that this research was available. The public could have decided whether or not it was a reasonable proposition. The public were denied the facts on these matters. The cover-up in fact was completely inept because at the end of the year we saw that the national report had not been doctored and only after I asked some questions in this chamber on 19 March this year was it demonstrated that key consultancy reports had not been reported in the annual report last year and that the report itself had been suppressed. Of course that led to the train of events where the doctored version of the report was finally issued on 23 July this year.</para><para>The question lies with the minister. I call on him to come clean about the processes and his office's direct involvement in the censoring of this report. It defies belief that the minister's office was not made aware of the complete report 15 months ago. It is of course like the `children overboard' scandal where the minister seeks to claim that there are firewalls operating. Because it goes to the minister's office and to the minister's advisers, he turns around and says, `It has not come to me personally.' The department have shown us in the Senate estimates that they direct their communications to the minister. It is totally inappropriate for the minister now to turn around and say, `I personally did not know anything about it; it was only my advisers.'

The purpose of the report—again, which Senator Carr was not very interested in—was to provide the department's retrospective view on policy and on other developments in the sector between 1992 and 2001. That covers the period from the introduction of the HECS scheme by the Labor government at that time, who deemed it necessary for students to make some contribution to their higher education. I had three daughters involved in the scheme until the late 1990s, and one still has not finished paying back the HECS contribution. She considers it to be a fair way of receiving an education and that she should have the opportunity to pay for it at some later stage.</para><para>The higher education adviser saw several drafts of the report and then suggested some minor improvements.

The material that had required minor improvements related to the impact of HECS, and it was edited out of this draft and subsequent drafts by the department. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the minister. If Senator Carr had cared to listen to the answer that Minister Alston gave, he would have noted that the secretary of the department had advised the minister that the department had edited material out of the report in November last year before it was provided to the minister's education adviser for comments because—and this is the part that is important—of the department's concern in relation to the methodological difficulties inherent in analysis of this kind and the incompleteness and inconclusiveness of some of the findings, which meant that it did not have a valid place in the report.</para><para>That answer was given specifically by the minister to Senator Carr's question and to other questions by senators on that side, yet Senator Carr chose to ignore completely the response that was provided by the minister and go off on a tangent of his own—on his own little frolic, putting his own propaganda forward and putting his own slant on everything that occurred in the department—to suit his own political purpose. It would do Senator Carr and the Labor Party much more good to come up with some draft policy of their own—some draft policy that they might put to the Australian public—because they have not, and it seems they cannot decide on what their policy should be.

If you want to talk about obfuscation, shouting and abuse, you have the perfect example of that again from Senator Alston in his response to the question that I asked. He did not deal at all with the question. He went off on a frolic of his own, because quite clearly (1) he knew that he did not know the answer and (2) he also suspected that the answer that he might get from the department or from the minister would prove the point of the question. Senator Carr has outlined quite clearly in his remarks that there has been interference, there has been cover-up and there has clearly been further politicisation, in this case of the Department of Education, Science and Training.  </para></talk.start><para>Politicisation of the Public Service has become rampant under this government. We have seen plenty of examples of where the Public Service has been prevented, either deliberately or by other means, from providing impartial and factual advice to this government. We saw it in the evidence that came out in the `children overboard' inquiry. We have seen it more recently in respect of the issue of the weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's capacity to produce nuclear weapons. It is now acknowledged that the Office of National Assessments had information that the claims that were about to be made by the Prime Minister about Iraq were false. They had that information before the Prime Minister made his speech, but he nevertheless went ahead and misled the parliament and the people with regard to that matter.</para><para>Let us come back to the issues that were specifically raised in questions by Senator Carr, Senator Faulkner and me with respect to this cover-up in the higher education area. It is quite clear that the Minister for Education, Science and Training had the draft report provided to his office. But the secretary of the department claimed that that had not occurred. Evidence was given at the Senate estimates hearing on 5 June this year that the final draft version of the report was sent to the minister in the first quarter of the year. Yet what does the secretary of the department say in a letter to his minister? That it was not provided before 21 July this year. You just cannot reconcile those two claims. Clearly, given all the other evidence, the people who are to be believed are the departmental officers who gave evidence to the Senate estimates committee.</para><para>Dr Shergold is the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. At the time of this situation, when he clearly interfered in the drafting of that report to ensure that certain elements and information compiled by the department would not see the light of day, he was the Secretary to the Department of Education, Science and Training. It is interesting to note Dr Shergold's response to claims that there has been politicisation. He had the temerity to say, `It's absolute balderdash and poppycock.' Everybody in the country knows that the Public Service is being politicised more and more and that decent public servants are being prevented from doing their job of providing impartial advice because of the actions of ministers and ministerial advisers. Dr Shergold also said this, when commenting about the ONA:</para><quote><para>Intelligence, I've discovered in my time in this department is a remarkably difficult area ...</para></quote><para>I think Dr Shergold is speaking about himself there, because he clearly cannot understand the right and proper role of the Public Service in providing advice—</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13320</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The case which has been put to the Senate today by those opposite for the politicisation of the Public Service seems to me to rest on extremely tenuous grounds. The circumstances of this particular report being made available to the office of the Minister for Education, Science and Training prior to it being published have been taken up by the Secretary to the Department of Education, Science and Training. It is evident from what those opposite have said that they do not believe that secretary. They do not believe what the head of the department of education told his minister and said on the public record. They obviously do not believe his predecessor Dr Shergold either in respect of the things he has had to say about this matter.  </para></talk.start><para>We are seeing a systematic attempt by those opposite, both in this chamber and in the other chamber, to tar public servants who work at senior levels with the claim that they have been politicised by virtue of their association with this government. That is what is taking place. The politicisation which is occurring is a matter of opposition members choosing to taint those who work for this government with the brush of being politically associated with the objectives of the government. The fact is that the Public Service, in serving all levels of the government federally, does its job well, effectively and apolitically. The evidence to the contrary which we have heard here today is weak in the extreme. </para><para>We have been told that there has been interference. We have been told that there has been a cover-up. Where precisely is the evidence of a cover-up? A report has been made available to the minister's office. The report, according to the minister and the secretary of the minister's department, was made available in November 2002. Material relating to the effect of the HECS scheme on demand for higher education places was certainly removed from that report at some point prior to the report being made available to the minister. That seems to be agreed. But where is the evidence that the minister, the minister's adviser or somebody on the minister's behalf, got on the phone to the department and said, `Take that stuff out'? Where is the evidence of that? There is not any. </para><para>The evidence that we have been given today is Senator Carr saying, `It defies belief that the minister's office was not made aware' of that doctoring. Senator Forshaw told us that everyone `knows that the Public Service is being politicised'. With great respect, before we drag the reputations of senior public servants through this place, it behoves us to produce some solid evidence that they have behaved inappropriately. I have met Dr Harmer and I think he is a man of integrity. I have met Dr Shergold and I have the same view of his character. And I note that Dr Shergold and Mr Max Moore-Wilton before him have received the same withering treatment from those opposite, which is to say that if they work at such a level for a Liberal government they must necessarily be Liberal sympathisers and therefore incapable of serving a government of the other persuasion. That is the message I get, and I think that that is most unfortunate. What we are seeing in this exercise is Dr Shergold getting the Max Moore-Wilton treatment, and that is undeserved. </para><para>The fact is that the reports which have been considered so damning have now been made available by the minister. The minister was happy to put those on the table in the light of this controversy to demonstrate that the government has nothing to hide about those documents. But he has pointed out that there were real methodological questions about their validity. There were real questions about how much value could be placed on some of those reports into the workings of Australia's higher education system. Fair enough. That was the view—according to the secretary of the department—of the department of education. It was their decision. I ask again: where is the evidence that it was not their decision? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>13321</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend Senator Humphries for at least addressing the substantive nature of this debate, on speaking on the same matter. He asks, `Where is the evidence?' Let us address that issue. But firstly, I would like to say that this is not a tenuous personal attack on Dr Shergold. I doubt that Dr Shergold, for instance, would accuse me of withering treatment in relation to his position. What this argument is about is a further demonstration of yet another example of the integrity problems at the core of the Howard government. It is difficult these days to remember that phrase `honest John Howard'. This is another one of those examples. This is a case of the government, it is alleged—and we are having great difficulties getting the information to prove otherwise—excising important information from critical reports: on this occasion, higher education; on past occasions, hepatitis. This is akin to that problem that has been named `plausible deniability'. It is one of the critical credibility problems for this government. I am, because of past history, quite critical of the letter that has been tabled from Dr Harmer. Why am I critical? Because if you read the second paragraph on the second page, it does not say that the material had been taken out of the draft provided to the minister's office; it simply says the decision to remove all material had been made. I would like to know when that material was removed.</para></talk.start><para>The other difficulty is that we have reports that this report did go to the minister's office as early as April, not November as reported in this letter. Now that was at a point when Dr Harmer was not secretary of the department. The question here is: when Dr Shergold was secretary, was that material passed over? It was not to the knowledge of Dr Harmer. We are not accusing Dr Harmer—or certainly I am not, from what I am aware of to date—of providing inaccurate information. The question is: is he providing incomplete information and why will Dr Shergold not respond directly to the reports that have been made? He has had four days to deny what has been reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>: that it was he, Dr Shergold, who directly sought to have this material excised, and that it was to be excised because it was inconvenient to the government. Now, this is the Dr Shergold who, despite his claims of non-politicisation or of being nonpartisan as a public servant, also says some other very interesting things.</para><para>Senator Carr will recall, as I do, when he rolled up to estimates with a trolley load of material, with the press gallery already briefed about how much money it was going to cost the Commonwealth in answering Senate estimates questions—one of the most partisan pieces of behaviour I have ever seen in estimates, but of course this report was not on the trolley, was it? Of course not! I also remember when Dr Shergold politicised DEWRSB by seeking to impose Australian workplace agreements throughout that department. At the same time he is politicising these departments, he goes to the Prime Minister's office and claims that he is nonpartisan. Let us quote Dr Shergold, because he said, for instance, in a recent speech he gave:</para><quote><para>In truth, I not infrequently fail to live up to the rhetoric I espouse.</para></quote><para>And this is another example of failure to live up to his own rhetoric. His rhetoric, though, was that:</para><quote><para>Our advice should seek not only to have honesty and integrity, but to be imaginative and innovative. Creativity is critical.</para></quote><para>I wonder if that creativity is what guided Ross Hampton in what he did in the children overboard affair, when he created an impression that things occurred at night, to avoid critical evidence that was going to damage the government, or is it that attitude of creativity that guided, on this occasion, Dr Nelson's adviser Ross Hampton—previously with Minister Reith—to deny that the minister had tampered with the report? He said: </para><quote><para>There's been no dialogue, correspondence or any form of discussion between the minister or anyone in his office about the report ...</para></quote><para>We now know from Dr Harmer that Ross Hampton is misleading us again.

The first bill was, of course, tabled by the Treasurer on 22 July and has caused serious concern in the charitable sector because of the definitions which appear to limit the concessions available to charities to only those charities which are not seeking to change government policy. Of course the Treasurer, at the time, said the definition in that bill purely reflected the common law. In actual fact, the common law in this area that he was relying on is something like 20 years old, and the definition which the government is proposing is a very narrow view. In fact it was expressly rejected in the most recent common law case to deal with the definition of charities, in October last year, in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, concerning the ACF.</para><para>In her answer the minister said that the consequential amendments bill only contained technical matters and that there was no substantial policy difference. We were told that the charities definition in the bill only contained a codification of current law. But, on examination of the exposure draft, this is not the case. So I call on the government quite clearly to release the consequential amendments bill to ensure that the charity sector can look at it. I also call on the government, quite emphatically, to release its response to the rest of the Charities Definition Inquiry report. There is some good stuff in the Charities Bill that the government released in July. It included a wider definition of charity than that contained in the current common law, and I think the government deserves credit for that. It recognises that the definition of charities should be extended to self-help groups, and it includes a much wider definition of advancement in terms of the purposes of charities.</para><para>There is some very good stuff in this bill, and the bill would be a very good one if the issue of disqualifying purposes for criticising government could be fixed—there would be a very significant advance in the laws covering charities. The problem is that most of the tax concessions associated with charities are only associated with a very narrow category of charities called `public benevolent institutions', which was a result of the response of the Bruce-Page government in 1927 to a Privy Council decision. That particular definition has been found to be more and more narrow by the various courts. In fact, the key decision that defined a public benevolent institution goes back to 1931. The Australian Taxation Office, based on that decision—the Perpetual Trustees case—describes a public benevolent institution as a `non-profit institution organised for the direct relief of such poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, disability, destitution and helplessness as arouses compassion in the community'. </para><para>Every single one of those words in that tax office ruling creates legal problems. There has been a flurry of cases trying to tease out what they mean, and the cases conflict with each other. What they keep coming back to, as evidenced in the RSPCA case—which found that the RSPCA could not be a public benevolent institution—is that the `present approach derives from decisions of the High Court of Australia and that it should be left to that court to formulate a new test if one is to be adopted'. In other words, the common law has atrophied in the area of the most important issue for charities, which is access to PBI status. That is why the Charities Definition Inquiry said that we need to get rid of this definition. We need to update it, improve it, make it more comprehensive, make it more modern and make it more readable.</para><para>At the end of the committee's report is recommendation 21, an important recommendation, which is that the category of public benevolent institutions be replaced by a subset of charities to be known as benevolent charities—that is, a charity whose dominant purpose is to benefit directly or indirectly those whose disadvantage prevents them from meeting their needs. That recommendation was made over two years ago. The government is yet to respond to it. The government has responded to the rest of the Charities Definition Inquiry report but not to its key recommendation. On that recommendation rests access to the most important concessions that charitable institutions can get in this country. On that recommendation rests the fundamental issue of updating law that is over 80 years old so that we can ensure that our tax system does whatever it can to alleviate distress, wherever it is in our sector. That is why the Democrats call on the government to respond in full to that report, which has now been on the table for two years. We call on the government to release its consequential amendments report to ensure a fairer deal for charities.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Pharmaceuticals and Drugs</title><page.no>13323</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>13323</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I asked a question in what I thought was a very mild manner, seeking information from the Minister for Health and Ageing as to what progress had been made by the government in putting the requirement on drug companies to declare whether a drug has been created, tested or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the minister's reply told me that nothing has been done since June.

The current procedure is that all drugs licensed by TGA must have an “Investigational Brochure”. This brochure contains all information relevant to the development, testing and manufacture of the drug. Such information would include the preclinical efficacy testing, which might very well involve the response of different cell lines to the drug or to related products of the drug. It would involve information relevant to the pre-clinical toxicology (in other words whether the medication demonstrated any harmful effects to animals or cell lines) and it would of course involve pre-clinical efficacy in sub-human species (typically mice and non-rodent species) and data on safety and efficacy in human studies. The TGA must hold a copy of the brochure for each and every drug that is licensed and In doing so it adheres to the International Convention for Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. </para><para>My understanding is that the TGA could expect to collect information relevant to the use of human embryonic stem cells involved in the development of new drugs without a great degree of difficulty.

Colonel John Frewen, from the ADF's second battalion, is leading a military component of some 1,800 personnel who are providing valuable support to the police. </para><para>The Australian contribution comprises approximately 1,500 defence personnel, 155 Federal police and 80 members of the Australian Protective Services as well as a small number of officials drawn from relevant government departments, including the Treasury, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance and Administration. </para><para>Mr Speaker, I want, on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, to record our respect and admiration for those currently serving with the mission in the Solomon Islands. I wish to assure them that they carry the very strong support and the good wishes of the Australian community. </para><para>Our military and policing forces are held in high esteem internationally for their courage and for their professionalism—our nation is rightly proud of them. We have absolute confidence that they will behave with the appropriate restraint and proper respect for the attitudes and culture of the people of the Solomon Islands.</para><para>But we are also mindful that any mission involves an element of danger. We take comfort from the knowledge that they are superbly trained, well led and have been welcomed by the people of the Solomons. Our thoughts will be with them until they return, safe and sound.</para><para>I wish also to thank the families of those deployed. We know that the greatest burden of anxiety and loneliness is carried by those who wait at home. We will endeavour to provide them with support and encouragement while their loved ones are away.</para><para>As I have said, the mission is essentially a police operation. The bulk of the military personnel are providing them with important logistical support. There is an active force protection element. I do not expect that the combat element will need to remain in the Solomon Islands very long, although it is too early to put a precise timeframe on their departure.</para><para>The government hopes that there will be no need to resort to the use of force. But we need to be confident that our police contingent is adequately protected and that our military personnel could protect themselves and innocent civilians should it be necessary to do so. Recognising this, the parliament of the Solomon Islands has passed legislation to allow members of the assistance mission to use such force as is necessary to protect themselves, protect other persons or property, and to achieve the purposes of the mission.</para><para>Our immediate goal is to stop the violence so that the people of the Solomons can rebuild their lives and their institutions. The message is clear and I believe it has been heard—the time for guns is over. The people of the Solomons want the threat of illegal firearms permanently and unambiguously removed from their community.</para><para>Mr Speaker I am pleased to be able to report to the Senate that since 24 July around 1,000 weapons have been handed in to, or secured by, the assistance force. </para><para>The Foreign Minister, with his New Zealand counterpart, the Hon Phil Goff, visited the Solomons at the end of July to gauge the progress of the assistance operation and discuss the next stages with Solomon Islands leaders. He has advised that the mission has got off to a very good start. Impressive progress has been made.</para><para>Ordinary people are feeling more confident about their future and that of their nation. But there are still some major challenges ahead.

Direct intervention, even by a friendly multilateral force, should always be a last resort.</para><para>Over the past years, we have made every effort to assist the people of the Solomons manage their own affairs. The descent into lawlessness over recent months finally became acute. The Solomon Islanders and ourselves both recognised that criminal gangs and corrupt individuals had taken control of their future. Their very existence as a community, as a nation, had been placed in peril.</para><para>In these circumstances we jointly concluded that intervention was not only appropriate, but necessary. Regardless of the means, the objective has remained consistent—to return control of their own affairs to the people of the Solomon Islands.</para><para>And it is indicative of the Pacific way, that so many countries have joined together to help the Solomons. The multi-national force is not only symbolic of that special spirit of cooperation but also a demonstration of what is achievable when there is unity of purpose. </para><para>We need to work with other nations to ensure collective stability and sometimes we will need to join or form coalitions that are able to respond to requests for direct assistance. Common goals, shared information, mutual support and collective approaches are the most practical ways of securing our region.

If it is required, help is at hand. </para><para>Australia, for one, has clearly expressed a willingness to help all the nations of the Pacific so that their people can experience the benefits which a properly functioning system of law and order provides—so that they too can enjoy peace and stability and be able to look to the future with confidence.</para><para>The government envisages that Australia's contribution to the Solomons assistance mission— Helpem Fren—will cost over $200 million this financial year. The final cost will, of course, depend on the length and nature of the operation. While we envisage that the military component will draw-down as soon as a secure environment is established, the Australian Federal Police, aid officials and economic advisers may be engaged for several years. This will be costly, but it is a cost which I believe Australians would wish our country to bear. It is also a burden which we will be looking to bear side-by-side with others in the international community.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Long-term commitment</inline><inline font-weight="bold">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">to the Region</inline></para><para>The situation in the Solomon Islands is unique but a number of our friends in the Pacific are experiencing economic decline, growing corruption and lawlessness. Development assistance has an important role to play in restoring stability to the Pacific. But we now understand that aid can only ever be a part of the solution. We must use our aid programme to encourage and strengthen good governance. The future stability and prosperity of the South Pacific depends on achieving higher standards of governance.</para><para>We want our neighbours to know that Australia is willing to help—to do our fair share, in a careful, deliberate, cooperative and neighbourly way. But they must also understand that this assistance cannot be a substitute for proper governance and careful stewardship of their own nations. </para><para>Mr Speaker, we have made it plain—nations who look for our assistance, who receive our financial aid, must understand support is now conditional on working to overcome corruption. Because unless corruption is rooted out and the institutions of good governance strengthened aid will make little difference.</para><para>The government recognises the special challenges confronting the island states of the Pacific. Through the framework of the Pacific Islands Forum we have begun to discuss innovative and creative ways to respond to these challenges. Increasingly, we are discussing the possibility of dealing with governance issues and institutional capacity building on a regional basis.</para><para>The Australian Government believes there may be some scope for pooling aspects of regional governance. Obviously this would have the greatest application where there are common needs, common interests and common benefits and where pooling can provide the necessary critical mass or economies of scale.</para><para>The Prime Minister is looking forward to exploring these possibilities during the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Auckland at the end of this week.</para><para>With this regional assistance mission to the Solomon Islands, Australia has signalled it is willing, in a cooperative and collegiate way, to play a supportive, stabilising, and, if it is required, more interventionist role in the region. We will not let our friends down. We are committed to working with our fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum to address the challenges of the region and to demonstrate what it means to be a good neighbour.</para><para>I would simply like to add to that by saying—and I think I may have said it yesterday—that I thought the deployment by the ADF and the police, but I speak particularly of the ADF, in its complexity, bearing in mind that it is an interagency operation and included a number of Pacific Islands states, was first-class. That it was achieved in such a short period of time with so few hiccups is of great credit to the ADF and, in particular, to the logistics side of the department. They deserve great credit for it. I guess we should not be surprised, because they seem to do it so often, but we should nevertheless make specific mention of it. </para><para>In addition, I wanted to say that this deployment is being made on the basis that it is in Australia's national interest. We cannot afford, in my view, to have states that fail on our doorstep. That can only lead to regional instability, with all sorts of potential consequences that are not in the Australian national interest. Furthermore, in this instance there was a strong case for a good neighbour assisting men and women in a neighbouring state who were subject to violence and intimidation. Thus, there is a strong humanitarian aspect to this deployment, which I think attracts wide support from the broader Australian community.</para><para>The last point I want to make is to that background. We should all understand that this is not an operation without risks. I think there is a view that, because it is an operation in peacetime to support law enforcement, there are not significant risks attached to it. However, I want to make the point that we have deployed Australian service men and women, police and protective services in the knowledge that there are risks involved in this operation. That they are prepared to be so deployed—and, in the case of the latter elements, they are all volunteers—is a great credit to them, and all Australians should appreciate their contribution to our national interest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>13330</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Labor Party is pleased also to give its strong, bipartisan support for the regional intervention force led by the Australian police, the Australian military and Public Service personnel. This action meets all the criteria Labor believes are necessary for the effective and legitimate commitment of Australians to a peacekeeping effort in the Solomon Islands: it has unanimous regional support; it followed a formal request by the Solomon Islands government and the parliament; and it included an appropriate mix of police and military forces. Under difficult circumstances, the Solomon Islands government and parliament debated this proposal at length and came to an overwhelming majority in support of the intervention force. It reflected the genuine will of the Solomon Islands people. The process was right, so the outcome was successful. This was best summed up by New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark when she said, `It is a Pacific solution to a Pacific problem.'</para></talk.start><para>We simply cannot stand by and watch as lawlessness takes a stranglehold on a neighbouring country and terrorises its people. The process should be a model for future regional engagements. It is multilateral in composition and multifunctional in its delivery, covering the full range of social, economic and security concerns. Although future circumstances may differ, it is a model that works. It shows that Australia can be a good regional partner and a good international citizen—giving a helping hand to our Pacific friends, consulting with them and showing regional leadership. This action is being done squarely in the interests of the Solomon Islanders themselves. For the small island states of the Pacific, law and order is the necessary precondition for successful economic and social development. We all hope that as a result of this action the people of the Solomon Islands will be able to create the political and social stability that are the first steps towards restoring national development and economic growth. The people of the Solomon Islands, who stood by us during the Second World War, deserve our support. This is the very least we can do to repay that debt. </para><para>Since gaining independence in 1978, the Solomon Islanders have faced numerous political and economic challenges. Despite the efforts of some who have done their best to build a responsible and effective government in Honiara, the Solomon Islands have been inflicted with endemic corruption, resource exploitation and, as a result, economic stagnation. These pressures came to the surface in 1998 and 1999 in the form of ethnic disputes over land and jobs between the Malaitans and the Guadalcanalese. Violent clashes between the two groups resulted in many casualties on both sides, without any clear political resolution to the underlying problems of land ownership and lack of economic opportunity. Added to this volatile mix was the number of illegal guns circulating in the Solomon Islands, some of which had come across the border from the decade-long conflict in Bougainville.</para><para>Australia's response to this crisis was to broker the Townsville peace agreement in October 2000. Labor supported that initiative. It included an Australian led International Peace Monitoring Team to oversee the decommissioning of weapons and the restoration of law and order. Labor also supported the government's provision of additional aid assistance to the Solomon Islands to begin the process of rebuilding democratic institutions. Regrettably, the International Peace Monitoring Team was withdrawn early. Labor did not agree with foreign minister Downer's statement in June 2001 that the only worthwhile solutions to the problems in the Solomon Islands would be `home-grown'. While recognising the sensitivities over external intervention, the Labor Party argued that unless the law and order situation was addressed immediately there would no secure future for the people of the Solomon Islands. Labor also disagreed with the foreign minister's assessment that an intervention force in the Solomon Islands would not work. We are pleased to see that he has changed his policy.</para><para>In May last year, Labor argued that the growing problem of lawlessness in the Solomon Islands was of direct relevance to Australia's long-term foreign policy interests. Widespread lawlessness in the South Pacific had the potential to create an environment where drug running, people-smuggling, money laundering and other transnational crimes would flourish. For these reasons, Labor supported the government's decision in June to reconsider Prime Minister Kemakeza's request for external help in the form of an Australian led intervention force. The Prime Minister briefed the Leader of the Opposition, and this enabled Labor to give in-principle support to the initiative after consultation and discussions. The Solomon Islanders recognised that the state was failing to protect its people. Australians will not stand by and watch a neighbouring country and its people suffer in this way. Such a situation is untenable both for the people of the Solomon Islands and for neighbouring states. A failed state in our region is not in Australia's interests, nor in the interests of the Solomon Islands people or the region.</para><para>This mission is a clear demonstration of how collective security and multilateralism can work in practice. It has unanimous regional endorsement from 16 South Pacific Forum members. It was done at the formal invitation from the Solomon Islands government. The Australian Labor Party commends the speed and efficiency with which the Solomon Islands parliament was able to pass crucial legislation to allow this intervention to proceed. Labor would like to particularly acknowledge the constructive role played by Joses Tuhanuku, the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Solomon Islands. Joses provided much needed support for Prime Minister Kemakaze and was instrumental in the passage of the necessary legislation through parliament. This intervention has the overwhelming support of the people of the Solomon Islands, who want to return to peace and stability so that they can get on with their lives free from intimidation and corruption. </para><para>It is an appropriately sized force, with a balance of personnel between police and military. It is also fully consistent with the aims and objectives of the UN charter. Article 52 of the charter explicitly endorses and encourages regional arrangements for the maintenance of international peace. Labor welcome the fact that Kofi Annan has given this intervention his strong support, as the UN is still in our view an important and crucial force in international events. We also note that the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth has endorsed this action.</para><para>Like so many of the security challenges we face, not least the threat of terrorism, Australia will need to work closely and cooperatively with other regional countries. Regional security problems require a regional response. The Australian Labor Party would like to acknowledge the crucial role played by New Zealand in this endeavour. Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Phil Goff have been instrumental in getting broad based regional support for this initiative. The commitments made by many other Pacific Island states, including Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea, are a sign of genuine regional support for the Solomon Islands.</para><para>The principal aim of this intervention is to restore peace and stability in our region. As such it is fully consistent with Labor's strong foreign policy focus on the region. The action forms part of a consistent pattern of Australian intervention in regional conflicts, from Cambodia in the early 1990s to East Timor and Bougainville in the past few years. The action has met with some early success and so far is fulfilling its promise. The multinational force arrived in the Solomons only three weeks ago. Since then hundreds of weapons have been decommissioned and the Australian head of the intervention force, Nick Warner, has begun the process of identifying the needs of the Solomon Islanders and the tasks required to provide long-term security and stability. It seems there is a possibility that even the infamous Harold Keke will now submit himself to the police. However, the situation remains dangerous and the difficulty of the task ahead should not be underestimated. The amnesty for the return of weapons finishes at the end of this month. It is also possible that the intervention force will need to be in the Solomon Islands for some time to come. Of course, we all hope that the Australian personnel can be returned home as soon as possible.</para><para>Labor acknowledges the outstanding effort of the men and women involved in the intervention force from the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Protective Service and the Australian defence forces. Australian agencies have conducted themselves with the highest level of professionalism and dedication. Labor thanks and acknowledges the role of the AFP, the Australian Protective Service and the men and women of the various state police forces that have contributed their service to the previous peace monitoring team, and now the intervention force in the Solomon Islands. </para><para>Although a show of force from the military was considered necessary in this case, the real burden of disarming the rebels and restoring law and order in the Solomon Islands will fall on the shoulders of our police. Throughout numerous deployments in our region and around the world, our police forces have demonstrated a level of professionalism and dedication that is second to none. As the fight against terrorism in Indonesia after the Bali bombings has shown, it is the police on the ground doing the hard investigative work that will bring these criminals to justice. Labor supports the government in this initiative. We hope that law and order will return to the Solomons as quickly as possible and that our men and women can return home safely. The opposition strongly supports the motion before the chair. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>13333</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and supported by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, on behalf of my National Party colleagues.

I begin by supporting it on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We take this opportunity—as have others in the chamber—to extend our best wishes to the Australian defence, police and Protective Service personnel who are currently deployed in the Solomons. We join with others in this place to wish them a safe and successful campaign.</para></talk.start><para>As we have said many times before, the Democrats do believe strongly in supporting our defence forces and, of course, their families—particularly at times when troops are overseas. This applies when we support a government action as well as when we do not support a government decision to deploy troops to a particular region or for the purposes of a particular operation. In this case we do support the government's actions. We do not always agree with what this government defines as being in the national interest, but ultimately we recognise that respect must be paid to anyone who, by joining the defence forces, is willing to risk their life in the national interest.</para><para>In any defence operation involving Australian personnel, we recognise the sobering fact that those people could pay the ultimate price, whether by dying in conflict or by dying or being injured in an accident. Being overseas no doubt increases the concerns of their families and friends; plus, in short, they miss them. Our personnel receive deployment allowances not just because they face more danger or hardship than they would, say, in training—and, particularly, on their own shores—but because they are away from home. The Democrats add our voices to the hopes of all Australians that these defence personnel—particularly in the Solomons but also, of course, more generally— fulfil their primary mission and return safely. </para><para>We take this opportunity to express our qualified support for the government's decision to deploy the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. I say `qualified' because, while the Democrats do support the mission—certainly in principle—we still have a number of concerns and we have a number of outstanding questions when it comes to the finer details of this particular operation. There is no doubt that the people of the Solomons need help at this particular time. The Democrats are pleased to see that this assistance is being provided in a multilateral context on the express invitation of the Solomons. We believe that the passage of legislation by the Solomons parliament inviting external assistance was a crucial prerequisite to any Australian involvement.</para><para>The Solomon Islands is an amazing place with amazing people, and I pay tribute to them as well as to the Australian officials who are based there all the time. Those of us who were fortunate enough to visit the Solomons at the end of last year as part of a delegation—headed, of course, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer— recognise the special nature of that place but also recognise the difficulties that it was in and, indeed, was potentially going to face. That was one of the reasons that the Democrats felt quite strongly about our support for not only the region but also, specifically, the Solomons and this operation. It is encouraging to see the positive effect that Operation Helpem Fren is already having in the Solomons, but the government is right to warn that there are great challenges ahead.</para><para>I must convey the Australian Democrats' disappointment that today's ministerial statement has added very little new detail. There is not a lot of new information regarding this operation, despite the many unanswered questions that remain. For example, the minister's statement talks about Australia's immediate goals in the Solomons but, once again, the references to long-term goals are rather vague and somewhat ambiguous. The government has still not ventured to articulate any clear exit strategy. In fact, the fundamental challenge of formulating any such strategy was one of the reasons that the government has previously refused to consider any intervention in the Solomons. It is interesting to note that, in January this year, in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, the Minister for Foreign Affairs took not only quite a radically different position from the one adopted now but also a radically different position in relation to the challenges faced by the Solomons. He argued forcefully as follows:</para><quote><para>Sending in Australian troops to occupy Solomon Islands would be folly in the extreme. It would be widely resented in the Pacific region. It would be very difficult to justify to Australian taxpayers. And for how many years would such an occupation have to continue? And what would be the exit strategy? The real show-stopper, however, is that it would not work—no matter how it was dressed up, whether as<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>an Australian or Commonwealth or a Pacific Islands Forum initiative. The fundamental problem is that foreigners do not have answers for the deep-seated problems afflicting the Solomon Islands.</para></quote><para>I understand a lot of the method and rationale behind the minister's statement because I know that Minister Downer is very wary of being seen as paternalistic in relation to the Solomon Islands. He is always very conscious of making clear that we are not colonialist and do not want to see a return to that kind of mentality in relation to foreign affairs strategy. But, while I understand his wariness, in that quote I also pick up on the fact that he talks about some of the specifics. Included in that are how many years it would take and the issue of the exit strategy, and of course he alludes in that statement to cost. These are some of the questions that the Democrats still put to the government. </para><para>The minister does need to put on the record exactly why there is a changed government position. Why does he now believe that we do have the answers to these problems, and what are those answers? What indeed is the exit strategy in these circumstances? While the government has consistently provided details concerning the deployment of military, police and Protective Service personnel, it has said very little about exactly how the government intends to help the Solomons rebuild its economy, criminal justice system and other governance structures. </para><para>The government continues to refer to the mysterious `small number' of public servants who have been sent to the Solomons. We would like the government to inform us exactly how small that number is—that is, what is the exact number of public servants in the Solomons now? To whom are these public servants accountable and answerable? What powers do they have? What if the Solomons government does not accept their advice: will they have the capacity to impose their decisions on the Solomons government; and, if so, is this acceptable? What measures will be taken to ensure that those involved in the rebuilding process are accountable to the people of the Solomons? These are the issues that we believe the minister has not addressed, yet they will ultimately determine the success or failure of this intervention. </para><para>The deployment of military personnel and police is an important first step—of course we acknowledge that—but, if we leave the Solomons with a crippled economy and a criminal justice system that does not work, then we will have failed. The Democrats firmly believe that Australia should provide assistance to its neighbours when they need it, and of course we must concentrate our security efforts on the Asia-Pacific region. There has been an acknowledgment of the aid to that region. We found it really interesting and it made us feel quite proud to visit some of those aid projects last year. Senator Ferguson was in the chamber briefly just now, and he was also a part of that delegation. It was fantastic to see the work that is being done through Australian aid dollars, but there is always more we can do. In a global sense, our record on aid is not impressive comparatively. There is a lot more we could do there.</para><para>We welcome the minister's statement that, if Australia wants security, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our region, our neighbourhood, is stable, that governance is strong and that the rule of law is just. That is exactly what the Australian Democrats argued time and time again when the government was following the United States off to an ill-conceived war in Iraq. Nevertheless, we do welcome the government's apparent change of heart in relation to the issue of regional security. </para><para>Unfortunately, the government's response to other regional challenges suggests that this new found concern may be limited to the Solomons. While the government is, thankfully, prepared to reach out a helping hand to the people of the Solomons, it continues to fail to recognise and respond to serious human rights violations being committed against other people in our region, including in places like West Papua and Aceh. While the Democrats are not proposing direct action in either of those provinces, we do believe it is time for the Australian government to take a stronger position than it previously has and start exerting stronger diplomatic pressure on Indonesia to put an end to these violations. Certainly, there is a lot to do in our region. Recent reports or exposes of renewed contact with Kopassus, for example, are of grave concern to a lot of Australians and a lot of people in the region.  </para><para>There are still many issues in the region to be addressed, and that is certainly alluded to in the document before us today. The Democrats do support the motion that has been proposed by the minister. We take this opportunity again to extend our very best wishes to those defence personnel, Protective Service personnel and police personnel who are in the region on this very important operation. We look forward to more specific details coming from the minister in relation to those issues that I have highlighted in my comments today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13336</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Greens, I also endorse the motion on the Solomon Islands moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but I wish it were a more balanced motion.

The motion has got the mark of the Prime Minister on it. It has given a pat on the back to the Australian government through its deployment of defence personnel and others, but the motion of itself is not one that we could send to, for example, the parliament of the Solomon Islands to show that we understood why Australia had been asked to be involved there, that we understood the problems in the Solomon Islands and that our intentions there are entirely to assist the Solomon Islands rather than simply Australian interests in the region.

It is not laid out here, but it ought to be at the forefront. The communications I have had from people in the Solomon Islands indicate that there is a very clear public awareness there that there has been disempowerment through thugs and gun-toting people being able to usurp democracy and take into their hands power through corruption which has reached to the highest levels in government.</para><para>One bystander, according to analyst Joan Staples, who was at the airport when the Australian contingent started to arrive, said that they should first go to the Treasury. The comment through the crowd watching on the perimeter of the airport indicated both that there was a new freedom and that there was the ability to say that, and the crowd endorsed that. The point here is that the multinational force going to the Solomons needs to keep in mind that its job is to empower the people of the Solomon Islands and not to replace the current corruption and violence from which the Solomon Islands has suffered with an outside force that is very difficult to remove.  </para><para>In rebuilding the economy of the country, it is going to be very important that this government, at all stages, recognises that this entails giving the Solomon Islanders control of their own resource base: for example, getting rid of the corrupt and destructive logging industry coming from outside, and including Malaysia, which has been marauding the economy, the customary society and the environment of the Solomons. The government needs to be able to assess how it is going to empower civil society in the Solomon Islands, including non-government organisations. If you look at the robustness of Australian society, much of it comes through the power of non-government organisations and the ability for media and community organisations to investigate, keep tabs on and threaten with replacement, where it gets out of hand, governments of the day. That is something that we would do well to empower the Solomon Islands community to do. But there is nothing in the Prime Minister's statement which indicates an understanding of that. </para><para>Simply putting Australians in temporary places of assistance may not meet that goal. For example, it would be worth while offering to Solomon Islanders experience here in Australia or elsewhere in the Pacific in a society that has not broken down in the same way as the Solomon Islands have. They could get hands-on experience on the ground and make the contacts which are going to be very important for Australia's contribution to the Solomon Islands into the future. </para><para>We have acted too late, but it is a good thing we are there. There should have been Australian involvement years ago in the Solomon Islands. The Prime Minister's speech itself refers to the assassination of a former police commissioner and a cabinet minister in the Solomon Islands within the last 12 months. Australia ought to have been much more alert to this, and I submit would have been doing much better to get to the Solomon Islands earlier through the mechanisms that emerged when this necessity arose in the last few months, rather than the foray into the much more distant Iraq which has diverted the government's attention over the last 24 months. </para><para>I support the motion. I think it is strong on sentiment about Australia but weak on sentiment about the Solomon Islands. I hope that does not indicate an imbalance of thinking in the government. I can assure the Senate that the Greens will be—through this Australian involvement in the Solomon Islands—putting it very strongly in this place to the government that our trajectory into the Solomons should be to empower the people, to give them back their right to contribute to their society rather than to, in some way or other, empower outside entities and make the mistake of giving the appearance that Australia has long-term power ambitions as far as this little country is concerned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13337</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank, on behalf of the government, the other senators for their contribution and make a short one myself. Having had the privilege of representing the Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello, at the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting, which was held in the Marshall Islands in June, I would like to use the experience from that meeting of all those Pacific forum nations to allay some of the fears that have been quite properly raised by Senator Brown and others. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, in relation to the building of the institutions that are crucial to a successful society—and that involves a free press, as I think Senator Brown was referring to—I was very pleased to see, and I do not have the details in front of me, Sean Dorney, who is the ABC's longstanding Pacific correspondent. He was in fact at the meeting in the Marshall Islands and I think under an Australian aid program—I stand corrected on that; in fact, I undertake to give Senator Brown the details of it—he was training journalists from around the region and, again I will stand to correct myself, I think we had at that meeting a Solomon Islands journalist in this program that Sean Dorney was running. It was also quite clear to me at that meeting, which was at almost the same time that the Solomon Islands Prime Minister had visited Australia and the initial assessment team was visiting the Solomons, that there was a strong view that Australia and New Zealand, with the support of the region, needed to go to the Solomons. </para><para>It is also clear to me that Australia had to act but only at a time when the nations of the region, particularly the Solomon Islands themselves, invited us to do so. It is easy with hindsight to say the Australian government should have acted sooner. The Australian government has been watching the situation in the Solomon Islands very closely for a number of years—the political, social and security situation as well as the economic situation.</para><para>It has been of serious concern to this government for a number of years. But I do not think Senator Brown would have wanted the government to take some sort of pre-emptive action without the full endorsement of the Solomon Islands government and their parliament, which has of course occurred. I left the Marshall Islands forum with the overwhelming impression that Australia and New Zealand are both held in very high regard in the Pacific. It is quite clear that the effort that has been put in by Australian governments over recent years has been effective. We, as in the personnel who are there, put a lot of energy into the Pacific Island nations. As far as I have seen, I do not think anyone involved in Australia's activities in the Pacific would argue with anything that Senator Brown said about our longer term ambitions: empowering the people, building sustainable economies and, very importantly, respecting their culture. From my readings that I have undertaken since I have been to the Marshall Islands, clearly throughout the sixties and seventies, even into the eighties, there has been a significant threat to some of those cultures. If you do not respect the difference between each of the islands, respect their culture and ensure that the aid and assistance that big, successful nations such as Australia comparative to those very small nations can play, then you can cause harm.</para><para>I am absolutely certain, from understanding the Prime Minister's motivations in the region, the very close interest he has personally taken in the Pacific region and from my own reading of the situation, that that forum has been given a significant lift and importance within the Australian government's set of priorities. The establishment of the economic ministers meeting, the importance the forum itself has found in Australian politics and this historic intervention in the Solomons is a testament to our long-term commitment to creating a stable economic, social and political situation in the Pacific and is something that we should all be proud of. </para><para>I have no doubt that the parliament will closely scrutinise the involvement. It is not, as the Prime Minister has reiterated I think on a number of occasions, a risk-free exercise. It is an exercise that is fraught. As with East Timor, you cannot go undertake an exercise like trying to assist the Solomon Islands people to restore law and order, restore an economy and restore a civil society without any risk involved. There is clearly a risk to the Australians on the ground and there are massive risks of failure. But I think all of us agree today—and I think this debate has been a reflection of that agreement—that Australia does need to be there and that Australia can play a constructive role. It is not just a matter of our national interest; it is a matter of Australia playing a very constructive role very close to home. The longer term vision—and it is not one that can be achieved in a year, two years or five years— must be to ensure that in the Pacific we have nations that are independent, that can sustain their populations, that can ensure the citizens of those independent island states fulfil their own destinies, have their own dreams and achieve those dreams within societies that embrace their fantastic culture and for Australia to be a very important part of that going forward. It is a very big mission. It is a very big call. I think today in the Senate, with what is very important bipartisan support, this augurs well for achieving that mission. </para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>13339</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare</title><page.no>13339</page.no><no.signed>18</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5F4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Calvert</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows:</para><para>We strongly support Medicare, our universal public health system.

That team included Phil Aungles, Maureen MacLachlan, Yew May Martin, Chris Evans and many others. It was a highly regarded team producing quality work and many widely cited publications over several years. Their work has now been attacked, on instructions by Dr Nelson, by spokespeople and by ministers here today, who have suggested that their work has been methodologically flawed. Their research was prepared as part of the major work, <inline font-style="italic">The National Report on Higher Education in Australia 2001</inline>. Their research reports, on which a number of chapters of the major report were based, were completed and submitted for publication in April 2002. This work was prepared as part of the Crossroads processes and was due for release at the same time as the Crossroads issues papers of April through to August 2002. The Karmel team's research found that the changes to HECS in 1996 by this government had a negative effect on participation rates of key disadvantaged groups, especially young working-class men and older people with little background in education. Of course, chapters 4 and 7 were heavily censored in the final report that was released just a few weeks ago. I ask: who did that?</para><para>The minister's adviser, Ross Hampton, the same adviser who advised Mr Reith on the infamous `children overboard' affair, claimed in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on the fourth of this month that there was:</para><quote><para>... no dialogue, correspondence or any form of discussion between the minister or anyone in his office about the report ...</para></quote><para>Senior government officials acting again on the minister's instruction claimed that the deleted sections of the report were deemed:</para><quote><para>... internal research to inform the minister ...</para></quote><para>This is part of the one quote:</para><quote><para>Subsequently, they were not for publication and removed from the report before it was given to Dr Nelson.</para></quote><para>Mr Burmester, who took over the management of the project when he took over control of the higher education unit around Easter 2002, should be able to explain this statement, and I am sure he will at the next Senate estimates. When were these research reports reclassified and on whose instructions? I put it to this Senate that it was Dr Shergold who issued those instructions.</para><para>The ministerial correspondence log in the department of education—if it has not already been reclassified—will show that the offending report was sent to the minister's office about 15 months ago, around May 2002. Ms Peta Lane, the higher education adviser to the minister, received a copy of that report in May 2003. Dr Shergold, the then head of the department and now the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, was concerned that the research produced by this report contradicted the government's policy lines on changes that were being proposed to the higher education system—that is, that these research findings challenged the decisions that had already been made in the department concerning the so-called open consultations associated with the Crossroads process.</para><para>I want to be clear here. This government has sought to maintain that it was running an open process in respect of Crossroads. We now discover that not only were key financial data on the health of the higher education system withheld from this Senate but also data concerning the effects on participation and equity as a result of the previous changes the government had undertaken in 1996. This is a situation where there was a reclassification of data so that it became `ministerial advice' by Mr Ross Hampton and Dr Shergold, and it was done in an attempt to deny the Senate access to this information through the estimates committees. </para><para>I asked a question on 19 March 2003 concerning this report, because $62,000 worth of consultancies that underwrote this report had not been reported in last year's annual report. Some of course were under the reporting threshold, but there were others that were above the reporting threshold and none of them were recorded in the annual report. The government's answer revealed that there had been so-called misclassification of a number of consultancies. In June 2003 the estimates committee was told that the four underpinning research reports for this major report were classified as advice to the minister.</para><para>In the answer to question on notice No. 149-04, given to me three weeks ago, they maintained that fiction. Last Friday, Minister Nelson directed that four reports ready for publication 15 months ago were now to be released. However, we discovered that the four reports were now down to two. Two reports have been amalgamated and one became just a list of tables. It is unheard of in the department to produce just a list of tables. There is always analysis associated with those tables. The two recently released reports supported the material excised from the major report and released three weeks ago.</para><para>Still the department maintains the insulting and professionally degrading comments that these reports had `methodological difficulties' and were to be treated with caution given the small impact of the changes. These small impacts that the government speaks of include a reduction in disposable income for students of between $12 and $24 per week and a reduction in demand of 17,000 mature age people and a reduction of 38 per cent in demand for men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in band 3 HECS courses—that is, courses for doctors, vets, dentists and lawyers. These are hardly insignificant impacts. The research saw things happening as a result of the changes in 1996 and cautioned that there should be further adverse equity impacts if higher education costs were passed on to students through further changes to fees and to HECS. No wonder the government felt that these things were so politically sensitive.</para><para>In my capacity as a senator I have worked with Tom Karmel through the Senate estimates for about 10 years. I believe that he is an honourable, dedicated public servant. He certainly is no left-winger. He is as straight as a die. He would not allow shoddy work to go out over his name, but that is the claim that is being made here today. It is not the department's research that was flawed; rather, it was the policy process itself that was flawed through the lack of attention to the facts and through a lack of leadership and a lack of probity.</para><para>The research capacity of this department has now been crippled, the research budget slashed. Long-term research is being replaced by short-term studies and opinion polling. We see now that the only research the government is interested in are the short-term results of getting the government re-elected. That is why Mark Textor is in on the act, preparing the questions for the recent telephone poll survey undertaken on the question of community and parental attitudes to schooling and used as part of the MCEETYA processes to try to belt up the states. Capable research officers are being scattered. Tom Karmel, for instance, is now with the NCVER. Phil Aungles is now in the schools division. Others are on the verge of leaving. Morale in the department is low. Officers feel professionally shamed by the actions of this government.</para><para>Tom Karmel supervised the research unit, which was reorganised. He was then made to reapply for his job; he did not get it. That is how he was replaced. He is now head of the NCVER and in a recent interview talked enthusiastically about the huge autonomy this new job gave him. If the government did not like the work the NCVER produced they could simply disown it, he said. There was, of course, no question in his new job of getting the go-ahead from ministers for publications. These are statements made in the <inline font-style="italic">Campus Review</inline> on the public record. Tom Karmel is the kind of man we should be grateful to have in the Public Service and he should not have been hounded out by this government. </para><para>These officers' offence was to tell the truth. They were sent away and told to correct `the truth' and to redefine it in terms agreeable to this government. Under this government, research is not wanted if it does not support the policy objectives of the government. This is like a totalitarian state, where the truth is defined by ministers and their advisers, and all other opinions are branded as `methodologically flawed'.</para><para>The letter tabled in parliament yesterday from the current education department secretary, Jeff Harmer, is riddled with vague and misleading statements—and no wonder: he was not there at the time these actions were taken. He was not head of the department; Dr Shergold was. It was Dr Shergold who issued instructions and, of course, it was Bill Burmester who had to carry them out—he had the line management for the surgery undertaken under the minister. In his letter to the minister the new secretary says he was not formally briefed until 23 July. Yet the report was supplied to the minister's office on a number of occasions prior to that. The secretary has informed the estimates committee that the department always addresses correspondence to the minister. It is hard to believe that the minister's office was not made aware of the report prior to the time claimed by the secretary—that this event did not occur until 23 July.</para><para>The values of the government and the ethical standards by which it conducts its own affairs have a powerful influence on the tone of the Public Service, the esteem with which the community regards it and the value the Public Service places upon itself. Former and serving public servants have in recent times explained to me that there is a great fear in the Australian Public Service. This is not surprising, given the number of job losses that have occurred under this government. This is a vindictive government. There are currently record numbers of Federal Police inquiries, by the leak squad, into alleged unauthorised disclosures. Senior public servants are threatened with jail over leaks. Senior public servants are being sacked or moved sideways if the minister does not like them. Junior public servants fear the bullying tactics of ministerial staff, who demand control over information to get the right `spin' on events. The integrity of the Public Service is directly under threat in an environment where ministers and ministerial advisers do not respect the professionalism of its officers and the proper processes of the Public Service itself. That is the situation today.</para><para>In 1996 the Prime Minister told us that he would lift the standard of ministerial conduct. Since that time we have seen a steady deterioration in government conduct to the point where now, as a matter of routine, important information is suppressed, reports are rewritten, events are manipulated and lies are told to protect this government. Dr Shergold, as head of the Australian Public Service, recently told the ABC that the claims of politicisation of the Public Service were absolute `balderdash and poppycock'. Dr Shergold's predecessor, Max Moore-Wilton, had said:</para><quote><para>Frank and fearless seems to have been given some kind of particular status ... </para></quote><para>Max the Axe went on to say:</para><quote><para>I think frank and fearless in some people is a sign of hubris and stupidity ... A number of people have confused frank and fearless with just being a bloody nuisance.</para></quote><para>At a recent Liberal Party conference we heard a senior minister explain:</para><quote><para>We understand the power of incumbency. We have the bureaucracy making the bullets for us to fire at the opposition.</para></quote><para>We see all this occurring within a government from which a pattern of deceit has emerged and there is clear evidence of the process of politicisation of the Public Service at work. We have seen a situation where, to win an election, the government was prepared to fabricate stories about asylum seekers who were alleged to have thrown their children overboard, and then muzzle attempts to expose its actions. It has been totally complacent about the fact that its decision to follow the United States into war in Iraq was based on utterly false intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction. It has suppressed a report in the health department regarding injecting and hepatitis. And on ethanol it has attempted to conceal the relationship between the Prime Minister and the beneficiaries of the government's largesse.

Senator Carr has also been incredibly misleading, mainly because he just does not understand research. If we have a look back at the record of the opposition in terms of their policy approaches, we find that we have had Knowledge Nation and, recently, Knowledge Nation II, which was called Aiming High and was supposed to be the alternative policies of a Labor government. But instead of Labor coming in here and explaining what their policies will be when they get into government we have Senator Carr coming in with some minuscule matter, which he has totally misrepresented anyway.</para></talk.start><para>What we would like to hear from you, Senator Carr, is what you would do if you got into government. Aiming High, which was released by Jenny Macklin, was supposed to outline that, but it was a one-day wonder and then it disappeared without a trace. I thought at least on the very first matter of public importance, Senator Carr, you might choose to resurrect that. But, no, you are not doing that. You are in pursuit of Dr Shergold, who certainly had your measure in the estimates committees when he was the secretary of education, and this is just a bit of vengeance.</para><para>I want to go through and carefully explain what did happen, because what Senator Carr has said is totally misleading and does not stack up with what happened. We have a letter from Dr Harmer, who is the head of the education department. On a matter of personal explanation yesterday, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, read it out to the parliament, explaining to the House of Representatives what did happen. That was to correct the record, after the very misleading story in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that he or his office had withheld and/or amended reports produced within the department in relation to the impact of HECS on student participation in higher education. Indeed, the minister tabled the letter, dated 8 August, which set out the issues involved. I would like to read that into the record, particularly for the Australian public listening to this debate, to put this in the right perspective. Dr Harmer writes to the minister in the following terms:</para><quote><para>I am writing in the context of recent media reports about the publication of the <inline font-style="italic">National Report on Higher Education 2001</inline>. The purpose of this letter is to provide you with an accurate account of the circumstances relating to the preparation and publication of the report. </para><para>In early 2001 the Department decided to begin preparation of such a national report as a retrospective look at policy developments and other changes in the higher education sector during the decade 1992 to 2001. The report was intended to be a companion volume to the 1993 <inline font-style="italic">National Report on Australia's Higher Education Sector</inline> which examined the decade 1982 to 1991.</para><para>The Department subsequently commissioned a number of contributions from people in the sector including recently retired vice-chancellors and researchers with particular expertise. The report also drew on a wide range of internal Departmental material, both published and unpublished. Numerous Departmental officers were involved in drafting and editing various parts of the draft report.</para><para>A number of drafts of the national report were compiled between 2001 and the publication date of the final report on 23 July 2003. In around April 2002 work such as professional editing, formatting and indexing was begun in preparation for the publication of the national report.</para><para>In November 2002, or thereabouts, the Department took the decision to remove material regarding HECS that has recently become the subject of media reporting. This decision was made because of the Department's concerns in relation to the methodological difficulties inherent in analysis of this kind and the incompleteness and inconclusiveness of some of the findings which meant that it did not have a valid place in the report.</para></quote><para>Let me repeat that: it did not have a valid place in this report. He went on:</para><quote><para>The Department's concerns relate to the small size of the effects observed in the analysis, the difficulty of disaggregating other factors from any HECS-related factors and our inability to quantify the likely impact of statistical changes over the period studied. The Department's reluctance to use the above material in the context of the national report was strengthened by the fact that the analysis had not been published, nor subject to wider scrutiny or review by experts in the field.</para><para>An Interim draft of the national report was provided to the Higher Education Adviser in your office in late December 2002 for information and comment. I would stress that the Department had already taken the decision to remove all material relating to unpublished internal Departmental analysis before that draft was provided to your Higher Education Adviser. The material relating to the impact of HECS was edited out of this and subsequent versions by the Department. The Department received no feedback from your office on that draft. Revised drafts were handed to your Higher Education Adviser progressively from March 2003 onwards. Between March and July 2003 your Higher Education Adviser suggested some minor changes, largely of a stylistic or grammatical nature.</para><para>Some of your adviser's suggestions, along with other further edits initiated by the Department, were incorporated in the final version of the national report in July 2003. On 23 July 2003 we provided advice to you that the national report had been published on the Department's website. You issued a media statement on the same day announcing the publication of the report.</para><para>I would like to make it clear that the report was purely an initiative of the Department and was not begun or prepared with any consultation with you or your office, with the exception of the relatively late and minor input from your adviser as noted above. I can confirm that you were not formally briefed on the report by the Department at any time before 23 July 2003.</para><para>I trust this information clarifies this matter.</para></quote><para>I would like to now just repeat one phrase from that speech, because I think it comes to the essence of the matter. </para><quote><para>This decision was made because of the Department's concern—</para></quote><para>I repeat: because of the Department's concern—</para><quote><para>in relation to the methodological difficulties inherent in analysis of this kind and the incompleteness and inconclusiveness of some of the findings which means that it did not have a valid place in the report.  </para></quote><para>Basically what Senator Carr has demonstrated today in this matter of public importance and in question time and in taking note of answers is his profound ignorance of the nature of research. He just does not understand how research works, and he is the shadow minister for research. One of the things that he obviously does not understand is the small size of the effect observed. If you have a small sample and a small size of an effect observed, you cannot extrapolate that across the whole system—you need to separate out that particular factor as the factor that had the effect among a whole range of other factors. That needs a whole series of validity tests. Obviously Senator Carr does not understand that. Any research must be reviewed by experts, and this was not reviewed by experts. For that reason the research could have been highly misleading, and for that reason it was not included in the report.</para><para>Senator Carr should really get back on the main game. He has raised a minor point. He has been proved wrong in what he has done. He has wasted the afternoon of the Senate on a very minor matter on which he is incorrect and he should get back on the main game and present to this parliament what the opposition would do if it got into government. They have not done this effectively, because they obviously are a policy void yet again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>13349</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats care about accountability and honesty and we are proud of our efforts in this place to raise the bar on accountability in government and the public service. We have been successful in significantly increasing transparency and accountability in government contracts, the landmark change to end the government contract secrecy, with Labor support, I might say, for the so-called Murray motion. There is now a requirement that individuals must indicate what clauses in contracts are confidential and then justify the need for confidentiality. They must also provide the Senate with a list of contracts entered into by their departments that exceed $100,000. We would also like support from the Labor Party for better FOI legislation and legislation to fully protect whistleblowers. We know that mismanagement and corruption thrive in the absence of proper scrutiny, and that is why I wrote to the Leader of the Government in the Senate back in April, complaining about the disdain with which the government now regards the orders the Senate makes for government documents. I point out to the minister that I have yet to receive a response to that letter— a sign of arrogance in a government that I think perhaps has been too long in office.</para></talk.start><para>Let me run through the complaints. In 2002 there were 36 orders: 16 were complied with, seven were not complied with, seven were partially complied with and six are still pending. This year there have been 17 orders; so far 10 have not been complied with. There is no consistency, and probably no policy, in which documents are provided and which are not. Some ministers seem to refuse point blank, and that has become more common in recent times. With the PBS, for instance, one minister will release an interdepartmental piece of advice and another will refuse on the grounds that it is interdepartmental. One minister will release legal advice and others will not.</para><para>This country went to war with Iraq supposedly on the basis of advice that it was legal to do so, and yet the minister refused to provide the parliament with that advice. Given the lack of discovery of weapons of mass destruction or any evidence of nuclear arms development, the reasons for this attack now look slim indeed. Access to the environment impact assessment for a radioactive waste repository in South Australia was refused; access to the records and communications between departments on that dump were also refused. The memo of understanding between Australia and the Iranian government on asylum seekers being forced back to Iran was refused. This is literally a matter of life and death, and we have not been able to see what guarantees are in that agreement, if any, to protect those people from torture and imprisonment. </para><para>I asked for the document that was being made available to developers who cared to pay $100 and sign a confidentiality clause for information on Defence land at Point Nepean. It is an outrage that parliament is not entitled to see a document that describes the conditions for selling 90 hectares of Defence land. This is public land with significant heritage and real estate value. And what reason was given? I already had access to it apparently. I did not and, as a representative of the people of Victoria, I saw no reason why I should pay for or agree to secrecy provisions regarding its contents. Documents on Basslink, the government said, need more time. It is three months later and there is still no sign of them. Ministerial correspondence is sometimes provided but in other cases it is kept secret. I pointed out that the Manager of Government Business kept reassuring the Senate that documents about ethanol would be produced, but it seems that ministers in the House of Representatives decided against such production.</para><para>The government needs to understand that we will do what we did today if these documents are not produced: we will withhold our cooperation; we will not deal with legislation at the government's bidding. The current approach to returns to order is ad hoc and random, to say the least, and it does not engender cooperation in this place. We need a proper statement from the government to describe its approach to meeting Senate orders for documents and we want clear and cogent reasons for the nonproduction of those documents. If commercial-in-confidence is a legitimate reason for refusing the handover of documents, then let us see the real reason for that. Likely embarrassment of the government or the minister is not sufficient reason for refusal. Avoiding embarrassment or avoiding admitting to mistakes-in-confidence is not justified in this place.</para><para>The government is not much better on questions. A critical point in the Medicare package is the extent to which it will provide an incentive for GPs to increase their fees for non-concessional card holders. I asked a question on 2 June this year about the billing pattern data that the Department of Health had used to estimate the impact and the response given on the day was: </para><quote><para>The analysis is based on information supplied by the HIC which comes with very strict confidentiality requirements.</para></quote><para>What a nonsense. On 7 May I questioned the minister for health on the decision-making process leading to the decision to universally fund meningococcal C vaccines—a decision at odds with the recommendation of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation—and not fund other vaccines that ATAGI had recommended. The answer arrived today, which is more than two months late. There is also the question of political interference in the production of a vaccination handbook which talks about the `media interest in meningitis'—hardly appropriate for what should be a medical document.</para><para>It is obvious today that one of the factors in the ALP's decision to bring on this debate is the fact that Dr Shergold, while secretary of the department of education, instructed rewrites and deletions of material that might be damaging to the government's arguments on further fee deregulation of higher education. For us there are two important issues. Was this apparent suppression of material an example of politicisation of the Public Service? If it was, it is just another example of such politicisation. What are the policy implications of the actual contents of that material? The Democrats have long been concerned at the tardiness and lack of adequate evidence being provided by DEST and before that by DETYA. My colleague Senator Natasha Stott Despoja criticised the delays and inadequate research in producing Dr Kemp's Knowledge and Innovation and completion and attrition rates of postgraduate research students. </para><para>Quite frankly, we are getting fed up with decisions made on the basis of ideology and not on evidence. The department seems to be complicit with its manufacture of shoddy reports and `dirty data'—often after the decision has been made and in an attempt to justify policy decisions. It is not good enough that data and evidence expunged from the <inline font-style="italic">National Report on Higher Education 2001</inline> relate to equity, participation, barriers and fees. The lack of ironclad data has not bothered the government in doctoring reports in the past and we are not convinced that this was the reason for the censoring in this case. The five-year learning entitlements proposal is supposedly about perpetual students, for which there is absolutely no evidence. Fortunately, the Senate will examine the government's higher education proposals and no doubt the allegations about Dr Shergold's doctoring.</para><para>At the end of every sitting in this place, the government expects the Senate to cooperate in sitting longer and longer hours, despite refusing to schedule extra sitting weeks to make it at least the average for other sitting years. But our cooperation is wearing thin. It's a two-way arrangement in the Senate, and that is the beauty and the safeguard of the Senate—that neither the government nor the opposition have power over this house. The Senate relies on fairness, on compromise and on fostering arrangements that let us get on with the business of this place. The government's refusal to provide the documents ordered by the Senate threatens that very cooperation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>13351</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I tend to be a lot softer than Senator Tierney in this place.

There are three issues I am going to mention this afternoon: the politicisation of the Australian Public Service, education policy and the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The politicisation of the Public Service is this simple. Sir Paul Hasluck always said that the greatest achievement of the Menzies government was the building of an independent, professional and objective Public Service. In his recent autobiography John Menadue said that even though he had been Mr Whitlam's principal private secretary in the early sixties, when Mr Whitlam was leader of the opposition, Mr Menadue became secretary of the Prime Minister's department and in 1975, when Mr Fraser became Prime Minister, Mr Menadue went seamlessly from working for Mr Whitlam to working for Mr Fraser. The Public Service in this country was not made political by Mr Whitlam or by Mr Fraser; it was made political by Mr Hawke and, more importantly, by Mr Keating. That is what happened. It was the Labor Party, particularly under Mr Keating, that made the Public Service political. </para><para>I also read Senator Carr's motion about the growing politicisation of the Public Service and attempts by the government to withhold important information from parliament. I wonder whether Senator Carr had in mind, when he put together that motion, the $10 billion black hole in 1996 that was withheld from the parliament and, more importantly perhaps, from the Australian people. It seems that Senator Carr's object today is the education policy, and Dr Nelson in particular. I want to congratulate Senator Carr on releasing a policy. I mean that. We are often very harsh on this side with the ALP. We say that they do not release their policies. Senator Johnston, this time they have. When that policy was analysed recently by the department—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>—at least there is a policy, Senator Sherry—the department said that Labor had underfunded its education policy by over a quarter of a billion dollars. They had a policy but they got it wrong. That included a $6.3 million underfunding of additional places in universities and at least a $28 million underfunding for universities— taking into account the indexation of university funding. But that pales compared to the $218.9 million underfunding for reducing HECS charges for science and mathematics students in Australian universities. So in fact, even though Senator Carr is quite good at numbers in the Victorian division of the Labor Party, he cannot get the education policy right. It is the only substantive policy the Labor Party have released and they have got the numbers wrong. We have been waiting for seven years, they finally release a policy and guess what—it does not add up. Well done, guys!

Chapman says: `There's nothing in a HECS system that disadvantages the poor.'</para></quote><para>That is the conclusion of the Australian National University in their discussion on the philosophy of the HECS system. It works and it is equitable and, I might add, it is one of the Labor Party's few great initiatives from the Hawke-Keating years.</para><para>So, to summarise, it was the Labor Party that corrupted the Public Service, thanks to Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. The Labor Party's education policy is an absolute shambles. It does not add up. It is another grotesque failure. The Labor Party's HECS policy is equitable; it does work. All Dr Nelson wants to do is build on that. Finally, and most importantly, Labor does not have a plan for the future of Australia's universities, now one of our leading export industries. In a typical collectivist mode they want to strangle the initiative of universities, not let them grow and not let them specialise. For that, they should be ashamed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13353</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to provide a contribution to the debate on this matter of public importance. Let us take a step back in time to June 2001, when the Department of Employment, Science and Training commissioned consultants Ray Adams and Associates to do some research for them and put together the latest report into higher education—which was going to be a 2001 report.</para></talk.start><para>Our understanding is that any formatting, editing, indexing or completion of that report occurred by April 2002; yet the scenario rolling out before us seems akin to Minister Ruddock's handling of people who want to queue jump when they are trying to get entry into this country—that is, a minister who is not quite sure of his dates and a department that is prepared to write letters to protect its own actions in this matter. We have a claim by the department that the editing of this report had only begun in 2002. The consultants tell us that by April 2002 most of the formatting and editing had been completed. Who is correct? Who is telling the truth in this instance?</para><para>During the estimates process on 5 June, Senator Carr was informed that the final draft of this report had been sent to the minister in the first quarter of this year. But on 23 June the minister told us that he had not been formally briefed on the report. Once again, we will have to slowly dig deeper and find out exactly who is correct. Was the department right in saying on 5 June that the final draft went to the minister, or is the minister right in saying that he had not exactly been formally briefed on this by 23 June?</para><para>We have here shadows and mirrors, ducking and weaving. We know that at the bottom of all of this is the suppression of research and information that totally undermines the changes this government is planning to make in higher education. This is information which is unfavourable to the government's proposed changes in higher education, so the government now decides to politically doctor the research provided by well-known national and international researchers—that is, if the research and information you get does not suit you, just blank it out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Cover it up.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—That is right, Senator Sherry—or just ensure that the report is never going to be released. Do not let the public know that there is an alternative view on the draconian measures you are proposing in higher education. We know that the plan before us in respect of the results of the Crossroads review is that students will be asked to pay more HECS. Universities will be given the right to charge whatever HECS fees they like—in some cases up to 30 per cent more than the current HECS fees.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This research shows us that the changes and proposed changes to HECS since 1996, when this government came to power, have discouraged students from entering higher education. This research shows us that some 9,000 fewer school leavers have applied for university entrance per year. Some 17,000 fewer mature applicants have joined the education sector through entry into higher education. The research also shows us that dropping the HECS repayment threshold from $28,495 to $20,701 has caused particular harm and deterred people from combining work and part-time study. The research has to show you that. We have known for a long time that there have been fewer people wanting to get into higher education because of the prohibitive costs they would incur in meeting a HECS debt or because the repayment threshold is so low. That is one of the reasons why this government has decided to increase the HECS threshold: it has finally realised that dropping it from $28,000 to $20,000 back in 1996 was the wrong thing to do. Unfortunately it has taken the government seven years to realise that. </para><para>This government claims that these reports were not released because it had some reservations about the usefulness of the data. Senator Alston claimed today that the data were removed because they did not have a valid place in the report. No; the real answer is that they do not have a valid place in your arguments for the reform package that you are currently trying to put before the Australian public. Why would you want to release a report with data in it that shows exactly the opposite of what you are trying to achieve? You are trying to convince the public that increasing HECS payments will be a good thing for students and will provide better access for students to the higher education system at a time when your own research shows quite the opposite: that the increase in HECS since 1996 has deterred people from taking up higher education.</para><para>What we have here is politicisation of the Public Service. We have a senior public servant who has misled us during the estimates process, or a minister who has not been told the entire truth, or a minister who has been told the truth but has decided to play around with dates and figures to suit his own agenda because this research does not complement the package this government has before the parliament and before the Australian people. So, when you do not have research that suits your agenda, hide it; white it out; do not publish it; do not put it on the web site until there is public pressure to do so or, as this minister would have us believe, public interest in doing so.</para><para>Yesterday we had tabled in the House of Representatives a letter from the department trying to protect it in terms of how it has mishandled this report and giving 1,001 reasons why it has not been reported. We know the real reason for that: this government has politicised the Public Service. It has decided that research that does not back up its claims and does not back up its grand plan for higher education will not be released, will not be made public. This government is ensuring that research which it has commissioned with public dollars will not see the light of day while it continues to mislead the general public about what its plans for higher education are intended to achieve—that is, increased costs for students despite the fact that its own research shows that, if that is the case, fewer people will take up an offer to undertake higher education. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>13354</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The matter of public importance that we are discussing here today is, at its very core, about honesty in public life. Purely and simply, that is what we are talking about here today: honesty in public in life. On that test, this government has failed dismally. This week's revelations concerning the Department of Education, Science and Training and the doctoring and withholding of key pieces of research addressing questions of equity and accessibility to higher education form part of a very disturbing trend emerging in relation to this government's willingness to dupe, to deceive and to insult the intelligence of the public; to manipulate information and communication for blatantly political ends; and, sadly, to use the Commonwealth Public Service as an instrument in this campaign of deceit. </para></talk.start><para>This government was elected on the back of possibly the most shameful act of political deception in our history: the lie that children were being thrown overboard. Just this week in parliament we have been discussing the Prime Minister's willingness to mislead the parliament in relation to his dealings with an important Liberal Party donor, Dick Honan and his Manildra Group. In this same week we are discussing evidence produced by the government's own department—evidence that contradicts a core premise of this government's higher education policy—and the suppression of that evidence. Just in this one week—it has been only two days; we have two more to go—we have been discussing those instances of deceit by the Howard government.</para><para>At this point it is worth congratulating the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> for their dogged pursuit of the manipulation and politicisation of the Public Service by this government. We have read in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that a report has been withheld from the public view for over a year and that it has been doctored. Had that report been available untouched, the information in it would have seriously undermined the government's absolutely ludicrous contention that asking students and their parents to pay higher fees does nothing to dissuade poorer and older students from applying to university. I do not know which planet the government is on in being able to even put that contention to us. The defence that the minister came back with was that he was not consulted in the research. I am sorry, but at the level of politicisation of the Public Service we are seeing coming from this government, that is sadly by the bye. The government's ability to suffuse departments with a clear understanding of its political outcomes and the political outcomes required of them is well known. This latest incident simply confirms the regrettable trend in politicisation that has been in train for years and that has been heightened by this government.</para><para>In one sense, the greater dishonesty is not the inability of the government to admit to the details of the shenanigans in the education department and in its own policy but its inability to be fair dinkum about the thrust of its higher education agenda. We know that it is about cost shifting and privatisation. The government ignores its own research, which reveals the impact that this is having. The government should have listened to the research and supported proposals put to this chamber by the Greens. If you spend the money from the `milkshake tax cut' on higher education you will get free education. You will not have the HECS that the government's own research shows is stopping disadvantaged people from being able to access higher education in this country. That is the direction the government could have taken if it were not ideologically bound to its position of shifting the cost of higher education onto the shoulders of already struggling students and parents. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>13355</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To complain that the Australian Public Service is politicised is, on Senator Carr's part, to really want to complain about the fact that fairness and equity are being introduced. The high level of professionalism, high standard of management and outstanding level of service delivery by the Australian Public Service are things that clearly gall the senator. It galls him that we are doing the job and doing it well. The fact is that this Public Service is not politicised. It is a performing, professional, objective Public Service that, when confronted with government policy, gets the job done. That is the thing that sticks in Senator Carr's craw. He wants to lay claim and allegation to all manner of derogation of our Public Service in the name of his idea of political expediency. He will ignore the facts and go on about the conspiracies and the decline in morale, without any substantiation. He will go on and on in Senate estimates with question after question yielding nothing of merit. So here we are, with this allegation of politicisation, really acknowledging that this government is performing and delivering fairness and equity in, and accessibility to, higher education in this country. That is what the opposition and Senator Carr cannot stomach. The Australian Public Service's level of professionalism, knowledge, conscientious application and productivity is peerless in the Western democratic world. This is a Public Service that has come a long way under this government. Indeed, we said that we would deliver such a Public Service. </para></talk.start><para>In the Garran oration of 1997, our Prime Minister reiterated a commitment to the value of a nonpartisan and professional public service and opposed any trend towards a US style system. In the same speech, however, he also reasserted the government's right to have in the top leadership positions within the Australian Public Service people who they believe can best give administrative effect to the policies which they were elected to implement. That is the point that this opposition cannot stomach. We were elected to deliver on policy, and we do that through the Public Service. To go on, the Prime Minister said that the government have a right to hire and fire secretaries on grounds which suit their political and managerial purposes. We do not shy away from that. What you want to say is that we had a hand in this report. You are ignoring the facts. You have read the tabled letter, Senator Carr. You know for a perfect fact that this report was compiled within the department, a department seeking to deliver on policy. Of course this is a most unwarranted attack when all else has failed in assailing the minister for education for his approach in making higher education more accessible, more affordable and more equitable.</para><para>Let us talk about our Public Service.

Before the passage of this legislation through the Senate, the requirement for risk insurance advisers to disclose commission was hotly debated. Although commission disclosure requirements prevailed in that legislation, the Senate adopted a motion proposed by Senator Andrew Murray that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquire into and report on commission disclosure requirements for risk insurance products on or before 1 October 2003 to allow a more in-depth review of the relevant issues.</para><para>It should be emphasised that risk insurance products are general insurance products such as home insurance, car insurance, fire insurance and the like, together with term life and whole of life insurance policies. The significant difference between these products and other financial products marketed by financial advisers is that they have no investment or accumulation component, such as superannuation. In other words, the customer is insuring for a known outcome in a situation where an event may occur in the future. Hence the amount of commission paid does not affect the outcome for the customer. With investment related products, the amount of commission, by reducing the amount invested, may affect the final outcome. Thus there is a distinct difference between risk insurance products and other financial products, as regards the impact of commission. </para><para>The committee announced its inquiry into the issue in late November last year and, in keeping with previous debates on the subject, the evidence submitted was strongly polarised. On the one hand, some industry bodies and individuals in the financial planning industry strongly opposed any relaxation of commission disclosure requirements for risk insurance products. They argued that commission disclosure was essential to protect consumers against inappropriate advice and inflated remuneration. They said that consumers had a right to know what commissions their advisers received because this affected product cost to them. They said that disclosure would empower consumers to push for lower prices. On the other hand, risk insurance agents and brokers and their industry groups disagreed that there was a need to protect consumers against bias driven advice because it was not a problem in their industry. They argued that commission disclosure requirements, apart from serving no useful purpose for consumers, would drive many small risk insurance advisers out of business. In the end, they said, consumers would be the losers if this happened.</para><para>Remuneration disclosure is intended to protect the consumer against the possibility that a financial services adviser, acting out of self-interest, might give biased advice and, in so doing, cause the consumer some disadvantage. Given this rationale, we thought that it was important to find evidence that commission driven selling was occurring in the risk insurance industry, causing detriment to consumers at such a level as to justify disclosure. No such evidence was produced to this inquiry whether by the Department of the Treasury, ASIC, or any of the witnesses in favour of commission disclosure.</para><para>Opponents of commission disclosure were also unable to point to reliable evidence to establish an absence of detriment. However, the Life Advisers Action Group provided statistics from the Financial Industry Complaints Service showing complaints involving misrepresentation were 0.001 per cent of risk policies in force, and falling, while complaints involving advice on investment products are rising. Of course, these figures do not prove that commission bias is not a problem in the risk insurance industry. Without compelling evidence either way, the committee was unable to draw any conclusions on the commission bias issue. The main focus of the inquiry, therefore, was whether, on a cost-benefit analysis, commission disclosure of risk insurance products was justifiable. The committee's findings were that it was not. We have concluded that the present commission disclosure requirements do not facilitate comparability and that without comparability the primary purpose of commission disclosure—namely, the detection of potential adviser bias—is difficult to achieve.</para><para>Moreover, on this point, we heard that the disclosure requirements would give salaried advisers an unfair competitive advantage. A consumer looking at the remuneration disclosures of a salaried adviser and a commissioned adviser, for example, would not be comparing apples with apples and could be misled into thinking that salaried advisers offer a cheaper, more independent service. This misconception would be heightened when back office costs are included in commissions. Despite earlier assurances to the contrary, the legislation makes no specific disclosure exception for back office costs. ASIC's policy statement No. 175 on disclosure likewise makes no concessions in this area. The committee's view is that, unless remuneration disclosures facilitate true apples with apples comparability of remuneration, commission disclosure will do little to help consumers to protect themselves against detriment ensuing from bias driven advice. </para><para>We accept the evidence that commission disclosure will pave the way for the introduction of a level commission or lower commissions and, in so doing, will threaten the viability of small risk insurance advisory businesses. For many small businesses a sudden drop in commissions will be devastating. These businesses rely on the higher cash flow generated by upfront commissions to fund the very high cost of putting new businesses on the books. The introduction of level commissions will mean that many of these businesses will not have sufficient funds to stay afloat while they restructure their businesses for the disclosure requirements. They will simply go out of business.</para><para>Where is the benefit for consumers if this happens? These businesses specialise in risk insurance and offer face-to-face consultations throughout Australia and in particular in regional as well as metropolitan areas. Most importantly, they provide claims-handling and non-standard risk advisory services which are generally not offered by direct sellers because it is not worth while to do so. It is too expensive or they do not have the expertise. How will consumers benefit if they do not have face-to-face access to a risk adviser? How will consumers benefit if no-one will go into bat for them if they make a claim and there is a dispute? How will consumers benefit if there is no one left to advise them on non-standard risks? How will consumers benefit if the risk insurance advisers are forced to charge them for advice and they cannot afford to pay for that advice?</para><para>We heard no evidence that risk insurance advice provided by direct sellers is any more independent or unbiased than that provided commissioned advisers. If anything, because direct sellers are often the employees of manufacturers of the products they sell, it is probably more the case that direct sellers are less independent than commissioned advisers. Yet commission disclosure will work to the advantage of the direct sellers. In the circumstances, the committee has recommended in relation to risk insurance products that disclosure of the quantum of remuneration not be required either in the Financial Services Guide or in the Statement of Advice, that the present Product Disclosure Statement exemptions should remain, and that in the Financial Services Guide disclosure should be required of the nature only of remuneration received.</para><para>Also, the committee is seriously concerned that restructuring and consolidation in the financial sector is leading to a situation where manufacturing and distribution of risk insurance products will be concentrated in the hands of only a few players. This could have severe implications for the independence of advisers and thus the quality of advice offered to consumers. On a broader level, these developments could stymie competition in the risk insurance market, which, again, would not be good for consumers. We have recommended that the government should review and report on these developments and, where signs of market failure are identified, to formulate remedial programs. In arriving at these conclusions we wish to emphasise that we fully support measures that will empower consumers to make fully informed decisions about financial product purchases. Evidence to the commission disclosure inquiry has convinced us that these requirements fail in their very laudable consumer protection objectives and, instead, will lead to anticonsumer outcomes.</para><para>To summarise the case of the committee against commission disclosure requirements in the FSR Act: there is no consumer demand for this requirement; there is no demonstrated consumer need for it in that complaints relating to this aspect of financial services are negligible; commission does not diminish the potential outcome for a customer. The main interests of the consumer are served, first, by the product provider being solvent and able to pay out when a claim is made and, secondly, by the marketer of the product—that is, the agent—being around when a claim is made and going in to bat for the client against the product provider in the event of any dispute over a claim.  </para><para>The potentially detrimental impact of the commission disclosure requirements on agents may force them out of business; thus, the result will be that they will be unable to provide the service. Hence, the cost to consumers of this requirement outweighs any potential benefits. In three previous reports—on the FSR draft bill, the FSR bill and on the FSR Act regulations—this committee has recommended against commission disclosure requirements for risk insurance products. This inquiry, which is specifically limited to this issue, after much more comprehensive examination, has reinforced those earlier recommendations. I strongly urge the government to respond favourably to these recommendations. In conclusion, I thank Kathleen Dermody, Bronwyn Meredith and the other staff of the committee secretariat of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for their untiring work on this inquiry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13360</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It has been my pleasure to have a long service on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and its predecessor. I wish to start by commending the secretariat and the chair for the usual high standard that I have come to expect from inquiries conducted under their management.</para></talk.start><para>The issue before us is one which is not uncommon but is of particular difficulty for the sector concerned. I say that it is not uncommon because it is quite often that the Senate is faced with suggested changes to laws when there is no evidence of what the consequence of that law change will be. In this situation a desirable principle is set against established industry practice. The contest is between the national interest in having a viable, independent small business sector and the benefits to consumers of much enhanced disclosure and transparency with respect to commission on risk products. The dangers, if this goes wrong, are an increased commoditisation of the product range offered to consumers, the transfer of business to direct sellers and the integration of product supply and distribution, resulting in much poorer after sales service. The advantages are less clear, although if they emerged as the proponents would have them emerge then of course consumers would be better off.</para><para>In my supplementary remarks to the committee's report I made a number of remarks and I want to repeat some of those to ensure that they are understood. As noted at paragraph 2.7 of the report, the disclosure requirements introduced by the Financial Services Reform Act build upon the framework established by the Wallis inquiry that are intended to promote `informed decision making by consumers of financial products' by enabling them to `compare product characteristics, costs and expected rates of return'. At paragraph 3.7, the report notes that the commission disclosure in the statement of advice is intended to protect the consumer against the possibility that a financial services adviser acting out of self-interest may give biased advice. In so doing, the presumption is that the consumer will be disadvantaged by such advice and could suffer detriment. Bias is predicated on any of, or a mix of, self-interest arising from financial business and relationship considerations; as a consequence of instructions from product owners; or as a consequence of influence by product owners. </para><para>Commissions that are a simple payment for a sale need to be distinguished from commissions that are structured to be incentives to sell one product as against another. As a matter of practicality, a regulator would have difficulty separating out the two types. As a generalisation, prima facie, the potential for commissions to result in products being pushed is reflected in the statement of Mr Ian Johnson of ASIC that `there is strong evidence that product pushing takes place where the commission is highest'. It is also reflected in various witnesses believing that the purpose of paying commissions is to increase or incentivise sales, although that is unlikely to be true in all cases, particularly where the product has the characteristics of a commodity and is not highly differentiated.</para><para>The difficulty previously discovered by the committee and again uncovered by this inquiry is that hard evidence on the effects of nondisclosure of commission on risk products remains poor and assertions dominate. The principles established in the legislation mean that informed decision making by consumers of financial products requires full disclosure and transparency to enable consumers to compare product characteristics, costs and expected rates of return. Such principles could only be overturned for risk products if the costs outweighed the benefits. In the absence of definitive findings and sufficient factual evidence on costs and benefits, the choice of the Senate will come down to three views: the general principles of the act should apply regardless of the consequences; a belief that the market costs and supplier effects for small business resulting from disclosure would be greater than the benefits to consumers; or a belief that the costs to consumers of nondisclosure would be greater than the benefits to small business.</para><para>Earlier I used the term `full disclosure'. There is a view that the intended disclosure will be partial, and directed at the vulnerable small business end, leaving a big business oligopoly of product owners able to continue manipulating the market. This sort of view was expressed in an additional submission, which concluded:</para><quote><para>The Committee should either:</para><para>(1)	endorse disclosure of ALL influence, including life risk commissions, OR</para><para>(2)	take the UK option, and recommend NIL disclosure on life risk products.</para></quote><para>Having, in my August 2001 supplementary remarks, said that partial disclosure is inappropriate, I have sympathy for the view that the proposed disclosure regime must ensure full disclosure so that those with influence further up the distribution chain do not profit from partial regulatory change by increasing market dominance and financial return.</para><para>The evidence of risk advisers in the report seems to suggest two conflicting concepts. Chapter 4 suggests that consumers are not particularly interested in commissions paid to their advisers. This should mean that disclosure would not be expected to change consumer behaviour. In these circumstances, any effects on small business of disclosure could only be supplier and not consumer effects. In chapter 6, the evidence is that disclosure would result in the demise of small businesses, particularly in country areas. This could mean that disclosure would change consumer behaviour, so any effects on small business of disclosure would be consumer effects as well as supplier effects. I suspect the latter case is more likely with both consumer and supplier effects. The stronger objection that some small business witnesses have is that, while both partial and full disclosure will change consumer behaviour, partial disclosure runs the risk of allowing big business to concentrate the market to their benefit and greater profit, leaving small business squeezed in between. </para><para>To mitigate the impact on small business, it may be appropriate to include, with the commission disclosure, some commentary that the commission includes a back office, salary and service component that would not normally be included in the commission of a salaried employee of the product manufacturer or owner. In this way, small business operators in regional areas would be helped in justifying their commissions to consumers to demonstrate that the price of the risk product is not significantly different despite the nominally higher commission.</para><para>If small business operators are offering quality after-sales service, selling reasonably priced products and explaining these benefits to customers, the commission disclosure should not be expected to significantly impact on their relationships with customers. If there is to be disclosure, commonsense and equity demands a full disclosure regime, not a partial disclosure regime. To determine full disclosure, in the manner advocated by some witnesses, will be a complex task and require considerable consultation.</para><para>Full disclosure has the benefit of meaning that regulatory harmony and consistency will not be jeopardised by the exemption for stand-alone risk insurance products. It has been argued that exemptions could lead to the restructuring of products to avoid some commission disclosure and create the potential to top up commissions on risk products, with a corresponding reduction in disclosed commissions on investment products. The reaction of the government to the committee's views, and to my own views, will affect the Democrats' determination on this issue when legislation is before the Senate. The Democrats will assess any attempt to water down the principle of disclosure critically and will have a preference for full rather than partial disclosure.</para><para>In making these remarks, I do not minimise at all the difficulty we face that has been enunciated by the chair, and that is that we cannot be certain of the consequences of the law change before us and therefore we need to proceed with care. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund</title><page.no>13362</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>13362</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives notifying the Senate of the appointment of Mr McMullan to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund in place of Ms Gillard.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SPONSORSHIP MEASURES) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13362</page.no><id.no>R1824</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>13362</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator EGGLESTON (Western Australia) (5.56 p.m.)—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>13362</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title><page.no>13362</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>13362</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>13362</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">A Pacific engaged: Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south-west Pacific</inline>, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>This inquiry has enabled the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee to have a close look at a significant and somewhat neglected part of our neighbourhood. Over the last two decades, when we have talked about our region we have referred to Asia and the Pacific. Most often, we have then gone on to focus on the tumultuous changes in Asia to our north or, under the rubric of APEC, talked about how the Pacific ties us into the North and South American continents. Our interest in the Pacific island countries has tended to take a back seat by comparison. They grab our attention when a crisis hits, such as the coup attempts in Fiji, conflict in Bougainville, unrest in the failed state of the Solomon Islands or because of a general concern about the so-called arc of instability to our north.</para><para>Looking closely at the Pacific island countries, it is easy to see the truth of the cliche `trouble in paradise'. Many are small independent countries with microeconomies. Apart from notably Samoa, most are witnessing their economies decline—some quite quickly, others more in a slow-motion collapse. Problems of governance, law and order, criminality, health, education and infrastructure development plague the region and, of course, distance is a killer. These countries are far-flung. There are 16 independent states spread across a large portion of the biggest ocean in the world. They are home to 7.9 million people with a combined GDP of approximately $US23.3 billion. Australia, by comparison, has a population of 19.4 million with a GDP close to $US400 billion.</para><para>So Pacific Island nations are experiencing a period of rapid social change characterised by uncertainty and instability as a result of environmental and developmental pressures. There are numerous issues for these countries to contend with. Let me mention some of the salient concerns: increasing social and economic inequality; corruption; high unemployment, particularly for young people; ethnic tensions; environmental degradation; and declining health, education and living standards. With these considerations in mind, the committee sought to assess how effectively Australia's assistance in the region was addressing these issues and in what way Australia might in the future assist these countries to achieve a level of economic sustainability. It was clear to the committee from the evidence presented, and most starkly from the committee's visit to the region, that PNG and the countries of the Pacific have enormous potential for prosperous development. The challenge is to effectively harness the enthusiasm within the region to adequately support the realisation of this objective.</para><para>In its deliberations, the committee agreed that its report should be based on three central themes. First is Australia's engagement with Pacific countries. The committee considers positive and regular engagement with PNG and Pacific island nations by officials, organisations, firms and private institutions to be fundamental to a constructive and prosperous relationship. Secondly, the committee sought to determine the extent to which the usual means of awareness raising—primarily, the media and education— were successful in engaging the awareness of Australians about Pacific issues or in conveying an adequate account of the richness and diversity of Pacific island cultures, of their political and economic circumstances and of their inhabitants' view of Australia as a regional power. Finally, the committee endorses Australia's focus on good governance and regards the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of institutions and governments to be fundamental to the region's wellbeing. The committee has addressed the impact of the governance agenda on Papua New Guinea and Pacific island nations. </para><para>The committee also deliberated at length about how to frame its recommendations in the light of the many challenges within the region. Broadly, the committee agrees with the current policy settings. The committee has, however, set out recommendations where we think those policy settings can be adjusted to improve the economic and social conditions within the region. The committee sought to compile an economic and social profile of Papua New Guinea and the Pacific island countries ideally across a time series of the last 20 years with the aim of monitoring the progress or decline in economic and social circumstances. The committee's profile is limited, given some of the gaps in information, but is still good enough to determine that, notwithstanding all the efforts being made, the region is in decline with some countries on the brink of collapse and others on a slower yet inexorable downward path. Of course, there are some who buck that trend. Samoa is one of those.</para><para>As a consequence, the committee gave thought to its own role in making recommendations. Clearly, as a Senate committee, we have a review function. Senate inquiries are also opportunities to put forward proactive, perhaps all-encompassing ideas which, while they may not be perfectly developed, nonetheless raise issues for public debate and an alternative vision for policy direction. Therefore, the committee has made two tiers of recommendations. Firstly, we put forward a global recommendation about a Pacific economic and political community. In essence, it proposes a Pacific community which will eventually have one currency, one labour market, common strong budgetary and fiscal discipline, democratic and ethnical governance, shared defence and security arrangements, common laws and resolve in fighting crime, and health, welfare, education and environmental goals.</para><para>Our concept of such a community is one which recognises and values the cultural diversity of the region and the independent nations within it and takes into account the differing levels of growth and development of each country. This recommendation is based on the following considerations: </para><para>·	the economic and social problems of the region are worsening;</para><para>·	Australia has a responsibility to assist nations in the Asia Pacific region; </para><para>·	if sustainable regional economic growth can be achieved, issues of governance, international crime, law and order, regional security and the health and wellbeing of people living within the region and in Australia will improve; </para><para>·	the region is made up of 16 countries which are independent and sovereign entities whose independence is respected; </para><para>·	many of the countries suffer the problems that arise in small nations with microeconomies; to obtain sustainable economic growth, reform needs to be pursued across the region by all nations taking into account the special issues affecting small countries; </para><para>·	while all nations have the right to pursue their own economic goals, each nation has an obligation to the other countries in the region to achieve economic reform and sustainable growth; and  </para><para>·	if the region continues to decline, the costs to Australia of dealing with the consequences will be much greater than the costs to Australia of moving to establish a community that can increase regional prosperity.</para><para>All the evidence our inquiry obtained agreed at least on one point: Australia has an obligation to assist the Pacific states to protect their security and stimulate their economies.</para><para>The arguments in support of our regional obligations can be categorised in at least three ways: our shared history and links with the region; Australia is the major economic power and security presence in the region; the region is vital to Australia for defence and security, protection from terrorism, protection from organised crime and drug trafficking, and for health and security from disease, and from an environmental and ecological point of view. Notwithstanding Australia's obligations, considerable costs are incurred in living up to them. The actual cost of Australia's role in the Pacific is probably unknowable and certainly extends well beyond budgeted outlays for foreign aid in the region.</para><para>While the committee accepts Australia's obligation to the region, the committee is also mindful that the more economically self-reliant the nations in the region become, the more likely it is that governance improves and the more the security, policing, health and environmental obligations can be met. Better outcomes on these issues mean fewer costs to Australian taxpayers.</para><para>A further hidden cost is the damage that competing economic policies within the region can cause. One example of regional policy conflict which impinges on Australia's economic efficiency involves the conflicting positions taken in the current Doha Round of world trade negotiations. In this round, Australia in its own right, and as chairman of the Cairns Group, is committed to removing agricultural protection in Europe and elsewhere. This is being challenged by the ACP—African, Caribbean and Pacific— group that represents most of the world's least developed economies. The committee believes that the idea of a Pacific economic and political community is worthy of much greater public debate and research, and we have made recommendations along those lines.</para><para>As chair, I want to thank my committee colleagues, and in particular Deputy Chair Sandy Macdonald. The committee worked hard and in the true spirit of Senate committees. I would like to thank those who gave evidence, the Australian diplomatic corps that assisted our trip through the region and the Howard government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister, who made a plane available for the committee to visit the region. I would like to thank the prime ministers and heads of state who met our committee and made their ministers available. And I would like to thank the committee secretariat led by Mr Brenton Holmes and staffed by highly competent officers. In particular, the work done by Ms Saxon Patience was outstanding. She did the lion's share of the work, and we sincerely thank her for her efforts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>13365</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to make some comments about the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">A Pacific engaged: Australia</inline><inline font-style="italic">'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south-west Pacific</inline>. To add to what Senator Cook said, I think it is probably one of the most stimulating reports and inquiries in which I have ever been involved in my time in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>The Pacific is Australia's and of course New Zealand's backyard—or front yard. We are the superpowers in the region. To put that in perspective, the GDPs of Australia and New Zealand are approaching $800 billion a year from a joint population of 25 million. The combined GDP of the Pacific island nations is around $US25 billion from a combined population of around 7.9 million. It is an extraordinary disparity of population and particularly wealth. That is relevant when you think of the main recommendation that Senator Cook spoke to, which calls for the possible coordination of a Pacific economic and political community. But it is, as we say in our recommendation, worthy of further research, analysis and debate. It is important. It is a big call, but to make the report worth while and to show initiative I think it is in line with what we heard and what we understand some of the problems of the Pacific to be. </para><para>Pacific island nations are experiencing a period of rapid social change characterised by uncertainty and instability as a result of environmental and developmental pressures. There are numerous issues for these countries to contend with at this time, such as increasing social and economic inequality, particularly evidenced by the traditional village economy changing to the development of commercial activity and the requirement for people to leave their traditional community and go to the townships and cities for jobs; corruption; high unemployment, particularly for young people; ethnic tensions; environmental problems; and failing health, education and living standards when, as I said, people leave their traditional environment and move to the major cities.</para><para>With these considerations in mind, the committee sought to assess how effectively Australia's assistance in the region was addressing these issues and in what ways Australia might in future assist these countries to achieve economic sustainability. The obvious aim is to achieve a level of economic activity that allows for jobs, taxes and income for governments to provide the infrastructure of statehood. I think Senator Cook has covered many of the issues extremely well, but there are a couple of other things that I would like to add. </para><para>The inquiry report revolves around the obvious themes of any inquiry into Australia's relationship with PNG and the Pacific. They are, firstly, Australia's engagement, which by geography and history is ongoing and is considerable; secondly, Australia's knowledge of the region, which again has a past—we have only to look back 61 years to the war in the Pacific when it came to Guadalcanal in August 1942 to be reminded of the security implications to Australia of the Pacific and particularly the impact of the Pacific War—and, thirdly, the theme of good governance and Australia's commitment to it in our aid and development assistance programs. These themes have been well developed in the report and in the recommendations. Anybody reading the report will have to keep them in mind.</para><para>I can think of no inquiry in which I have been involved since being in the Senate where the issues and recommendations are so timely. Our relationship with PNG and the Pacific are very important to us, and they are also important to our long-time partner New Zealand. The high level of cooperation with New Zealand in our Pacific dealings and in many other areas must be developed and encouraged. To have been in the Solomon Islands only weeks before the cooperative intervention was, for members of the committee, an extraordinary experience. It is not often any of us get the opportunity to touch the hand of history, but we were certainly very close. The Solomons have very considerable problems of economic sustainability and good governance and a major part of the reason for this Senate inquiry was to make sure that the Solomons' experience does not become a partial blueprint for a number of other small Pacific nations. </para><para>The committee has put, as I mentioned, a main recommendation on the table and a number of particular recommendations. Anybody who reads the report will acknowledge the work and genuineness of the recommendations. I particularly acknowledge the generosity of the government, particularly the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in providing an RAAF aircraft for transport for us. I also thank and acknowledge the diplomatic missions in our region. Australia is well served by our AusAID representatives and our diplomats. I do not believe we could fault any of them in PNG or the Pacific. Congratulations, one and all. I would also like to make note of the fact that it is very rare—in fact, I cannot think of another example—for a Senate committee to be given the opportunity to travel. I would like to note that it was an opportunity not lost by the members of the committee and we are appreciative of that.</para><para>We have made a recommendation in connection with access to the Pacific for politicians because one of the things that came out very clearly in our dealings was that Australia's awareness of many problems in the Pacific, and of the Pacific generally, was probably greater in the time of our parents and grandparents than it is now because they were very concerned about the impact of the Pacific war. That is something that needs to be addressed and we have a number of recommendations in the report to do that.</para><para>I mentioned the performance of our diplomats. I know and I understand from our dealings that Australia is regarded with considerable affection in the region. It would be very easy for Australia to be regarded as the bad cop or the big brother in the region, or whatever you might like to see us as. I was pleased to see that, as a general comment, Australia's image is good—as it should be. That is why the committee says in the report that, `broadly the committee agrees with current policy settings'.</para><para>I would also like to thank and to acknowledge the work of the chairman, Senator Cook, and other members of the committee, particularly Senator Hogg, Senator Johnston and Senator Marshall. All of us came to the inquiry with different views of the region and I would say that probably all of us came to the inquiry with very little understanding of the states, the geography and the layout of the Pacific and of the importance of the interaction of those states with each other and with us. Our report is genuinely and generously unanimous. That is very important when you consider that we provide around $500 million worth of development aid and military assistance.</para><para>In passing I would like to say that one of the members of the committee was a Democrat—Senator Aden Ridgeway—and I think the Democrats missed an opportunity to take part in this very important inquiry. We have Senator Bartlett attending from time to time on various aspects of the Pacific that he finds newsworthy, such as the processing facilities on Manus Island or elsewhere. But when it comes to the hard yards and the hard work about where we should go in a cooperative and generous government approach to the problems of the Pacific, the Democrats are not there—they are not prepared to do the hard work when it is required to be done, which is certainly the case with our dealings with the Pacific.</para><para>I have particularly enjoyed working with Senator Cook. I say to him that I was very impressed with his capacity and his knowledge of both trade matters and the Pacific, and also with his energy in carrying through the writing of the report and the very considerable workload that took place in the week or so when we were away. I admired his energy in carrying forward the meeting program—it was important for the committee that that be done, and he did it extremely well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13368</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak on the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, <inline font-style="italic">A Pacific engaged</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south</inline><inline font-style="italic">-</inline><inline font-style="italic">west Pacific</inline>, I would like to endorse all the comments that Senator Peter Cook made in introducing this report to the Senate. In particular, I would like to put on the record my thanks to the government for making it possible for us to visit the South Pacific. Without that ability to travel and actually hear from the people on the ground in the region we would not have been able to complete a fully comprehensive report, as I believe we have done. I would also like to express my thanks to the secretariat—to Brenton Holmes and, in particular, Saxon Patience. Their work has again enabled the committee to produce a very comprehensive report, which I am very happy to recommend.</para></talk.start><para>I want to make a few comments about the report in relation to the Australian government policy which in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific is focused at all levels on the need to achieve good governance through institutional reform as well as recognising the need for development of an effective skill base, transparency, accountability and sustainability. Much of our aid program is designed to promote government policy in this regard. We as a nation have attempted in our aid programs to impose sound governance practices as conditions to the assistance that we provide. These efforts unfortunately have not worked so well, as compliance has generally tended to last only until the disbursements of financial assistance are completed.</para><para>Governance is sometimes described as the manner in which power is exercised by leaders at all levels in the management of resources entrusted to them for the benefit of the people they represent. Much of the political discourse on good governance is sometimes seen as a polite way of raising awkward questions on corruption, incompetence and abuse of power. While the committee was not charged with any responsibility to investigate corruption and has not sought to specifically make allegations in this regard, we were particularly concerned about the abundant allegations of corruption brought before us, formally and informally. The committee considers this issue to be a major inhibiting factor to economic development in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. The committee particularly noted the comment by a former prime minister of PNG, Sir Mekere Morauta, who noted that corruption is both systemic and systematic.</para><para>Corruption has a major negative impact on good governance and the distribution of essential social and infrastructure services to the mainly rural populations. It also represents a significant drain on the public purse. The committee recognises that corruption misappropriates resources that genuinely need to be directed towards poverty alleviation and long-term development. Corruption stands in the way of resource mobilisation for worthy national development efforts. Through bad governance and corrupt practices, government revenues are unnecessarily forgone and lost; recurrent and capital expenditures are dishonestly and wastefully inflated; low priority and more expensive projects or equipment are given budgetary approval; the average quality of public and private sector investments are deliberately lowered, with consequences in poor social and economic return for each dollar of national investments; and leaders lose credibility, and trust in the leadership is eroded, thereby compromising their effectiveness in marshalling public enthusiasm, commitment and resources for national development.  </para><para>There is no doubt that aid money provided by Australia is reduced in its effectiveness by this systemic and systematic corruption. Until we achieve a political will in donor recipient countries—in PNG and the South Pacific—to address the issue of corruption as a political and social issue, our aid program will continue to be severely undermined and the economies of PNG and the South Pacific island countries will never reach their potential. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>13369</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My speech this afternoon will be very brief, as all senators have canvassed the more technical aspects of our report, which I think is a bit of a watershed not only in terms of the Senate travelling to other countries but also in terms of the level of evaluation of the social and economic conditions of our Pacific neighbours. May I first thank the Prime Minister, who supported the Senate's trip and investigation, and the foreign minister, who also provided the diplomatic missions in each of the five countries to us to assist us and to brief us on the conditions that we were to encounter in each of Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. May I also, as did Senator Macdonald, pay tribute to the chair of the committee. I also pay tribute to Senator Macdonald, who, as deputy chair, chaired the committee in Samoa and Tonga. Both chairs displayed extraordinary diplomatic sensitivity and conducted a very intellectual approach to engaging senior ministers, prime ministers and senior government officials in each of the countries that we went to. Indeed, this approach and this ability and this skill enhanced the capability of the committee to prepare what I think is a very good report.</para></talk.start><para>I am left with a lasting impression of the very high level of professionalism and dedication of our high commissioners, their staff and officers—and of course their immediate families—in each of the countries we visited. Going to far flung climes, often quite isolated islands in the Pacific, and being committed to engaging these countries in a sensitive way whilst retaining the priority of Australia's national interest at the forefront of their mind is not an easy task, but they do it with a very high level of professionalism. I was delighted, and I think parliament would be delighted, to see the expertise that these men and women disclose in doing their job on our behalf.</para><para>As my focus was upon law and order issues, I want to make mention of the Australian judges and jurists who throughout the region provide a very high level of justice and justice administration in these emerging nations. To them I want to say a special thank you and acknowledge the work that they do. They do a very fine job away from home in the earnest, keen and energetic efforts they display in providing justice to these peoples.</para><para>May I also pay tribute to our Australian Defence Force and Federal Police personnel. We are providing a very large number of security initiatives in these countries through the expertise of the Federal Police. We have, of course, a patrol boat in most countries in the Pacific—certainly the five countries we visited have the benefit of one or two patrol boats—and these are maintained and instruction is given as to their use and operation by our naval personnel. It is clear that our naval personnel do an outstanding job in providing those patrol boats which assist in the security and protection of these countries' economic zones.</para><para>Finally, I want to pay tribute to my fellow senators: Deputy President Hogg, Senator Marshall, Senator Cook and Senator Macdonald. The routine was a very stressful and energetic one and we worked very hard. We were flying between these islands for very long periods of time and we were living in each other's pockets constantly for about 11 or 12 days. We were, I think, a happy band of senators doing our work and fulfilling the tasks that were presented to us by the terms of reference. I believe that the report indicates that we approached our work with a strong sense of application and dedication. We were in Honiara for a full day, a most dangerous and unstable environment. In closing, may I say God speed the work that we are undertaking there and protect our people who are carrying out that most important work. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13370</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I realise the debate on this closes in another two minutes, so obviously I do not have a great deal of time. I may seek an extension. Suffice to say, the significant part of this inquiry was that, when the inquiry started out, no-one knew exactly where it was going to lead to. It became evident during the inquiry from outside of Australia that, unless the committee travelled, this report would have little or no credibility to our neighbours in the Pacific. I must commend the government on the fact that, when a request was put by this committee to travel, in extraordinary circumstances indeed, the request was granted. It is very much to the credit of the government and, I am sure, lends great credibility to this report. I commend the report for that very reason to those out there in the broad Australian public.</para></talk.start><para>I want to focus briefly on the people who assisted us on the trip that we undertook investigating PNG and the South Pacific. We insisted as a committee that we saw the practical application of our aid dollars—we did not want it to be a glossy tour. The work of the secretariat in setting up the program for us was remarkable indeed. It was a hard work program: not only did we meet the politicians, the business community and the community in general but we met church leaders, who play such a significant role in the South Pacific and PNG, and also the NGOs. We also had the opportunity to meet with expats. In that sense, it was a well-balanced, well-organised program and it gave us a fair feeling, although we were not in many of these places for a long period of time, of precisely what the life and lifestyle in these places was about. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> As I say, the program was tightly packed. We did not go as tourists; we went as a working party—that is what it was: work from one day to the next. That will be seen in the program that was put together by the various high commissions in cooperation with the various governments that we paid our respects to on the visits.</para><para>I must commend the high commissioners and their staff, as has been done here. Without them, the investigations made by the committee would have fallen flat indeed. But also I must mention that we did have a senior AusAID officer, Cathy Bennett, who travelled with us. The work done by AusAID in assisting our program was remarkable indeed, and that is covered within the report itself.</para><para>My particular interest was in the area of good governance, as has been mentioned by Senator Johnston. That is something in which we are playing a very practical role in many of these island states and, in particular, in PNG. The direct assistance that is being given through practical programs under the auspices of AusAID really stands out. It seems to me that, unless there is law and order and good governance in these places, we will have a recipe for disaster on our doorstep indeed.</para><para>One of the highlights for me—and there were a couple—was the visit to the high school in Tari. I was accompanied by Senator Marshall and Senator Johnston, and that visit was a very touching experience. We met Sister Carmel, the principal of the school, and Father Dom, one of the school mentors, along with the school staff. But the outstanding feature of that school tucked away in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea was the fact that it was the only high school to remain open and give schooling to children during the uprising in the Southern Highlands the year before. They determined that, against the odds, they would remain open to teach the students in that area, because that was their goal in life and that was their obligation. They were doing a marvellous job indeed. </para><para>Another thing that stood out was our visit to the Oil Search gas site at the Hides. We visited there a medical centre that was receiving assistance from AusAID, as well as the primary school. If you think you have it tough in Australia, then you should visit those places and you really will see—and I have photographs of the medical centre and the primary school there—that there are no luxuries there at all. They are very basic and rudimentary, but nonetheless very important, pieces of assistance which Australia is giving in PNG.</para><para>Another memorable feature was our visit to Honiara in the Solomons. Whilst that was brief, I agree that it was very timely indeed. We saw the problems that are besetting that place.

The protection of employees is ensured by giving employees the right to make submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission if an order is sought. These are significant protections. They recognise the practical benefits of providing an umpire at the same time as they recognise that a new employer may have a different approach in mind.</para></talk.start><para>The ALP has moved amendments to the bill that the government has indicated it will not accept. Labor proposes in one amendment to create uncertainty, instead of resolving it, by inserting a test into sections 149 and 170MB of the Workplace Relations Act that would identify when a business has transmitted. The ALP proposal is similar to the one applied by the Federal Court in recent public sector outsourcing cases. This test focuses on the business activities of the relevant employer and employees. It is this test that in 2000 the High Court ruled was inappropriate for the private sector. Again we apparently must underline for Labor the essential difference—and it is not only a cultural difference—between the private and the public sectors. In particular, in this instance there is no argument that could possibly be advanced that would persuade anyone, except perhaps a lawyer, that legislating for protracted litigation about the identification and characterisation of the activities of a business could be in any way beneficial. </para><para>It is a very sensible piece of legislation that we are dealing with. In fact, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry describes the bill correctly as—I should stress—a moderate bill. `It is not a radical or extreme response to the problems arising from the existing transmission of business provisions and it deserves to be examined on its merits,' said the chamber.</para><para>I now wish to turn briefly to some of the remarks made in this debate by the Democrat spokesman on workplace relations. Senator Murray, as usual, made a thoughtful and generally well researched contribution to the debate. The government agrees with his view that this legislation ought to be about striking the balance between various rights and interests. The government also agrees with his characterisation of the transmission of business rules that `at heart the intention behind these provisions was to provide a protective mechanism for employees, but there has always been a corresponding understanding that business sales should be facilitated.' The government would add, however, that the present arrangements for resolving conflicts between competing enterprise based agreements can be unduly technical and complex and that there needs to be a simple and trusted means for resolving problems if and when they arise after the sale or transfer of a business.</para><para>The sensible and pragmatic approach is to allow the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to exercise its discretion to resolve difficulties which the parties, for one reason or another, have been unable to resolve for themselves. This is the approach taken in respect of awards, and in that regard the government is doing no more than treating all forms of collective agreements as alike for the purposes of transmission.</para><para>In bringing forward this bill the government has significantly altered its approach from the approach taken in the <inline ref="R1289">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2001. </inline>The present bill expands the category of people who may apply for an order about transmission of certified agreements and refines the category of people who may make a submission. The previous transmission bill only allowed an employer to apply for an order. Before transmission it is the outgoing employer; after transmission it is the incoming employer.</para><para>This bill will also allow employees who would be covered by the agreement, and relevant unions, to apply for an order after transmission. I cannot stress that point enough. As for making submissions, this bill will allow all those who would work under the new employer if it transmits, plus any relevant unions, to have their say if an order is sought. This principle applies whether an order is sought before or after transmission. Here it may be noted—with respect, of course—that Senator Murray seems to have mistakenly thought that only employers can make applications under the bill. This is not correct. A relevant organisation bound by a certified agreement, or employee of the incoming employer, who will be covered by the certified agreement can also make application at or after the time of transfer of the business—but not before the transfer as per the outgoing employer. Persons and organisations bound by the certified agreement can also make submissions re an application. </para><para>Senator Murray raised a variety of other issues that in total amount to a concern that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in exercising its discretion, may make some workers less well off. The government's view is that such concerns are largely hypothetical and that until it demonstrates otherwise the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ought to be trusted to perform the role given to it under this bill in a way that respects the rights and expectations of all those affected.</para><para>I note that during this debate the Democrats have indicated that they will move some amendments to the bill. The government is looking forward to receiving those and I understand that there is a willingness to consider some of those amendments in a very positive light. However, it is instructional to note that previously the Democrats said:</para><quote><para>It seems self-evident that the IRC should have discretion in respect of transmission of employee conditions in business acquisitions, however, particularly when more than one certified agreement affects `old', `transferred' and `new' employees in a business.</para></quote><para>They went on:</para><quote><para>The Industrial Relations Commission needs to determine which agreement should prevail— provided, that is, that the Industrial Relations Commission continues to recognise that the intention behind the transmission of business provisions is, in the interests of fairness, to provide a protective mechanism for employees. The IRC must do this while taking into account the need to provide new or reformed businesses with necessary operational flexibility.</para></quote><para>In conclusion, the bill will deliver greater certainty for employers and employees in the context of transmission of business. In my view, and in the view of the government, the bill ought to be supported and not subject to amendments which will create greater uncertainty and confusion—as, for example, the ALP proposed amendments definitely would. The government calls on the Senate to rise above sectional interests and adopt a more sensible approach to the modest reforms that are contained in this bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13373</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to wind up the debate on the <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002</inline>. This is essentially a very simple and straightforward bill. The bill will give the Industrial Relations Commission the power to assist employers, employees and unions in addressing anomalies and unintended consequences that may arise in the process of transmission or transfer of business. This is the same power that the AIRC already has in relation to awards.</para></talk.start><para>In particular, the bill will deal with the situation where employers and employees face multiple and conflicting certified agreements as a result of a business being transferred or sold. At present, the Workplace Relations Act provides that, if there is a conflict between different certified agreements as a result of a business transfer, the agreement that was made first must prevail. The government believes that this is not rational and that, where there are multiple and conflicting agreements, the agreement which ought to prevail is the one which best suits the interests of the relevant business and its employees. Under the bill, once the business has been transferred all parties, including employees and unions, have an equal right to approach the commission to ask it to resolve any anomalies arising from the application of multiple agreements. All parties will also have the right to make submissions to the commission in relation to any proposed orders. </para><para>The opposition have criticised the government, but we say to them that the bill also allows parties to agree amongst themselves to bring an agreement to an end or to vary it as suits their needs. Hence, workers do not lose their democratic right to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, all existing rights of appeal under the act in relation to commission decisions will be available where the commission orders the terms of agreement to be varied or brought to an end. The government believe that this bill is in the interests of both business and employees and we reject any suggestions that have been raised that the current proposals are unfair.</para><para>The commission's powers to make orders in relation to certified agreements and transmitted businesses can only be exercised on a case by case basis and on the application of affected parties. The government has deliberately not sought to confine the commission's discretion in dealing with these matters in order to maximise its flexibility in devising solutions to what are frequently difficult and complex issues. We neither expect nor want the commission to exercise its power under the new provisions in a way which is unfair to employees of transmitted businesses or to incoming employees. Protection of employees is ensured by giving employees the right to make submissions to the commission if an order is sought.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of the bill in Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>13374</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title><page.no>13374</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>13374</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>—Order!

The protocol sets basic standards for questioning undertaken by ASIO. These important new powers for ASIO have been over 16 months in the making. Even after the bill was passed in June 2003 it took the Attorney-General another six weeks to table the protocol. Perhaps if the government had not tried to play politics with the ASIO bill and Australia's national security, our security services could have had their new powers over a year ago. </para><para>The protocol tabled today sets out the minimum standards for many matters, including the manner and conditions of questioning by ASIO; the facilities used by ASIO for questioning; and the provision of meals, rest breaks, sleep and facilities for religious observance and personal hygiene. Importantly, the protocol protects the person being questioned. It also protects the integrity of the interviewing process by ensuring independent supervision and a secure videotaping regime. Because this protocol is finally in place, the general public can now be confident that a person will be treated humanely when being questioned; but it must always be noted when we talk about matters relating to the ASIO bill that the ASIO bill introduced by the government in March 2002 had no rules at all governing the custody of a person being questioned and no rules governing the behaviour of ASIO or the police when questioning that person.</para><para>The protocol tabled today by the Attorney-General has come about because Labor has insisted upon it. The Senate, of course, pressured the government into providing these safeguards. I want to be very clear on this point. Under the government's preferred legislation, introduced in March last year, there were no rules on how long a person could be continually questioned, no rules on where a person would be questioned, no rules on the handling of minors and no rules to ensure a person could eat, sleep or go to the toilet. There was simply a black hole into which a child, potentially, could indefinitely disappear, with only an interrogator from ASIO for company. This is the sort of unacceptable regime that the Attorney-General, the so-called first law officer of the land, was willing to contemplate. I said before and I say again that he really ought to hang his head in shame.</para><para>That is why Labor insisted on a protocol and, of course, on those other strong safeguards. Remember that these people being questioned may not be suspected of being terrorists. They may have information pertaining to terrorism and they may well want to help authorities with their inquiries. So why drag them into some sort of legal void without basic courtesies? That is why the Labor Party fought tooth and nail to improve the ASIO bill to make it more acceptable. The protocols are part of the fruits of months and months of committee work and negotiation. The government's preferred model for questioning procedures was, like so much in the original ASIO bill, extreme and completely out of place in a democracy. Thankfully, the Senate passed many amendments to strengthen the protection of civil liberties and democratic values while at the same time increasing ASIO's effectiveness in its job of tracking down terrorists. Almost all of the safeguards in the bill were insisted on by Labor and the Senate, and opposed by the government. Once again, I say the opposition and the Senate have done their job in tempering the excesses of this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13375</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no question that the protocols we are looking at here this evening have gone some considerable way towards improving the ASIO legislation as it was first introduced. I think it was quite a significant failure on the part of the government not to have considered this procedure in the first instance. Notwithstanding that, the Australian Democrats still maintain that the ASIO powers are extensive and invasive. They contravene the rights and liberties of individual Australians. We Democrats maintain our opposition to these powers but now that they have been enacted—indeed proclaimed, I understand—we reiterate the fundamental importance of ensuring that there are clear guidelines governing their exercise.</para></talk.start><para>Moreover, the process for developing those guidelines must be transparent. The government's actions in developing this protocol were reminiscent of the secret backroom deals that it negotiated with the opposition to secure the passage of the legislation that we now have. While the draft protocol was provided to the opposition prior to, or at least during, debate on the legislation, it has never formally been provided to the Australian Democrats or those of us on the crossbench. I think that is particularly disturbing given the government's insistence that this document not be subject to disallowance and Labor's decision to accept that as a part of the deal. </para><para>While the Democrats welcome many of the provisions in the protocol and concede that it sets out important protections for those who might be detained by ASIO, our concern remains that the government is at liberty to make changes to the protocol if, for example, it finds that some of the requirements are too inconvenient for ASIO officers to comply with. If the government does decide to go down that path of changing aspects of the protocol, there is nothing that this parliament can do to stop it.</para><para>We Democrats reiterate our concern that the documents make no provision for individuals who are detained by ASIO to have access to legal aid if they are unable to afford a lawyer, despite earlier intimations from the government that that would be the case. Just in the last few days there has been some discussion and some debate in the media as to who would be required to meet the administrative costs for security clearances for lawyers representing those individuals who are detained by ASIO, given that it is now a requirement for such legal people to go through a security clearance process. It would appear that lawyers, who are in any event bound by legal professional privilege, will be required to pay up to $1,500 for that security clearance.</para><para>In summary, we Democrats welcome the positive aspects in the protocols, particularly in relation to ensuring that people have appropriate sleeping conditions, hours of sleep, food and accommodation—the essential elements of dignity and human rights that we would expect in a civilised country. Notwithstanding that, we reiterate our concern that such protocols were not a part of the broader debate, were not transparent and accessible during the discussion, are not disallowable by the parliament and are therefore open to the government to change without any response or recourse from the parliament, do not contain the details which they ought to in relation to access to legal aid for detainees and still leave unanswered this question of the $1,500 expense for lawyers. In that sense, I think perhaps the clumsy way in which the protocols have come about through the process of the Senate—and we must remember always that it was the Senate which was able to do this through its powers and operations—has left us with the reasonably unsatisfactory way in which we have dealt with this situation after the event, as it were, after the legislation has passed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13376</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You will remember, Acting Deputy President, that during the debate on the legislation—which increased enormously the powers of ASIO to arraign people from the Australian community and hold them under arrest for interrogation, even if they were known not to be guilty or were not even suspected of any criminal offence—the Greens pushed very strongly for the protocol about handling people in detention to be then brought before the Senate for discussion. It was not. It is a failure of process that this protocol is now issued as a document. It should have been dealt with by the Senate and by the committee of the Senate at the time that the legislation was being dealt with. The document is, at first look, a simple and expected outline of the procedures that would be required for questioning a subject. It leaves quite a lot to the circumstances and conditions that the subject who is being arrested and questioned finds themself in. </para></talk.start><para>Some closer study of this protocol would be required before a final comment can be made on it. But let us never forget that the legislation which Labor supported the government in passing through this Senate just a few short weeks ago broke all previous established standards in relation to the upholding of the freedoms and expected liberties in our democracy. I simply reiterate that that legislation, and therefore this protocol, will be used against citizens who are guilty of nothing, who can be taken off the street, from their workplace, from their home or from anywhere else without notice and without notification of their loved ones. Under this protocol they can be held for up to a week, interrogated for blocks of four hours without interruption and put under enormous duress without their own selected legal support if a so-called prescribed authority deems it.</para><para>The legislation remains no less repugnant because of the protocol that is before the parliament today. The Labor Party should not forget that; many people in the community will not. The potential is wide open, through that legislation passed by both the big parties in this Senate, to infringe upon the civil liberties of law-abiding, innocent Australian citizens—including journalists, doctors, priests and other people who may have information about somebody else that ASIO wants to get hold of—in a way which I would have never thought possible. It is repugnant legislation. Both the government and the opposition should be ashamed that it passed this parliament. It did not need to go to that excess. Equivalent legislation in other countries which are similar to our own— New Zealand, Britain and even the United States—does not trespass on the rights of citizens the way this legislation trespasses on the rights of innocent Australians. No protocol now brought before the Senate—and it should have been here weeks ago—is going to alter that fact.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>13377</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Order!

They were an article by Mr McManus entitled `MP fixers make pension agony' and an editorial titled `Not so super retirement'. These two articles responded to the recent report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation entitled <inline font-style="italic">Planning for retirement</inline>, which was tabled out of session on 29 July 2003. I wish to place on the record my profound disappointment at those inaccuracies and the tenor of those two articles. They made a number of outrageous and erroneous statements which I, on behalf of the committee, strongly refute.</para></talk.start><para>In his article `MP fixers make pension agony', Mr McManus stated that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended the axing of lump sum payments and the conversion of all superannuation savings into an annuity on retirement. The majority of the government and Democrats senators made no such recommendation. The committee majority recommended that the government move in future to make retirees convert a portion—not all—of their pre-retirement savings into a complying annuity. In making this recommendation, the committee majority noted that such a move would need to be accompanied by transitional arrangements over a long period of time. Furthermore, the committee majority indicated that the move to require retirees to convert a portion of their pre-retirement savings into a complying annuity should only come at a time in the future when the superannuation savings had increased significantly above the current average of approximately $65,000. </para><para>I also wish to indicate my disappointment at the statement of support in the McManus article attributed to Mr Daryl Dixon. In particular, Mr Dixon made the following statement:</para><quote><para>He described the proposed measure as madness. “They are living in dreamland, and any government that tried to do it would be committing political suicide,” he said.</para></quote><para>As I have already indicated, the committee did not make a recommendation, as claimed in the article, for the axing of lump sum payments and the conversion of all superannuation articles into an annuity on retirement. Mr Dixon lent weight to the article, and the manner in which he lent weight I think was disappointing. Mr Dixon subsequently wrote to me and said he was not responsible for what the newspaper might say, which seemed to be an unusual situation when lending support.</para><para>The committee devoted a chapter to the reform of complying annuities, suggesting making them wider and more attractive to retirees on the one hand and the providers on the other. The committee majority anticipated that under these sorts of revised arrangements retirees could then mix and match between lifetime annuities, allocated fixed term annuities and growth pensions according to their individual circumstances and risk profiles. For example, certain retirees for personal reasons such as their health may not want to purchase a lifetime annuity but would be better served by a fixed term annuity where term annuities and remaining capital can be left to the estate.</para><para>In a sense, we were quite disappointed at that article. As I have already indicated, the committee did not make such a recommendation. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Sun</inline> editorial came a little closer to the mark when it noted that the committee had recommended that lump sum payments should be limited rather than eradicated but referred to the article prominently displayed on page 4. Again, the editorial argued that the proposed move would be retrospective. This was despite the committee's statement that the move to require retirees to convert a portion of their retirement savings into complying annuities should come only at a time in the future when superannuation savings had increased significantly from the current average of $65,000. Even in 10, 20 or 30 years time there will always be retirees who have small amounts in their superannuation accounts for various reasons, such as health or coming into the system late et cetera, and there was no intention that those small amounts would ever be required to convert to a lump sum. We are talking about a substantial lift in the amount in the superannuation account before you would ever contemplate this move to annuities.</para><para>As a result of these erroneous articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, we received numbers of letters from Australians, particularly those approaching retirement, who were concerned that their retirement plans were being completely overturned. I have responded to these letters and those who have got back to me have thought that the committee's position was perfectly reasonable. I do regret the inaccuracies. They were also taken up by a number of radio commentators. I do believe that newspapers of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline><inline font-style="italic">'</inline>s standing have an obligation to inform the public accurately of important parliamentary reports, particularly those which have implications for Australia's future retirement system. They can do great harm if they inaccurately or possibly mischievously report. There is no reason they should take this particular line.  </para><para>I note that the Australian Press Council's principle No. 1 states that newspapers and magazine publications should not publish what they know, or could reasonably be expected to know, is false or fail to take reasonable steps to check the accuracy of what they said in a report. They were in breach of principle No. 1. Following the publication of the McManus article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, I wrote to the editor expressing my extreme disappointment at the inaccuracies and the thrust of the article. I note that yesterday the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> belatedly, 10 days after the event, published some extracts from my letter at page 17 in the `Letters to the editor' column under the title `Lump sum ban not on the agenda'. I wish to acknowledge the statement in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. However, in publishing extracts from my letter, it failed to honour item 2 of the principles laid down by the Australian Press Council—that is, that the publication should make amends for publishing information that is found to be harmfully inaccurate by printing promptly and with appropriate prominence such retraction, correction, explanation or apology as will neutralise the damage so far as possible. I note that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline> in publishing my letter on page 17 under the heading `Lump sum ban not on the agenda', failed to acknowledge the inaccuracies of the articles— merely, their view, my view—which were based on a false premise. In doing so, they have caused a lot of agony. In truth, their word `agony' is correct, but it is as a result of their action and not as a result of what we produced. </para><para>I feel so strongly about these matters that I raise them tonight in the federal parliament. I do believe that freedom of the press involves obligations towards the people such as accurate reporting in the public interest. I regret that this has not been demonstrated in this article instanced by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Museum of Australia</title><page.no>13379</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13379</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the chamber tonight to speak of the war that the Howard government has been waging on Australia's cultural institutions. In the most recent revelation a secret report has exposed that the National Museum of Australia is the latest target in a spiteful and dishonest undercover cultural war. It is revealed that the Howard government has embarked upon a well thought out act of deliberate and deceitful sabotage which began back in 2001. </para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister himself commissioned the 250-page funding review in the museum's first year of operation in 2001. The report was supposed to determine adequate funding levels for the museum beyond its first year of operation. This report, however, was never released to the public. Instead it took the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper a year-long battle to obtain it under the Freedom of Information Act. Given the information that the report contained, it is no wonder that the Howard government want to keep it quiet. This report has revealed that the coalition is intent on letting the National Museum of Australia slowly bleed to death. It has knowingly provided funding at unsustainably low levels.</para><para>The report's findings warned that if the National Museum was funded insufficiently it would lead to rapidly declining visitor numbers and a significant downgrade in exhibitions. The report recommended three funding options. The first, which the report refers to as option A, would cost an additional $15.520 million and enable the museum to deliver the vision approved by the government in the 1998-99 budget context. Option B, costing an additional $12.593 million, and the option which the report recommended as the preferred option, represented a service level that provided the potential for the museum to work towards a stronger leadership role through exhibitions, public programs and the use of new technologies—but not really achieving the vision that was laid out for it in the initial budget appropriations. However, the report did point out that this option did not provide the capacity to fully develop that innovative role indicated in that original vision. The third option, the option that was in fact chosen by the government, costing $9.138 million, spelled out the disastrous impact this option would have on the museum. I will quote directly from the report. On page 5 of volume 1 it states: </para><quote><para>Option C represents a significant downgrading in the level of exhibitions and programs provided in the museum's opening year and permits only limited work on developing the new media technologies which are integral to the museum's operations. Adoption of this option would not sustain the standard and level of services envisaged in the original government decision to construct the museum and demonstrated by the museum since its opening in March 2001.</para></quote><para>It cannot be any clearer. I canvass this in such detail because it reveals so much about the Howard government's carefully devised plan. In fact, the timing of this report explains much of the behaviour and puts it into the context of this broad attack on the museum that has come from the other side of this chamber in the past two years. The forced outing of this report reveals what is in fact the fourth instalment of the Howard government attacks on the National Museum of Australia. There is a question about which comes first. The timing of this report predates a number of the other attacks, which I will now outline, that the National Museum of Australia has endured.</para><para>There was the carping, subjective criticisms about the museum's portrayal of Australian cultural history by members of the museum council, who include the Prime Minister's authorised biographer, David Barnett, and his former speechwriter, Christopher Pearson. In fact, Professor Graeme Davison was asked in March 2002—one month after the funding review committee reported in February 2002—to assess complaints made by Mr Barnett in an internal memo. The complaints included that the museum's stolen children exhibit was a `victim episode'. In December 2002, the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp, quietly announced that the museum's inaugural director, Ms Dawn Casey, had had her reappointment unreasonably shortened. Dawn Casey has contributed an extraordinary amount, including seeing this museum come to fruition on behalf of the citizens of this country. What a disgraceful way to repay such a fine contribution by foreshortening that appointment. It should have been three years; it was one year. It comes to an end in I believe December this year.</para><para>The Howard government engineered a review of the National Museum, culminating in a frightening report which advocates censorship of the museum's exhibits. At the time of this report's release there was a bit of debate in the museums and arts community as to whether this report was really that bad. Of course it was couched in the polite language of a political knife job. It was a knife job that we now know, from what Ms Casey has put on the public record, has had an impact on the National Museum's ability to mount and host the sorts of exhibitions that the National Museum thinks appropriate and reflective of our cultural history. What it has led to of course is a whitewashing—and that is a polite way of saying censoring—of Australia's cultural heritage and the way it is expressed in this institution. </para><para>Finally, going back to this latest secret report, it is further evidence of the degree to which the Howard government is deliberately sabotaging the museum. So across all of these events this report was having its effect: these unsustainably low funding levels were being applied. As a local citizen, and having been to the museum many times, the explanation for not proceeding with some of the temporary exhibitions and for doing things a little differently was not clear to me. Now it is all so clear why those things were being wound back. I think this series of events that we are now able to observe forms a cohesive picture of sabotage over a lengthy period of time and is nothing short of a national disgrace.</para><para>The National Museum of Australia now has the dubious distinction of formally joining the ABC as a target and victim of the Howard government's secret war against independent cultural institutions in this country. It was with such fanfare that the Howard government stood on those steps of the museum and opened it as this incredible monument to everything it is to be an Australian. To have then been followed by this disgusting campaign against the integrity of this institution is absolutely unforgivable.</para><para>I would like to join everyone who, since this has become so clear, has come to the defence of the National Museum's cultural independence and their ability to continue to operate as a fine institution—not to be sabotaged, not to be undermined, not to be interfered with, not to be politically censored. What does it say about Australians that we cannot sustain institutions in a civil society that are true to our past and our history and our culture? That is what we are dealing with. While senators on the other side of the chamber laugh, I would like to remind them that it is the institutions of this country that, ironically, the coalition likes to hold up as their flame. How ironic is it that this despicable campaign has been auspiced by the Prime Minister himself.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reserve Bank of Australia</title><page.no>13381</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>13381</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take this opportunity in the adjournment debate this evening to refer to the activities of the Reserve Bank of Australia. In particular, I want to refer to a speech that the Governor of the Reserve Bank gave at the Business Council of Australia's annual dinner in Melbourne on 8 July and also to a press release that the Reserve Bank issued yesterday in relation to a statement on monetary policy.</para></talk.start><para>The governor, on 8 July at the Business Council of Australia's annual dinner, said that he had not been to any of its dinners before and I am assuming that was correct. I do not know where in Melbourne it was held. I am assuming at some point during the evening, as the lads and lasses were toasting themselves over a good bottle of port or wine, the Governor of the Reserve Bank lauded the situation that, in this country, as far as he was concerned, economic policy over the last 20 years had resulted in a number of good things having occurred. One of them was labour market deregulation. In one of his points, he says:</para><quote><para>Labour market deregulation. The main change here was to decentralise, i.e. to move away from a system based on a National Wage Case which awarded every worker a given percentage rise once a year (or, in earlier times, once a quarter). The labour force looks a lot different today with a considerably smaller proportion working for the government, and a small proportion unionised.</para></quote><para>This is the independent Governor of the Reserve Bank. He further goes on in his speech to say of the results of decentralisation and deregulation:</para><quote><para>They have resulted in a myriad of small changes— </para></quote><para>I will emphasise that—</para><quote><para>occurring almost continually, rather than a few large ones. So the economy today shows more day-to-day volatility but is less likely to build up the pressure that results in crises and large disruptive adjustments.</para></quote><para>I do not know what country Ian Macfarlane and the Reserve Bank members live in.</para><para>We have been involved in an inquiry into poverty and financial hardship in this country. On a number of occasions, organisations have mentioned the difficulty that the other Australia are having in trying to clothe and feed their children and pay their power bills. One of the things that has come through on each occasion that these organisations have reported to us has been the effects of labour market deregulation. Let me talk about one aspect of it: overtime. A survey done by Irving Saulwick and Associates found that there was more unpaid overtime in 2002 than ever before and that it has overtaken the hours all the people who are registered as unemployed would have worked in that year—that is, 47 per cent of overtime worked in 2002 was unpaid. That is one of these great market deregulation situations.</para><para>We have these ideologues like Mr Macfarlane and the Reserve Bank board who say, `This is a great thing to look towards.' We have seen in our inquiry, the report of which we will present shortly to the Senate, the rise of inequality and poverty in this country. We have seen, particularly over the last 10 years, the rise of casual, part-time and temporary employment. Casual, part-time or temporary employment is no longer a stepping stone to full-time employment. It is no longer a guarantee for wage justice, security and dignity. Yet this is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said in July to his mates in the Business Council of Australia. As I said earlier, you could almost hear them clinking their port glasses as he made this pronouncement.</para><para>We have seen this insecurity of hours and the crisis it causes among low-paid people. As I said earlier, in terms of the rise in casual employment, in 1982, 14 per cent of the work force was casual; in 1999, 26.4 per cent of the work force was casual. There is a decline in full-time employment and this has occurred because the restraints placed on employers through the arbitration system have been whittled away. Deregulation has taken away full-time employment. This has ensured that there are more and more people asking for assistance from the government. You cannot say that this is a great thing for this country because the men and women who have appeared before our inquiry into poverty and financial hardship have said on any number of occasions that they do not necessarily want to have government assistance but they need it to make ends meet.</para><para>They need it to clothe, educate and feed their children and to pay their power bills. Any number of witnesses have said to us how much they have had to do without to make sure their children are looked after. We have had any number of instances where children were told there was no breakfast for them before they went to school. On every occasion we have had before us casual, part-time and temporary workers who said that, if they had the chance of full-time employment, they would grasp it with both hands and gladly come off being on some sort of government assistance. But that chance is not there because of the ideological pursuit of the government and also the paid lackeys on the Reserve Bank board.</para><para>Yesterday the Reserve Bank put out a statement on monetary policy. It said that we are in trouble because we owe too much debt and have too much credit. Let me tell you about the men and women who have appeared before the inquiry. As I have said, we will have an opportunity to speak further about this when we present our report. Credit card debt amongst people who cannot afford to make ends meet is skyrocketing. We have had plenty of examples given to us of men and women who are borrowing from credit card to credit card to make sure that they can make ends meet. We have heard of people falling into the credit trap. We have heard of people who were so pressed because of the uncertainty of work that they went to payday lenders. </para><para>Why isn't that registering with these geniuses in the Reserve Bank? It is because it is not their Australia. It is not the Australia they identify with. The men and women they no doubt see who are in these predicaments are the taxi drivers, the cleaners or the waiters who serve them. This is not their Australia; they have no idea. If Mr Macfarlane wants to find out why Australians are having some sort of credit problems, why doesn't he ask them? Why doesn't he stop going to his mates in the Business Council of Australia and saying that great things are happening as a result of economic policy and that there has only been a myriad of small changes rather than large ones. This myriad of small changes shows in the two million people who cannot make ends meet and, in one form or another, are in need of government assistance.</para><para>I raise this in the Senate tonight because I found it very offensive that these cowards did not even have Macfarlane make a statement or issue a press release. In July this year he gave a talk to his Business Council of Australia mates, but not more than a month or so beforehand we had the Brotherhood of St Laurence before my committee in Melbourne making a plea on behalf of those people who are not winners in this economy. They were saying that one of the things they have identified as contributing to poverty and financial hardship is labour deregulation—something Mr Macfarlane mentioned in his speech, and that is a disgrace.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Property</title><page.no>13383</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13383</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak this evening to the proposed sell-off of Point Nepean Defence land. It is my understanding that there will be an announcement by the government soon on its intention to sell 91.8 hectares of Defence land at Point Nepean, which is commonly known to Victorians as a national treasure, a unique blend of cultural and natural heritage on the doorstep of Melbourne.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats take this opportunity to urge the government to choose an option from the expressions of interest that will keep this land in public ownership. That is a simple request. Why is this important? This land has some of the most important heritage in Victoria: the Quarantine Station and Norris Barracks area with its 19th century and early 20th century buildings, the grave sites of early shipwrecked settlers and around 50 hectares of threatened coastal moonah woodlands. It is beautiful and extremely rare.</para><para>The Victorian National Parks Association and the National Trust of Australia in Victoria have joined forces to work with the Vic-tor-ian community to keep Point Nepean in public hands, and I congratulate them for their campaigning efforts. They have formally requested the return of the Defence land to Victoria, to be included within a reborn Point Nepean National Park and managed by Parks Victoria in partnership with the community and the Point Nepean Living Museum, which would protect, manage and restore the built heritage precinct. In the process, it would provide many environmental, economic and social benefits, including those associated with research, education, conservation, management, tourism, employment and training. The state government says that it will cover the ongoing management and restoration costs at Point Nepean and include all the Defence land within the national park once it is returned to Victoria. </para><para>I would like to be optimistic about the government making a decision to keep this land in public ownership and to sign off on a proposal that has very wide public support. However, the responses to those people who have written to their local federal MPs and to the minister are not encouraging and what I want to point out tonight is that they are also not truthful. The Victorian National Parks Association and the Victorian National Trust have received a lot of responses that people have had from ministers and MPs, as well as those they have received themselves, and they have prepared a response to some of the claims that were made in those letters, emails and telephone calls. I think this ought to be on the public record, and that is why I am doing so tonight.</para><para>People were told that the Commonwealth government has banned housing on Point Nepean. This is simply not true. Subdivision into allotments is permissible around the dwellings and other buildings that are currently on the site and, presumably, they could be sold again separately for further subdivision. It will be possible to subdivide allotments for use as hotels, conference facilities, education establishments, tourist accommodation and other so-called non-residential purposes. This would split the land into smaller and smaller blocks, with further fragmentation of management and control— something I think we should avoid at all costs.</para><para>When the government talks about banning residential development, it does not mean short-term tourist accommodation. We would argue that 100 new houses, or 100 new holiday apartments or cabins, pose the same environmental and cultural risks and impacts on Point Nepean. They will in fact be quite similar, if not exactly the same.</para><para>People have been told that the Commonwealth has protected Point Nepean's bushland. Again, that is not so. The 50 hectares of coastal moonah woodland, the threatened vegetation community found behind the Quarantine Station, is up for sale. Coastal moonah woodland is listed as threatened under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and it is quite unclear as to whether that act will have the protection that Victorians would like to see for that woodland. People were told that the Commonwealth would clean up all unexploded ordnance and give 205 hectares of cliff-top land to the state for a national park.</para><para>The point to be made is that the Department of Defence created the problem of unexploded ordnances and it is only right and proper that it should clean it up. It is also worth mentioning here that the proposed clean-up includes extensive use of fire, and there are significant concerns that that fire will impact on native flora and fauna and lead to long-term problems for weed and erosion management that will inevitably become the financial responsibility of the Victorian state government.</para><para>People were told that the Commonwealth government will give the 20 hectares of cliff-top land at Police Point to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council for open space. Indeed, that does appear to be the case. However, what needs to be pointed out is that this further fragments land management, and it would not appear to be protected by any caveats, covenants or other mechanisms. We could have a situation in which the local council finds the management of this land to be burdensome and difficult, and there would be nothing at all to stop them selling it off in the future.</para><para>The sale by the Department of the Defence of Point Nepean would create at least three separate areas under three different managers for three different purposes: a national park managed by Parks Victoria, Police Point managed by the council, and exclusive ownership, management and use of the quarantine station by private and commercial operators. </para><para> People have been told that the Commonwealth is spending $4 million on the restoration of the Norris Barracks and heritage precinct. This is very welcome. There will still be considerable costs associated with the restoration and upgrade of the built heritage area. Gladly the state government has committed to covering those costs but, again, not mentioned by those MPs who responded to these letters.</para><para>People are told that the Commonwealth government's approach is consistent with the Portsea Defence Land Community Master Plan prepared by the community based Community References Group. Again, no. The master plan's vision for Point Nepean is for `A public park managed as a whole and integrated with the Point Nepean coastal and marine environments to enhance its special sense of place'. In contrast, the selling of Point Nepean will disintegrate the ownership and management of the land; threaten the fabric, integrity, spatial association and sense of place of the quarantine station buildings; and privatise the ownership and/or management of what is currently publicly owned and managed foreshore. We are talking here about actual beach and foreshore. It needs to be pointed out that almost all of Victoria's foreshore is in Crown land and it is publicly accessible. Senator Hill said that this privatisation of the beach and the likelihood of beachfront development was a reasonable balance because there was public access elsewhere. The sell-off will encourage linear development and overdevelopment along the shoreline of this national coastal treasure. That is completely inappropriate. It will contradict the underlying principles of the Victorian coastal strategy. In contrast to this, the Victorian community expression of interest in Point Nepean upholds the principles of the community master plan, the Victorian coastal strategy and the spirit and practice of proper coastal planning and management. It will prevent exclusive use, incremental development, ad hoc planning and the setting of what is a very dangerous precedent for Victorian and, one would argue, even Australian coastlines.</para><para>Again, people are being told that the Commonwealth has established stringent environmental and heritage conditions for the sale of the Defence land at Point Nepean. That is not so. The heritage conditions are in fact very weak and environmental conditions are not described. The heritage conditions could allow numerous new buildings in the built heritage precinct, and the development of the area's threatened coastal Moonah woodlands as well as the extensive playing fields.</para><para>Substantive studies recommended by heritage experts are urgently needed to properly assess the impact of proposals for Point Nepean, but they have not been done and there is no sign that they will be. It appears that there will be no assessment of environmental impacts and ecological sustainability issues associated with the use of the site—issues such as access provision, traffic, water management, energy conservation, coastal protection, crowding and the numbers of site visitors that might come with the development being proposed. The heritage conditions, no matter how weak or strong they are, should be just one element of a comprehensive environmental analysis of the individual and cumulative impacts of proposed uses at Point Nepean.</para><para>The letters go at some length to talk about the Victorian government buying the land from the Commonwealth in 1988 and why not now, and the Victorian government declining an offer on the land at Point Nepean in 2001, suggesting that the Victorian state government is not really interested. Again that is not true. It was Premier Kennett who was first offered the land who did not in fact respond to that. I do not have time to go into that, but there are many flaws in these responses that should be corrected by the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Reply</title><page.no>13386</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13386</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In closing the adjournment debate tonight I take the opportunity to refer to Senator Lundy's quite emotive speech—emotive claptrap I might call it. Senator Lundy is always full of conspiracy theories and has this very black outlook on life. Everything always seems to be wrong to Senator Lundy. She referred to the National Museum of Australia and used words such as the Howard government `attacking cultural institutions'. She also said that the Howard government was allowing it to bleed to death. She further referred to the Commonwealth government `deliberately sabotaging the museum'. </para></talk.start><para>Of course, Senator Lundy nicely overlooked, as she very often does, the fact that the Labor Party actually promised for decades to build the National Museum of Australia. They were in power for 13 years and did not lift a finger to construct the National Museum. I think they went to every election promising the people of Canberra and, indeed, the people of Australia that they would construct an Australian National Museum. They never did a thing. It had to await the advent of the Howard government to actually construct a truly national museum for Australia. It is a museum of which all of us on this side of the parliament are extremely proud. We are particularly proud that after decades of talking about a national museum it was the Howard government that actually provided the funding and the planning to construct the National Museum of Australia.</para><para>Senator Lundy's emotive claptrap, all her conspiracy theories and all her quite difficult language come to nought when you place them against the facts. As always, it is in fact the coalition government—the Howard government—and the current Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, who is doing a marvellous job in this area, that have shown real commitment rather than rhetoric when it comes to supporting arts in Australia.</para><para>Senator Hutchins also spoke on the adjournment debate and I was distressed at his personal attack on individuals who are not in this chamber to defend themselves. He quite viciously and personally attacked Mr Macfarlane—a great Australian, a very able man and one who has played his part in getting the economy of this nation heading in the right way. Certainly the Howard government are well recognised, both domestically and internationally, for the work we have done on the economy. But Mr Macfarlane, in his independent role in the Reserve Bank, has contributed to the way we are today. The name-calling from Senator Hutchins, which is what passes for policy debate in the Labor Party these days, is to be deplored. In fact, I would have thought Senator Hutchins's remarks showed that he was making a bid for the role of the shadow spokesman for finance, Senator Conroy, and that he might have been eyeing off your job—as I understand so many are these days.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Always!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—But I have to say to you, Senator Conroy, that after hearing Senator Hutchins I do not think you need fear anything from him: he has even less substance in his comments than you do—and that is saying something, if I might say that in a friendly way. What Senator Hutchins forgot to mention, in his rhetoric about how bad the economy is, was the very substantial rise in standards of living in Australia. He forgot to mention the dramatic fall in unemployment and the rise in employment under the Howard government. And of course he and most Labor commentators today desperately want to forget the days when Labor ran the government and home owners were paying 17 per cent interest on their home loans, businessmen were paying 22 per cent on loans—if they could get them—and many were paying 27 per cent to private lenders. What Labor people just cannot bear to think of these days is that, instead of ordinary home owners—and, I suspect, many of us in this chamber—paying 17 per cent on their housing loans, people nowadays are paying four, five, six or seven per cent. Under the policies we have adopted we have made ownership of your own home quite feasible and possible in Australia. I just thought I should correct the record on those couple of comments and thank all those who participated in the adjournment debate. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.48 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13387</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>13387</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Australian Security Intelligence Organ</inline><inline font-style="italic">--</inline><inline font-style="italic">isation Act 1979</inline>—Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Protocol— Procedures to be followed in the exercise of authority under warrants issued under section 34D of the Act.</para><para>Judge Advocate General—Report for 2002.</para><para>Murray-Darling Basin Commission— Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Treaties—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline>—Text, together with national interest analysis and annexures—</para><para>Agreement between Australia and the Kingdom of Belgium on the Gainful Employment of Certain Dependants of Diplomatic and Consular Personnel, done at Sydney on 19 November 2002. </para><para>Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium on “Working Holiday” Arrangements (Canberra, 20 November 2002).</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline>—Text, together with national interest analysis and annexures—Protocol, done at Sydney on 30 June 2003, concerning the Bougainville Transition Team made pursuant to the Agreement, done at Port Moresby on 5 December 1997, between Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu concerning the Neutral Truce Monitoring Group for Bougainville, as amended by the Protocol, done at Port Moresby on 29 April 1998</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>13387</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act—</para><para>Child Care Benefit (Breach of Conditions for Continued Approval) Amendment Determination 2003 (No. 1).</para><para>Child Care Benefit (Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval) Amendment Determination 2003 (No. 2).</para><para>Housing Assistance Act—House Assistance (Form of Agreement) Determination 2003.</para><para>National Health Act—</para><para>Declarations Nos PB 8-PB 11 of 2003.</para><para>Determination No. PB 12 of 2003.</para><para>Social Security Act—Social Security (Specified Class of Persons in Australia in Specified Circumstances—Health Care Card) Declaration 2003. </para><para>Social Security (Administration) Act— Social Security (Dependants—Concession Cards) Declaration 2003.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>13388</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 20 June 2001, as amended on 27 September 2001:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 January to 30 June 2003—Statements of compliance—Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio agencies—</para><para>Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.</para><para>AusAID.</para><para>Australia-Japan Foundation.</para><para>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>13389</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Staffing</title><page.no>13389</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 664)</subtitle><id.no>664</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13389</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 September 2002:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 2889 (House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 22 June 1998, p.5112):</para><para>(1)	What is the: (a) peacetime establishment;

The Woomera detention centre is located three kilometres south of the Woomera airfield, directly under the extended centreline for the main runway which is aligned north/south. As such, any aircraft approaching Woomera airfield from the south or taking off towards the South will unavoidably pass over, or very close to, the Woomera detention centre.</para><para>(2)	An extensive examination of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) records, has identified at least 560 flights into or out of Woomera during the period 1999-2002. These records do not indicate the number of flights that overflew the detention centre.</para><para>(3)	(a)	RAAF records do not contain information on altitudes of overflying aircraft.  </para><para>(b)	Types of aircraft that have conducted operations at Woomera during the period are F/A-18 Hornet, C-130 Hercules, P3 Orion, B200 Super Kingair, PC9, S70A Blackhawk, UH1H Iroquois, BAe 748, Falcon 900 and Boeing 737. Royal Air Force Tornado aircraft also operated from Woomera during August 2000.</para><para>(4)	RAAF aircraft may overfly other detention centres while following Air Traffic Control instructions during departure from or approach to a number of airfields or while en-route. In particular, the contingency facility at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin is close to Darwin airfield and would likely be overflown by some aircraft approaching or departing Darwin. In addition, the facility at Singleton could be overflown by aircraft operating in the Singleton Range training airspace.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Depleted Uranium</title><page.no>13434</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1622)</subtitle><id.no>1622</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13434</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 July 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the April 2003 `Handbook of Military Medical Operations Medical Management of Radiological Casualties' produced by the United States (US) Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute and, in particular, pages 59 and 60 relating to depleted uranium (DU): </para><para>(1)	Was the Government made aware of this handbook and its instructions prior to sending Australian troops to Iraq.</para><para>(2)	Did the Government request advice from the US Administration prior to deployment with regard to DU exposure; if so, can details of these requests be provided; if not, why not.</para><para>(3)	Is there an equivalent Australian Defence Force handbook dealing with DU exposure; if not, why not; if so, can a copy be provided.</para><para>(4)	(a) Has the Government been informed of the likelihood of Australian troops or members of the Australian media having been exposed to DU; if not, when is this advice expected; and (b) what are the medical implications of waiting for this advice before conducting radiobioassay testing of troops.</para><para>(5)	Were any Australian troops or media personnel provided with the `normally issued chemical protective masks' described in the US handbook; if so, how many and in what circumstances.</para><para>(6)	What tests were done on military and other equipment returning to Australia from Iraq for DU contamination.</para><para>(7)	Were Australian troops warned against souveniring DU munitions or fragments.</para><para>(8)	What checks were made to ensure that such material was not brought back to Australia by troops.</para><para>(9)	Have DU munitions or fragments now been removed from recent operations in Iraq; if not, what measures are in place to guard against Iraqi civilian contamination from souveniring such material.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13435</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	No. The handbook was not released until April 2003, which was after Australian troops had deployed.</para><para>(2)	No.</para><para>(3)	No. However, although not directly dealing with DU, the following publications are used by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for the management of radiological casualties: Health Policy Directive 005 - Initial Medical Procedures for Radiation Accidents and Radioactive Contamination; ADFP 53 - Health Support, Chapter 9 - Health support in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Environments; ADFP 15 - Nuclear, Biological and chemical Defence, Chapter 8 - Medical Support; and ADFP 724 - Ionising Radiation Safety Manual.
