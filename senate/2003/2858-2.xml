Those statistics show that the automotive manufacturing industry is the most heavily government subsidised industry in this country and currently receives around $560 million of taxpayer money every year. Some of that comes from the states and some of it is provided for very good reasons. We do need an auto industry in this country, so I am not complaining about that, but I think it is a very sad situation that, with all that industry assistance, we do not do anything by way of encouraging the production of vehicles that are energy efficient or which operate on clean alternative fuels.</para><para>The Democrats have for some time been critical of the fact that governments, both state and federal, have not leaned more on the auto industry to produce those cars. In fact, in a sense we have gone in the opposite direction. The industry tells me that Australians are not interested in fuel efficiency. This happened when I went to see the Holden E Commodore a couple of years ago. The engineers proudly showed me this hybrid petrol-electric vehicle which could have been put on the production line within a fairly short time frame and which would not have cost all that much in changes to the production line, but they are not going to produce it because, they say, Australians are not interested in fuel efficiency. That vehicle is being used as a demonstration model for component parts and is being taken around the world and shown to numerous people. So, instead of us producing this vehicle in this country, it is just there as some sort of showpiece.</para><para>The reason for this is partly that our petrol is still relatively cheap by OECD standards—I am sure many people will disagree with that, but it is the case that this government stopped indexing petrol taxes a couple of years ago—and that our vehicles are not promoted for their fuel efficiency ratings. I did a quick web site search of Ford, Holden and Toyota yesterday, looking for fuel efficiency data—cars are required to have a fuel efficiency rating on them at the point of sale—but in fact I could not find anything at all from Holden or Toyota. Ford has a kind of cost-saving calculator, if you like, for its dedicated LPG utes. But, for all the need to cut greenhouse emissions and to cut toxic emissions from vehicles, we have not managed to get it across to the manufacturers that this ought to be something that they use as an argument to sell their vehicles. In fact, the efficiency does not appear anywhere. It is very difficult to find out how many litres you need to drive 100 kilometres, which is the measure we use for efficiency. So it is very disappointing. Our auto industry, particularly in comparison with industries in other countries, is way behind the eight ball in promoting fuel efficient vehicles and in developing and manufacturing them. </para><para>I think people are interested in more environmentally sound vehicles, but there does need to be leadership. We do need to have encouragement for many of them to go down that path. Yesterday Senator Minchin asked why we were interested in environment and not focused on safety, for instance. Nobody could disagree with the argument that we should be focused on safety, but we have made enormous gains in safety over the last two decades. Airbags have saved countless lives, better roads have saved lives and cutting down on drink-driving has saved lives. We have put an enormous effort into road safety, but we have done practically nothing about fuel efficiency. Whilst it is very good for our economy and for the thousands of Australian workers who are employed in the auto industry, and whilst it is good that millions of dollars are generated in exports every year, this is very short term if we do not look at fuel efficiency and alternative fuels in particular, because other countries are doing it. Australia is way behind the eight ball if it is going to sit back and say, `Our niche market is to manufacture very large cars for export to the Middle East, and we do not need to worry about fuel efficiency.'</para><para>It is time that the government, when allocating money to industry, applied some sort of criteria. Otherwise we are essentially handing over a blank cheque to industry in the hope that they will stay in this country for the sake of jobs. We believe that those criteria should not only require industry to be environmentally and socially responsible but also encourage industries to be innovative and to develop as a world leader in whatever field it is that they are working in. </para><para>I think most Australians are well aware of the environmental impacts that result from pollution from cars. Every litre of fuel from a conventional motor produces 2.438 kilograms of carbon dioxide. Whilst that does not sound an awful lot, when you consider that three tanks of unleaded petrol produces a quarter of a tonne of CO2 the contribution from the average household towards greenhouse gas emissions from auto transport alone is very significant. We know that our cities suffer enormously from the exhausts from vehicles and we have in this country one of the highest asthma rates in the world for children under the age of 12. That is a symptom of the degree to which our air is clean or not clean. I do not think it is good policy to just accept that cars pollute and let that be the end of it. Auto manufacturers have developed a number of prototype models, as I just said, to demonstrate that cleaner cars are possible to manufacture, but all too often those cars do not make it to the showroom floor—they are not available to people.</para><para>I have a Toyota Prius as my electorate car and that achieves an efficiency rating, on very short trips for most of the time, of 5.4 litres per hundred kilometres. That is roughly a third to a half of what another car that size would produce. Before this car I had a car that used compressed natural gas, but I did not get another because it was almost impossible to refuel that vehicle. There are so few refuelling stations around—there was only one in Melbourne that I could access—that it was not convenient. While we do not have the refuelling sites we will not have people buying these cars and there will be no encouragement for the auto manufacturers to make them. We really have to look at the whole cycle and make sure that those facilities are available.</para><para>As I said earlier, the E Commodore is a hybrid vehicle. It is a bigger vehicle than the Toyota Prius but it can cut emissions by more than half that of a normal Commodore and still have the same performance level. That car remains a prototype. It is a great piece of engineering and a great idea but it is sitting there because we do not put pressure on Holden or any other auto manufacturer to go into production. I am sure they do not necessarily want to do that, and maybe there are other incentives governments should offer. For instance, they could use their purchasing power to say that 20 per cent of government fleets would purchase this vehicle. I think that would be a very good incentive for getting those cars off the production line. There are many ways in which we could use the tax system in order to encourage people to buy such vehicles. So rather than just having a bucket of money that goes to keeping those auto companies in this country we ought to be looking at more innovative ways of making sure that what they make is in our interests. </para><para>A couple of the ideas that we could adopt are flexible registration charges for low emission vehicles, particularly for the corporate sector, and mandating that large companies of a certain size and operating in certain urban areas acquire minimum numbers of low emission vehicles. We could, as I said, establish government purchasing policy to require the acquisition of efficient vehicles by government departments. We could mandate large fuel companies to install minimum quotas of bowsers distributing alternative fuel at petrol stations—just to make sure that consumers like me do not get discouraged because there is only one refuelling place and it is in an awkward location for me personally. We could also look at implementing rebates for individuals who choose to purchase these efficient vehicles—similar to the rebates offered by state governments for the installation of solar hot-water systems. </para><para>They are just some of the ideas that we could adopt and I strongly encourage the government to act on Senator Ridgeway's second reading amendment. I hope the government do not just put it aside as being some loopy idea that the Democrats might have in this place but that they really take on this issue of fuel efficiency in our cars and make sure that our industry is gearing up to be much cleaner, with cars in this country producing much lower greenhouse emissions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15231</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move the amendment now circulated for the Australian Greens which is an amendment to—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—Your amendment is to the second bill, not the first bill which we are debating at the moment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

We are past the second reading and we are now in committee. That might help him to sort it out. Now we have that straight, I will continue. There is very great concern amongst people who are looking at the automobile industry and its impact on the environment. It is a major producer of greenhouse gases and carcinogens—that is, cancer causing agents—in the great cities of the world, including the Australian cities. Their concern is that much more be done to reduce the pollution coming from motor vehicles. But there is a contradiction here between the public impulse to buy bigger and more gas guzzling vehicles and the public wish that vehicles be leaner, cleaner and not a greater impediment to the environment. Opinion polls show that in the United States and I guess it is exactly the same here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Allison has been putting forward to the committee—and I hope the government was listening—a series of measures which ought to be taken up by the government in the absence of any real indication from this government that it understands the environmental impact nearly as well as the public in Australia does.

As I understand it, we are dealing with the <inline ref="">ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and not with the <inline ref="">Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS) Bill 2003</inline> to which Senator Brown has proposed an amendment. Dealing with the first bill, the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003, I do not have a lot to add to the remarks I made last night in my second reading contribution with respect to the second reading amendment moved by the Democrats in relation to environmental matters. I take the opportunity, however, to rebut some of the rather negative comments about the Australian car industry. I think it has done an enormous amount to produce more environmentally friendly fuel efficient vehicles in recent years. It should be applauded for the steps it has taken to produce much more fuel efficient vehicles rather than be criticised. </para></talk.start><para>I pick up the point Senator Brown made about the public's attitude. The point is that an industry like this must be responsive to consumers. That is how capitalism works. You produce products which the consumer wants and if consumers want to buy fuel efficient vehicles there are plenty available for sale and they can purchase them and there is no disincentive to that activity whatsoever. If the public want to buy these vehicles then there are plenty on the market for them to purchase.</para><para>I point out that, by the substantial reduction in tax we have brought about in relation to motor vehicles by removing the wholesale sales tax and replacing it with the GST, motor vehicles are now much cheaper and more affordable. There is no doubt, and it ought to be recognised, that new motor vehicles are infinitely more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than old vehicles. One of the problems in Australia has been the age of the motor vehicle fleet. Everyone understands that older vehicles going back 10, 15 or 20 years are much more fuel inefficient than modern vehicles. The newer the fleet, the less fuel inefficiency and the greater the fuel efficiency; so the more people we can get into newer vehicles the better it is for the environment. </para><para>That is why, if I may foreshadow some remarks I might make in relation to Senator Brown's amendment, making cars more expensive, which is what Senator Brown wants to do, is completely contrary to the interests of ensuring more fuel efficient vehicles on our roads. The newer vehicles are so much more fuel efficient, using much better engine technology and much lighter materials, that we want to do everything we can to encourage Australians to be in newer, more fuel efficient vehicles. That is one of the reasons we foreshadow our rejection of the forthcoming amendment. I do want to acknowledge how much the car industry has done in this country to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicles, working closely with the government. Everything we can do to enable Australians to have newer vehicles which are not only more fuel efficient but a lot safer will produce the objectives the Democrats and the Greens quite properly see. It is obviously a good objective to have much more fuel efficient vehicles on the road. We want to work with the industry but at the end of the day it is a matter for consumers. If they want to buy those vehicles there are plenty on the market for them to buy and the industry will be responsive to that demand.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15233</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to delay this debate but I do need to respond to Senator Minchin. It is not the case that you can buy in this country a hybrid vehicle—petrol-electric vehicle—which has been manufactured here. The Toyota Prius comes from Japan. We do not have vehicles made in this country that are easily purchasable by consumers. A consumer may wish to have a very fuel efficient car. I am not just talking here about engine technology—of course engine technology right around the world has improved energy efficiency; there is no question about that. But the advances are marginal. They are not huge leaps forward, like a 50 per cent or more saving on a car that is otherwise not of that technology. We are talking here about massive leaps in efficiency.</para></talk.start><para>As I said earlier, I had a quick look at web sites last night and had a look at differences in different countries. The US has the Energy Policy Act 1999 that requires federal, state and fuel provider fleets to acquire alternative fuelled vehicles. The result of that is that when you look at the General Motors web site you can see that there are dozens of cars on the market just for natural gas, for instance. I counted 12 vehicles that roll off the production line that run on natural gas. They are both more fuel efficient and cleaner than other vehicles. If you look at ethanol, General Motors Holden makes six vehicles that run on ethanol. That is a mix of 85 per cent ethanol. We do not do that in this country and it is not because consumers have collectively said to themselves, `We do not want to buy fuel efficient vehicles.' It is because we do not have government leadership that encourages the manufacture of them here. It is pure and simple. You cannot blame consumers and say, `Consumers want to buy big cars, big gas guzzlers—they are not interested in fuel efficiency,' if you do not ask them and if you do not give them choices. This government is supposed to be about choices. We hear a lot about choice and how important that is for consumers, but consumers are not being given the choice. I drive my Prius gladly; I love this car and feel proud that it is saving fossil fuels and that it is good for the environment—but it is a very expensive car. It is $40,000 before on-road costs.</para><para>Ordinary people do not have that choice—that is equivalent to an expensive, medium-size car by any measure—whereas if we were manufacturing them here, if Holden had its ECOmmodore on the production line, it would be within the reach of ordinary Australians. So I do not think Senator Minchin can say that it is consumers who are driving the move to stay with big cars and they still are. Plenty of people are buying small cars—that is true—and cars are, generally speaking, getting more fuel efficient, but they are also using more energy with electronic windows and various airconditioning and other comforts and features in cars. Those all use up energy. So it is not quite as clear-cut as he is suggesting. So we really need to look at the incentives that are offered in other countries in order to provide that leadership to shift people to vehicles which are in everybody's interest for them to drive. </para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (ACIS) BILL 2003 </para><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15234</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Greens amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 3099:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 27 (after line 2), before item 156, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">155A Schedule 3 (Chapter 87—Vehicles other than railway or tramway rolling stock, and parts and accessories thereof, after </inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Additional Note 5)</inline></para><para>Add:</para><para>	(5A)	For the purposes of 8704, motor vehicles used for the transport of goods including off-road vehicles may attract concessional rates of duty under Schedule 4 when used wholly or principally in agriculture, mining, construction of public infrastructure or for other specified purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">155B Schedule 3 (subheading 8704.10.00)</inline></para><para>Repeal the rate of duty and the concessional rate in column 3, substitute:

Most of these vehicles come into the country, although some are being produced here now. The problem is that they are the new and exciting edge of motor vehicle transport but they have much more of an impact on the environment than the cars that Senator Allison has just been talking about. Environmentally, they are shockers: they are gas guzzlers and quite dangerous as far as pedestrians and small cars, if they are in a smash, are concerned—although the figures have yet to come in on the relative impact on road safety of the big bumper-bar-led four-wheel drives that we are seeing so much in the cities now. It is worth noting that of the people who buy them only 10 per cent do get to go off road. The intention as an off-road vehicle has been lost in the glamour of the advertising of these lucrative sales items for the big car companies.</para><para>It is interesting to see exactly what is driving the switch to the off-road vehicles. I notice that Arnold Schwarzenegger has five and Mike Tyson has four. I am indebted to Gary Young, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on Monday, 19 May for his reference to <inline font-style="italic">Harper</inline><inline font-style="italic">'s </inline><inline font-style="italic">Magazine</inline> in the United States. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> states:</para><quote><para>... as pick-up trucks and off-road vehicles shed some of their redneck image and started to become popular with suburban professionals, the car industry saw its chance. “Detroit marketers began to identify a new class of driver ... a pleasure-seeking, self-oriented man or woman who liked to drive fast, cared deeply about a car's appearance, had an above-average fear of road dangers (including crime), and wasn't exactly eager to advertise his or her married status.” At the root of it was sex.</para></quote><para>It is interesting that this has led to quite a controversy in the United States, with people lined up on both sides. These vehicles have been branded the `axles of evil' and they are ticketed in their millions and attracting bumper stickers from the owners in retaliation to environmental bumper stickers in the United States, saying, for example, `As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' and `I'm changing the environment. Ask me how.' Evangelist Jerry Falwell was much upset by the evangelical environment network, which launched a campaign asking, `What would Jesus drive?' That brought a tirade back to them, some pointing out that he had 12 disciples, so it would be a Humvee—it would be a big one! Evangelist Jerry Falwell, who believes that global warming does not exist because `God would not let that happen', is in favour of these vehicles. </para><para>Without divine guidance on the matter here today, though, we have got to use our commonsense. Commonsense says that these vehicles are, quite contrary to what Senator Minchin was saying, gas guzzlers and polluters. The bigger of these vehicles use 20 litres per 100 kilometres compared to the average car using half that. Senator Allison was pointing out that her environmentally efficient car uses half that again—down to five litres per 100 kilometres, a quarter of what the big gas guzzlers use. Yet the government is saying, `We will import these at a 10 per cent reduction. Actually, it is a two-thirds reduction in the tariff: instead of 15 per cent, we will allow it at five per cent.' In the old days that was so that there would not be a tariff on farmers and people out in the bush who use these off the road genuinely as part of their business. My amendments cover them and allow them to keep that advantage.</para><para>But now 90 per cent of people do not even go off road in these vehicles. Whether it is Nissan, Toyota or Mitsubishi, they are being pushed on the television. As an environmentalist, I might say that some of the ads they have are absolutely appalling—ripping up, in particular, the arid and the alpine wild country of Australia as an example of what not to do if you really care for this country. Some of the advertising agencies show mud spattered all over these vehicles after they have been through pristine rivers and creeks and across snowfields and out onto the edges of sandstone valleys. That is an absolutely appalling indictment of the advertisers and the car makers, who should hang their heads in shame at wishing to rip up the Australian wilderness, and wildlife underneath, in this fashion.</para><para>Let's have some fairness here. If people are going to buy these gas guzzlers they will pollute the environment almost in equal inefficiency—that is, the more gas you burn, the more you pollute the environment, the worse it is for global warming and the worse it is in terms of the air breathed in by citizens in big cities. I might add that there is not much escape if you go to diesel because that brings out the cancer-causing particles. One estimate I saw some years ago was that, for example, 300 people a year in Melbourne were getting cancer from the exhaust of diesel vehicles. It is 10,000 people a year in the UK. Let them not get a tax break. Let the taxpayers not be funding the four-wheel drive vehicles. If people want to pay for them, then certainly let them pay for them, but let the incentive go to the more environmentally sound passenger cars that we are more used to and that most people buy, and not to the big polluters.</para><para>It is, as I said, an enormous debate that is occurring around the world but, as Senator Allison said, in this country there is apparently a complete absence of recognition by the government that it is actually giving a tax break to an environmental nasty. If you are going to give a tax break in the year 2003, you give it to those vehicles which have the environmental edge. I ask: does the minister believe in global warming? Does he think it is happening? I ask: does the minister think it is smart to be giving city folk a tax break on vehicles like this as against much more environmentally sound vehicles? If you were looking at a $50,000 vehicle, there is a $5,000 tax break over and above what you would get if you were buying a conventional sedan. Finally, I would like to know what the minister thinks about the 25 per cent tax barrier that the United States has got, as far as Australian produced vehicles of this ilk are concerned? Does he not think that Australia should at least catch up by going in the same direction? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>15238</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to place on record that the government will oppose these amendments. We do so for a variety of reasons. Could I first point out that this package of bills has been developed in very close consultation with the Australian car industry and they are designed to ensure a robust future for our industry and those who work in it. And I would make the point, particularly for the benefit of the opposition, that the Australian car industry did not seek these amendments. This was not part of what you might call the log of claims made by the Australian car industry on the government as to the future Australian car industry plan. They did not seek a tariff increase on the importation of four-wheel drive vehicles. So, in agreeing to this, we would be doing something that the industry itself has not sought from the government.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, I would refute the proposition, which is not based on fact, that we are talking about a whole bunch of gas guzzling vehicles. I do not think Senator Brown is aware of the nature of the four-wheel drive vehicles that are imported and sold in this country. I would point out to Senator Brown that the top-selling four-wheel drive in the last calendar year, 2002, was the Honda CRV. This is a 2½ litre four-cylinder car which actually uses less fuel than the Australian-made passenger cars which are typically bought by Australian families. It uses less fuel and it is the top-selling car. Seventy-five per cent of the classification `sports utility vehicles' that are sold here, which are four-wheel drives, are compact or medium-sized vehicles. It is a myth to suggest that every four-wheel drive sold in this country is a Toyota Land Cruiser or a Nissan Patrol, or whatever other vehicle Senator Brown may have in mind. Indeed, if he is genuinely concerned about seeing more fuel efficient or fewer gas guzzling cars, he would be promoting the sale of small- and medium-sized four-wheel drive vehicles because they use less fuel than Australian-made six-cylinder and eight-cylinder family cars. So I do not understand what this amendment is about at all.</para><para>I also make the point in passing that there are many Australians who have as much love for the Australian bush and the Australian environment as Senator Brown, and the best way and probably the only way that they can experience and enjoy it is by seeing it in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Indeed, in July I took my 12-year-old son up the Strzelecki Track in South Australia to show him the wonder and beauty of the Cooper Creek, which is one of the most magnificent pieces of Australian bush and Australian environment. You can only go up the Strzelecki Track in a four-wheel drive, which we did. When I got to Innamincka there were lots of ordinary Australians who love the Australian bush and the Australian environment in four-wheel drives because that is the only way they can experience it and enjoy it and express their love for the Australian bush.</para><para>Senator Brown's proposition that is before us means that those Australians who love the environment just as much as he does should pay anything up to $5,000 more in tax on the vehicle they buy. What he is proposing is a 10 per cent increase in tax on the four-wheel drive vehicles that Australians need if they are to experience the wonders that Australia has to offer. So Australian families under Senator Brown will pay $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 more in tax on the vehicles that they need to enjoy the Australian environment. That is the message that should come out today: that the Greens in the guise of Senator Brown are proposing to tax Australians another 10 per cent on their vehicles—$3,000, $4,000 or $5,000—if they want to enjoy the Australian environment by going to areas, like I did in July, that you cannot get to without a four-wheel drive. So we strongly reject these amendments. </para><para>In terms of the differential in tariff, under this package of measures, that will be gradually phased out by the alignment of the tariff on four-wheel drives and passenger motor vehicles. I would remind Senator Brown of what I said last night—that is, the whole tariff regime was established to protect the infant Australian car industry from imports for a certain period of time until it could get on its feet. Four-wheel drives were not included in that, because the Australian industry has not made four-wheel drives. It is only latterly, now, that they are looking at the question of producing four-wheel drives but doing so clearly on the basis of the existing regime of tariff—that is, a five per cent tariff for that industry. They believe that they can successfully and commercially produce four-wheel drives at that level of tariff. They have not sought, as I said at the outset, any increase in that tariff assistance, so we strongly reject these proposed amendments.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—Senator Brown, I have raised the question of the constitutionality of your amendments.

Section 53 of the Constitution, Senator Brown, prevents a bill imposing taxation being initiated by the Senate. That is the effect if your amendments were to be successful.

When it comes to families, what he was talking about is bunkum. I referred to the fact that only some 10 per cent of people do get off the road in their vehicles, so we are dealing with the 90 per cent of people whom he did not meet at Innamincka. I also want to draw his attention to the fact that, even if you do take all the four-wheel drives into account, 80 per cent of Australians are buying conventional sedans. They are families and they are the people that this government is punishing with an extra $5,000 impost. That is the way that it goes. This government is penalising families because it is not giving them the same tariff break when it comes to imported— </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Yes. Senator Minchin is caught by his own argument there. He is penalising families that do not have four-wheel drive vehicles—which is most of them. I would have thought that he would have thought better than that. When it comes to the car industry, I advise him to consult with them as to whether they think they would do better making four-wheel drives in Australia with a five per cent tariff on imported vehicles than they would with a 15 per cent tariff on imported vehicles, which is what this move would mean. Of course, that is nonsense. It would be in the interests of the Australian car industry to have this tariff matter fixed up. It will help to protect jobs. It will help to protect the industry itself and, as I have indicated, it will certainly help the environment at least while we are in this phase where most of these vehicles are being imported.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15240</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will not be supporting these proposals.

They go to the appropriateness of these amendments outside the technical requirements. There is no doubt that this package has been put together with considerable consultation within the industry. There are, in my view, mixed feelings about the effectiveness of this package and I indicated those concerns in my remarks in the second reading debate. The opposition is not satisfied with this package but we do recognise that there is widespread support within the industry for the adoption of these measures as they are. We were concerned specifically about the relationship between the tariff reduction and the industry assistance and we are not satisfied with the government's assurances on that score. What we are satisfied with though is that the major manufacturers, including the component manufacturers—people that employ 30,000 Australians—have put a strong view to us on this. </para><para>Furthermore, the representative of those 30,000 Australians, the union, has also put a view to us. While not accepting the tariff reduction, it has indicated to us that the financial support provided to the industry in regard to the ACIS component is worthy of support. Clearly, there is within that, despite the differences, an element of consensus about the need for industry assistance for this particular industry. I want to emphasise this. The employment of 30,000 Australians on a relatively high wage, by and large, in highly skilled jobs is something that the Labor opposition strongly supports.</para><para>This is an industry of great strategic importance to the economy and to our society. I suggest, Senator Brown, if there had been an opportunity perhaps to spend some more time with workers in the industry, you might actually appreciate a bit more some of their concerns about these questions. I do not share Senator Minchin's view about the nature of the capitalist economy in this matter, because clearly this is an example where, without this industry assistance, there would be a very strong example of market failure. That is why we are doing this.</para><para>Without the assistance that we are providing here, I think the industry itself may well be in serious difficulty. There has been substantial change in the industry, and this industry assistance package is seeking to shape that behaviour—a measure that we also support. What we do not support, however, are willy-nilly propositions that come up late in the day without proper discussion and without proper examination of the impacts on the industry as a whole. The economics of this industry are very, very important to us and they are very, very important to 30,000 Australians who get direct employment in this industry. I also suggest they are very important to a whole range of other industries that rely upon the success of this industry.</para><para>This industry is doing extremely well at the moment. There is no doubt about that. I say that that is a product of the Button plan of some years ago. This is the fruition of that plan. But the fact remains that, by industry standards, the industry is going through prosperous times. It has to be acknowledged that the sports utility vehicle component of the market is growing—increasing at six per cent or thereabouts per annum, as I understand it. Recently, on visits to Ford and Holden in Melbourne, I was given the benefit of a briefing on the market research that both those companies are producing. One of the reasons they are putting to me for the increase in this particular component of the industry is that it actually caters to social need—a perception of social need, it may well be argued. Nonetheless, for a large number of Australian families, these particular vehicles are said to be very important. It may be that many of them do not actually leave the road. The fact is that they are not always bought to leave the road. They are bought for a whole lot of other reasons to do with people's perceptions about the benefits of those vehicles, including their perceptions about safety, their perceptions about the capacity to actually see the road, their perceptions about mobility, their perceptions about getting the kids to and from the football, the netball or the soccer and their perceptions about the convenience of these vehicles. The reason they are one of the fastest growing segments of the market is that they do meet people's views of where they see themselves.</para><para>Equally, it is said that people are a bit embarrassed about driving these vehicles, so there is a movement away towards different styles of vehicles that do these particular jobs. With that in mind, the local manufacturers are now putting onto the market an Australian made SUV. I understand that Holden, if they have not released it already, are about to release theirs. Ford are releasing theirs—the Territory, I think it is called—and I have had the privilege of actually having a look over it. It is a very, very good vehicle, and it has been specially designed. I think at Ford in Melbourne they have 600 design engineers. They are using that skill for export capacity, and they have come up with a vehicle which they believe will be very popular here. It is constructed in Australia by Australian engineers and with Australian innovative techniques. It is designed to meet a particular need in this country and to be of great export value. It strikes me that, in those circumstances, with the industrial planning that has gone into the construction of that vehicle and the market planning that has gone into that vehicle on these premises, it is not for us to intervene at this stage in the debate, willy-nilly, without consultation either with workers in the industry or with management in the industry, and to propose changes such as we are seeing here today. </para><para>I trust that the vehicle industry does do well. I do think that there have been considerable improvements in its fuel efficiency, its safety record and its capacity to actually meet the needs of Australians in a whole range of areas. I trust that it continues to do well, but it will not do well if we, in a knee-jerk way, propose amendments of doubtful constitutional validity, of dubious legal capacity and, finally, which simply do not meet the economics of the industry as it currently exists. For those reasons, I think this is perhaps a bridge too far, Senator Brown. While I appreciate the benefits of doing these particular jobs on a broadcast day and explaining the great benefits of the green credentials of the Greens, as the Democrats have done, it is not a good way to intervene in industry policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>15242</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not take up a lot of time. I just want to express the view of the Democrats to the amendments put forward by Senator Brown. People may recall that last night during the second reading debate I made it clear that the Democrats support the continuation of the ACIS scheme and the accompanying bill. We want to make clear through our amendment that we are seeking to look at ways of having the industry invest in environmentally sound research and development, and we are seeking some support, particularly from the government, to ensure that those investments continue to occur by leadership from government. I am at a loss to understand some of the logic of what it is that Senator Brown's amendments are trying to achieve, certainly from the perspective of looking at environmental outcomes. It becomes a little bit difficult when you put forward amendments that not only talk about increasing tax but look at the question of making concessions for farmers. What does that achieve at the end of the day?</para></talk.start><para>It seems the only thing that is being achieved is that perhaps we are applying a tariff to sex, as Senator Brown originally spoke about, but from the notes that were provided by Senator Brown to the crossbench senators and the opposition it was made very clear that it was very complex to be putting forward these types of amendments and that they would be put forward in a rough, global amendment that could lead to uncertainty. Then, of course, there was the uncertainty in relation to specified industries such as agriculture and mining. We understand that, given the size and nature of the Australian industry, much of what may be sought will happen abroad as opposed to here. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, if we are talking about trying to deal with four-wheel drives themselves and their production, it is really a question of comparing their full impact with at least the larger family sedans that are also being produced in terms of their fuel efficiency and their effect upon the environment. </para><para>This issue was not brought forward by industry or environmental groups during the Productivity Commission inquiry. Under the circumstances, the Democrats thought that it was appropriate that the bill be sent off to a committee for inquiry, and it was dealt with appropriately. The industry made it clear that they supported the passage of the bills. There was no call from industry to adjust the tariffs on four-wheel drive vehicles, and we accept their reasons for not doing so. One would have thought that, if there were an increase in tariffs, it would have been lucrative for them and it would have protected Australian industry. But they did not seem to express that concern. In the submissions that were received, no views were put forward by environmental groups about this issue. Having said that, the issue of same treatment of tariffs on vehicles has been Democrat policy for many years.</para><para>I agree with the broader proposition that Senator Brown has put forward. For that reason alone we will support the Greens amendments, but I do want to raise the issue of the way they were brought forward. I believe they were ill thought out. There has not been enough comparative research done on fuel efficiency and harm to the environment with respect to other types of vehicles that are produced domestically. There is also the issue of constitutionality, which was raised by the chair. We accept that, and it does raise some perplexing problems.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15243</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It has been an interesting debate, and I thank all those who have taken part.

It is not good enough for the chamber to call the debate short at this point for the reasons that Senator Ridgeway, Senator Carr and Senator Minchin have given. This is an important matter. We are talking about a major slice of the vehicle industry in Australia. Senator Minchin has at least said: `I do what the car industry asks of me. If they don't mention something, I don't know about it or I'm not going to support it.' As Senator Carr said, that is the way the government proceeds. But we have to be able to think for ourselves about what is good for Australians and Australia in this matter. The proposal by the Greens would have given parity to the average car buyer in Australia and there would have been no disadvantage to people who buy imported four-wheel drives. That is the first thing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second thing is that logically—it does not matter which side of the chamber you are sitting on—it must be advantageous to the industry in Australia to have 15 per cent protection, albeit diminishing according to the formula for other passenger vehicles, rather than the five per cent impost on imported vehicles. That absolutely assists the industry with respect to jobs and vehicles made in Australia. There is no logic that says otherwise. It is good for jobs in the Australian industry, and it is also good for the environment. Senator Minchin was quite wrong when he said that four-wheel drive vehicles in Australia are more energy efficient than the sedans that Australians will buy as an alternative. In the main, that is not the case in Australia, it is not the case in the United States and it is not the case anywhere in the world. Senator Minchin should go back and look at the books on that matter. </para><para>The Greens are prepared to get into this debate. We do know what we are talking about. We have seen the world literature on this. We have taken into consideration what is good for the Australian industry as well as for the Australian environment. That is why this amendment has been moved. Next time we come back with an amendment like this I hope the various spokespeople will be a little more informed. I am sure there will be some comment from the industry, and I can guarantee you that it will not be negative.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003 and Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS) Bill 2003 reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>15244</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MINCHIN (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Administration) (1.28 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>15244</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>15244</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MINCHIN (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Administration) (1.28 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day no. 4 (Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 and two related bills).</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15244</page.no><id.no>R1815</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1816</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1812</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15244</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Senator MINCHIN (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Administration) (1.29 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>15244</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition is ready and willing to proceed with this package of bills: the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 </inline>and the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline>. However, we do have a second reading amendment. If that is not ready by the time I conclude my speech, then I will ask one of my colleagues to move it later in the debate. </para></talk.start><para>This is the fourth time that the Senate has debated these bills, and we have to give the Liberal government full marks for persistence, if nothing else. The first of these bills reduces the superannuation surcharge tax rate on high-income earners. That is an inequitable measure, even in the government's own terms. The second bill introduces the low-income earner co-contribution scheme—a scheme not without problems. Nonetheless, it has considerably greater merit than an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. Labor supports the co-contribution measures, subject to certain amendments, but Labor does not support the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, the so-called surcharge. The tax reduction would benefit only a relatively small number of working Australians—less than five per cent and a relatively well-off group.  </para><para>I deal firstly with the reduction in the superannuation surcharge tax rate. The initial tax reduction was proposed to be 15 per cent, down to 10.5 per cent over three years. Amendments will be moved in the committee stage to vary that from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Nevertheless, even with the change this is a highly inequitable tax reduction, which provides an exclusive tax cut to less than five per cent of Australian workers—that is, those with incomes greater than $94,691 taxable income, with the highest tax reduction going to those earning more than $114,981. If your income is less than $94,691, there is no tax cut. Yet this is the same Liberal government, which now wants to reduce the so-called surcharge tax, that introduced it in 1996 on of all grounds that of equity. Of course, in introducing that surcharge tax the Liberal government blatantly broke their 1996 election promise not to introduce any new taxes or increase existing taxes. In February 1996, Mr Howard, on behalf of the Liberal Party, promised:</para><quote><para>We are not going to increase existing taxes and we're not going to introduce new ones.</para></quote><para>That was a straightforward promise, which the Liberal government broke just six months later by announcing a new tax on superannuation, the so-called surcharge applying to higher income earners. As I mentioned earlier, when introducing the surcharge tax, the Liberal government justified it as an equity measure—a fairness measure. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, in his budget speech on 20 August 1996, stated:</para><quote><para>The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer. </para><para>A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20,000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners. </para><para>The Government is remedying this situation. </para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.</para></quote><para>Mr Costello went even further in his support for this measure when he announced a `one and all' in his Budget speech on 27 August 1996 by stating:</para><quote><para>... the point I'd like to make is that on Budget night the first Treasurer in history—me—stood up and put a surcharge in respect to high income earners and applied it to himself and every other politician, you know, we're the good guys in relation to this.</para></quote><para>Yet now, along with other high-income earners the Treasurer and his colleagues, including Senator Coonan who will deal with this bill, will benefit substantially from this exclusive tax cut to the tune of at least $1,000 for each individual member of parliament and tens of thousands of dollars over their parliamentary careers. This is because of the type of defined benefit fund that politicians enjoy. I make the point: I did not make politicians' superannuation the issue with respect to the surcharge tax; Mr Costello did when he boasted about how he was applying it to himself when he introduced it. Yet here today we have the government proposing an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners which benefits all politicians. I now call on government members who plan to speak on this bill to disclose the individual benefit they will receive from this exclusive tax cut.  </para><para>As I said earlier, Labor opposes an exclusive tax cut on superannuation. Hopefully, there will be no benefit to any parliamentarian as a result of this proposal—or any other high-income earner for that matter. I am sure those who are following this debate will want to know if the government will rule out this outrageous windfall that is now going to be passed on to members of parliament. If there is one aspect of the surcharge tax that was inequitable, it was and remains the administrative costs—costs that are spread across all fund members regardless of their level of income. The surcharge is unacceptably expensive to implement. Some funds have incurred costs of up to 30 per cent of the contributions collected. Although the administration expenses are now considerably less, they remain a burden on all fund members regardless of their income level. But the legislation to reduce the rate of the surcharge tax does absolutely nothing to redress the administrative inefficiency of the tax. It is reasonable to expect that the implementation of a reduction in the surcharge tax rate each year for each individual surchargeable member will actually increase the administrative inefficiencies of the tax.</para><para>Labor, in a positive way, has put forward a much more equitable alteration to this exclusive tax cut. Labor would instead cut the contributions tax—a tax which applies to all fund members regardless of income level. This is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians; it is not giving a selective reduction to higher income earners, which is the Liberal Party's approach. Mr Costello believes it is impossible to cut the contributions tax burden. He said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:</para><quote><para>It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way in started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us ... So it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.</para></quote><para>Here is the arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello, saying he cannot do it. It is very simple: you remove 15 and you put in 13 as the contributions tax, as Labor has suggested. Perhaps Mr Costello could explain why it is so complicated to reduce a universal contributions tax but not a selective tax, the so-called superannuation surcharge.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I can't believe what I'm hearing!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Surely it is more complicated and expensive to reduce a selective tax than a universal one.

What is more, the Liberal government will not allow Treasury to release their later costs and publicly correct the record to show that Labor's proposals are affordable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I now turn to the co-contributions measure. The current co-contribution offered in this bill—albeit amended in the package that we will consider in committee—is a pale imitation of much more extensive and universal co-contribution arrangements proposed by the Labor government in May 1995 in its Savings for our future statement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Which you then dropped in subsequent elections.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Those proposals included the government matching contributions of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings. I take the interjection. It was not the Labor Party that dropped the additional three per cent co-contribution proposals, which would have cost $4.5 billion over three years; it was the Liberal government and the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, who dropped universal government contributions into superannuation. He dropped it in 1997. Again, he claimed it was impossible to implement. Apparently when it suits the Treasurer it is just too hard to implement changes. It is just too hard with super; it is too hard to implement a universal tax cut and too hard to implement universal government contributions to superannuation. And that was after the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, had in 1995 committed an incoming Liberal government to implementing the Labor Party's co-contribution proposals.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The inquiries of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation into these bills heard many submissions that raised concerns in relation to the effectiveness and equity of the proposed co-contributions scheme that we are considering today, the access to the co-contribution by particular groups of persons and the administrative costs of the proposal. The Labor Party is particularly concerned about one issue raised in submissions to the committee. Many submissions pointed out that the proposed co-contribution arrangements leave considerable scope for abuse. It was highlighted that comparatively well-off people will make contributions in respect of family members in part-time employment or no employment to access the tax concessions available—that is, for this group of people the co-contributions arrangement could operate as a tax minimisation measure. </para><para>The ability of a single- or low-income sole breadwinner in or below the salary target range—and the maximum level of benefit is payable at an income of $27,500—to contribute $1,000 in superannuation after paying the mortgage and food, health and education costs is extraordinarily limited. The take-up at that level of income and below will be very low, and that is a matter we will further test in the committee stages of the bill. Evidence given to the committee suggested that it was most unlikely that many of those in the target income range could raise that extra money to make the contributions necessary to attract government matching.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>—What happened to Mr FitzGerald's evidence?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I was referring to people on a single income of $27,500, Senator Cherry; not to joint incomes of $27,500 and higher. The number of people estimated to receive the full $1,000 is only 75,000, as revealed in the evidence from the peak superannuation body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA. This is from a total pool of 4.4 million people with incomes of less than, as originally proposed, $32,500. Increasing the income threshold to $40,000, which is what is under consideration in the revised package, will increase the number. Again, we will be interested to see what the figures are. Senator Coonan tried to convince the Labor opposition in respect of these two measures that the surcharge tax reduction and the co-contribution scheme were due to the government's desire to `highlight the fact that the government's superannuation initiatives are designed as a balanced set of initiatives'. Accordingly, the justification for debating the two measures together is to show the balance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have here is a blatant political stunt, undoubtedly aimed at trying to justify the Liberals' exclusive, unfair tax cut for higher income earners, to pretend that high-income earners need that measure and to link it to the co-contributions. This is misleading rhetoric. If the Liberal government were serious about helping those most in need of assistance in accumulating a retirement nest egg, they would have maintained Labor's proposed three per cent co-contribution scheme and they certainly would not have attached it to and watered down the co-contribution arrangements to an exclusive surcharge tax reduction. The Labor Party nonetheless support the revised superannuation co-contributions for low-income earners, albeit with the reservations that we have expressed, but we will require the government to closely monitor and report to the parliament on the outcome of the operation of the co-contribution arrangements to see who actually benefits from this particular measure. We think that is a particularly important part of the consideration in the committee stage.</para><para>In my concluding overall remarks on this legislation, let me summarise the position in respect of these two bills. We have a Liberal-Democrat deal, somewhat similar to the GST approach. With respect to the co-contribution for low-income earners: they have to find an additional $1,000 from their disposable income to contribute into super to receive $1,000 from the government. We do not know the exact numbers yet, but it is likely to be a very small proportion of the millions of Australians on low incomes who can actually find $1,000. At the other end of the income scale, those earning more than $94,600 all get a tax cut. Most people at the highest income level of $115,000 to $116,000 are guaranteed a $1,000 tax cut for doing nothing. So, high-income earners get $1,000 for doing nothing; low-income earners, if they can find an extra $1,000 to put into superannuation, after meeting the family commitments—mortgage, health, education—will get $1,000 from the government. That is not an equitable approach. </para><para>The other point about this package that I would highlight is: what is in this package for middle Australia—those earning between $40,000 and approximately $95,000? Not one cent! No co-contribution; no tax cut. Not one cent for the 2½ million middle-income Australians. Aren't the 2½ million middle-income Australians deserving of either a tax cut or an additional incentive to contribute to superannuation? Don't they save as well? Don't they need additional superannuation for their retirement incomes? This is a very exclusive tax cut on the one hand that is weighted against low-income earners because of their lack of disposable income. Labor's proposal for a universal tax cut is the best approach. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15249</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The superannuation bills we are discussing today have been discussed once by the Senate and will be discussed again when we move into committee. The Democrats will be supporting the bills on this occasion. We do so because of the very substantial amendments, which have been circulated by the government. The key bill in this particular package that has attracted our attention is the government's proposal for a co-contribution for low-income workers in respect of their superannuation. I agree with Senator Sherry that this measure was originally introduced by the government during the election campaign as cover for a very large cut in the surcharge. However, in the course of the evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation it became quite clear that the government had almost stumbled on what was an exceptionally good policy measure. It is a very good policy measure because it has the real potential to encourage low-income earners to save more and to engage in a savings culture. From that point of view, the Democrats suddenly became moderately enthusiastic about it.</para></talk.start><para>Our concern with the balance in the government's proposals was always that they were proposing to put two-thirds of the funding of their package into the high-income earners surcharge cut but only one-third into the funding for the low-income earners co-contribution. We always felt that was the wrong way round and would need to be amended. I am pleased to give credit to Senator Coonan in this regard, because eventually the government agreed to changes to the package to re-weight it in favour of low-income earners. The result is that the co-contribution will now be extended to a much wider category of people and the benefits of the surcharge cut will be significantly reduced. I should note for the record that the Democrats would have preferred to have seen the smallest possible cut, or even no cut, to the surcharge at this stage.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—It was an election promise.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—We accept that it was an election promise, Senator Kemp. We accept also that at the end of the day you have to compromise on these matters—the government is putting together these measures as a package and, from that point of view, we are prepared to support these bills. However, I note that the timing is ironically a significant positive.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>In the last year, voluntary contributions to superannuation in this country fell by $3.8 billion. A lot of that contribution cut actually came from high-income earners because of, to some extent, a response to the market conditions of superannuation funds. But a lot of the money that previously went into superannuation from high-income earners is now flowing into more speculative investments, particularly our overheated property market. Now is ironically a very good time in the economic cycle to provide a real incentive, even to high-income earners, to put more of their money back into longer term investments rather than short-term speculative investments. There is some economic gain in looking at the surcharge at this point in time.</para><para>I also point out that the proposed cuts to the surcharge are less in each of the next four years than the growth in the surcharge in each of those four years. The entire funding for this particular cut to the surcharge comes from bracket creep on the surcharge itself. From that point of view, we are achieving an outcome that the superannuation industry has spoken about for some time—achieving cuts in superannuation taxes from the estimated growth on those superannuation taxes.</para><para>Returning to the low-income earners' co-contribution, I advise the Senate of some of the very significant changes which were made in the agreements reached between the Democrats and Senator Coonan, and the number of people who will be affected. According to the ABS, 1.7 million workers earn under $20,000 a year and as such were eligible for the government's original proposal of a $1,000 co-contribution. By raising the threshold from $20,000 to $27,500, an extra one million workers will become eligible for the co-contribution—2.7 million people will now be eligible for the full co-contribution. The number of workers who will be eligible for a partial contribution has also risen. Under the government's original proposal, a total of 3.5 million workers would have been eligible for a full or partial contribution. Under the new amendments, which will take the income test up to $40,000, 4.6 million workers will be eligible for the co-contribution. Contrary to Senator Sherry's view that this is not very substantial, 60 per cent of the work force will now be eligible for the co-contribution. </para><para>It was very surprising to hear the Labor Party saying in here that we should provide more benefits for the middle and upper income brackets—for everybody, as they say. But if there is a limited budget and limited resources, I unashamedly say the benefits should go to low-income earners first and foremost. The 60 per cent of people earning less than $40,000 a year in my view should be the principal beneficiaries. If we had gone down the Labor Party's route of a two per cent cut across the board, it is worth noting that there would have been a two per cent cut to everybody—low-income earners and high-income earners alike. High-income earners—the people whom Senator Sherry was complaining about with respect to the surcharge—would have received a two per cent cut in their contributions tax. Under our proposal, yes, they get 2.5 per cent. </para><para>The difference is very small, but the big difference is at the bottom end. We are putting the vast bulk of the money into the bottom end. They get a lot more out of this proposal than they would have under the Labor Party's policy. And they get it if they are prepared to save, and that is the key thing. Australia's national savings rate has fallen, according to the most recent figures I have seen, to zero per cent. Our voluntary contributions to superannuation, as I said, fell by $3.8 billion last year. We need to encourage people to save in this country. We need to do that. We need to encourage a savings culture whereby people are encouraged to put away for tomorrow. That is what the co-contribution is all about. That is why I am so enthusiastic about it. That is why I have been prepared to talk to government over the course of the last year to try to extend it to as many people as is politically possible to encourage people to save.  </para><para>How many people will pick it up? That is the sixty-four million dollar question. I am sure, as Senator Sherry pointed out, we will tease this out when we get to the committee stage. But Treasury estimates that the number of people who will pick up the co-contribution will rise under the revised package from 350,000 to 540,000 people. That I think is a very significant group. But Treasury in my view has underestimated the pick-up rate, and this came out in evidence that we received during the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into this particular measure. Evidence given by Dr Vince FitzGerald—the most eminent expert on savings in this country, from research he had done for IFSA—clearly indicated that the pick-up rate is likely to be much higher than estimated. In fact the pick-up rate he estimated is around 50 per cent higher than that estimated by Treasury. That suggests that as many as 800,000 people will benefit from the package we are putting up here today. Because the actual total expenditure is not capped, if the actual pick-up rate ends up being higher than estimated by Treasury or Dr Vince FitzGerald, we could see even more people picking up benefits.</para><para>It is worth noting, for example, that a worker on $35,000 a year is still eligible for a co-contribution of around $400. That is still a substantial boost to their superannuation. If they put away $8 a week over the course of their working life, the government will double it. That significantly adds to what they ultimately end up with. This is a very significant gain for the lower middle income area, where the real savings are likely to occur.</para><para>In the time I have left, I want to point very briefly to some of the likely beneficiaries of these particular changes. A key group, who I think will pick up the co-contribution and run with it quite significantly, will be older workers—workers over 40. Their children have possibly already left home and are off their hands. They are starting to think about retirement. They want to get ready for retirement and get their finances in order. They are likely to be in a position where they have a bit of extra money to put away. If they put away up to $20 a week, they could increase their final superannuation payment over 15 years by $45,000. That is very significant for older workers approaching retirement, particularly when you consider that the average superannuation balance for that group at the moment is just $56,000.</para><para>Another group who will benefit from this change, quite significantly in my view, will be women returning to the work force. Many women return to the work force as part-time workers. As a result they will probably be eligible for the full co-contribution. A constant complaint I hear from women returning to the work force is that they have lost time because of their child rearing years and are significantly behind with their superannuation. These changes allow them to catch up, and that is a huge benefit which we will talk about in more detail later.</para><para>Part-time and casual workers who are prepared to save will also benefit from these changes. Again that is significant given that this is by far the fastest growing segment of our work force. But the key thing is that 60 per cent of workers earn less than $40,000 a year, and they will benefit from this change right across the board. It is something that we really need to recognise in this place as a very significant and positive proposal. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>15252</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Child Care</title><page.no>15252</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15252</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, Minister for Family and Community Services.

That is relevant in a climate where there was a $10 billion black hole that had to be filled and where difficult decisions had to be made. Nonetheless, the government, in recognition of the desire of women to re-enter the work force, whether it is in a full- or part-time capacity, has very significantly extended child care.</para></talk.start><para>The government has committed a record $8 billion over the next four years to child care and, of that, $190 million each year will directly support services through the child-care support broadband. The redevelopment will examine all aspects of child-care support broadband to determine how support to child-care services can be improved. Redevelopment will ensure better use of available resources to meet the needs of children. We remain committed to supporting family day care as one of the range of child-care choices available to Australian families. No decision has been made, and any decisions will be made in the context of the government's commitment to improving work and family.</para><para>I think that makes the picture very clear. I will just repeat for the benefit of Senator Collins that there has been a record allocation of $8 billion over four years—more than $7 million in the first six years in office, which is over 70 per cent more in real terms than in Labor's last six years in office. Fee increases for centres have halved, with an average increase of 4.3 per cent per annum since 1996, compared with an average increase of 8.5 per cent under Labor. Child-care fees have increased by only 5.3 per cent since June 2000. The CPI has increased by 12 per cent over the same time. This means the cost of child care has increased far less than general prices. Child-care benefits have been provided, with very substantial increases in assistance for most families. It was boosted by indexation of three per cent on 7 July 2003. Child-care benefits subsidise around 70 per cent of the total cost of child care to low-income families and, as a matter of interest, a family earning $50,000 a year with one child in full-time care now pays about $380 less out of their pockets a year for child-care fees than they would have in June 2000.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15252</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask a supplementary question.

As people know, the states and territories have signed up to the new health care agreements. It is a $42 billion offer to the states—$10 billion more than the last five-year agreement and 17 per cent over and above inflation. The states also have a growing revenue from the GST and, as Senator Vanstone said yesterday, a windfall from some stamp duties, including stamp duties on medical indemnity, which they did not have before. I would ask the states to take the stamp duty off medical indemnity, but I do not think I can expect much from that.</para></talk.start><para>In signing the new agreements, the states have recommitted themselves to Medicare principles and, specifically, the availability of free public hospital treatment for all Australians regardless of their insurance status. For the first time, we have provided a much more transparent, specified level of funding for each year in the next agreement and, for the first time, the states have had to commit five years ahead for their funding. They have never had to do this before; they have always expected the Commonwealth to do this. As a result it will mean there will be much greater certainty for the health system in each state.</para><para>As well, they have committed to a new financial and performance reporting framework. In the past we have not known sometimes two years back how much the states have spent on their public hospitals. We have also not known statistics about waiting lists and other issues associated with public hospitals. We will be able to better compare, state by state, the various hospitals and their performance, and the states and their performance. The states now need to work with the Commonwealth on some of the reform agenda items such as streamlining cancer care, improving safety and quality, and easing the pathway of patients from hospital care to home. </para><para>I am glad to say that despite all the colour and movement that went on with regard to the Australian health care agreements I had four ministers who came and discussed with me the reform agenda during that whole debate. I look forward to seeing the other health ministers and I will make myself available if they wish to come and talk to me about the reform agenda. We must be able to spend the $40 billion a year that the Commonwealth and the states spend on health much better and more efficiently. We spend just over nine per cent of our GDP on health and we must be able to do it more efficiently. I am determined to do all I can to improve health outcomes for people. </para><para>Some states, like Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, are claiming that the record funding falls short for them to treat their public hospital patients and that the Australian government is not interested in reform. My commitment to the reform agenda is unwavering. I have had significant discussions with some health ministers and I look forward to working with them on improving patient care, but we must never forget that the states run the public hospitals and it is no good blaming the Commonwealth. Last week we saw Mr Carr running advertisements when stories were littered throughout the paper on Friday of the failure of his government to run the public hospitals—Camden, Campbelltown and Prince of Wales. Over and over we see stories of the failure of the New South Wales government to run their hospitals. </para><para>When you have reduced your hospital beds by 5,000 you might expect that there will be problems in your public hospitals.

When you listen to the emergency doctors and nurses in New South Wales, they talk about the lack of beds.

As Dennis Shanahan of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>—a very independent commentator—wrote last Friday on this matter:</para><quote><para>Oblivious to Labor's economic record—everything he has said about economic reform, the electorate's searing experience with recessionary unemployment and 17 per cent mortgage rates—Latham is launching a dual strategy of such daredevil proportions that he's risking everything on one throw of the dice.</para><para>He has decided to attack the economic record of John Howard and, more particularly, Peter Costello at a time of relative prosperity, with interest rates one-third of what they were under the Keating government, unemployment dipping below 6 per cent to a 13-year low and inflation a dead dragon.</para></quote><para>The latest instalment of this `daredevil strategy' came with an opinion piece by Mr Latham in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> yesterday. He, surprisingly and quite extraordinarily, expressed concern about the level of household debt and its impact on national savings. He quoted figures indicating the rise in nominal household debt levels since 1996 but then he destroyed his own argument by conceding:</para><quote><para>As it stands the overall household balance sheet is not too bad.</para></quote><para>It is very begrudging, but absolutely accurate and a correct comment by Mr Latham. The growth in disposable income and real household wealth has boosted the ability of Australian households to service debt, and that is why they have felt the confidence to take out more loans. Household interest payments today represent about six per cent of disposable income, whereas in 1990 under the former Labor government they represented 10.7 per cent of disposable income—nearly double their level today. Today, for every dollar of debt households have around $2 in financial assets and more than $6 in total assets. The government has repeatedly said that Australians should be wary of excessively exposing themselves to the property market and that what goes up can come down. But it should also be remembered that investment in housing is a form of saving. They are not borrowing it to blow on the casino; they are borrowing it to invest in housing.</para><para>One of the biggest factors in determining the level of national saving is the role played by the federal government. You will recall that when we came into government the federal Labor government was dissaving to the tune of $10,000 million a year and it had racked up no less than $65,000 million in extra debt just in its last five years in office. That has been a major focus of our policy. In just seven years we have repaid $60 billion of that debt and indeed the share of net foreign debt held by the government has fallen from 17 per cent when we came into office to just three per cent today. Of course, Labor have not changed their spots. Every time we put up a measure to try to increase national saving through the federal budget they block it. They block our attempts to try to control runaway expenditure programs and they do nothing but promise more and more spending, so everything Mr Latham says is utterly hollow. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Pensions and Benefits</title><page.no>15257</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15257</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services.

However, I can make a few general comments about the ability of retirees to access lump sums and incentives to take income streams. </para></talk.start><para>Once a superannuation account holder has reached the preservation age—currently undergoing a phased increase from 55 to 60 years—and retired, as senators would know, they have the choice to take their superannuation as a lump sum, as an income stream or as some combination of both. Significant tax and social security incentives are provided to encourage retirees to purchase income stream products which meet with the government's broad retirement income policy objectives. These incentives include the provision of a tax rebate of 15 per cent on the income received from a pension, so obviously there are incentives there. Additionally, some income streams which meet certain rules receive an exemption from the social security assets test and you are entitled to be assessed against the higher pension reasonable benefit limit.</para><para>The ability to take either a lump sum or an income stream provides flexibility in the Australian superannuation system and allows retirees to structure their retirement arrangements to suit their individual circumstances. It should also be noted that, while the superannuation system matures, some retirees will have insufficient savings to make the purchase of an income stream a valid option, regardless of the incentives offered. These retirees need to retain the ability to access their savings as a lump sum. I am sure that Senator Buckland has understood every word of that.

If the Senate were to pass our workplace relations reform agenda for small business, another 50,000 jobs would be created.

One of the most significant threats is the Labor state governments whose pursuit of stamp duty, land tax and payroll tax are all at record levels of collection. Unable to quench his thirst for more tax revenue, Labor's leader-in-waiting is finding new ways to tax jobs in small business. Now Mr Carr wants to introduce a new CBD employee tax. Typical of all Labor leaders, Bob Carr wants to introduce another tax. A generation ago, Mr Simon Crean's father sagely noted, `One man's pay rise is another man's job.' Today, Mr Simon Crean should be saying, `One premier's tax increase is other men's jobs.' Ironically though, this New South Wales Labor tax proposal may in fact save one Victorian Labor man's job. Mr Carr will slug every small business in the CBD in New South Wales with more than 10 employees with his tax—it is Labor's new tax on employment. But the Labor state governments are not the sole threat to Australian small businesses and the workers and families whose livelihoods they provide. The Labor Party's political masters have constantly threatened small businesses. </para><para>In New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, the teachers unions are planning a strike which will force thousands of parents to stay home or even take their children to work with them.

More importantly, they were to give an indication on a number of points of reference and what it would mean to the social and economic fabrics of all the communities up and down the river if you picked them up. This is a particularly complex position, Senator Allison, and you cannot look just at the environmental flows. You have to look at the impacts on the farmers, on those who use the land, on the communities and on all stakeholders, including the environmental aspects of it.

I do recall seeing some reports by Senator Lundy yesterday that this matter was being discussed in cabinet, which it was not, and that it was `all the National Capital Authority's fault', which it was not. Wrong, wrong and wrong again. The situation, quite simply, is this. There was an announcement in June last year that we would commission a celebratory art work to recognise the achievement of this nation when it was, I think, the youngest nation in the world—if it was not the youngest, it was very close—to give women both the right to vote and to stand at elections.

One would have thought that the world as Canberrans knew it was coming to an end. When a competition was launched by the Fraser government for the design of the new Parliament House, people said that this place was going to be `horrific', `dreadful', `hated by everybody' and an `abomination on the landscape'.

Had we got to the stage where the artists could confirm that they were able to complete this commission on time and within cost, we might have had that argument. I can assure you I would have been on another side from Senator Heffernan. Absolutely! I would have backed Betty Churcher, Ron Radford and Annabelle Pegrum and I would have backed the view that a brave, forward-thinking and challenging decision by a young country deserved a brave and forward-thinking memorial.

They would have said, `Let them have a fair crack of the whip. There are design issues. You've got to work through these things. You've got to give people a chance to comply.'

She criticised Ms Hayes, Mr Wood and Alan Kohler. What I found extraordinary was that she actually criticised her own colleague Senator Watson. Senator Watson is the Liberal Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and she bagged her own colleague because of the quite correct and unanimous observations and criticisms made by Senator Watson of Senator Coonan. Senator Watson criticised Senator Coonan.

This is a grossly irresponsible claim because it is simply not correct. I posed this important question to Senator Coonan today. I asked her to confirm the prediction that Australians would become millionaires in today's dollar values as a result of the low-income earners co-contribution; I asked her whether she would confirm Senator Ian Campbell's prediction. Of course, she would not. I know why she would not, and that is that it is virtually impossible. I know of no scenario where an Australian could become a millionaire in today's dollar values as a result of the $1,000 co-contribution. I know of no circumstance. They would have to have an extraordinarily high return over 40 years and have no fees or charges. It is just not going to happen. That Australians could become millionaires was a grossly misleading comment and prediction—and it was grossly misleading financial advice—from Senator Ian Campbell to low-income earning Australians. Who wants to be a millionaire? It was an Eddie type of prediction from Senator Ian Campbell.</para><para>But that was not the first irresponsible and grossly misleading statement made by not just Senator Ian Campbell but other ministers on behalf of the Liberal government in respect of superannuation matters. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, prior to the last election projected that there would be 470,000 children's superannuation accounts. How many have been opened? About 500. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer predicted that there would be $325 million collected from a new tax on temporary Australian residents. How much has been collected? About $15 million. At current rates there will be a $250 million shortfall. I understand why Senator Watson is sensitive, but to his credit Senator Watson criticised his own minister over her portability regulations.

Yes, it is true. But Senator Ian Campbell reminds me, Senator Sherry, that in that time he has not seen one instance of a policy from the Australian Labor Party. In that time, there has been no policy from the Australian Labor Party. There has been much misreading or selectivity and taking out of context in relation to a number of matters raised today. Senator Buckland raised the issue of lump sums. I draw the attention of Senator Buckland to issues that he signed off on and that he apparently wants to walk away from. Senator Sherry has already walked away from the concept of portability, which is another matter. The report of the committee is important. With respect to transitional arrangements—which you, Senator Buckland, seem conveniently to ignore—the report reads:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Committee majority recognise that any move to mandate the purchasing of complying annuities on retirement would need to be accompanied by transitional arrangements over a long period of time.</para></quote><para>There is no immediacy, as you and some of the newspaper correspondents attempt to infer there is.

It is in black and white, and I am quoting from it today. The report does recognise the option of:</para><quote><para>... a continuation of the current complex tax and social security rules, which have resulted in insufficient incentives for retirees to take up income streams or for life offices to offer such products.

The committee drew attention to the fact that Australia is one of only two countries in the world with mandatory, individual superannuation accounts that allow members access to their whole balance when they retire. We are saying that in the long term, when the balances come up as a result of a generational change, there should be some mandating of a portion of the balance. The Labor Party have completely ignored or misconstrued the reading. How they can honestly stand up in this place and make such statements is absolutely astounding. It is a disgrace to the Labor Party and a disgrace to those members of the committee who have not properly represented what is in the report. If the committee system is going to degenerate into this, the whole standing of the Senate committee system will fall into disrepute. We need honest reporting of what is actually in committee reports.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15270</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in question time today. What the minister demonstrated today is a frightening lack of understanding of superannuation policy and the pressing issues facing superannuation policy in Australia. Not only does this minister fail to grasp the key issues in the area of superannuation but she appears to suffer from some sort of ideological tunnel vision, where any reasoned criticism of her policy—what there is of it—is dismissed as some sort of Labor Party and industry fund conspiracy. It is unfortunate that the minister in the Howard government who has responsibility for this important area of superannuation, which will define Australians' retirement incomes in years to come, suffers from such tunnel vision.</para></talk.start><para>Even the minister's own party colleagues are able to see sense. There was a unanimous recommendation from the superannuation committee to not apply the portability regulations to active accounts. I do not think that is a misrepresentation of your position, Senator Watson. In fact, I congratulate you as chair of that committee on putting good policy and good sense above party politics and, in the discussion of the portability regulations, making the very clear point that in their current form those regulations could lead to an increase, not a decrease, in the number of superannuation accounts in Australia. That is something we all agree is a problem. The point was made by the committee that this issue of portability out of active accounts is more properly dealt with in choice-of-fund legislation, which would allow scrutiny by the Senate and issues of consumer protection and efficiency to be addressed. Thank goodness for the committee and that the chair and deputy chair, Senators Watson and Sherry, can provide some reasoned debate and policy in the context of a minister who simply fails to grasp some of the primary issues in superannuation at this moment. </para><para>I want to turn briefly to the issue of exit fees. I asked the minister a question on that issue and again the minister simply failed to grasp the nettle on it. The Senate committee and other commentators have commented on the barrier to portability that is posed by outrageous exit fees—that is, fees that are charged simply for taking your money out of one account and putting it into another. I cited some of the examples to the minister in my question: a balance of $5,939 which would be hit with a fee of around $5,620 and a balance of $1,287 which would cop a fee of $1,195. I think any layperson, any Australian worker, would say those sorts of fees are unreasonable and they clearly constitute a barrier to taking your money out.</para><para>If the minister were serious about portability, if she were serious about actually encouraging people to consolidate their accounts and ensuring they are not financially penalised for doing so, she would do something about exit fees of the sort that I have described. But today again in question time we saw this minister simply refuse to concede that it is an issue at all. She does not think these sorts of exit fees are an issue. With a wave of her hand she airily dismisses exit fees as being a minor problem, as being only a problem in relation to older funds. I make the point that I agree with her in one respect: some of the industry funds certainly have far better practices when it comes to exit fees. But this minister simply brushes away examples of outrageous and exorbitant exit fees that would be applied to the superannuation funds of Australian workers. She says the market will sort it out. My question to the minister is: how many Australian workers' savings will be diminished while you wait for the market to sort this issue out? If this minister were serious about the consolidation of Australian superannuation funds, she would deal with the issue of exit fees. She would regulate those fees and ensure, as the Senate committee recommended, that those fees are limited to the reasonable costs of processing the transactions and any rollover costs associated with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15271</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have had a number of attempts by the Labor Party in the Senate today to raise issues in relation to superannuation. All of them failed and they failed basically because the Labor Party have, as in so many areas, completely failed to develop any policy with regard to retirement incomes in the important area of superannuation. That is the first point that needs to be made. The second point that needs to be made is that, in terms of their involvement in debate on superannuation, the Labor Party are forever doing the bidding of the union funds. They are not interested in consumers; they are not interested in people trying to save for their retirement. They are purely interested in serving the interests of the union funds, which are of course largely operated by the union organisations they represent.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Sherry tried to lampoon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, because Senator Campbell apparently said that the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme for low-income earners will result in people becoming millionaires. Well, that is true. How do we define millionaires at any particular time? Generally a millionaire is someone who has assets in excess of a million dollars. The data has been prepared not by Senator Campbell or by the government but by the Financial Planning Association. They have done calculations, and have laid out the basis of their calculations, which clearly show that someone 25 years of age today will have, if they retire at 65 years of age having made contributions under the government's co-contribution scheme, retirement benefits worth a lump sum amount of $1.202579 million. </para><para>Certainly that is $1 million 40 years hence. But we talk about millionaires today being people who have assets of a million dollars or more; we do not talk about them being people who had assets of a million dollars or more 20 years ago. We talk about it in current dollar terms, and that is exactly what Senator Campbell correctly did on the basis of the information and the evidence provided by the Financial Planning Association. That reinforces the great value that the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme has for low-income earners who make their own small contributions which will be supported dollar for dollar by the government. So let us have none of this nonsense from the Labor Party that Senator Campbell is somehow misrepresenting the situation. </para><para>The other issue that has been raised is the portability of superannuation benefits between funds. Again in marked contrast to the Labor Party, the government believes that workers should have the freedom to decide who is going to manage their superannuation—the funds they are saving for their retirement. They should have the right to move their benefits from one fund to another. That is why the government has introduced regulations to give effect to that policy. Portability will allow members to consolidate their superannuation benefits in one account should they wish to do so. It will also allow members of accumulation funds and fully defined benefit funds to transfer benefits from their current superannuation fund to a fund of their own choice. It will also benefit Australians by creating greater competition in the superannuation industry, placing downward pressure on fees and charges and leading to more responsive investment strategies by trustees. </para><para>Another issue that the Labor Party raised in its questions today was the issue of fees and charges. The best way to ensure we have low levels of fees and charges is by having the maximum amount of competition in the financial services industry, in particular in the provision of superannuation investments. That is exactly what will be achieved as a result of the introduction of portability by this government's regulations because, when consumers have the right to place their funds where they want them, they will be able to do it on the basis of where they will get the best investment return at the lowest cost in fees and charges. Again, by not supporting the government's regulations, the Labor Party is indeed working directly against the interests of consumers and directly against the interests of low-income earners who want to take up the opportunity to save for their retirement and to maximise their retirement benefits.</para><para>The government generally also supports choice of superannuation funds, but the introduction of portability is not a backdoor method for introducing funds, contrary to what ASFA has claimed. We do remain committed to that, but that is quite a separate issue. The fact that it is a separate issue is reinforced by the fact that, under the regulations for portability, portability will only be provided once a year. That addresses the concern that it will be used as a backdoor method for introducing choice of funds. It is also important to recognise that portability exists on a voluntary basis. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>15272</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of answers given in question time today by Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. The practice of lump sums at retirement needs to be kept in place, but government members tend to have the view that perhaps all of that money should be put into an annuity or some other form of savings to help workers later on. But when you look at low-paid workers there is no benefit for them. For instance, if low-paid workers who are on $20,000 were to invest that amount of money as a pension, they might be able to get $1,200 a year, or $23 a week.  </para></talk.start><para>The minister seems to be making high-income earners her priority: those who earn $100,000 or more, those who might be able to live off an annuity and those who do not need to retire debt that they have accumulated during their working life—something that they have a right to do. They have been putting money aside so that when they go into retirement they will be debt free and able to survive the rigours of their later years.</para><para>In responding to my question, the minister said a very curious thing. When I asked her about the annuity and the partial or full ban on lump sum superannuation payouts, she said that the government are looking at and considering their position in relation to the committee report, which I thought was a good report overall; it has assisted the debate on superannuation in this country quite considerably. She said that they are reviewing it. The curious thing she said was that the abolition of lump sums—to use my choice of words; preventing people taking part or all of their superannuation as a lump sum—is something to be considered. Those were her words: `something to be considered'. That worries me because it seems that in the overall picture that is what the government are going to be all about—considering ways to prevent the lower paid workers in our community from benefiting from their savings to retire their debt as they go into their years of retirement.</para><para>The Labor Party support the choice of taking a lump sum as a pension. But, in our view, there have to be real incentives from the government to allow Australians to make an informed choice about retirement income options. They should not just throw people to the wolves who see a quick buck in selling products to them and investing their money so that they can pick up the fees and charges and do very nicely out of it. Such people are ready to capitalise on those who are not educated in the area of superannuation or in financial matters and who are unable to plan for their later years.</para><para>The committee spoke a lot about education, and that is contained in the report. There needs to be very real education programs so people know what they will be doing upon retirement. They need to know that they can securely invest their money, if that is what they want to do, and live off the capital that they have accumulated over their working lives. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murray-Darling River   System</title><page.no>15273</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>15273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>15273</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation (Senator Ian Macdonald) to questions without notice asked by Senators Bartlett and Allison today relating to an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and water levels in the Murray River.</para></motion><para>Both of those questions go to what has become, sadly, an extremely consistent approach by this government on important public policy issues, which is to mislead the public, to hide the facts and to dodge any proper scrutiny of what they are doing. Firstly, Senator Allison asked about a very important scientific report on the future of the River Murray, which the government promised to release prior to the Ministerial Council meeting in August this year. Despite a clear commitment to do so, the government have not released the report. It appears that the government are backing away from their previous commitment to establish a specific amount of environmental flow that would be restored to the River Murray. Of course, that flow would be based on scientific assessment, yet they have not released the scientific assessment that they have received. So we have a government that are trying to prevent the facts from becoming public. They are trying to manage the release of that information in such a way as to mislead the public about what it contains. They are backing away from some of the clear commitments they gave on this critical issue. </para><para>On a matter that is possibly even more critical, which was the government's decision to send Australian troops to war in Iraq, we have even more indication of this government trying to hide from the truth. A parliamentary inquiry that is controlled by the government is under way. It is an inquiry in which, as the minister himself has admitted, government ministers will vet submissions from intelligence officials, agencies and any other government bodies before they are provided to the committee. The government can decide who will or will not appear before the committee and whether or not it will be in secret. There has been one public hearing to date. No government official has appeared before it, and there has been no indication that there will be any public hearing in the future. Once again, I have to remind the ALP that the Democrat view is that this inquiry is inadequate. It is not sufficiently public and it is not sufficiently vigorous. We really need to have a broader inquiry of the sort the Democrats suggested from the start.</para><para>Let us contrast the government's approach with what has happened in the UK. There have been a number of different inquiries for starters but, in addition to the UK intelligence services inquiry and the existing Hutton inquiry, the UK Foreign Affairs Committee, a cross-party committee without government control, held an inquiry into the decision to go to war with Iraq. The committee received public evidence from Jack Straw, the Secretary of State, the equivalent of our Minister for Foreign Affairs, more than once. It received public evidence from the Director General of the Political, Foreign and Commonwealth Office more than once. It received public evidence from the director general of the defence intelligence section of the government. It received public evidence from the Director of Communications and Strategy in the Prime Minister's office, also known as the spin doctor—so it was a personal staff member of the Prime Minister—and it received public evidence from the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, as well as other serving and former senior scientific and defence experts.</para><para>What do we get in Australia? We get an inquiry which has had nobody appear from the government at all. There have been no public submissions from any government agencies, even though the government can vet them and censor them first. It is no wonder the government are confident of the outcome of the inquiry, even though, extraordinarily enough, they opposed it being set up in the first place. Why they bother to oppose something that they have such total control over is beyond me. This in the face of the only critical evidence, from former ONA analyst Andrew Wilkie. Another submission has now appeared from Dr Hugh Crone, a very experienced award winning scientist who worked for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation for 30 years. It appears that the only people who can tell the truth are people who are retired or who have quit their job to try to make the evidence public. This is a ridiculous scenario for a government that is supposedly open to scrutiny about the accuracy of its rationale for sending Australians to war in Iraq. We need to get more public scrutiny of what this government are doing. This government have a continual record of hiding from the truth, misleading the Australian public and dodging the facts. That is why we need proper Senate scrutiny and that is why we need a strong, independent Senate.

The question seriously misrepresented my position on the committee and it also misrepresented what was in the report. To senators who are interested in an accurate reading of the report, I suggest that they read in their own time from pages 156 to 159 of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation <inline font-style="italic">Planning for retirement</inline> report dated July 2003. I think you will find that that presentation is a far cry from claims raised by Senator Buckland and some newspaper correspondents who have been quite reckless in the way that they have read that report. They have caused a lot of fear in people who are approaching retirement.

I will keep this brief. In the motion under paragraph (b), which is headed, `urges the Government to', subparagraphs (i), (iii) and (iv) are, of course, Labor policy. We are all over the public record declaring those things. They are unexceptional to us. We support them strongly and have been out proselytising for them. Subparagraph (ii) is an arguable matter. We would not express it in those terms but we understand the sentiment. If the mover had been sensitive to those concerns, I believe we could have reached an agreement.</para></talk.start><para>Those issues are not the reason why we opposed the motion. We opposed it because of subparagraph (v), which reads:</para><quote><para>bring any negotiated trade agreements to the Parliament for debate and ratification.</para></quote><para>There is a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the Australia-US free trade agreement and into the GATS. Part of those hearings, which are still on foot and have not yet concluded, relate to the question of how trade agreements should be dealt with by the parliament, given the constitutional arrangements whereby the executive wing of government adopts agreements of that nature but where later consequential amendments to legislation that might flow as a consequence of implementing a trade agreement have to be voted on by the parliament. The Labor Party's view is that the authority of the parliament is vitally important and the open disclosure of the contents of those agreements so that the parliament knows what is being considered is also of vital importance. </para><para>The parliamentary references committee has not completed its hearing. It is disappointing to us that this should be moved. Senator Ridgeway is a member of the committee and knows the process that we are undergoing. We are shortly going to report and it seems to us that it would have been more sensible to have waited for the committee to complete its hearing, formulate its recommendations and make a report to the chamber. It is no trifling matter to argue about how the constitutional arrangements about the adoption of treaties should be dealt with and, in our view, it is not appropriate to take it on to a resolution at this time, in this way, in this chamber. While we say it is not appropriate, we recognise nonetheless that it is the right of senators to do so. We think it is frivolous to proceed this way. We think it is about claiming bragging rights and, if that is so, it trivialises the process. These are weighty matters and should be dealt with in an appropriate way and our preference is in response to a report from the Senate committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15284</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to respond to what Senator Cook refers to as bragging rights in the context of the process that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee is going through. Senator Cook has been around this place for a long time and he would be well aware of the position that has always been adopted by the Australian Democrats on matters of this sort. I refer first of all to the position taken by the former senator for New South Wales Vicki Bourne in her private senator's bill about the Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill.</para></talk.start><para>There has been some confusion about whether Senator Cook regards this motion as being inconsistent with the processes undertaken by the committee. I am well aware that the committee is looking at these particular types of issues. I am well aware that the committee has also made it clear—or at least from discussions that I have had with members—that it is highly unlikely that the role of the parliament will be improved in the context of debating and ratifying any treaties that are dealt with by the executive of government. I certainly respect the views that have been put forward by Senator Cook, but I think that it is a cheap shot to suggest that we are talking about bragging rights here.</para><para>These types of motions have been moved on a number of occasions and, whilst the executive does have the power to make treaties, there is a need to respect the role of the parliament in scrutinising its actions and in making recommendations to further the interests of the Australian people. The principle that is sought is one no different, no more, no less than that which currently exists in relation to the US Congress. If the Americans seem to think that it is okay for them to go down the path of authorising their President to deal with fast-tracking trade agreements, keeping in mind that they have an opportunity to deal with full ratification through the Congress, then it is seems highly appropriate in this circumstance. Whilst there are virtues and deficiencies that we can talk about in relation to how the US parliamentary system might work, the reality is, at the end of the day, that this parliament ought to have a role in relation to ratifying any treaty that is dealt with by the executive of government. </para><para>Again, I say that it has been party policy for an enormous amount of time and goes back to well before my arrival here. Senator Cook would be well aware of that. It is a position that we will continue to put forward and it will be dealt with tomorrow in relation to another motion of similar form about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is clear that that will not be supported. There is no reason though that these motions ought not be put forward, not as a question of grandstanding or bragging rights but as a question of recording the principle in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that there is a need and a role for the parliament to be involved.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>15285</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>15285</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate—</para></motion><para>	(a)	notes that: </para><quote><para>	(i)	the World Trade Organization Ministerial Council meeting in Cancun, Mexico comprises an essential stage of the Doha round of trade negotiations, which is known as the `Development Round',</para><para>	(ii)	developing countries have expressed concern at the manner in which meetings such as these are conducted, with negotiations carried on in secret and significant time pressures placed on member nations to achieve consensus, and</para><para>	(iii)	finding a real solution for the removal of subsidies in agricultural trade is a key means by which the world trade process can help the developing world and, as United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has stated, `no single change could make a greater contribution to eliminating poverty than fully opening up the markets of prosperous countries to the goods produced by poor ones'; and</para></quote><para>	(b)	urges the Government to use its influence to:</para><quote><para>	(i)	ensure the Ministerial Council meeting is conducted in a transparent and democratic manner, with the full participation and free consent of all members, and</para><para>	(ii)	maintain pressure on developed countries to achieve a meaningful solution on agricultural trade reform and removal of agricultural subsidies, to open key agricultural markets to producers in the developing world.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>15285</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>15285</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>15285</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a document entitled <inline font-style="italic">TGA report on information and advertising associated with products tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells</inline>.

It established, for the first time in this country, a national regulatory regime for fuel quality. That regime is backed up by a comprehensive monitoring and enforcement program that is among the best of its kind in the world. The Act ensures that key fuel parameters are regulated in a uniform manner throughout Australia and enables the Commonwealth to progressively tighten standards to achieve better environmental and operational outcomes.</para><para>The amendments in this bill will complement and enhance the existing regulatory regime by providing a power to introduce and enforce uniform national fuel labelling where such labelling is needed in the public interest. They will also ensure that the objectives of the Act can be achieved, by declaring key offence provisions to be offences of strict liability.</para><para>The bill establishes a comprehensive and transparent fuel labelling framework that fits comfortably within the existing regime of fuel quality regulation. This framework will provide for determinations to be made that set Fuel Quality Information Standards for specified supplies of specified fuels. This is a flexible mechanism and, in the first instance, will be used to set parameters that will apply to the labelling, at the point of sale, of ethanol blends. This step has been promised by the Government, and represents a crucial element in restoring consumer confidence in this renewable fuel.  </para><para>Each Fuel Quality Information Standard will set out the type and supply of fuel to which it applies, the information that must be provided in regard to the fuel, and the manner in which it must be provided. For example, a standard could be set in relation to retail sales of petrol at service stations, and require that labels stating the octane rating of the fuel be attached to each bowser. The standards would be enforced through Environment Australia's existing national fuel monitoring program.</para><para>Each Fuel Quality Information Standard could also impose information requirements on suppliers at other points in the fuel chain. In most cases this is likely to be an obligation on fuel suppliers to provide retailers with the information they need in order to comply with the standard—for example, whether or not the fuel contains components that are subject to a labelling standard.</para><para>Consistent with existing provisions for fuel quality standards, the bill also allows for variations to the Fuel Quality Information Standards to be granted in cases where strict application of the standard would be inappropriate or excessively burdensome, and where the objectives of the legislation would not be compromised.</para><para>To ensure transparency, the bill provides that Fuel Quality Information Standards and variations to these standards cannot be made without first consulting the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee, a body established under the existing Act to provide a voice to the many stakeholders affected by fuel regulation.</para><para>These amendments acknowledge that there are situations where consumers have a right to be informed about the attributes of the fuel they are buying, and in such cases, they need to be confident that this information will be consistent and reliable, even as they travel across State borders. This is something that cannot be achieved by relying on State labelling powers.</para><para>This bill also amends several key offences in the Act related to the supply of fuel that does not meet the Australian specifications. It is proposed that the key offences of: supplying `off-specification' fuel; altering fuel so that it doesn't meet the standards; and supplying or importing prohibited additives be made strict liability offences. Similarly, the new offences relating to the supply of fuel that doesn't meet the fuel quality information standards will be strict liability offences.

I did want to note for the record a couple of the comments from some of the industry bodies who have been commenting on these bills. The executive director of the Investment and Financial Services Association, Mr Richard Gilbert, said in his statement welcoming this package of measures:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Lower to middle income earners are the big winners after negotiations on the Superannuation Co-contribution Bill and the Surcharge Reduction initiative ... reached a successful conclusion.</para><para>“ ... the Democrats have brokered a compromise with the Government that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in superannuation tax in 15 years,” he said.</para></quote><para>Ms Philippa Smith from ASFA also put out a statement on the same day, and she said:</para><quote><para>Retirement savings for lower income earners could be boosted by as much as 70%, if they take advantage of the new co-contribution arrangements announced by the government ...</para><para>“We are delighted to see that common sense has triumphed on these superannuation measures, originally mooted by the government at the time of their re-election in 2001 ...</para></quote><para>So there is some very strong industry support for these measures, which we believe will significantly improve the attractiveness of superannuation as a savings vehicle. Before I conclude, I want to respond to a couple of the points made by Senator Sherry in his speech. As I said in my comments earlier, I would have preferred to have seen as small a cut as possible to the surcharge, and we have managed to minimise it as much as we can within this political environment. I will point out, though, before I am accused of providing huge tax cuts for the rich, that the tax cut that is involved here is one-quarter of the tax cut that Labor ticked off when the government halved the capital gains tax in 1999. It was a very significant reduction for high-income earners, for which Labor got nothing in return—nothing whatsoever, no concessions, no compromises, no nothing. Significantly, it is roughly the same size as the tax cut that again Labor supported for this category when it ticked off the tax cuts flowing out of this year's budget.</para><para>Finally, as I said earlier, Labor have already offered that group a two per cent tax cut, compared with the 2½ per cent that is in this package, by their proposal to provide the same tax cut across the board. From that point of view, Senator Sherry's contribution to the debate has been a little cute without necessarily recognising the benefits in this particular package. I agree with Senator Sherry, though, that the co-contribution is just a start. Senator Sherry did make the point—and it is a good point—that the government co-contribution proposed by the Keating government back in 1996 was much more substantial and much more wide ranging than this measure, but I hope this measure grows over time. If there is a demand for it—and the figures will be collected—and if the industry can get behind it and promote it as an encouragement for people to save, I hope this will become one of the most popular measures in superannuation law, at which point we can come back to this place and argue with some confidence to get the measure expanded further up the income scale and to get the co-contribution increased. We have to start somewhere, and I reckon $920 million over four years for low-income earners is a pretty good place to start. I think it is a very positive move. I commend this package of bills to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15291</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. At the end of my speech I will move, on behalf of the opposition, the second reading amendment that has been circulated in the chamber, on sheet No. 2991 revised. Honourable senators might recall that that was not ready to be moved when the shadow minister, Senator Sherry, was speaking.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is one of a package of bills presented by the government after agreement with the Democrats. It demonstrates yet again the failure by this government to properly deal with the central issue in superannuation in Australia, and that is the adequacy of retirement savings for low- and middle-income Australians. It is well documented that the present level of retirement savings of low- and middle-income Australians is simply insufficient to meet most of their needs for the sort of lifestyle they wish to have in retirement. A government that was serious about addressing this issue would look at a range of reforms in the superannuation sector to ensure that working Australians—not high-income Australians, but working Australians—and their families have reasonable and adequate retirement incomes later in their lives. This is important from many perspectives, but from one policy perspective—that is, the demographic trends in Australia—it is particularly important. We know that the Australian population is ageing and that an increasing percentage of the Australian population will, over time, be above what we now regard as normal retirement age. If we are to deal with this demographic trend without undermining the retirement incomes of this group of Australians, we have to increase their retirement savings. This is most important in respect of low- and middle-income earners.</para><para>The government's response to this important issue is the bill that is currently before the Senate: the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. </inline>This is a grossly inequitable piece of legislation. It is grossly unfair. It provides an exclusive tax cut for high-income Australians that starts when you earn over $94,691 a year, and you get the most benefit if you earn over $114,981 a year. Many Australians and their families can only dream of those incomes. This government has ensured that a tax cut is directed specifically at those high-income earners. This demonstrates that this government has the wrong priorities. It ought to be trying to lift the adequacy of the retirement savings of low- and middle-income families. It ought to be looking at alleviating the tax burden on the superannuation contributions for those low- and middle-income earners in order to address this adequacy issue. Instead, this government's priority is a tax cut for high-income earners—for people earning well over $94,000 a year, with the most benefit for those earning over $114,000. We know the government's priority is to reduce tax on high-income earners.</para><para>One thing that is clear about this legislation and its accompanying legislation on co-contributions is that there is one group of Australians who will get no benefit whatsoever out of the government's package nor out of the deal that has been done by the Australian Democrats with the government—that is, any Australian family earning between $40,000 and $94,000 a year. They gain no benefit whatsoever from this legislation. At one point in this debate I heard one of the Democrat senators having a go at the Labor Party, asking why we are championing middle Australia when we should be championing working-class Australia. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>—Good question.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOU</name.id><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name></talker><para>—Senator Cherry, I will explain it to you if you have not understood it. We will support the co-contributions legislation—the bills that are in this package—but we think it is a very small and a very inadequate step to deal with the issue of retirement savings for low-income Australians. It ought not be presented—as the Democrats seemed to try—as some saviour for low-income Australians. The evidence that was presented of the estimated take-up rate, along with people's anecdotal knowledge of low-income families, would suggest that the benefit will be very marginal indeed. If you are a single-income family earning less than $27,000 a year, what chance do you have to save $1,000 after health, education and living expenses in order to get the co-contribution?</para></talk.start></continue><para>But more importantly, perhaps the Democrat senators who are supporting this legislation can explain why they have agreed to an income tax reduction for high-income earners at the same time as they have supported a package which does absolutely nothing for any Australians earning between $40,000 and $94,691. When you consider the issue of the adequacy of retirement savings in this country, it seems remarkable that you would come to the Senate with a policy that completely ignores Australian families earning those sorts of incomes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>—We have to start somewhere.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOU</name.id><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name></talker><para>—I can tell you where I think we should not start: we should not start with a tax cut for people who are earning over $94,000 a year. If the best the Australian Democrats can do is assist this government in putting in place a tax cut with some deal that they try and hold up on the issue of low-income earners as providing balance to that tax cut, I think the Democrat senators have some way to go before they can actually say that they negotiated a reasonable outcome for poor and middle-income Australians in this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The co-contribution, which has been introduced at the same time as this legislation, is an attempt by the government to try and soften the blow of what most Australians would see as an unfair tax cut given to Australians who, frankly, probably do not need it—that is, people earning over $100,000 a year. The government tries to dress up the tax cut for wealthy Australians by saying, `We are going to have a co-contributions scheme as well. If you save $1,000, we will put $1,000 into your account.' For many Australian families on the sorts of incomes that we are looking at, that is great in theory but will mean very little in practice. For many Australian families, those earning $20,000 to $25,000 a year on a single income, the prospect of saving $1,000 after all the expenses that they have is highly unlikely. What we have in the package before the Senate is a guaranteed tax cut for those at the upper ends of the salary scale with a possible co-contribution for poorer, low-income Australians if they can manage to save $1,000 out of their family's budget.</para><para>Senator Cherry spoke of the administration costs of the surcharge tax. Some of the things which are not detailed in the regulatory impact statement with this legislation are precisely what the costs of dealing with the alterations to the surcharge will be and how they will be passed on to fund members. I want to comment briefly on the amount of tax that this government is now reaping from superannuation savings. When this government was elected in 1996, around $1.6 billion in taxation from superannuation contributions was received by the Commonwealth. Taxes have now reached a record level of $5 billion. In an environment of fiscal discipline, as we keep being told by this government, it may be the case that additional government contributions for low-income earners is beyond the short-term ability of this government to deliver. </para><para>I make the point again that an additional three per cent contribution for low-income earners was part of the Keating Labor government's policy, which did not require any co-contribution but which was a genuine attempt to deal with the retirement incomes of low-income Australians. But in these times when the government say, `We do not have enough money to make a three per cent contribution,' despite the fact that they indicated that they would do so, one would have thought that one of the ways they could try and deal with the issue of adequacy—that is, the amount of money saved by low- and middle-income Australians—would be to reduce the contributions tax for all Australians, particularly for those on low and middle incomes. Instead, what we have is a government that is prepared to reduce the taxation levied on high-income earners. People earning over $114,000 a year will be the primary beneficiaries of this; people earning between $40,000 and $94,000 will not receive one cent of benefit from this package. At the same time, we have the government cynically introducing legislation requiring from low-income earners a co-contribution when its own figures make it clear that the take-up rate will not be great and that it will be extremely difficult for many families on single incomes in particular to save the amount required in order to gain co-contribution.</para><para>The Labor Party's second reading amendment, which I will move shortly, goes to the heart of the issue that we say is problematic with this legislation—that it is completely unbalanced and skewed towards the interests of high-income earners by providing them with a guaranteed tax cut. It completely ignores Australians on middle incomes between $40,000 and $94,000. We also consider that there is questionable benefit in the co-contribution legislation which accompanies this.</para><para>We will be supporting the co-contribution because we think it is a small but necessary improvement in addressing the issue of retirement savings of low-income Australians, but the opposition's view is that the government could do significantly better than this in terms of policy to address retirement incomes of low-income Australians.

The measures were popularly received and contributed to the significant election win by the Howard government. I note that the ALP supports with some degree of qualification the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003,</inline> but it rejects the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I remind the Senate that earlier today Senator Kemp stated that this rejection was the greatest U-turn in the history of the parliament by the ALP and, in particular, by Senator Sherry. We all recall the early days when Senator Sherry harangued the Senate about the problems and inequities of the surcharge. Yet now, at the first opportunity we have to establish a measure to reduce that surcharge in part, he rejects that measure.</para></talk.start><para>The alternative suggested by the ALP of transferring the reduction from the existing 15 per cent surcharge to a 13 per cent contribution tax does not make sense. There is a huge black hole in Senator Sherry's argument, because for a person on $110,000 per year the saving is only $150. That saving, multiplied by the limited number of people—we acknowledge—who are going to benefit from this, compared with a two point per cent contribution covering a much greater number, does not make arithmetic sense. There is a big black hole created by the Labor Party in terms of the arithmetic.</para><para>I remind the Senate that an income of $110,000 per year includes termination benefits and FBT, so it is more than a salary. One of the inequities of the surcharge tax is that it does impact on some middle-income earners. A couple of days ago I indicated that I met with members of the Police Federation, who were very concerned that a number of their people who had particular illness problems because of the nature of their employment had sought early retirement only to be caught by this surcharge. They are not regarded as people on higher incomes but, because of the impact of fringe benefits and termination benefits, their income is grossed up and they suddenly become subject to the surcharge. Here we have an opportunity as a first step, albeit a small step, to make this change and it is rejected by the ALP. </para><para>I recall the time when this surcharge, or surtax, was introduced. It was introduced for a specific purpose: after the 1996 election we found a $10 billion black hole in the ALP's calculations in terms of budget deficit, and that had to be funded. Lots of people said, `This is just a short-term measure.' Unfortunately this short-term measure has gone on for a while. But, at the first opportunity that we have to reduce the surcharge, the bills are knocked back by the ALP.</para><para>You were talking about the huge benefits to high-income earners, Senator Sherry. I remind you that the saving is about $150 in the first year. It could be a lot less for a lot of other people. Senator Sherry, in rejecting this, you and all of your parliamentary colleagues, as people who are in defined benefit funds, have the advantage of the surcharge being capped at 15 per cent. But if you are outside the Commonwealth Public Service and the like, if you are in a defined benefit fund, you are not necessarily paying a surcharge of 15 per cent; you could be paying, for a successful fund, 20 per cent. Yet you are denying these very people an opportunity of some small reduction in the surcharge. I think it is time you looked at the equity of this issue. You had more commonsense five or six years ago than you are showing at the present time. We have particular problems with this surcharge and we must send a message to the electorate at large that this has got to be, over time, taken away. </para><para>I remind the Senate that it was Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer, who introduced the concept of a contribution tax. In modern-day thinking, practically all the commentators are saying, `This was wrong. We should move back to the original position of taxing the end benefits.' Therefore, it is very difficult for a government—and particularly for the Treasurer, Mr Costello—to suddenly forgo revenue of $900 million, which the surcharge raises annually, in one measure. So it was agreed in the proposition put to the Australian people that it should be progressively reduced. The first stanza was that it would be reduced progressively. As a result of the historic agreement with the Australian Democrats, that surcharge was reduced quite significantly. But there is still a message out there that we should go further, and there is a commitment to do so.</para><para>For the first year, 2003-04, the maximum rate is 14.5 per cent. Of course, that rate can be higher for people who belong to successful defined benefit funds. For the year 2005 and subsequent years, the rate becomes 12.5 per cent. We are not talking of massive tax savings to the rich. Senator Sherry, where is the inequity in these people paying tax—overall, in terms of the benefit—of between 46 and 64 per cent? That is what we are talking about. We are talking about pretty high taxes. Admittedly, they are the higher-income earners but, when the marginal tax rate for ordinary income is in the order of 48 per cent, why should superannuation be taxed much more heavily than the maximum on ordinary savings—up to 64 per cent for some people; between 48 per cent and 64 per cent. Even the tax on income from capital gains is a lot less. Where is the equity, in the Labor Party's vocabulary, of taxing people who have savings—admittedly the higher-income earners—of between 48 and 64 per cent? It is just not right.</para><para>As a result of a Senate committee inquiry, our attention has been drawn to the big savings gap between what people will have in 40 years time and their expected lifestyle. ISFA, in conjunction with Rice Walker, conducted some studies which showed that that gap was of the order of $600 billion. It is immaterial whether it is $500 billion or $700 billion. The point is that it is a very significant figure. What we have to do is move to encourage more retirement savings in Australia. We have already seen that there has been a dropping off of voluntary contributions, and the surcharge is certainly a contributing factor. Why would higher-income earners want to put money into superannuation when they are taxed at the sort of prohibitive marginal rates that are now on the books? In terms of equity, it has to be changed, and it has to be reduced.</para><para>The other very good measure is the co-contribution. I thank Senator John Cherry, who is a member of our superannuation committee, for entering meaningful discussions with the government to make this possible and allow this bill to proceed. Contributions and savings will significantly increase as a result of the incentives proposed by the co-contribution bill. It particularly targets the lower-income earners in society. If people who have incomes of up to $27,500 deposit $1,000 into a superannuation account, the government will pay a co-contribution of $1,000 into that account. If they cannot afford $1,000 but they put in $400, they will receive $400. For those who have incomes in excess of $27,500, it tapers off—to $40,000; at $40,000, there is no co-contribution. </para><para>I believe that is one of the best investments on the market. It has low risk, it has a very high return and it is not speculative in nature. Over time, I believe that there will be a very significant take-up. Initially over half a million people will be directly affected. I think that figure will grow substantially. Lower-income earners are being told, `We'll make contributions.' More and more people are seeing the need to increase their level of savings for their retirement. People recognise that, even in 40 years time, at nine per cent, without something extra they will have a shortfall in terms of their expectations and living standards. </para><para>And I put this to the Senate: how do we know that in 30 or 40 years time the Australian economy will be as robust as it is now? It is certainly going along very nicely, but if it is put in the hands of such irresponsible people as certain spokesmen of recent times we may not be in that fortunate position. I hate to suggest that, if the hands of those at the controls of government are not as responsible as they are at the present time, we may have to go down the track of a lot of countries in Europe which have to reduce retirement benefits. This is the situation where it really hurts.</para><para>There is no doubt about it. The measures this Commonwealth government has introduced will significantly improve people's retirement incomes. It is true that they might not meet people's expectations, but to meet people's expectations there also has to be some saving on their part. As a result of the age pension, the incentives that the Commonwealth government has provided and the superannuation guarantee, people are going to have a better standard of living than they would have had had these additional measures not been introduced.</para><para>It is a breath of fresh air to have such a measure. In fact, it is one of the most creative of the measures that have been suggested by the Liberal-National coalition in terms of lifting the levels of savings, particularly for lower-income earners. For example, moneys can be paid into the accounts of mothers who have had to take time out from the work force and then come back to the work force; they can get significant benefits out of this.</para><para>I commend the bills to the Senate. They will certainly increase the level of savings in this country and contribute very significantly to people's welfare when they retire. As earlier spokesmen have said, when this matter was put to a Senate committee there was overwhelming support for the concept of the co-contribution. Vince FitzGerald believed that overwhelming support would continue even if the contribution by the government was only 50 per cent of the contribution people made—50 per cent of every dollar they put in. But that is not the measure. The point is that it is a breakthrough in terms of philosophy and methodology. It is groundbreaking. It is going to be very significant in terms of the level of savings. There has always been a problem of how to creatively get those at the lower end of the spectrum of wage-earners in society to build up their superannuation accounts. Every contribution is going to be significant.</para><para>Like many other senators, I am grieved when people come to me and say, for example, that their sight is failing, they have an eye problem and it would take about $1,500 to $2,000 for an operation, they are not in Medibank and they have been told to wait 15 months to two years for an operation. Their standard of living during that period deteriorates because they cannot read or socialise and yet, if they had some money in the bank in the form of retirement savings, they could have the operation. </para><para>We are living longer, and the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has indicated various measures which can be undertaken to make retirement savings much more attractive. We can make them much more attractive—because at the present time they are not all that attractive—by changing the format of complying pensions and annuities. At the same time, if we follow the recommendations of the Senate committee report—many of whose issues have been very much maligned in the Senate today and earlier—we will have complying annuities and pensions which are much more attractive to the providers. There will be a re-entry of the providers into the market, and they will certainly be much more attractive to the retirees themselves. This is what we must have. We must have a mix of lump sum, complying pensions, annuities, allocated pensions et cetera, as well as other investments. It is by getting the most desirable mix that people's incomes in retirement are going to be adequate to meet their important needs.</para><para>So, savings is an important issue. It must not be underestimated, and the superannuation committee have spent a lot of time on it. I notice the next contributor to this debate is going to be Senator Hogg, a very valuable contributor with experience within industry who recognises the need for savings and the need to protect those savings. I still think the challenge is out there. We have had an adverse report from APRA about the supervision that is being offered over superannuation accounts in Australia, and the challenge is now to APRA to lift their game and ensure that there is adequate, comprehensive audit and surveillance of people's superannuation savings, because we cannot afford for it to fail.</para><para>On the other hand, retirees must also plan to save more than they really think may be necessary. Why do I say that? Because there will always be occasions, over a 40-year period, when you get negative returns. A lot of superannuation funds factor these in as one in seven or one in eight years. When you retire you must also take account of a particular market slump if you are heavily into equities or, in particular, into property. That is why we have said superannuation funds themselves must provide better education to assist their members throughout the accumulation phase, but particularly before they retire because often they receive this big lump sum, they are out of the work force and they do need guidance. If we could have a move towards accumulation sums, so that some of these funds could provide income streams, I think we would have an improved superannuation system in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>15297</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Having listened to Senator Watson speak on the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>, I must acknowledge that Senator Watson, as a long-term Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, is probably far and away the most knowledgeable person on superannuation on the other side of the chamber. Having said that, when one looks at the issue of superannuation, it really gets to the heart of the third plank that I outlined in my original speech in this chamber about giving people dignity in retirement. I will lead on later to just where the shortfall in superannuation will be in giving people the dignity that they would expect. There is a difference, I will acknowledge, between expectations and what actually can be achieved but, having said that, let us look first at the initiative in the co-contribution. </para></talk.start><para>The co-contribution is going to be available to a maximum of $1,000 where an employee contributes $1,000 over 12 months to a superannuation fund or RSA. That maximum is going to apply to people who earn less than $27,500. Therein lies one of the fundamental problems of this government initiative. Whilst it is welcome, and it is targeting low-income people, it is targeting people who have the least capacity to contribute in their own right. I know that from being a long-term trade union official. The figure quoted there is getting close to the figure that a number of people earn in the retail industry and the fast food industry, where I have vast experience and know that many of these people live from hand to mouth. They do not have a great deal of discretionary income available to them to salt into something such as a co-contribution.</para><para>Whilst it appears attractive on the surface, the first issue that I must raise about the co-contribution is that, even if these people can afford to contribute the maximum of $1,000 and receive the maximum $1,000 contribution from the government, that in reality will be $850, if I read the legislation correctly, because that $1,000 will be subject to the contributions tax. That is something that has not been clarified to date in spite of the inquiries that I have made. You shake your head, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, but you should not be participating in the debate from the chair. Having said that, though, I have asked sources to clarify that. If it can be clarified in this debate, it will be helpful indeed. But if that is true then it is not the boon that it is made out to be. And if the $1,000 that the person pays in themselves—and that the government pays—is subject to the contributions tax then how is it going to be exempt from the contributions tax? Where in the legislation is it exempt from the contributions tax? Even if the $1,000 is put into the account in full, the fact of life is that, for many of those people, $1,000—which does not sound a great deal to many people—is $20 a week out of discretionary income and $20 which many of them would not have.</para><para>If one looks at the sliding scale, as was indicated by an earlier speaker, it cuts out at $40,000. Those people are on a weekly income of about $800 per week. Whilst they may well have a greater capacity to pay, because of the sliding scale from the $27,500 per annum income up to the $40,000, they will not attract anywhere near the same benefit as those who earn less than the $27,500.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Watson</name></talker><para>—It is an after-tax contribution.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Now that you are interjecting from your spot, Senator Watson, if it is an after-tax contribution it has not been made clear and has not been obvious to date. If that is the case, it is still but a mere bandaid in giving people a decent retirement benefit. Those people who have had a cursory look at this could come to the conclusion that this is something that will benefit those who are in a partnership where one of the partners is a high-income earner and the other earns less than $27,500. Of course, in that set of circumstances, it will be quite easy for $1,000 to be contributed on behalf of the lower income earner. But where the household income is only at a level of $27,500—and that was the point made by Senator Wong—then those people are going to struggle greatly to make a contribution anywhere near $1,000 and get the benefit of it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I understand it, and this is something else that needs to be clarified for me, the money, once placed in the superannuation fund, is preserved, as are all superannuation funds. I have no problem with that, but I do not know if the public understands that. I do not know if the public understands that these funds, once placed and once having attracted the benefit, are preserved. I am not saying that it is improper; I am just saying that there may well be confusion out there and that some people will see it as an opportunity to salt away some money for a time of need and then apply to get hold of it.

There is no explanation that I can find, in relation to this bill, of the impact on the adequacy of the investment for the retirement of the superannuant.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Watson</name></talker><para>—Just one measure.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Yes, but there is no projection as to how that will pan out for the individual in the longer term. There is obviously a cost to the government of this initiative, and I do not believe that the initiative will be taken up with the force that the government is hoping for at this stage. It would be interesting to see if there is a model floating around which shows what impact this will have on pensions in the longer term. That would be interesting indeed, but I do not think it is available at this stage. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I recall when we were looking at the adequacy of superannuation, and I was then a member of the superannuation committee, we did get a fair deal of modelling of what the benefits would be under certain circumstances, and a range of circumstances were covered. I am not going to go into them in this debate, but we did see the impact that making different changes in the superannuation mix had and how that would benefit individuals in the longer term. From my reading of the information that is around, that is not available. I would suspect, from what I am going to mention in a moment from an earlier report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that the benefit is not going to impact greatly on the retirement benefit that is available for these people when they do reach retiring age. </para><para>On that note, I am going to look briefly at the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation entitled <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation and standards of living in retirement</inline>. It is a report on the adequacy of tax arrangements for superannuation and related policy, and it is dated December 2002. There are some interesting statements on page 140 in the report, where the committee looks at the modelling that was done by Treasury. At 12.30, the report says:</para><quote><para>Treasury's modelling of retirement incomes reinforces the Committee's concern. As noted, Treasury's modelling using standard assumptions indicates that a single male aged 65, retiring in 2032 following 40 years in the workforce at 1.5 times AWOTE will draw 82 per cent of the age pension.</para></quote><para>The report goes on:</para><quote><para>For a single male in the same situation drawing exactly AWOTE, Treasury's modelling indicates that he will draw 90 per cent of the age pension.</para></quote><para>That was the modelling that was done in that instance. The report, at 12.31, goes on:</para><quote><para>By 2050, with a mature superannuation system, it is expected that the proportion of people aged 65 and over not receiving the pension will rise to around 25 per cent, and of those that do receive the pension, only about one third will receive the full rate.</para></quote><para>The question that I have posed is: how will this initiative of the co-contribution impact, given what we have heard in terms of modelling that was done by Treasury, in terms of one and 1.5 times AWOTE? If my recollection is correct, we looked at 0.75 of average weekly ordinary time earnings as well. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—But, Senator Watson, that has not been supplied this time around. It would be handy to see the impact of this measure and just how much it really will bite. The advisers might have it there, but to my knowledge it certainly has not been made available at this stage. The committee report went on to say:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>However, in the Committee's view, to reduce pressure on the age pension, through a heightened emphasis on individual self-reliance, the Government should continue to strive for universal and adequate superannuation coverage for all Australians including employees, the self-employed and non-working people, with a focus on assisting low and middle income earners.</para></quote><para>I think that that had it right, but I do not think that the prescription we have been handed up in this bill has got it right. Whilst it is laudable—and the co-contribution is there—and whilst it is targeted at people who are earning in round figures less than $550 a week, as I say, for many of those people the capacity even to start to maximise the return out of the co-contribution is going to be very limited indeed. So the expectations that the government have built around this cause some concern.</para><para>The other issue that I want to raise very briefly before I get onto the surcharge is about the indexation of the threshold. Again, this is not clear in what I have read to date in the bill. As I understand it, the threshold of $27,500 will not be indexed until the 2007-08 year. That is when the intention is to move the rate from $27,500. I am not sure what the indexation will be at that time or what it will take the rate to, but if one projects even a three per cent movement in salaries over that period of time then the way I read the initiative of the government at this stage—and I stand to be corrected—is that there will be people slipping down the schedule in the period between now and when the threshold is indexed in the 2007-08 year.</para><para>If that is correct—and I have to say that I am basing it on a three per cent increase in wages each year—it means that someone who is currently able to receive the maximum of $1,000, for example, on a salary of just less than $27,500 would move to a salary of roughly $28,000, which would see their co-contribution fall from $1,000 to $960. If the same three per cent applies in the 2004-05 year—if I am interpreting the bill correctly—their co-contribution will fall to roughly $880, then to $800 and then to $720. That is for someone who was just within the maximum limits to start off with. If that is not the case, what protection will there be in the bill for those people, to ensure that their rate of co-contribution is protected in the period between now and 2007-08, when I understand that the rate will be changed?</para><para>Of course, it affects those at the other end of the scale—let us say those earning around the $36,000 mark. If the scenario that I have painted there is correct, some of those people will fall off the co-contribution scale by 2007-08. If that is not the case then that needs to be cleared up. But all the inquiries that I have made to date have not had an answer that indicates that what I am saying is incorrect. So, whilst it is an effort on the part of the government to address the issue of long-term superannuation to give people security in their retirement, it falls well short of the mark in achieving what needs to be achieved in this area. A massive government commitment indeed will be needed to fund pensions in the longer term. Any action that can be taken now to alleviate that need is welcome. But, whilst this is an attempt on the part of the government to do so, it certainly does not go far enough.</para><para>I turn to the surcharge. One has to say that that is a very disappointing action by the government. As my colleague Senator Sherry has already indicated, the surcharge was a complex tax in the first instance. As Senator Sherry said, we opposed it because it broke the promises of the government. It took the government a long time even to admit that the surcharge was a tax. It took them a great deal of difficulty to come to grips with that. But, now that the government have gone down that path—now that we know that it is a tax—I must say that, in my view, it is a tax that targets people with the greatest capacity to pay. I know that that is not the government philosophy; it is the philosophy that I and my colleagues believe in: that those with the greatest capacity to pay should pay the greatest amount of taxation. It was a bungling tax that was put in place in the first instance—as you know, Senator Watson. It was a tax that was very complex. It was going to be very costly to collect and it was going to be costly to the funds. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—But it was costly to all the people in the fund; therefore, reducing it and giving those people who are at the lower end of the income scale no benefit whatsoever, and giving those in the middle in particular absolutely no result out of this package, leaves a lot to be desired indeed. Senator Watson knows that when we did some of the modelling—and I am glad Senator Watson is here because he is helping me in this and it is always good to have his help—and looked at the adequacy of superannuation, we saw how the issue of contributions tax could be addressed to ensure that the accumulation that was coming to the superannuants was working to their benefit. The proposal that has been put forward in the second reading amendment by Senator Nick Sherry is commendable indeed because he advocates that there should be a cut in the contributions tax without specifying the amount. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15301</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased indeed to be able to sum up this debate on some landmark superannuation legislation to deliver some real and significant benefits to a wide range of Australians trying to save for their retirement. The government first foreshadowed the superannuation co-contribution for low-income earners and the surcharge rate reduction measures in its pre-election superannuation policy statement, A Better Superannuation System. The Prime Minister announced this policy on 5 November 2001, almost two years ago. The statement was designed to provide greater incentives for voluntary superannuation contributions and to make superannuation relatively more attractive compared with other forms of non-concession taxed savings. It also included measures to remove inequities in the system to improve security of superannuation benefits, to broaden the availability of superannuation to more Australians and to promote the value of lifelong saving. </para></talk.start><para>Among the measures to provide greater incentives for voluntary contributions was the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme. The government recognised that more incentives were needed for low-income earners to increase their level of voluntary superannuation saving, thereby achieving greater self-reliance in retirement. The scheme will replace the previous $100 low-income earner superannuation contribution tax offset. Another component of this package of measures was the proposal to reduce the maximum superannuation contribution and termination payment surcharge rates to encourage those who can afford to save for their retirement to do so and thereby take pressure off the future age pension system. </para><para>As I announced on 7 September 2003, the government negotiated an agreement with the Australian Democrats to enable passage of both these measures, following the failure of the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 to obtain a second reading in the Senate on 24 June this year. Savings generated from the smaller reduction in the superannuation surcharge rates will be applied to the co-contribution measure, thereby enabling the government to extend the parameters of the co-contribution scheme. The changes mean that the total pool of money spent on the co-contribution and surcharge rate reduction measures is now applied in favour of low-income earners in the proportion of 66 per cent to 34 per cent over the budget years 2004-05 to 2007-08.  </para><para>I foreshadow that in the committee stage I will move amendments to these bills to give effect to this agreement. In passing, I do commend the Democrats for the constructive approach that they have taken towards ensuring that the government can deliver these very important measures to Australians saving for their retirement. The co-contribution amendments will mean that people earning up to $40,000 will now qualify for a co-contribution if they make eligible personal superannuation contributions. This measure is a significantly greater incentive than the current tax offset it is replacing, which phased out on an income of $31,000, and will be a direct injection into the retirement savings of this category of people. </para><para>In addition, the thresholds will be indexed from the 2007-08 income year onwards to maintain the relative target group of the measure. The co-contribution amendments also provide for the measure to now apply to eligible personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July 2003. Further to this, the date that superannuation providers must give statements for the purposes of the co-contribution will be prescribed in regulations to enable the government to provide industry groups with time to implement the necessary alterations to their systems. </para><para>Finally, the co-contribution amendments also provide for additional reporting to the parliament on a quarterly and annual basis. These reports will cover the operation of the co-contribution measure, including details about the recipients and payments made. The surcharge rate reduction amendments will provide for a smaller reduction in the superannuation surcharge rates. Rather than reductions of 1.5 per cent per year for three years, the maximum surcharge rates will now be reduced by half a per cent in the first year and by one per cent in each of the two subsequent financial years. The reduction in the surcharge rates will also be delayed. Consequently, the reductions will commence from 1 July 2003. Together, these measures—that is, the revised co-contribution and surcharge measures—are significant steps in improving the availability and the attractiveness of superannuation. The measures remove some of the disincentive of the extra charge facing those who are able to save more for their retirement and will no doubt do so, and it will significantly boost the savings of lower income earners. I do commend these bills to the Senate. Whilst I seek the support of the Senate for the requests for amendments and the amendments in the committee, I note that the Labor Party will be opposing some of the amendments.</para><para>In the time left to me in my summing-up speech, I want to deal with some of the points raised by earlier speakers. The first point I wish to deal with was made by Senator Sherry. He said that reducing the surcharge rate is inequitable and provides an exclusive tax cut—which I think is what he said—to high-income earners. One of the main themes of the government's superannuation policy statement, A Better Superannuation System—launched during the election—was to make superannuation more attractive and to encourage all Australians, no matter what their income, to save for their retirement. The government's measure to reduce the superannuation surcharge is indeed a modest reduction in the charge over and above the tax that affected Australians pay on their superannuation. The surcharge rate reduction will go towards removing the disincentive facing employees who have the ability to save for their own retirement. This will—and is designed to—take the pressure off the pension system as our population ages so that those who really need it will be able to avail themselves of it. </para><para>When you consider whether or not it is equitable to reduce the superannuation surcharge, a measure the government introduced—and, Senator Sherry said, boasted about—it is important to point out that, due to the budget surplus resulting from the economic and other good management of the government, the government can reduce a disincentive facing employees who have the ability to save for their retirement. It is no secret that I would have liked to have reduced the superannuation surcharge much more—and I think Senator Cherry said that he would have preferred to have not reduced it—but politics is all about compromise and about getting outcomes that are ultimately to the benefit of the Australian people. I feel very confident that we got that with this measure.</para><para>The next point dealt with by Senator Sherry, I think, was that parliamentarians will benefit from the surcharge reduction. Senator Sherry well knows that members and senators are treated no differently from other taxpayers and that parliamentarians also pay the charge over and above the tax that everyone pays. If the measure is criticised on that ground, there is absolutely no need for any parliamentarian—from the other side or, indeed, in the other place—to accept this reduction. I throw out this challenge to each and every one of you who criticises it: stand up, identify yourselves and say that you are going to give it back and that you will not accept it. I am very surprised that the Labor Party would oppose this modest cut. With all the sound and fury at the time the surcharge was introduced, it seems quite extraordinary that there is now a backflip—a U-turn—and that even a modest cut is opposed. The surcharge reduction is just part of a package of measures that quite rightly includes a generous government co-contribution of up to $1,000 per year that is available only to lower- to middle-income earners. That is why the package is fair.</para><para>I think Senator Wong said that only those taxpayers earning more than $94,000 will benefit from the surcharge reduction. I wish to take issue with that because it shows some misunderstanding of how the surcharge works. The surcharge thresholds relate to an individual's adjusted taxable income. The ATI—or adjusted taxable income—is a combination of taxable income, surchargeable contributions and reportable fringe benefits. Consequently, an affected individual's income could be significantly less than $94,691 but the individual could still be subject to the surcharge. I think Senator Cherry said that one concern about this is that the people who pay the surcharge are not all from the big end of town; some who pay the surcharge get tipped into doing so by circumstances. They may have had an interrupted work pattern, and that particularly affects women and part-time workers, or they might have been retrenched, got another job and tried very hard to save for their retirement but run up against the surcharge. That is not a desirable outcome. It is important that this is on the record so that those listening to this debate know that at least the Democrats and the government are concerned to try and alleviate some of the burden from that category of person facing the surcharge. </para><para>Senator Wong also said that in her view it would be difficult—and, if I heard correctly, she said extremely difficult—for families to save any money so as to qualify for the co-contribution. It is hard to take this as a serious criticism. To assume that somehow or other those on low incomes are too poor to really count and to qualify for the co-contribution is very patronising. The government want to help ordinary workers save for their retirement. We think this is an honourable aim. We think it is important that those on low incomes are treated with some dignity and are given the opportunity to make what contribution they can to their own retirement, to their own savings, and that they should be given some assistance to do this.</para><para>The co-contribution measure provides an opportunity for low-income earners to take advantage of greater incentives than those that currently exist—and I have already explained the measure it is replacing—to improve their self-reliance in retirement by saving through superannuation. If they start early, they will do very well out of the co-contribution. Even if they are some way into what one might call their superannuation life—their time of making contributions to superannuation—every bit helps. Once again, it will mean they can have a better outcome than they would have if they were relying on the pension alone. As I have said, the government think this is important. Our estimate is that 540,000 low-income earners will receive a co-contribution in 2004-05. It is not only the government's view that this is a very positive thing; the Investment and Financial Services Association says that the co-contribution is likely to produce a significant increase in the number of people making voluntary contributions, and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia—ASFA—claims that the measure has the potential to boost retirement savings for people on lower incomes. Indeed, they showed us some very high figures with respect to how retirement income could be enhanced by the co-contribution.</para><para>Senator Wong also spoke about the inadequacy of retirement savings. I must say I am completely taken aback that Senator Wong can stand in this place, suggest that retirement savings are inadequate and then suggest that the attempts of the government—and indeed, the Democrats—to increase savings should be opposed. It is more like a co-contradiction than a co-contribution. The co-contribution will provide a significant increase in the savings of lower-income earners and the modest surcharge reduction will encourage those who can afford to save for their retirement to do so. That is as it should be. Both of these measures are costed and on the table. It is up to the Senate now to recognise this package and to support these measures.</para><para>Senator Sherry also talked about wealthy households being able to use the co-contribution as a tax minimisation vehicle, which would be an important point if it were not jumping at shadows. The co-contribution is not a tax break; it is a contribution to retirement savings. There is also no evidence to support any assertion that only wealthy households will benefit from the co-contribution. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that the co-contribution will somehow become a tax minimisation vehicle. If there is some evidence, bring it forward. There is no evidence at all, so far as I can tell, that it is likely to be abused.</para><para>The co-contribution was said by Senator Hogg to be subject to contributions tax—at least he raised that question, which to a large extent proves that Senator Hogg is just spouting a speech rather than looking at the proposed legislation. Neither the original undeducted contribution nor the government co-contribution will be subject to the contributions tax. If Senator Hogg is listening, or if he cares to go back to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I draw his attention to items 4 to 6 of schedule 1 part 1 of the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>, where he will find his answer. It indicates that those opposite have probably given this legislation a cursory look, or it would have been pretty obvious. Senator Hogg also wondered whether co-contributions are preserved. Of course, co-contributions mirror the treatment of the eligible personal superannuation contributions that they match. All personal contributions since 1 July 1999 are preserved until retirement and so are co-contributions. </para><para>Some of the speeches made on the other side took what I would describe as a pretty churlish approach to a landmark agreement that is capable of delivering super benefits to Australians. It is surprising that these measures, which are overwhelmingly in the interests of a broad range of Australians, are opposed at all. Then again, we have to understand that superannuation and everything to do with it seems to excite opposition. The measures that are being brought forward in these bills have been welcomed generally in the community. They are overdue; they should have been delivered earlier than they have been.

stated that the reason for reducing the high-income earners' surcharge tax rate is to encourage those who have the ability to save to be able to do so. That is not a direct quote but a summary of her explanation. What concerns the Labor Party about that argument, and the reason we do not accept it, is that if that is the case why did the government introduce the surcharge in the first place? It is a contradictory argument about the initial introduction of the surcharge. It is not my intention to spend an enormous amount of time talking about the introduction of the surcharge today, but I just make that point.</para></talk.start><para>More particularly, the argument implies that people who are on taxable incomes below the surcharge rate—where the surcharge rates cuts in, which is $94,691 in the 2003-04 financial year—do not need an additional incentive to save, whether it is by way of a co-contribution or a cut in their contributions taxes on superannuation. I would argue that they do. I would argue that it is not just high-income earners who need a tax reduction in order to encourage them to save. It is not just to encourage them to save; the outcome of a tax reduction on superannuation contributions must produce a higher level of superannuation retirement savings on compulsory contributions, and there is some incentive effect with respect to increasing the level of voluntary contributions. </para><para>So I do not accept this argument that it is high-income earners who need the additional incentive to save. I would argue that all Australians need a tax cut on their superannuation in order to give a higher retirement income on their compulsory superannuation contributions and on their voluntary contributions—these pre tax so-called salary sacrifice contributions—and, in addition, a reduction of the tax on superannuation contributions for all Australians who pay the contributions tax. That would also improve the incentive for those earning less than $94,691 taxable income and would assist them to fill in the gap.</para><para>There is no doubt that there is a retirement savings gap for a very significant number of Australians in respect of superannuation. I am not going to attempt to define this gap today. A number of recent reports, including a Senate committee report, have made the point that the sad, unfortunate fact is that a majority of Australians are not going to achieve a retirement income that is at least reasonably close to their pre-retirement income. It is not just high-income earners with a taxable income of greater than $94,691 who will struggle to fill the gap; it is low- to middle-income earners—most Australians earning up to $94,691. They need additional retirement income because of a tax reduction on their compulsory contributions and on their voluntary contributions. This is the great hole in the government's approach. There is nothing for Australians—2½ million of them—earning between $40,000 and a taxable income of $94,691.</para><para>The minister made the point that a number of Australians who have an income of less than $94,691 are caught by the surcharge because the definition of their taxable income is broader than their straight wage or salary income. That is a correct point to make, but it is this government that, three or four years ago, broadened the definition of the income base to include things like FBT. It extended the surcharge application by broadening the definition of income. And here today the minister would have us believe that these people, however many there are earning a money income of less than $94,691, need assistance when the government themselves put them in that definition.</para><para>Having made those points, I have a couple of quite specific questions. I believe the government would have these figures because they have had to estimate a financial impact of the reduction in the surcharge tax rate. Could the minister provide an estimate—and I stress the word `estimate' because I am not going to hold to the nearest one, 1,000 or even 10,000—of the number of Australians whose taxable income is at the maximum surchargeable tax rate, and let us use $114,981, or greater?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>15310</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will try to get Senator Sherry some information in answer to his question in a moment. I will ask the officials. I think Senator Sherry's remarks indicate that he has failed to grasp that the surcharge is an extra charge over and above the tax that everyone pays. Even if the surcharge were reduced and taken off completely, those on high incomes would be paying tax. The whole point of reducing the surcharge is to remove the disincentive that the surcharge obviously provides to people who otherwise could save more for their retirement, because they not only pay the tax that everybody else pays but also cop the surcharge on top of that.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Sherry seems to suggest that everyone is just on a continuum and that those on a surcharge are going to get some added benefit. According to this arrangement some of the disincentive to making extra voluntary contributions will be removed but they will continue to pay the tax that everyone else pays. I think that the whole nature of the surcharge and what it does provides a disincentive to saving. It is important that that disincentive gets removed while we still retain the tax structure that everybody else pays under. I think when senators look at that, by way of a distinction, they will see that it is of a different character with very different consequences. Removing a disincentive is a bit different under the circumstances to providing some additional tax incentive. </para><para>Senator Sherry was seeking an estimate and I think the point he makes is about the government having broadened the definition of income. The original surcharge legislation calculated liability on adjusted taxable income, as I mentioned a little earlier, and this figure is not taxable income. It includes certain super contributions and always has. I think that that is probably the fundamental point that we have not quite come to grips with in looking at the difference between what the surcharge does and what otherwise taxable income does. This figure is not taxable income and that is really the point.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>15311</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am still waiting for an answer to my quite specific question about the estimated number of Australians who earn $114,981 or more in taxable Australian income. The minister must have that figure available because she would need to know that in order to work out the financial impact of this measure. The minister has referred to the disincentive to save. Senator Cherry and Senator Greig might remember that I used to pepper Senator Kemp, the previous Assistant Treasurer, with questions in question time about disincentives to save. Senator Kemp would always come back and quote me the latest contributions going into super. I think they were somewhat misleading figures because I think he included earnings in that figure as well. Senator Kemp's contention, at least up until he ended his tenure as Assistant Treasurer, was that there was no impact by the surcharge on saving levels in Australia. Question time in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was littered with quotes. So the minister's position today is contradictory. She points to the decline in superannuation assets over the last 18 months. I am familiar with the APRA survey figures. The voluntary contributions to superannuation have dropped by about 17 or 18 per cent in the last year and the total level of superannuation savings has already dropped. I cannot recall the exact figures.</para></talk.start><para>My argument is that this is not because of the surcharge. I do not think it has anything to do with the surcharge. It is for the fundamental reason that fund earnings have been negative. For a significant number of fund members, in the last financial year fund earnings were negative, so their balances have been going backwards. For the 2001-02 financial year almost every fund member's earnings on their superannuation were negative. That is the reason that total savings in superannuation have dropped. It is because of the markets. That has undermined confidence in superannuation and that is why voluntary contributions to superannuation have dropped, as I said, by approximately 17 per cent over a year. It has nothing to do with the surcharge. </para><para>It is because of the lack of confidence. People are seeing for the first time in 12 or 13 years widespread negative returns with respect to superannuation. There have been some other factors—for example, increasing concern about fees, charges and commissions; people worrying that they are not getting value for money in at least some cases; negative comment about the activities of some financial planners; and issues relating to theft and fraud. Again, they are very small in the context of total superannuation savings; but, when you get superannuation lost as a result of theft and fraud and it gets a lot of publicity, it does have a negative impact. For those reasons savings in superannuation have declined significantly. Before I get to my next question I am seeking a response to my question about the estimated total number of people whose surchargeable tax income is $114,981 or greater. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15312</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The estimate of the number of Australians whose taxable income is at the maximum tax rate is coming across, as I understand it, and will be here shortly. In relation to the other comments Senator Sherry has made, it is very difficult to be categorical about why superannuation savings have declined. There are a number of reasons. As we all know, superannuation is a long-term investment and it cannot be that anyone has any real concern about the safety of superannuation because relatively speaking, as Philippa Smith, the CEO of ASFA, has pointed out on many occasions, compared to the amount of savings in super the defalcations are indeed very small. As Senator Sherry would know, we are very concerned and keen to ensure that proper compensation is made to those who are otherwise eligible under the SI(S) Act for compensation, and that has been something that I have taken extremely seriously. So that cannot be one of the reasons.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed, you could not be sure that the disincentive of copping an extra surcharge would not be a significant reason why those with more disposable income to make voluntary contributions to super would not wish to, if they are going to pay something over and above the tax that everybody else pays—an extra charge. If indeed any of those who are facing the surcharge are mindful of any of the points that Senator Sherry has raised as reasons why savings have declined, one reason would have to be that people would be disinclined to have to pay an extra charge.</para><para>The earnings have been negative but, in conjunction with the surcharge, this does provide a clear disincentive, I would have thought, to somebody being asked to put in a lot of money—somebody who could make voluntary contributions over and above what is otherwise the superannuation guarantee—which would really make a difference to their savings and retirement income. There is no doubt that reducing the surcharge will increase the attractiveness of super as a savings vehicle. That is what it is designed to do and all of the indications are that it will indeed have the effect.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15312</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While we are waiting for the answer the minister has indicated is on the way, could I also have an estimate—again, it should be available given the estimates of the costs—of the number of people between the lowest level at which the surcharge tax rate cuts in, which is $94,691, and the upper level at which the 15 per cent rate cuts in, which is $114, 981?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—It is on its way.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Could I have an estimate of the number of Australians with taxable incomes that fall between $40,000, which is the upper limit of the low-income earners co-contribution, which we will get to in the next bill, and $94,691?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—Yes, Senator Sherry, we will get those estimates.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

The minister's argument is that the incentive to save will be increased. Therefore, in terms of the record in this debate, it would be useful to know the existing levels of contribution to superannuation at the surchargeable tax income level so that, at some future date, the argument can be tested. So we would like to know the level of superannuation contributions at that income level. It may not be possible to give a reasonable estimate at $94,691 and $114,981, but there must be some data about the existing contributions levels at what is broadly known as the higher income level.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>15313</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can provide some information in relation to a couple of Senator Sherry's questions.

What I suspect it will show is that the revenue collected from the surcharge tax, notwithstanding the cut to the rates, will still increase over time. I will be interested to see the figures. The next question relates to the issue that I raised of the benefit to parliamentarians from this tax cut. The minister has argued that the percentage rate reductions are relatively modest—notwithstanding Labor does not agree with any exclusive tax cuts to high-income earners—but the benefit that would flow to politicians, to judges, to the Governor-General reflects the effective level of contribution into their defined benefit fund. Therefore, you have a defined benefit fund that is paying effective contributions higher than the community norm, which is nine per cent—and I know it is much higher for politicians, judges and the Governor-General. And it is higher for military personnel, for example, although certainly not as high as for public servants in the Commonwealth Public Service and certainly nowhere near as high as for politicians, judges and the Governor-General. Could I have a figure on the estimated average level of benefit for a member of the federal parliament on a backbench salary, after the four years, after the full tax cut has been phased in; the level of benefit that flows to a judge, whatever the basic salary is of a judge; and the same information in respect of the Governor-General?

My question in respect of judges applied to Federal Court judges, because I am aware of the problem that the minister mentioned in respect of some state judges. I am not sure how many state jurisdictions there are, but there are some state jurisdictions where the surcharge tax does not apply at all following a court ruling. My attitude is that, if everyone is going to pay the tax, everyone should pay it; there should not be exemptions.

You cannot have a piece of legislation like this where there is a major benefit to members of parliament which is not recognised as such. That is why the Greens were so keen on keeping the requirement that it be stated during the course of the debate—I did so earlier during the debate on these matters, but I will do it again—that we have a pecuniary interest involved here. Because in getting the legislation through, those who vote for it will gain greatly and those who vote against it will also gain greatly. We should recognise that, because it does influence the way that we think about these matters. It is an important exercise to go through. Unfortunately the need for that provision was taken from the statute books—and that is the way I voted earlier this week—but it is a very good case in point of where we should be aware of it and we should be stating it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>15316</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Dealing with Senator Sherry's question, Senator Sherry said that he was not seeking individual details but, in his earlier question, he said that he wanted to know what the Prime Minister's surchargeable contribution was—and he is only one.

There are many, many parliamentarians who have other business interests, investments and other income. I would have thought that, when you consider that, the only way to find out averages is to go and ask the individuals. You cannot get it from the tax returns.

Senator Cherry, you make the point that I made: because of the level of effective contribution, because of the defined benefit fund—which I would describe as generous compared to the community standard of nine per cent—we would like to know how the surcharge is going to affect politicians, since the Treasurer, Mr Costello, literally made such a big song and dance about it. I recall him dancing the macarena on TV after he had talked about the surcharge and how it was going to actually affect politicians. He is the one who made it an issue. I did not raise that as an issue at the time; he did. He boasted that it was going to apply to politicians.

I have just about concluded the questions, and I have not got the answers to most of the questions. I do not think the questions that I have put are unreasonable. I do not think it is unreasonable to expect someone like Mr Gallagher or the Government Actuary to be online or in the chamber to give us an estimate.

I hope I gleaned the questions from your last contribution. Like Senator Sherry, I also claim to be somebody who tries to provide to the best of my ability information to the Senate that is appropriate to be asked. I have indicated throughout the time that the committee has been sitting this evening which information can be got and which information cannot be got. I have indicated why some information is not available and, where I have information, I am bringing it forward. The level of contributions at specific income ranges is information that Senator Sherry would wish to hear. From the 1999-2000 data file, average surchargeable contributions were in the $94,000 to $114,000 income range. There are surchargeable contributions of $14,300. In the $114,000-plus income range, the contribution is $25,000. That provides some information on average surchargeable contributions within income ranges. </para></talk.start><para>The other thing I can say, and this is an estimate that Senator Sherry has asked for, is that the benefit for most parliamentarians will be in the order of 2.5 per cent of their surchargeable contributions per year after three years. One of the reasons why Treasury does not have information relating to all groups and all contributors, as Senator Sherry would know, is that Treasury and actuaries often work from samples and not from all contributors. Senator Sherry has my assurance that where the information is available or reasonably available it will be brought forward. In his last contribution Senator Sherry got onto compliance cost impact and delay in commencement. My advice is that there are no compliance costs associated with the surcharge.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15319</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I learnt a long time ago that many people do not understand the impact of a percentage, so I would like money figures with respect to parliamentarians, Federal Court judges and the Governor-General. I think that would give the public a more accurate idea of the level of benefit. Money figures are more easily understood than percentage figures. So, in addition to the costings questions that I have asked, the minister can anticipate that there will be a similar range of questions about the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 when we get to it. It is not my intention to ask any more questions of significance about this bill. I do not think that the opposition has been unreasonable about the number of questions asked and points it has made about this bill in the committee stage. </para></talk.start><para>We are finishing deliberating on this matter at 6.50, so I ask, Minister, as you will have the opportunity overnight, that you seek further answers to the questions that I have posed to date on this bill. I think it would be unfortunate if we were in a position tomorrow where we do not have most of the answers to the questions I have sought. It would also be unfortunate if we were in a position of not having on hand one or two people who can advise us about the cost estimates for the low-income earners co-contribution, which we will presumably be dealing with tomorrow. I assume that the government will list these bills on the agenda for tomorrow.</para><para>The opposition does not want to be in a position where, if we deal with the bills tomorrow and a range of questions are posed about the cost estimates, who benefits, and the level of income with respect to the low-income earners co-contribution, we are not able to get a response to the questions and they have to be given at some future date. I do not regard that as satisfactory. I want to see these bills dealt with in some shape or form tomorrow. I do not want to see the debate go beyond tomorrow, and that is not my intention. I put you on notice, Minister, that a similar range of questions about low-income earners will be asked tomorrow, and we would like answers tomorrow to what I think are reasonable questions. </para><para>A summary of the minister's argument is that there is an increased incentive to save, the disincentive to save is reduced, and therefore more people will contribute to superannuation at these income levels. There is an assumption that there will be an increased level of contributions to superannuation as a result of these measures. There should be an estimate of that level of increased take-up. I would like to know—it probably will not be tonight—what the estimated level of increased take-up as a result of this measure will be of superannuation savings, assuming the legislation passes because of the government's agreement with the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15320</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I talked a little earlier in response to one of the questions raised by Senator Sherry about the benefit for parliamentarians in percentage terms.

It comes at a most opportune time, of course, given the fact that in the last week we have seen one of the most comprehensive bungles by the federal government in the way that it treats some of its Defence Force members. I refer particularly to those 580 Army personnel around this country who are employed as combat clerks and storemen at bases around Australia. It has suddenly been discovered that the Defence Force are going to do something fairly negative about the level of pay that these personnel have been receiving for the last four years.</para><para>I take this opportunity to look at what the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal does throughout the year. While this is in no way a criticism of the tribunal—as I can see by its membership and the clarity and comprehensive nature of its report that it undertakes its tasks in a most professional manner—I am interested to learn that, in the introduction to this report, one of the functions of the tribunal is set out as being:</para><quote><para>... to inquire into and make determinations in respect of prescribed matters that have been referred to the Tribunal.</para></quote><para>The report says that, under section 58KD of the act under which the tribunal operates:</para><quote><para>The Tribunal may, in making a determination, give effect to any agreement reached between the Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Chief of the Defence Force, acting on behalf of the members of the Australian Defence Force, in relation to a matter to which the determination relates.</para></quote><para>I also note that the report outlines the work the tribunal have done through the year and the matters that have been brought before them and dealt with over the period covered by this report.</para><para>It is interesting to note what is missing from the report—that is, what is missing not through any fault of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal but what is missing from the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Force have not bothered in the last 12 months to refer to the remuneration tribunal a matter relating to 580 combat clerks and storemen. I suspect that, if I went back three or four years and looked at the three reports published prior to this period of reporting—July 2002 to June 2003—I would probably find that this matter had not been referred to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal in that time, either. This alleged overpayment—as the Defence Force would determine it is, for want of a better word—came about because four years ago an agreement was entered into that provided for these Army personnel to be paid at pay group level 4. By and large, most of them have been paid at pay group level 4. They were going to be trained, or have been trained, as riflemen; they have skills over and above those of combat clerks and storemen. I understand that in the Army combat clerks and storemen are usually paid at pay group level 3, so this was probably an exceptional group of employees. But there is no doubt there was an agreement struck for this group of employees that they would be paid at pay group level 4. </para><para>Four years later, the Army had a look at this and said: `Whoops. We can't actually do this anymore because the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal hasn't sanctioned it, and it hasn't been sanctioned in law.' It could have been rectified. I found out tonight that the minute this agreement was entered into—four years ago—the agreement could have been sent off to the tribunal for it to investigate and probably agree to. This matter could well and truly have been rectified by the Army many years ago. In response to a memo from me that was actioned by the Army, the Major General said:</para><quote><para>I expect there will be a degree of concern and emotion over this issue.</para></quote><para>The issue is this: the Army want to have pay group level 4 storemen and clerks paid at level 3 from the end of November and 1 December. That is without rhyme or reason; it is just because they have decided that is the case. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement</title><page.no>15321</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>15321</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This report is made under the Housing Assistance Act on the operation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement that was in force between 1999 and June 2003. This is the third annual report. It covers the year 2001-02. It has been tabled today—well over a year since the end of the financial year this report applies to. Indeed, the report that applied to the previous financial year was only tabled on 26 March this year. There is a fair lag in these statistics and reports being provided.</para><para>It is appropriate to make some comments on this report at a time when the issue of housing affordability is finally on the national agenda. The Democrats have repeatedly called for the federal government to take responsibility for a national approach to housing affordability. We have been calling for that for well over a year, as have many other people throughout the community. It is pleasing to see at least some initial moves on this by the federal government via establishing a Productivity Commission inquiry, albeit only into first home ownership. It is unfortunate that the inquiry is into just first home ownership because housing affordability goes much wider than just first home owners. It goes to all other buyers, it goes to private renters and it goes to the issue of the availability of public and community housing.</para><para>The Commonwealth-State Housing Agree-ment is—obviously, as the name suggests—an agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the states. This year Commonwealth funds totalled just over $1 billion. The different states and territories partially matched that with an extra $364 million. I very much urge state governments to consider putting extra money into public and community housing, particularly at a time when there is a massive investment driven housing boom in the community. Much has been said about the increase in stamp duty revenues for state governments. I do not believe that is in any way the major driver of the problems with housing affordability. Nonetheless, there is a fair point to be made that, at a time when state governments are getting massive windfalls from stamp duty on property sales, they should put at least a percentage of that money back into community housing, public housing and other affordable housing throughout the community. That is not happening, and that is contributing to the lack of availability of affordable housing and to incredible stresses at the lower end of the housing market. </para><para>I point to the Commonwealth's contribution. That figure of around $1 billion goes to a range of specific programs such as crisis accommodation and Aboriginal rental housing and to some GST compensation. The base funding is actually only three-quarters of a billion dollars. That sounds like a significant amount of money but, if you look at some of the other areas where this government spends money by way of forgone revenue, it is not as significant as it should be.</para><para>The Democrats have pointed out, and got information through the Senate estimates committee process about, the lack of targeting and the inefficiency of the first home owners grant program. The federal government points to that program as a suggestion of how it is dealing with affordable housing. There is ample evidence that some of those grants are going to help people buy properties worth more than $1 million. There was evidence just last week of over 70 houses in Victoria being subsidised by the first home owners grant even though they cost over $1 million, so it is obviously not targeted particularly well in terms of need. It is also not necessarily efficient in terms of delivering affordable housing because that subsidy or grant can get absorbed into the overall market price and it effectively goes into the pocket of the seller or the real estate agent.</para><para>This government has spent as much on untargeted first home owner grants as it has on community and public housing. That is unacceptable. The predecessor to the Productivity Commission, the Industry Commission, highlighted that public housing is the most efficient way of spending public money to deliver housing outcomes. This government should not back away from the prospect of dealing with affordable housing, in part, through better resourcing of public and community housing through mechanisms such as the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.

As befitting such an occasion, it is a day we reflect upon sensitive issues of national symbolism. Recently the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, released the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code. It is a valuable document and I congratulate the minister on his initiative. Among its many provisions, the code states that `there is great value in incorporating appropriate Indigenous elements into citizenship ceremonies'. It goes on to encourage the organisers of citizenship ceremonies to incorporate into proceedings such elements as a `Welcome to Country' ceremony which: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... enhances awareness and understanding by new citizens ... of Indigenous culture and heritage and the status of Indigenous people as the first Australians.</para></quote><para>The code also stipulates that the officer presiding over the citizenship ceremony:</para><quote><para>... should publicly acknowledge the traditional inhabitants of the land where the citizenship ceremony is taking place.</para></quote><para>The formula recommended in the code for presentation at citizenship ceremonies is expressed this way:</para><quote><para>I recognise the living culture of the xxx people and the unique contribution they make to the life of the xxx region.</para></quote><para>This is the code's recommendation; however, as we all know, the reality is very different. The formula I always hear at citizenship and other ceremonies is something like: `I acknowledge the XY peoples, the traditional owners of this land.' I believe it is right and it is proper to acknowledge and recognise the Indigenous contribution to Australia. However, in my opinion this formula, commonly used at citizenship and other ceremonies, is deficient. It is deficient for two main reasons: firstly, instead of uniting all of us, it perpetuates the segregation of Australians into two categories; and, secondly, in itself it is insufficient in that it fails to acknowledge the great debt we owe to other Australians who built this country.</para><para>Bruce Woodley, of the group the Seekers, writes in his famous song <inline font-style="italic">I Am Australian</inline> that `we are one, but we are many'. Unfortunately, for many on the Left we are not one; we are two—there are Indigenous Australians and then there is the rest. Indigenous Australians are the real and authentic Australians, while the rest of us are interlopers and uninvited guests. This is not a healthy world view to promote at citizenship ceremonies. Just when our nation is welcoming its new citizens and should be saying to them that they now belong to Australia and Australia belongs to them—that they own its institutions, its democracy, its rights of citizenship—we are reminding them that they do not and cannot really own this country: their title is defective; their ownership is somehow contingent upon someone else's. It is as if our new citizens are at best merely tenants in their new home and, at worst, tourists. Citizenship should entail a sense of ownership but this sort of statement fosters division.</para><para>This formulation feeds on the Left's signature polemic: its culture of resentment and its embracing of victimhood. Everyone, in the lexicon of the Left, is either a victim or an oppressor. For the Left, Australian history is the story of exploitation, racism, sexism and imperialism. Equality, or even fairness, is not at the heart of the contemporary bourgeois Left; rather, it is guilt and self-loathing. When the Prime Minister recently addressed the Liberal Party National Convention in Adelaide, he spoke about the loathsome `self-appointed cultural dieticians' that have prescribed what Australians must feel about themselves. While I have no doubt about the sincerity and good intentions of many of those who at citizenship ceremonies acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, I equally have no doubt that often this sort of statement is delivered by cultural dieticians with the intention of force feeding us guilt and self-loathing.</para><para>From the day new citizens swear allegiance to this country, they are invited to accept the claim that Australia's history is simply one of the expropriation of land, racism, sexism and every other evil characteristic imaginable. It makes you think: why would anyone want to migrate to such a country? Yet in this culture war there are those who do not subscribe to the black armband view of Australian history. For those of us—the mainstream—who do not form our opinion based on fashionable broadsheets and trendy broadcasters or spend our time preaching indignation and resentment, the story of Australia is seemingly more prosaic yet in fact far more moving. We believe that the Australian story is one of great achievement and that despite some shortcomings we are among the most egalitarian, fair and prosperous societies on earth. So when at citizenship ceremonies we acknowledge Indigenous Australians let us also acknowledge those men and women who tamed our harsh continent and, in doing so, brought into being one of the world's oldest democracies and most successful multicultural nations. </para><para>This is not about downplaying the role of Aboriginal Australians but about celebrating in a much more inclusive manner the contribution all our ancestors of whatever race, creed or colour have made to building our country, regardless of whether they have lived here for 1,000 years or only for a few. Our new citizens should learn not only about the importance of Indigenous Australian history, as considerable and unique as it is, but also about the great debt we owe to all those who built our country—whether they be convicts, pioneering men and women, the Anzacs or the migrants who flocked to this country after World War II. So when we recognise the undisputed and valuable contribution of Indigenous Australians to our history, our culture and our society let us also add words such as these: `I would also like to acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all our forebears: the men and women of all races and religions who through their courage, hard work and determination made Australia one of the freest, fairest and most prosperous countries on earth.'</para><para>I know that the Left—the divisive, guilt-ridden, self-loathing, intolerant Left—will not like this. Recently, Mr Keating described those who rejoice in our national achievement as `lickspittles', `tintookies' and reactionaries with `tiny, timorous hearts'. And of course he did all of this before an adoring chorus of swingers and trendies like Phillip Adams, Pat Dodson, Bill Kelty and Robert Manne. Mr Keating said that he and his ilk will win the culture war. Let us disappoint him. Let us amend the Australian citizenship ceremonies code to add a more inclusive and positive recognition of the Australian achievement.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>15324</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15324</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week, Senator Robert Hill assured the Senate on seven occasions during question time that he would make inquiries or refer matters to the relevant ministers with regard to the leaked ONA top-secret intelligence document that was written by former ONA analyst Andrew Wilkie. This document somehow got into the hands of tabloid journalist Andrew Bolt. The classification of this document was AUSTEO, and it was code -worded.</para></talk.start><para>We are still waiting for Senator Hill's answers. We trust that these questions were not just taken on notice and then forgotten. What happened is that a highly classified document found its way to a person without security clearance, and that is a crime. The parliament deserves candour from the government on this security breach. Last Tuesday I asked Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister: </para><quote><para>... when was the attention of the Prime Minister's office drawn to a press article by Mr Andrew Bolt dated 23 June 2003 containing direct quotes from an ONA document classified top-secret, AUSTEO? </para></quote><para>I also asked Senator Hill why the Prime Minister had not immediately referred this leak to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. In response, Senator Hill said he did not know when the matter was first drawn to the attention of the office of the Prime Minister, but he assured me that he would refer the question to the Prime Minister. Has he? Not yet. In a supplementary question I asked Senator Hill:</para><quote><para>... did ONA make any attempt to urgently retrieve this top-secret AUSTEO document from Mr Bolt? And, Minister, if they did not, can you say whether the Federal Police have retrieved the document from Mr Bolt?</para></quote><para>Again in response Senator Hill said he was not aware whether ONA had contacted Mr Bolt but that he would make some inquiries. He could not assure the Senate that ONA would be prepared to answer the question but, nevertheless, he would ask them. Senator Hill also indicated that he would ask the AFP whether they had tried to retrieve the document from Mr Bolt. When can we expect the answers to those questions?</para><para>During question time last Tuesday, I also asked Senator Hill to take on notice and follow up with the Senate whether `all ONA documents are routinely classified, numbered, bar-coded and individually grammatically configured to identify the source of leaked documents' and to `confirm that all of these safety measures would have been used on the ONA report on Iraq written by Andrew Wilkie and dated December 2002'. Furthermore, in the supplementary question, I asked Senator Hill to confirm whether `ONA is currently introducing technologies which allow for the identification of persons who have handled classified ONA reports'. Senator Hill assured me he would refer my question to ONA. But it is now a week later, and Senator Hill has not come back to the Senate with an answer to any of these questions.</para><para>In Senate question time on Wednesday, Senator Ray asked Senator Hill:</para><quote><para>... did any department, minister's office or government agency request a document in the days preceding the publication of Andrew Bolt's article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>?</para></quote><para>In reply, Senator Hill said that he would be happy to refer that part of the question to the Prime Minister. The answer does not require AFP input. It can be answered immediately if the government has the will to answer it—no appearance, Your Worship. On Wednesday, 10 September 2003, my colleague Senator Chris Evans asked Senator Hill whether a brief had been prepared by the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs `to assist government senators in their questioning of witnesses before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD at its public hearing on 22 August 2003'. Senator Evans also asked if Senator Hill would confirm whether any government senators had been `briefed in the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs prior to the public hearings'. Senator Hill was also asked who authorised the briefing—if government senators were briefed—who conducted it and whether Senator Hill would table the document provided to government senators.</para><para>In response, Senator Hill confirmed that Senator Macdonald had `contacted the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs seeking a briefing and was provided with one'. He also assured the Senate that `at no stage was any classified material or information provided at this briefing—that only publicly available material was provided'. To the questions he could not answer—that is, who provided the briefing, what was contained in the briefing and whether he would table the information provided to Senator Macdonald—Senator Hill said that he would refer that part of the question to the foreign minister. The silence is deafening. Again, we are still waiting for an answer. </para><para>On Thursday, I asked Senator Hill whether ONA referred the leaked ONA document matter to ASIO and, if so, `when ASIO was informed of the Bolt security breach'. I asked specifically whether it was `immediately after it was known by ONA and the Prime Minister's office'. Senator Hill could not say when ASIO had been informed about the Bolt security breach. However, he assured the Senate that he would include this question when making inquiries. To date we have not heard back from Senator Hill on any of the questions he said he would refer to other ministers or make inquiries about himself. Is Senator Hill's lack of diligence in obtaining answers a result of being very busy, or is it just a technique to fob off difficult questions from the opposition—at least until the parliament rises at the end of the week?</para><para>Today we find again that the government's failure to answer these serious questions is not just a problem in the Senate. In the House of Representatives today we saw another clear example of this pattern. My colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Kevin Rudd, asked Foreign Minister Downer:</para><quote><para>Will the minister formally confirm to the parliament that neither he nor any member of his staff provided Mr Bolt with a copy of, a summary of or a briefing on the contents of that report?</para></quote><para>Mr Downer's answer said it all. He refused to rule out whether he or anyone in his office leaked the ONA intelligence document to Andrew Bolt. Instead Mr Downer said:</para><quote><para>I have said already that my office, and obviously I, will fully cooperate with the police, and we will not be commenting any further until police investigations are completed.</para></quote><para>Mr Downer decided to hide behind the excuse of operational matters. This is an issue that goes directly to Mr Downer and the staff in his own office—his own behaviour and that of his staff.</para><para>If Mr Downer and his staff are not involved, he should just front up in the House of Representatives and say so—that is easy enough for any minister—and not hide behind some excuse of operational matters. But if Mr Downer and his office are involved, then he is also required to go on the floor of the House of Representatives when asked a straightforward question by a shadow minister and admit it—to be frank, to be straightforward, to be honest and to be direct in his answer. If it is the case that there is an involvement by Mr Downer or someone in his office, then obviously it is an offence for which a resignation is in order. On this matter, the government cannot hide behind the excuse of operational work of the Australian Federal Police. This is a matter of national security. The government must answer the opposition's direct questions on this matter. They are serious issues, they are serious allegations, and it is a requirement of this parliament and the Senate that government ministers come clean. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>We the People Conference</title><page.no>15326</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15326</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak tonight to the Senate about a conference, titled We the People, which addressed a range of issues of peace and justice in a world which, post the Iraq war, is at risk of being increasingly dominated by United States unilateralism. I think it is important because, whilst a lot of people were opposed to undertaking the attack on Iraq, that has obviously happened and, for those of us who are looking for ways to work constructively towards alternatives to military action wherever possible, we have to try to develop credible alternatives rather than simply attack the decision that has been made. </para></talk.start><para>This conference was a follow-on, the first conference having been held two years ago, and there will probably be another in 2005. The conference covered a wide range of topics and brought together a diversity of viewpoints. The final session adopted a statement that raised a range of economic, security and social justice issues, as well as electoral reform. I hope to get permission to incorporate information on that conference, or at least to table it a bit later on. That does not in any way suggest that the Senate has to indicate its agreement with everything in it. I do not agree with the entire content of the document, but I believe it is a useful contribution to moving the debate forward, particularly for those of us who are looking for alternatives that involve multilateral agreements and arrangements that seek to avoid military options wherever possible.</para><para>I want to highlight some sections of the statement that deal with how to make peace and justice a reality through building alliances. As I said, I do not agree with every single word of the statement but I agree strongly with the importance of finding areas of agreement. The statement notes that the decision by some nations to invade Iraq defied world opinion and thus in many ways was an affront to democracy. The administration of the USA is trying to impose new rules of international relations which create a precedent enabling it to invade countries, ignore the UN Security Council and charter, withdraw from treaties, and undermine cooperative efforts to limit the arms race, protect human rights and protect the environment. </para><para>The conference statement acknowledges that the US had to respond directly to the terrorist attacks of September 2001 but recognises that what has occurred has not in many ways targeted those who are actually responsible. Further, unlike activity which defends people's rights, terrorism—which was clearly demonstrated by the attack on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001 and by the Bali bombing on 12 October 2002—is a real threat to ordinary people everywhere. The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan show that the military response has had the effect only of expanding the violence and provoking more terrorist outrages. The conference statement says:</para><quote><para>We must ensure that terrorism is met with international cooperation for firm police action and not military invasions ...</para></quote><para>The conference noted:</para><quote><para>Prime Minister Howard's support for the Bush Administration's war policy has exposed the great flaws in the Australian Constitution. The war decision was taken without approval by both Houses ...</para></quote><para>The Democrats have pursued for over 20 years in the Senate constitutional change to require the support of both houses of parliament to send Australian troops to war overseas. We have a private member's bill on this topic, which was first introduced some 20 years ago and is before the Senate again in an updated form, and we have a petition in support of this approach.</para><para>The Democrats believe that it is vital that there are stronger controls on the Prime Minister's ability—that is any Prime Minister of any government—to take us to war. In the case of Iraq, the war was not supported by the United Nations, by the Senate or by a majority of the Australian people at the time. Recent events have made it clear that military action, particularly without broad international support, is not a catch-all solution to the problems posed by rogue nations or by nations developing or threatening to develop weapons of mass destruction. It seems like a simple solution—send in the marines—but usually the only time it is right to go to war, under the criteria of what is a just war which has been followed by many Christian religions for some time, is in response to an attack or an imminent attack by another nation. </para><para>Hugh White of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has observed:</para><quote><para>Choosing to go to war is something we do more often these days. We hardly used our defence forces from the time Australia withdrew from Vietnam in the early 1970s until the late 1980s ... Moreover, we are choosing to go to war in a more significant sense: our recent wars—such as the occupation of Iraq in March this year—have been `wars of choice' ... not wars forced on us by overwhelming threats of great immediacy, in which the resort to war was the only alternative to imminent catastrophe. Our recent decisions to go to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, like our decision to join the coalition to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991, were choices made from a range of plausible policy options.</para></quote><para>That is not to say that all of those decisions were necessarily wrong; it is simply to highlight that there has been a shift in Australian policy—in effect, making a proactive choice to engage in military action rather than the approach we have tended to take in the past.</para><para>I note that on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper of last Thursday, 11 September, yet again the word `terror' dominated headlines. In that case it was not just because of the second anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Centre but because of another suicide bombing in the Middle East. On the same front page the Prime Minister has an opinion piece about the war on terrorism. I found it astonishing that that article did not mention the war in Iraq, although that was clearly waged under the banner of fighting terrorism—even though it does not necessarily seem to have achieved a reduction in the threat of terrorism. Amongst other things, the Prime Minister's article says:</para><quote><para>... the question that those who oppose American leadership must ask is simple: who else would they prefer in the role of the world's superpower?</para></quote><para>If we did have a choice I for one would probably prefer to have Australia in that role, but that is obviously not really the choice. Choosing between superpowers is not the challenge we face. Rather we must choose global democracy, international cooperation and a system of international law respected by all, or a world where might makes right. I suggest that the second option may be easier to achieve but it is far less likely to achieve a secure future.</para><para>The war on terrorism cannot be won by one country or even by a small coalition of countries acting against the opposition of most of the world. It can only be won through global cooperation. The United Nations, for all its faults, is clearly the predominant forum for international cooperation to occur. Yet the government's new foreign affairs and trade policy white paper, <inline font-style="italic">Advancing the national interest</inline>, considers the United Nations only briefly. Similarly, Australia's defence white paper update released in February this year mentions the UN only once, although it contains dozens of mentions of the United States.</para><para>This government sees the Australian alliance with the United States as the primary defence solution. I should emphasise that I am not against the US alliance or indeed the ANZUS treaty, but I do believe we should be putting more effort into encouraging global cooperation and global disarmament as a vital part of the pursuit of peace and security. We cannot just rely on a powerful friend and cheer on that friend whilst they are moving away from global disarmament agreements, whilst they are pursuing the option of developing new nuclear weapons and whilst there is clearly a degree of disregard, at a minimum, for some aspects of international law.</para><para>The Senate last week passed a motion in support of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. International agreements such as this one are one path, amongst many, to greater global peace and security, but what we are seeing in some respects is the US turning away from these initiatives. I think that is unfortunate. I believe we should be using the positive alliance we have with the United States to try to encourage greater use of those initiatives rather than encouraging or supporting or tacitly allowing unilateral action. I seek leave to incorporate the statement I have referred to. </para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Now We The People Conference Statement</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Challenging the US Empire</inline><inline font-weight="bold">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Australia for peace and justice</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The New Threat to Peace and Justice</inline></para><para>Events since the first Now We The People Conference in July 2001 have underlined the importance of the democratic, inclusive directions outlined in the convening and concluding statements.

While preaching `practical reconciliation', the government has continued to squeeze resources and programs for indigenous communities. A new compact between the original owners of the land and the Australian governments, and a real Social Justice Package, are needed to affirm Indigenous Peoples' rights and ensure sufficient levels of service.</para><para>When George Bush's `coalition of the willing' decided to invade Iraq, they defied world opinion and thus attacked democracy everywhere. Bush and his allies cannot win their fight against the peoples of the world, but the people need to be much more united to take the world on a new path to peace, justice and a sustainable environment.</para><para>The neo-conservatives of the United States have qualitatively changed the global role of the USA by adopting more openly and aggressively a general unilateralist approach and using its overwhelming trade and military power on several fronts at once. While US governments have always been prepared to overthrow other governments and to use military power, `regime change' used to be by covert means, and military adventures were contained by the Cold War.</para><para>Now the Bush Administration is trying to impose new rules of international relations which will allow it to openly invade countries, to ignore the United Nations Charter, to withdraw from treaties, and undermine international cooperative efforts to limit the arms race, to protect human rights and to protect the environment.</para><para>While the US had to respond directly to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, this intense, aggressive unilateralism was a pre-conceived shift developed by the neo-conservative policy makers now dominating the Bush Cabinet. The use of September 11 to trigger this broader agenda was clearly expressed in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and increased support to repressive regimes in the region. These neo-conservatives openly argue that the US is in a unique historical moment as the sole superpower and that its consequent opportunity to dominate the world in its own interests should be grasped and maintained by denying any challenger the chance to develop a counter-power.</para><para>In the USA, the Bush Administration with corporate backing has attacked civil rights in the guise of the `war on terror' and launched a broad attack on progressive policies in welfare, women's rights, human and civil rights, labour relations and the environment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Challenges to Australia and the Region</inline></para><para>This change in the global role of the US is forcing all progressive and democratic organisations and movements to shift out of their comfort zones and to change their ideas and priorities. In Australia and Britain in particular, the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a direct challenge to democracy.

There is a particular danger that Australian forces will be deployed to the Korean Peninsula or the Philippines. These wars are low-level nuclear wars involving deadly depleted-uranium munitions. Unilateralism must be replaced by a return to international law and cooperation. </para><para>Unlike mass-based revolutionary activity which defends people's rights, terrorism—as demonstrated by the attack on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in September 11, 2001, and by the Bali bombing on October 12, 2002—is a real threat to ordinary people everywhere. The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq show that the military response only expands the violence and provokes more terrorist outrages. The war is not over in either Afghanistan or Iraq. The bombings in Riyadh, Casablanca and Jakarta show that the terrorism is not over either. We must ensure that terrorism is met with international cooperation for firm police action and not military invasions, together with positive political initiatives to redistribute wealth, to prevent the suppression of democratic rights and to address the environmental crisis, particularly in developing countries. </para><para>The Howard government's push for a US Free Trade Agreement, which would damage Australia's national interests, is another dangerous expression of Howard's deep commitment to the US for good or bad. Similarly, Howard's own deep conservatism echoes the US neo-cons in his drive to break down a universal Medicare, quality aged care, public education and welfare system, to be replaced by a two-tier system in which public provision is restricted and under-funded. Universal access to publicly provided health and dental care, education and social services is crucial for a just Australia. </para><para>The Howard attacks on the public education system are unfair, create inequality and so add to social stress, insecurity and resentment that can divide us. Young people face acute pressure in the education system and graduates start their employment with a significant debt. We must demand the right to a free public education including TAFE and university education to ensure that students from poor or disadvantaged backgrounds can develop their full potential to the benefit of all, and that Australia maintains a high level of education and skill.</para><para>The global capitalist economy has now shifted clearly out of the hyper-speculative growth of the 1990s and into a serious recession, undermining savings and threatening jobs and job security everywhere, including in the USA. While the neo-conservatives provide the Bush Administration with a lofty justification for their aggressive unilateralism, these policies are also a convenient screen for the ever-worsening economic crisis in the US and world-wide. This crisis is now developing deflationary aspects, combining low interest rates, low inflation and low economic growth. The economic rationalists have no answer to this problem, and continue to push the policies of deregulation, privatisation of efficient and effective publicly-owned corporations and service providers, liberalisation of trade and investment and attacks on labour rights all of which has led to the current crisis. We must replace discredited free market doctrine with expanded public investment and job creation in key areas such as the environment, education, health, transport, housing, youth and community services, arts, public broadcasting and regional sectors of the economy. We must renew efforts to close the ever-widening wealth gap and to create secure jobs, and at the international level support initiatives such as the Tobin Tax to reduce speculation and fund ecologically sustainable and socially desirable development.</para><para>The Howard and Bush governments seek to further transform global and domestic regulation to serve the interests of the major corporations. The resistance to the growing inequality and injustice created by these policies is centred on trade unions and other community organisations. The development of an alternative program for global and national governance depends on these organisations, which is why they are under such strong attack. Trade unions in particular now operate in an environment which breaches International Labour Organisation standards. Defence of trade union rights and opposition to further anti-union laws and industrial police forces is essential for the protection of our democracy.</para><para>The endless war on terrorism also screens the severe moral crisis in management of transnational corporations and finance institutions, shown in the wreckage of giant companies like Enron and Worldcomm—so closely associated with George Bush—and HIH and OneTel in Australia. Rather than being a “few bad apples”, this corporate crime embodies the arrogance of capitalist high-flyers and is part of a deeper economic and political crisis being borne by everyone. We need to expose attempts by conservative forces to shift the costs of this crisis from directors and managers onto the general public, and corporate governance must be re-regulated to make it socially and environmentally accountable.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Impact on Australian society</inline></para><para>Howard's support for the Bush Administration's war policy has exposed the great flaws in the Australian Constitution. The war decision was taken without approval by both Houses, ASIO now has powers to detain without trial, refugees are denied their human rights, and the Governor-General continues to be appointed by the Prime Minister alone. We must work towards a Republican Constitution with a Bill of Rights that will protect our basic rights and broaden democratic control over our lives. Mandatory detention of refugees and the `Pacific Solution' must be ended.</para><para>We call for an independent judicial inquiry to investigate electoral reform, including the proportional representation system used in New Zealand, and to propose models to be put to the Australian people in a referendum. Across the board, we advocate greater citizen participation in the processes of government.</para><para>The current economic phase has seen a massive expansion in property development and speculation, raising prices for homes and destroying the environment. State governments have allied themselves with developers and sought to undermine local councils where grass-roots democracy has grown. We must develop a viable system of local and regional government with Federal Constitutional protection in order to defend our communities.</para><para>The banking, insurance and finance system has robbed ordinary users of basic services and overcharged them, while at the same time, promoting speculation in shares and property rather than investment in social and environmental needs. The narrow interests of shareholders have been allowed to set policy. The current privatised system of banking, insurance and finance cannot be left to the marketplace alone but must be operated in the long-term public interest with its responsibilities to the community clearly identified and enforced. This requires new regulation such as a Banking Social Charter, and a return to public and community banking and insurance enterprises, including a public insurance office.</para><para>The war on terrorism and its associated war on refugees is degrading Australia's respect for human rights and dividing our multicultural society. Muslims are the current target group. We need to respect and protect differing religious and secular belief for everyone and deal with fundamentalism of all kinds by addressing the real needs of people, and removing sources of insecurity, especially in jobs and incomes.</para><para>The Afghanistan and Iraq wars both featured oil and oil pipelines as underlying objectives of US policy. The world continues to deal with the looming peak of oil production and the subsequent decline, with war. This can only increase instability and terrorism and release ever-increasing amounts of greenhouse gases into the environment. A global sustainable energy program is urgently required and Australia should play its role as a significant player in its development. Australia should sign and implement the Kyoto Protocol of the Climate Change Convention immediately, as a first step to a major reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Australia must prepare to accept so-called climate refugees who lose their homes because of rising sea levels.</para><para>A stark choice lies before Australia and the world—endless war led by George Bush and John Howard and their ideological successors—or a world of peace and justice created by democratic people's movements and parties.

It is quintessential Australia—the dinkum Australia of our bush lore and our history. Yet it is home to people who continually astonish me with their energy in pursuit of local solutions to national goals, their innovation in their rural based industry and their social organisation and interests.</para></talk.start><para>I was in Longreach on this occasion, courtesy of the Minister for the Arts and Sport, to help officiate at the unveiling of a plaque at the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame commemorating its expanded and enhanced services to visitors, real and virtual. One particularly interesting aspect of the new look Stockman's Hall of Fame is the proposal to substantially enhance the capacity for `virtual' visitors. That is something I will come back to in a minute. The story of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame is an interesting example of determination on the part of its many backers and of the true regard with which Australians view their country's bush heritage.</para><para>In 1988 the Commonwealth supported the establishment of this wonderful monument to our outback pioneers, with funding through the bicentennial program. It is fitting that the Commonwealth should again be involved in the first major upgrade of the Stockman's Hall of Fame—this time through a fund set up to mark another milestone on our national journey, the Federation Fund. The $1 billion federal fund was created to help communities such as Longreach celebrate Australia's Centenary of Federation. Around the country more than 1,100 projects were funded, creating hundreds of lasting legacies to the centenary year. </para><para>The dividends from this investment have been immense. Not only have communities been helped to secure and cherish the past but also, in securing the artefacts of the past, they have helped ensure the viability of true Australian culture into the future, via tourism, the heritage experience, job creation and enhancement of local infrastructure. In my own state of Queensland, 43 projects received Commonwealth funding through the Federation Fund. The amount of $48 million went to the Queensland Heritage Trails Network, of which the upgrade of the Stockman's Hall of Fame was a part. The Commonwealth contribution through the Federation Fund to this project alone was $1.5 million.</para><para>The network is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when the different tiers of government work together with the community to create something of lasting value. The Commonwealth's $48 million to the Queensland Heritage Trails Network was supplemented by $39 million from the Queensland government and another $23 million from local government and the private sector, giving a total investment of $110 million. I believe this outstanding partnership deserves to be acknowledged as something that has created jobs and given a new lease of life to communities across the state. </para><para>The Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame has been a great favourite with Australians from right around the country for the past decade and a half. More than three-quarters of a million people—the vast majority of them Australian—have gone out of their way to come to Longreach to visit this monument to an all but vanished way of life. Here is proof that remoteness is no barrier if there is something worth seeing at the end of the journey. The upgrade will ensure that the Stockman's Hall of Fame remains one of the premier attractions of this state—a must for anyone wanting a feel for how the outback was opened up for pastoralism after European settlers reached further and further west in pursuit of adventure and fortune. In particular, the upgrade will ensure that the tales that are told—and now they are being told with state of the art imaging—encompass the multiple histories that make up our national story.</para><para>Women are given a greater voice and their role in opening up the outback is acknowledged more fully. So is the tremendous contribution made by Indigenous Australians to the development of the pastoral industry. A country that celebrates its history and honours its pioneers thereby keeps faith with itself and with the unique ethos that drives it. That is a truly great idea.</para><para>There is another great idea I want to briefly canvass—the proposal to create a videoconferencing facility at the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame. This is a project that will require a modest outlay of new funds and I am happy to admit in this chamber that I have made representations in the right quarters for consideration of that funding request. The Chief Executive of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame, Mr Peter Andrews, tells me a six-month study of appropriate videoconferencing technology has been completed. It involved an innovative trial link-up with schools in the inland Queensland area, something that Telstra, among others, assisted. Mr Andrews says that research on visitor numbers to other mainly overseas locations where such technology has been installed reveals increased visitation directly attributable to the use of this technology.</para><para>The Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame is a long way from the mass market that might find its exhibits and interactivity a big draw. Hitching the star of our past to the planetary web of the future seems a great idea. On the subject of actual rather than virtual visitors—and in the certainty that more and more Australians and overseas visitors will want to experience the inland in person—Longreach Shire Council has proposed upgrading Longreach Airport to accommodate aircraft of Boeing 737 size. I am happy to report to the Senate that I have received representations from the Mayor of Longreach, Councillor Joan Maloney, and have subsequently made my own representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. </para><para>I agree with the mayor of Longreach that enhancing the capacity of the airport to service future needs is important. It is important in the context of the central role that Longreach plays in the economy of central western Queensland, and the anticipated growth in inland tourism traffic. Increasing the capacity of the regional airport to handle traffic growth and larger aircraft is something I believe should be looked at in terms of appropriate upgrading of transport infrastructure in a time frame and at a pace that reflects growing passenger traffic and freight requirements. I hasten to add that the state government, together with the local government to which I have referred, also has real obligations in the funding of any future upgrade. I am sure that, with the goodwill that exists toward the Longreach region in both those levels of government, support will be forthcoming if plans are finalised.</para><para>I am also pleased to inform the Senate that I have invited the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, to visit that great part of Queensland and that great part of Australia. Minister Hockey has displayed a great amount of enthusiasm and commitment to doing so as soon as his schedule permits, and this is something that I know will please the people who are part of that great tourist attraction and tourist destination, the Stockman's Hall of Fame, and all the other wonderful tourist attractions which exist in that part of Queensland.</para><para>You can see that I was very invigorated by the experience of visiting Longreach and being involved in the rededication of the Stockman's Hall of Fame and also experiencing the tremendous hospitality of the people there, who are very keen to welcome visitors—not just because there are dollars involved but because they are so proud of what Longreach and its environs have to offer in displaying our history, displaying our culture and making sure that it is preserved for future generations.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Radio Frequency Identification</title><page.no>15334</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15334</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise in the chamber to speak about a new technology which could well revolutionise the transport and tracking of shipments around the country and around the world. Its applications are broad, but it does come with a very real threat of contravening consumer privacy protections. I am talking about radio frequency identification, or RFID.</para></talk.start><para>For the uninitiated, an RFID system works on the same principle as a scanner and bar code system, but it offers much more scope. The RFID chip needs no power—the power is in the reader or scanner—yet it can be scanned through packaging, such that, for example, a pallet load of goods can be scanned without unloading to check each individual item's bar code. Goods trains and semitrailers can pass through scanners en route, providing shippers with up-to-the-minute information on the location of their goods.</para><para>RFID technology is very new, currently very expensive and particularly useful for large shipments of goods. It heralds the arrival of a new weapon in the fight to streamline inventory management and improve market control by allowing for more efficient tracking of products. In time, this has the potential to bring down costs for producers, manufacturers and distributors and, hopefully, lower prices at the sales `coalface'. These savings can be substantial. For example, when Wal-Mart, a large supermarket chain in the United States, proposed the introduction of RFID technology in June 2003, it was estimated that its savings could amount to as much as $US1.5 billion based on a six to seven per cent reduction in supply chain costs. However, these savings are based solely on cost cutting in the distribution area. </para><para>While the current focus of RFID technologies is in the tracking of cartons and pallets, the technology is not expected to really take off until the price of the chips, known as `tags', drops to the point where their versatility allows them to be used in stores to more accurately monitor sales and stocking issues for consumer items. As production increases, it is expected that the tag price will drop from approximately US50c to $US1 down to just a few cents.</para><para>It is here, however, that the business community should pause to consider an increased recognition of consumer rights. Consumers are no longer content to accept what is offered without question. The Internet has not only been responsible for informing but it has also on occasion misinformed, allowing conspiracy theorists to have a field day. But when there is some basis to these theories the misinformation spreads much more easily and is much more believable.</para><para>The introduction of RFID overseas has been a lesson in how not to introduce such technology. Ignorance of consumer issues has seen some companies face serious consumer backlash. Problems of security and privacy will arise when the technology is used in consumer goods such as clothing, shoes or other personal items. Privacy activists have the very real concern that the uncontrolled use of these tags will allow shops to gather large amounts of data about customer or store activities and link this to their customer information databases. It is possible that this monitoring could continue after the goods have left the shop. Any reader can scan the tags and it is proposed to put such readers in shop doorways. Effectively, the owner of a new garment or product can be tracked as easily as a pallet full of spare parts by simply walking into a shop fitted with such readers.</para><para>Such systems may reduce theft and improve stock monitoring, but allowing retailers to increase their knowledge base in this way would be seen by most people as an unacceptable intrusion into shoppers' privacy. A large multinational manufacturer introduced a trial project using RFID tags on their Mach 3 razor blades in conjunction with UK grocery giant Tesco. However, protesters began gathering outside the stores when it was found that the supermarket was automatically taking photos of customers picking up the blades. Despite claims by the company that they were only using the chips to improve their supply network, the result has been a worldwide call to boycott the company by the US based group Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering or CASPIAN. The group's director, Katherine Albrecht, is quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>... consumers will not tolerate being spied on through the products they buy.</para></quote><para>A proposed similar trial by the company in stores in the US was subsequently cancelled in July.</para><para>Of further concern is that the data gathered could be stored overseas to remove it from Australian consumer protection and privacy laws. As one witness to RFID hearings in a Californian Senate hearing said: </para><quote><para>How would you like it if, for instance, one day you realized your underwear was reporting on your whereabouts?</para></quote><para>With such emotive aspects surrounding this issue it deserves more than the offhanded one-liners we have come to expect from the government's information technology minister. Senator Alston's approach to the rapid build-up of broadband usage in South Korea was to suggest that `they like pornography', and his advice for handling the spam deluge was `just don't open it'. Senator Alston's sole response to the problems surrounding the introduction of RFID is that it is a matter for the Privacy Commissioner, but this ignores the fact that the commission is already underresourced for current activities. The prospect of a long investigation over several countries to follow the data path would stretch the commissioner's resources to the extent that all other mandated work would suffer.</para><para>We Democrats believe that the only solution is a legislative framework which respects the right of business to work as cheaply and effectively as possible while at the same time respecting the privacy concerns of the consumer. At the very least, this means mandating that all goods carrying such tags be identified as such, that these tags be switched off at the point of sale unless the consumer gives informed consent to the contrary and that no personally identifying information is connected with the data gathered by the RFID tags.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Hydrogen Energy </title><page.no>15336</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>15336</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this year's State of the Union address, the President of the United States, George W.

The hydrogen conference had an international flavour and was invaluable in drawing together delegates from government, energy and transport industries, scientific bodies and research institutes from all over the world who had the opportunity to take the first step towards the future integration of hydrogen as a major source of energy by exploring the strategic, technical, economic, environmental and commercial issues surrounding the use of hydrogen.</para><para>The specific aims of the conference were to review existing Australian and international knowledge relating to the use, potential and safety of hydrogen as a significant new energy source; to identify and examine the key issues for Australia at national and international levels relating to the production and use of hydrogen energy; to share information on opportunities and impediments to the production and use of hydrogen energy; to develop actions that Australia might take in response to these opportunities and impediments; to discuss the potential for regional Australia to be involved in the production and use of hydrogen energy from renewable and other sources of hydrogen; and to showcase Australia's existing and potential capabilities for hydrogen production from both renewable and non-renewable sources, together with our capabilities in the related fields of science, technology, engineering, manufacturing and finance. I am sure that, in the future, hydrogen will be used in fuel cells and even as a direct fuel in combustion engines to power vehicles, electrical plants and buildings. </para><para>The Australian government recognises the significant potential of hydrogen as a future energy source and has commissioned a national hydrogen study. According to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, who spoke at the conference in Broome, the aim of the study is:</para><quote><para>... to gain a better understanding of the issues and the potential for utilising hydrogen as an energy carrier to improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The study will also assess whether the general optimism for hydrogen is justified and examine strategies and actions that may be appropriate for governments and key stakeholders.</para></quote><para>The national hydrogen study team in their presentation referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Draft Australian Vision for Hydrogen</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> It says:</para><quote><para>Australia recognises the potential of hydrogen to contribute to a more environmentally friendly and sustainable energy mix and will continue to play an active role in the national and international development of hydrogen and related enabling technologies. In doing so, Australia will focus on areas where it has scientific, technical or other advantages.</para></quote><para>The Senate will be interested to know that there are two significant factors providing an impetus towards a hydrogen economy: energy security and environmental considerations. At the conference, Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu, who is President of the International Association of Hydrogen Energy and Director of the Clean Energy Research Institute at the University of Miami, referred to projections that by the year 2020 international demand for non-renewable fluid fossil fuels—petroleum and natural gas—will outstrip production. Australia is becoming increasingly dependent on imported oil. According to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane:</para><quote><para>... by 2010 we will be importing about 60 per cent of our crude oil—racking up an annual debt of about $8 billion.</para></quote><para>Not only does this pose an important economic consideration but also it poses the question of energy security for this country. Oil is, after all, the lifeblood of the world economy, including the Australian economy. In this respect it is important to note that most known reserves of oil are located in the politically volatile Middle East region. In fact, almost two-thirds of known oil reserves in the world are located in just five nations: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</para><para>Conversely, hydrogen has the distinct advantage of being available everywhere and can be derived from a variety of domestic sources, which significantly include renewable energy sources such as water and biomass. There are a variety of environmental considerations driving interest in hydrogen. Unlike petrol or diesel, hydrogen is a non-toxic, clean source of energy that will deliver significant environmental benefits in terms of decreasing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. According to the presentation of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage at the conference:</para><quote><para>Hydrogen usage in most applications can be regarded as greenhouse neutral, producing only water, and little or no other emissions. Where a fuel cell is used, the hydrogen usage produces no greenhouse gas emissions, so it is not difficult to see the attraction of hydrogen fuels to urban transport authorities.</para></quote><para>Emissions from hydrogen production will ultimately depend on the method of production and energy source used. </para><para>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but it does not occur by itself. In fact, it combines with other elements, meaning that it has to be separated. The most cost-effective method of hydrogen production is the steam reformation of methane from natural gas. However, this has the undesirable effect of producing carbon dioxide and the challenge will be to capture and sequester this greenhouse gas. Where hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water using renewable power, such as wind or tidal power, there is zero greenhouse gas emission and that, of course, gives it a significant advantage.</para><para>In relation to the hydrogen economy, Australia has a number of competitive advantages. In respect of research and development, the National Hydrogen Study team referred to Australia's internationally recognised research bodies, our good skills base and the fact that we are a credible and respected research and development partner, which will help us to participate in international research efforts. The second competitive advantage that the study team identified is the fact that Australia has an abundance of the inputs required to make hydrogen: coal, gas and renewable energy such as solar, tidal and wind power. Dr Michael Jones, General Manager of Hydrogen, BP International, told the conference that the lowest cost route to hydrogen is from natural gas. The North West Shelf off the Pilbara coast of Western Australia, of course, is blessed with abundant reserves of natural gas.</para><para>It is likely that in future, rather than powering our cars with fossil fuels—as we do today—we will probably power them with hydrogen, either by fuel cells or providing liquid hydrogen directly into internal combustion engines—which BMW plans to do and have a production car on the road by the end of next year. So the development of a hydrogen fuel is a very exciting possibility which will do much to reduce our dependency on Middle Eastern oil and certainly help to ensure that we reduce greenhouse gases.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Entitlements</title><page.no>15338</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>15338</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on the adjournment this evening to address a controversial issue, which has been led by the government as part of the proposed new military compensation scheme. This particular matter concerns the proposed offsetting of superannuation paid by Defence to former ADF members incapacitated for work due to their service-related injuries against the special rate also paid to those same ex-service personnel under the Veterans' Entitlements Act by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I make it clear, however, that this proposal is not part of the new military compensation scheme. It is a proposed amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and it affects only those with VEA entitlements now and into the future for injuries incurred during service prior to any new legislation being enacted, effective from 1 July next year—according to the government's timetabling anyway.</para></talk.start><para>To some extent, therefore, in the context of the proposed legislation, this is either a deliberate distraction to muddy the waters with respect to the new scheme or an attempt to use the new scheme as a smokescreen to conceal the government's motives with respect to the TPI community in particular. Veterans should not fall for this. They should deal with the new scheme as it stands and as it is proposed, but they cannot be blamed for their anger at the way these matters have been deliberately confused.</para><para>In essence, the facts of the matter are as follows. Under the VEA, provision is made for those who are so injured by their service that they are considered to be totally and permanently incapacitated—that is, their injuries and illness are such that they are unable to work for more than eight hours per week. This is the TPI. This is a category of disability which has been in existence since World War I and, at present, there are some 26,500 such people, mostly veterans with overseas service, but also a small number who obtained dual eligibility under the VEA and the MCRS between 1972 and 1994 and who have peacetime service only. </para><para>At a slightly lower level are those on what is called the intermediate rate for whom the work limitation is 20 hours per week. Both the special rate and the intermediate rate are tax-free pensions payable for life and are indexed by the CPI. They have never been means tested. The Senate will be aware that the TPI Federation of Australia has been waging a campaign to have the government redress the real erosion of this pension over the years due to the form of indexation—namely the CPI—as opposed to another index, such as MTAWE, which better reflects the changes in the standard of living. I do not intend getting into that issue now, suffice it to say that the government's response to the TPI Federation can only be described as belligerent.</para><para>It is a very complex matter steeped in history, but the government has refused to deal with these people intelligently or even to pursue a range of options which are clearly available. The minister's consistent response to TPIs has in fact been that they are greedy and that there are many others in society in greater need—to the extent that a so-called typical income for families of $1,900 per fortnight is used to exemplify the greed, which is not the slightest bit representative.</para><para>This is deliberately misleading, but it is also indicative of the belligerence which I ascribe to government attitude. The minister avoided the rally outside Parliament House on 16 June last and consistently refuses to address this issue. Moreover, this belligerence towards TPIs is also evident from the government's failure to respond to the report of the review of veterans entitlements by Justice Clarke. This report was released late last February but, as we know, despite the opportunity presented by the intervening budget to respond, the 109 recommendations—with one exception—remain gathering dust in the government's big pigeonhole. Having used the inquiry as a stalling device, the government has now shelved the whole report—including a major piece of work on the TPI issue.</para><para>This issue, I remind those listening, formed almost one-third of the report and, although many did not like the recommended new model—and quite rightly—the analysis was invaluable. It provided plenty of detail and fact on which to properly deal with the issues. But, as we know now, the government is not the slightest bit interested in the TPIs. The Clarke report was never to be anything other than a cruel hoax, misleading people, holding out false hope, and spending $1.6 million in doing this. That background is highly relevant because we now have, deliberately mixed in with the new military compensation bill, a proposal to change the TPI special rate and its relationship to other compensation benefits, which was not a central plank in the Clarke report.</para><para>The real assault on the TPI special rate in this package containing the new Military Compensation Scheme is a consequential amendment to the special rate where effectively, for the first time since its inception, it is to be means tested. The background is that a growing proportion of TPI recipients are now former full-time members of the ADF. For those with service overseas, as well as those with service between 1972 and 1994, there is dual eligibility under both the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Compensation Scheme as we know it today or its predecessor, the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. Quite frankly, this dual eligibility is a mess, as has been found by three inquiries in the last six years. The tabling tomorrow of the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on the matter of offsetting compensation claims between the two schemes is just another example. </para><para>The proposal by the government is that, in future, superannuation payments made to former ADF members with dual eligibility, and also in receipt of the special rate, should be offset against the above general rate portion of the special rate—which is that element paid for work incapacity—and also, in turn, the service pension where it is payable. Because the special rate is tax free, the superannuation is to be offset at 60c in the dollar. This will first be deducted from the above general rate and then against the service pension at the normal taper rate of 40c in the dollar, consistent with the standard means test. Technically speaking, the first is a straight offset; the second is standard means testing.</para><para>The argument is that the Commonwealth is effectively paying this group of TPIs twice for their work incapacity: once through the special rate and second through the superannuation paid as an incapacity payment. This, however, is not a new phenomenon and has been technically possible while ever there has been dual eligibility. Yet action is only now taken in the context of the new legislation—but, more importantly, politically speaking, it is also in the context of the government's belligerence towards TPIs. This is no mere coincidence; it is a deliberate ploy.</para><para>The most offensive element of this assault on the TPIs, however, is that it is a fundamental reform to the special rate in isolation from the TPI Federation's legitimate campaign. It is also done in complete isolation from the broader need for reform as discussed by Justice Clarke. To be blunt, it is an opportunistic and ad hoc attempt to `fix' the TPIs, and so it is no wonder these people are so hopping mad. They have every right to be. For four years they have been trying to engage in a dialogue and to explore some solutions to what we on this side acknowledge as very real problems. The Clarke review was their day in court, and that has been thrown out as well. So it is no wonder they feel cheated.</para><para>This in fact has been a totally duplicitous stunt on the part of the government and the Repatriation Commission to make a major reform by subterfuge. Whatever the merits of the case, it is dishonest in that it has been brought up in complete isolation from all the other issues surrounding the special rate. Quite naturally, the TPI community is incensed not just at the deceit of this surprise but also by the detail. A great proportion of the TPI community is in receipt of superannuation. They are not to be affected but, in the usual discriminatory way, those who apply in the future will be. This is a legitimate complaint. It will, for example, create a new class of TPI veteran who will clearly be worse off than his peers who had the good fortune to apply earlier. Nor is it clear that there is complete policy legitimacy to the government's proposal simply because, under Commonwealth superannuation law, there is an entitlement to access superannuation at the age of 55, for MSBS members at least. Many TPI applicants are now over 55, so does this not mean that the MSBS superannuation pension is legitimately theirs as a retirement benefit at 55 and, therefore, cannot be legitimately offset after that age?</para><para>None of this has been explained. Nor has the detail on the impact on the DFRDB scheme been explained because the proposal in its raw form would offset the whole incapacity payment, including that to which the member would normally be entitled after 20 years service—namely 35 per cent of final salary. Nor has there been any explanation of any other Commonwealth superannuation payable as a result of employment elsewhere after discharge. In fact, this is a very common feature of post-service careers. What is more perplexing is that this issue is presented as a case of double-dipping—but one which has remained in place unattended for many years. It is also effectively imposing a means test on the special rate—which is also a historic benefit—as it is for the war widows pension, paid regardless of other means. For the purposes of these benefits, millionaires and the poor are treated alike. The fact, though, is that there is a far greater proportion of TPIs struggling to raise families than there are those with greater means. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—Order!

A recently completed study by the International Labour Organisation has determined that Australians are working more hours per person annually than their counterparts in comparable economies. The ILO key indicators of the labour market study have found that the annual hours worked per person in Australia is 1,824, which is higher than the United States at 1,815 and significantly higher than European countries such as France and Germany at 1,545 and 1,444 respectively.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst we would like to think that as an industrialised economy Australia has been able to develop fair and reasonable working conditions, the excessive annual working hours per person that Australians endure compares with countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where annual working hours are 1,980 and 1, 978 respectively. The economies in these countries are at a transitional stage, and they have succeeded in reducing annual hours worked per person. Further development will most likely see a reduction in annual working hours to levels that are less than ours here in Australia. </para><para>Ireland's transition from an agricultural based economy to a manufacturing and service based economy demonstrates how economic development should reduce annual working hours per person. Following the transformation of the Irish economy, annual working hours per person fell from over 1,900 hours annually in the early 1980s to 1,668 hours in 2002. This decline represented a drop of nearly six 40-hour work weeks per employed person, whilst productivity per person employed between 1980 and 2002 doubled.</para><para>The reduction of annual working hours in countries such as Ireland, France and Germany and in many other economies across the world demonstrates the need for the issue of working hours—more specifically, excessive working hours—to be placed on the public agenda in Australia. Whilst the long-term trend in Australia has been towards a reduction in working hours, over the past two decades Australia has reversed this trend and has been one of the few economies in the world that has witnessed an increase in annual working hours per person.</para><para>Prior to the 1980s, full-time weekly working hours reduced from 48 to 44, and then to a 40-hour week. By the early 1980s, a weekly standard of 38 hours was the norm. Between 1992 and 2001, the average full-time weekly hours worked in Australia increased from 38.2 hours to 41.3 hours, an increase of 3.1 hours per week. The increase in average full-time weekly working hours in Australia puts us in unique company, with only the economies of the US and the UK having had an increase in full-time weekly working hours during this period. The increase in working hours in the US, however, has largely been in the form of paid overtime, and the extra hours in the UK appear to be made up of an increase in both paid and unpaid overtime. Significantly, in Australia the growth in extended hours is composed of increases in unpaid overtime. The mean in annual working hours in Australia has been pulled upwards due to a large and growing group of full-time employees who are working excessive hours above the standard.</para><para>In Australia, the proportion of full-time employees working in excess of 45 hours per week has increased considerably, from 17.7 per cent in 1985 to the current level of 26.1 per cent, and 28.8 per cent of Australians work at least part of the weekend every month. The percentage of the work force who only work Monday to Friday decreased from 64.3 per cent in 1993 to 58.6 per cent in 2000.</para><para>As a parliament, we need to recognise the impact of excessive working hours on the health of Australian workers and on the health of the economy. Many Australians have communicated that they are under increasing pressure as they attempt to balance work and family commitments. An increase in working hours results in less time committed to family needs and a decrease in leisure time. There is compelling evidence to suggest that the growth in the average working day for full-time employees has placed significant strain on families and relationships.</para><para>Demands for workers with family responsibilities to work longer hours can lead to people feeling obliged to leave jobs or to refrain from applying for jobs in which long hours are expected. Increased working hours and, subsequently, less time for family commitments and leisure time is leading to work related stress, which is having a negative effect on Australia's social fabric and has been identified as a potential cause of alcohol and drug misuse. Long working hours, poorly managed shift work and negative managerial styles have been identified by the House of Representatives Family and Community Affairs Committee as a potential reason for employees to misuse alcohol and other drugs to deal with work related stress. </para><para>In addition to the impact on family and leisure time and the negative health effect of longer working hours, it is widely recognised that the impact of longer working hours and job related stress is leading to a less productive work force and a less productive economy. The demand for people to work longer hours has resulted in a work force that is becoming increasingly fatigued, leading to lower productivity and an increase in the risk of workplace accidents. Generally it is becoming a negative for business, particularly with respect to customer relations. Further, a culture of `presenteeism' is developing amongst the Australian work force. Employees are going to work despite being sick and tired, resulting in less productivity than if employees took time off, recovered and then returned to work. It has been estimated that the cost of presenteeism to employers is around seven times more than that of productivity lost through absenteeism.</para><para>Statistics demonstrate that shorter working hours can have a positive impact on the economy. The ILO-KILM report showed that Norway, France and Belgium all have a higher output per hour worked than the US—with levels of $US38, $US35 and $US34 respectively—which is estimated at $US32. Annual working hours in the economies of Norway, France and Belgium are between 270 and 473 hours fewer than annual hours worked in the US. The OECD Productivity Index, using 1995 as the base year, demonstrates that in Ireland the percentage change in productivity between 2001 and 2002 was 4.6 per cent compared with the US at 3.4 per cent and Australia at 1.5 per cent. I remind the chamber that Ireland's annual working hours are significantly less than those of the US and Australia.</para><para>As a parliament we need to consider legislative standards and limitations on total hours and overtime worked by Australians and the redistribution of excessive hours to Australia's unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. In various economies across the world, legislative standards and limitations on total hours and overtime worked have been implemented. France's 35-hour law requires French companies to pay 39 hours worth of wages for 35 hours of work, places a cap on overtime and sets out maximum daily working hours and maximum weekly working hours.</para><para>Following the introduction of the 35-hour standard week and a limit on maximum daily hours and overtime, unemployment in France fell sharply and French GDP growth averaged three per cent per year between 1998 and 2001, which was on average higher than most other European countries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that shorter working hours have resulted in fewer coffee breaks and smarter work habits, increasing the productivity of output per hour worked.</para><para>The UK has been introducing legislation regulating working time patterns since 1997. The legislative changes in the UK established a minimum period of annual leave, a maximum average working week, minimum rest periods and maximum daily hours for night workers. Subsequently, annual hours worked per year in the UK have declined from the high 1,700s at the beginning of the nineties to an expected level in the high 1,600s in 2003, reversing the trend of an increase in working hours during the 1980s and the 1990s. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Australia has traditionally been at the forefront of introducing progressive reforms which have resulted in shorter working hours. Currently, we are headed in the opposite direction, whilst many other countries continue to benefit from a reduction in working hours. It is an issue that Australia must act upon with great urgency to ensure that Australian workers are able to appreciate recent gains of economic growth. </para><para>As a parliament we need to consider introducing reforms which will ensure Australians are not expected to work unreasonable, excessive hours and which will have the legislative support of the parliament in doing so. Reforms that introduce shorter working hours will free up much needed hours that Australia's unemployed and part-time and casual workers who seek full-time work will be able to benefit from.</para><para>International experience demonstrates that shorter hours can result in a more productive, more vibrant economy and a healthier society. Long working hours are creating an inefficient use of resources, with resources being tied up in unproductive, excessive hours rather than being directed towards more efficient forms of production. All sides of parliament must address this issue, and I will continue to promote and support campaigns aimed at implementing shorter working hours, which will benefit the Australian economy and, more importantly, the Australian people.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans' Affairs: Fraud Control</title><page.no>15344</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>15344</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to address a serious issue within the administration of the Repatriation Commission—namely, a most apparent contradiction, to say the least, of the values and policies which are applied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs with respect to fraud control and the overall waste of public money. I begin by relating a very sad and troublesome story concerning representations made to me almost 18 months ago by a young man, the son of a Vietnam veteran, who as a youngster watched his father die and who with great determination is trying to make his way in the world. In addition to enormous personal pressure caused to him by sexual abuse by his church—a matter which is still unresolved—this young man also had the great misfortune to have claimed allowances under the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme. While his intentions to study were no doubt good, clearly his study slipped, but the payment of allowances continued to be claimed. There is no doubt that this was wrong. Of the $30,000 debt claimed by DVA, $10,000 was repaid as a down payment in recognition of the wrongdoing. The difficulty was that the department refused to retreat from its hard line and the matter was referred to the DPP for prosecution, notwithstanding offers to repay the debt in full in the hope that a criminal conviction could be avoided and a failure to recognise the mitigating circumstances of his father's death and the stress of the ongoing litigation with the church.</para></talk.start><para>For the record, I personally wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on this young man's behalf only to be rebuffed, as everyone else is, the excuse being that of Pontius Pilate—no care, no responsibility. I next raised the matter at estimates and the department undertook to review the case, with the same result—Pontius Pilate: `The matter is out of our hands.' Through his solicitors, the young man sought to parley to negotiate a settlement whereby a substantial sum of the debt would be repaid, but again to no avail. It seems that the wheels of justice once engaged had to grind on without mercy. The end result was a good behaviour bond, and so the matter is finished, but the process and the contradiction by the department was amazing. Seemingly, its will to have this young man punished, regardless of the mitigating circumstances, makes one wonder about its values and competence. </para><para>There are other examples of these worrying values, and here I refer to the sums of money written off each year by waivers and write-offs—that is, decisions not to pursue the collection of outstanding debts. In 2003 the amount written off was in total $163,000, in 2002 it was $230,000-odd—no simple sums of money—yet in the case I have just mentioned we had a relentless pursuit with the apparent determination to obtain a conviction. How is this attitude explained?</para><para>Let me turn to the selective application of fraud control policy, for here it seems it depends on who you are. Moreover, it seems that, within a global budget now reaching almost $10 billion, there is little fraud in DVA at all. In answer to my Senate question No. 1004 I was advised that in the calendar year 2002 the number of medical providers counselled was 239 and the number of providers prosecuted over the last five years was only 10. It is true that there is the odd spectacular case—for example, the neurologist who had to repay $130,000 and a physiotherapist caught for $10,000. </para><para>The ANAO estimate, based on experience elsewhere in the health system, is that DVA can expect medifraud of between $6.7 million and $15.3 million per year, yet nothing like this is realised. Indeed, ANAO report No. 6 of 2002-03, on the DVA administration of recovery of overpayments and fraud control in the health area, is damning. The report is highly critical of the dilution of fraud control procedures. It states:</para><quote><para>Monitoring and investigation, leading to detection and recovery of overpayments is widely seen as a non core activity ...</para></quote><para>Further, page 68 of the same report reads:</para><quote><para>... during Financial Year 2001-2002 ... overpayments raised against allied health and transport providers in New South Wales as a basis for administrative recoveries totalled $668 000 and s.93 recoveries amounted to a further $1.01 million. However, in States other than NSW there had been minimal recovery action and in some States no recovery action had occurred.</para></quote><para>We can only hope that by now this has been remedied. Nevertheless, the reference is indicative of the attitudinal problem I have been addressing. As we know, DVA is subject to constant staff cuts, which lead to fewer controls, more so-called risk management and higher spending from a budget which is not capped. Overall, the record is poor. What has proven to be the most outstanding contradiction is between the attitude towards the young man I spoke of earlier and the pursuit of others. It must be said that the circumstances and record are most uninspiring.</para><para>The greatest contradiction with respect to attitude and fraud investigation can perhaps be best illustrated with respect to the concern expressed publicly earlier this year when it was alleged that serving ADF personnel were able to access veterans' benefits without the ADF knowing, with the result that people with serious disabilities were being deployed overseas. The accusation was that some of those claims were fraudulent as well. Simply put, the Department of Defence had no idea which of its personnel were being compensated by DVA. We were given a whole lot of baloney about privacy provisions, which allowed seemingly fit people to continue to serve even though they were in receipt of disability compensation from another agency. Unfortunately, I suspect we will never find the truth to this. There is either no coordination or a conspiracy to avoid the fact that the administration of compensation for the military and health care are simply two processes which never, or rarely, come together.</para><para>At estimates on 12 February this year, when I asked the Repatriation Commission about its follow-up action, I effectively received no response—except a challenge that, should I be aware of such cases of alleged fraud, I should refer them across. For the record, I did just that with one typical case referred to me. On 12 March I passed it across to the President of the Repatriation Commission in full expectation that an investigation would be conducted at least as a test of the system. Fraud investigations are clearly very selective. As we know, in this jurisdiction there have always been a large number of denunciations in the compensation area, few of which ever see any remedial action. With respect to my letter of 12 March, which I was invited to send, I received what can only be described as a non-response in its refusal to come to grips with the allegations made. The letter read: </para><quote><para>... for privacy reasons I cannot disclose the outcome of the investigation, but please be assured that any appropriate action will be taken ...</para></quote><para>That was effectively the brush-off. I point out it was not my allegation but an allegation from a member of the public. But, having been given the challenge at estimates to refer such denunciations received from a constituent, I was then essentially ignored. Where the matter is up to, I cannot know; but it is hardly inspiring. One can only wonder how serious the investigation was, and there again seems to be a dramatic contrast between that and the vigour shown towards pursuing a conviction of the young VCES claimant I referred to earlier. My bottom line impression is that the Repatriation Commission are at sixes and sevens on this matter and I must say, as a senator responsible for obtaining accountability from the bureaucracy on matters such as this, I am appalled. They must come clean and tell us what they are doing on fraud policy and administration across the board. They need to tell us what their policies are on which debts they intend to pursue and on prosecution. Looking on from the outside, it certainly seems arbitrary.</para><para>At a very minimum, a complete review of the management of fraud in the Department of Veterans' Affairs needs to be undertaken. It is simply not good enough that those with what seems to be more political power, including doctors and suppliers of medical services, should simply get counselling while others are threatened with jail terms. If there are problems with evidence and making charges stick then that perhaps says something about the quality of administration and the effectiveness of the guidelines in place. In fact, it raises the question of whether there are any guidelines at all. If there were, how could performance with respect to who is prosecuted be so erratic and selective? It also says something about resource levels in the fraud area and the support the area receives from management. Overall, however, it is a matter of attitude. From what I have seen and described, it is hypocritical, weak or just plain negligent.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Reply</title><page.no>15346</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>15346</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In closing the adjournment debate tonight, I want to thank senators for their contributions—although one would thank some more than others. I appreciate Senator Bishop's passion, but I hope anyone listening would not be confused about some of his opinions that were dressed up as facts and would know they should be checked before they are believed. Senator Bartlett spoke passionately about some group that seems to have a very strange view on life. Fortunately, he kept indicating that he did not agree with all of the items he had incorporated. </para></talk.start><para>I was very pleased to see my Queensland colleagues Senator Mason and Senator Santoro speaking on the debate, with Senator Mason giving a sterling account of some of the left-wing latte drinkers—a lot of whose thought transpires as opposition policy these days. Senator Santoro demonstrated why the Liberal Party does so well right across the state of Queensland: he has been out in the west of Queensland, where we often go. I might say that you never see a Labor senator out that way; you rarely see one outside the Brisbane CBD. Senator Eggleston demonstrated a very keen appreciation of some of the more delicate and interesting aspects of energy. He obviously has an expertise in that area that few others in Parliament House would. </para><para>I did want to urge Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—the Labor Party leader in this place—to get on with life and forget about things that have happened in the past. Most of Australia has appreciated the government's involvement in the Iraq war. They have been very grateful, as citizens of the world, to see the downfall of Saddam Hussein and his brutal regime that was the cause of many deaths of his own people—men women and children. The Labor Party cannot seem to let that go. They seem to want to live in the past and nitpick on these particular points. They should really take a lesson from the public of Australia, who are more interested in interest rates and the economy and in matters in rural and regional Australia than the Labor Party ever seem to be. It is no wonder the opinion polls for the Labor Party are so appalling at the moment. Nobody knows what the Labor Party stand for. Nobody understands what they are doing in this parliament. They certainly have no policies that the Australian public can have a look at to see whether they might at some time be considered as an alternative government.</para><para>The big issue for most Australians is the interest rates they pay on their housing loans. Many Australians remember the days, as I do, when Labor were in charge and we were paying 17 per cent on our home loan interest rates. I suggest there may be young people listening to this broadcast tonight who have bought a house in the last five or six years who would not believe me when I say that many of us were paying 17 per cent, when interest rates are now around six to seven per cent. That did not happen by accident. That happened as a result of good financial management by John Howard, Peter Costello and their colleagues on this side of the chamber in parliament.</para><para>In spite of some of the worst trading circumstances in recent times—the drought in Australia, the collapse of the Asian economy a few years back, the difficulties with the American economy—the Australian economy has continued to power ahead. It has not grown quite as strongly this year as in past years but it is still going in the right direction. Most Australians understand that you cannot run up debts all the time, as the previous Labor government did, and expect the economy to go well. One of the very significant achievements of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister has been to pay off $60-odd billion of the debt that Labor ran up.</para><para>Those are the sorts of things that Australians are interested in. They are not interested in hearing Senator Faulkner repeat, as he did tonight, questions he had been asking during this week and last week. Why he feels the need to repeat all those questions yet again simply escapes me. It does demonstrate, unfortunately, that the Labor Party has no forward agenda for Australians—nothing that Australians would be interested in looking at. I can only urge Senator Faulkner and his colleagues to get with the present, have a look to the future and try to offer the Australian people some policies that will enhance the economic and political debate in Australia—forget the past, forget the nitpicking, forget the attempts to score political points, move on and get with what most Australians want: some idea of what the Labor Party might stand for in relation to the things that interest most Australians. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—I was not aware that, on the adjournment debate—</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—Senator Bishop, can I ask why you are speaking?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—I wish to make a contribution in response to the comments just made by Senator Macdonald.

The Government contends that the evidence shows that illegal logging is the principle cause of deforestation, not the legal activities of Australian mining companies. According to Indonesia's Department of Forestry, illegal logging activities result in the loss of 2.1 million hectares of Indonesian forest every year, costing the country $US600 million annually. By contrast, legal mining activities have disturbed less than 135,000 hectares of forest area (or less than 0.1 percent of Indonesia's land mass) in total since 1967.</para><quote><para>The Forestry Law, in its present form, contradicts the legal rights of mining companies, which have been operating under contracts of work agreed with the Indonesian Government before the law came into effect.

However, a number of factors led to the decision that the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) be responsible for policy relating to the new Military Compensation Scheme.</para><quote><para>First, a decision was taken by the Government shortly after the Review of the Military Compensation Scheme (the Tanzer Review) reported that the ADF would continue to be covered by the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. Consequently, occupational health and safety and compensation will continue to be prescribed by separate legislation with separate regulatory arrangements.</para><para>Second, the nature of military service, and particularly operational service (warlike and non-warlike), is such that there are extensive time lags before veterans may seek compensation, in some cases many years. As a result, the vast majority of compensation administration concerns personnel who are veterans or former members of the ADF.</para><para>Finally, if Defence were to be responsible for policy relating to the new scheme, it would be required to take on additional responsibilities such as health studies, veterans' health and provision of veterans' medical services.

However, the Government decision that the ADF will continue to be covered by the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 removed the need for any further consideration of a separate OH&amp;S regulatory authority.</para><para>(4)	Under the proposed new scheme funding will be allocated to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</para><para>(5)	The health care of serving ADF members is the responsibility of the Defence Health Services irrespective of whether their condition is compensable or not. Unlike present arrangements, serving members will not be able to access medical treatment under the new military compensation scheme unless the Service Chief agrees it is appropriate. Under the new scheme all treatment costs for serving members will be attributable to the Defence Health Services and post-discharge treatment costs for compensable conditions will be attributable to the Military Compensation Scheme.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Sandon Point </title><page.no>15359</page.no><subtitle><inline font-weight="bold">(Question No. 1772)</inline></subtitle><id.no>1772</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15359</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 13 August 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the order of the Senate of 16 October 2002, which requested the Minister to grant a request from the Wadi Wadi Coomaditchie Aboriginal Corporation for an emergency declaration under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Heritage (Interim Protection) Act 1984 in relation to the development at Sandon Point:</para></quote><para>(1)	Was such an emergency declaration made: if so, what was the outcome of the assessment referred to in the order; if not, why not.</para><para>(2)	What other actions, if any, has the Minister taken in relation to Sandon Point.</para><para>(3)	What other actions, if any, has the Minister taken that may have an indirect effect on development or Aboriginal Heritage at Sandon Point.</para><para>(4)	Does the Minister intend to take any action with respect to Sandon Point: if so, what actions or activities is the Minister intending to take; if not, why not.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15359</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	I did not make an emergency declaration under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 because I was not satisfied that the area specified in the application is a significant Aboriginal area within the meaning of the Act.</para><para>(2)	Stockland (Constructors) Pty Ltd referred the proposal to develop Stages 1 to 10 of Sandon Point on 4 October 2001 pursuant to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
