There are enormous issues of concern to the Australian public which we need to debate and will debate, but it is my belief that the government should be questioned on those issues before that debate, and now is the time to do that. I know the numbers are not here for that, but I register the Greens' objection to question time not being on today and that we cannot question the government on the issues we are going to debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>8181</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will support the motion before the chair moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I want to say, very briefly, that no opposition—and I do not think any party represented in this place—lightly forgoes an opportunity to have question time. This opposition certainly regards question time as one of the most important accountability mechanisms that we have in our system of government. But I think we need to be very frank about the situation we face here. We are confronting dramatic circumstances, with Australian troops having been deployed to a potential theatre of war by a government which has yet to fully explain the reasons for this deployment and the commitments that underpin it. But the opposition is prepared, in these unique circumstances, to give priority to the fullest possible parliamentary debate on this vital issue. </para></talk.start><para>As I said, it is a matter of being frank. I can make that comment and it might sound, I hope at least to some, a statement of high principle. If people do not accept the statement of principle, then let us deal with the real politics here. The real politics are this: that the opposition would have, if there had been a question time today, asked every question of the government on this issue of Iraq. And I know what the government would have responded if we were to have done this at two o'clock today, as Senator Brown suggested in, I think, a principled way. I know what the government would have said. They would have said, `We wanted to make a statement in this place. The answers to your questions are contained in the statement.' They may not necessarily have been the truth, as you know, Senator Brown, but they would have said in each and every case, `Wait for the statement.'</para><para>That is the problem we face, particularly in the situation where the House of Representatives is dealing briefly with the issue of bushfires and then moving to the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq. There is a principle here. There is an issue of balance to address, and it is a question for which arguments can be made on both sides. I can make an argument that I think is strong in terms of principle, but I think I can also say to the Senate that, as every senator knows, if we proceeded with a question time right now, Senator Hill or other senators answering questions would say, `Wait for the Prime Minister's statement.' I think we are better off getting on with the debate around the Prime Minister's statement and, of course, dealing with the other important issue of bushfires. There will be plenty of opportunity for us to hold this government accountable on those and other issues. I think this is not only an issue of principle but also an issue of good sense. Frankly, it is also politics. On balance I believe that, in this circumstance, while we do not lightly forgo question time, there is no alternative today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>8182</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is appropriate to briefly put the Democrats' views on record, given that the issue has been raised. I think a lot of the comments that Senator Faulkner has made are appropriate. This debate we are having now highlights that the debate on Iraq will be commencing in the House of Representatives before it does in the Senate. If we had had question time first, we would have had the strange situation of the House of Representatives being an hour into its debate on Iraq while we were still waiting to get to it. This would have made it even more difficult for the very important and separate contribution that this house will make to that debate to be noticed and given the attention it deserves. Given that the Democrats were the first to ask for a full parliamentary debate on this issue as long ago as May last year, I think that, now that we are finally getting the Prime Minister to make a statement, to delay consideration of it in the Senate would be rather contradictory to the position we have taken for many months.</para></talk.start><para>We do believe, however, that it is very unfortunate that the government has chosen to forgo question time. The fact that it has done that in the House of Representatives makes it very difficult and problematic for us to continue with it in the Senate whilst the House starts debating the Iraq statement. An alternative might have been for question time to occur later this evening and for questions to be put up consequent to the statement occurring so that the questions could be informed by the Prime Minister's statement. I think that would be preferable, and if there was possible support from others in the chamber for that approach then certainly the Democrats would move that way, even if it meant it was late in the evening.</para><para>The other point that does briefly need to be made is that, because of this government's atrocious scheduling of the parliamentary sittings, which we criticised last year and which we attempted unsuccessfully to alter last year, we have only two more sitting days of the Senate this week, and that is it until March. That is ridiculous at a time like this. We will now have only two days with a question time in the Senate until March, by which time, quite feasibly, war could well be under way. It is a very inappropriate and unfortunate dodging of scrutiny and accountability on the part of this government. I think other issues and other options, such as possibly extending question time tomorrow, should be explored. The Democrats, again, are happy to work constructively with other parties to see if we can extend a question time or to see if we can have a question time later on this evening after the statement has been released and debated, to at least get some extra scrutiny of the government. But we do believe that having question time before the statement—and we have been calling for the Prime Minister to make a statement and have a debate on this issue for nine months now—would be inappropriate, given that question time has been forgone in the House of Representatives. For that reason we do not support the Greens' motion. We obviously support the government's motion to bring on this statement now. Given the importance of bringing it on, I will curtail my remarks here. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>8183</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak in support of the Greens' amendment to this motion I believe we should use every single opportunity we can in this parliament to question the government on the decision that they have made. We should use question time and we should use the opportunity to take note of the ministerial statement that is made. To argue that, because the House of Representatives is forgoing question time and forgoing the opportunity to question John Howard on this very important issue, this house should also do so is simply not to recognise the importance of this house. The Greens will continue, on a range of opportunities that we get, to express not only the importance of this house but also the importance of using every opportunity that we can to question this government on the decisions that they have made regarding military invasion of Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para><para>Original question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSHFIRES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>8183</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>8183</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate--</para><para>(a)	extends its sympathies to all Australians who have suffered such grievous personal losses during the tragic bushfires throughout Australia over recent months, and particularly those in the Australian Capital Territory on 18 January 2003;</para><para>(b)	acknowledges the tireless commitment of the thousands of individuals, including the rural and metropolitan fire brigades, emergency and rescue services, ambulance services, the defence force, police, welfare groups, government agencies, councils and businesses from across the country, who were involved in fighting these fires;</para><para>(c)	expresses its enduring gratitude and admiration to these Australians, many of whom are volunteers, for their efforts and sacrifices and in particular acknowledges the bravery of those who risked their lives in fighting the fires; and</para><para>(d)	recognises that the way that communities heroically pulled together in a time of crisis truly demonstrates the strength of the Australian spirit.</para><para>I will just speak briefly to the motion. There is no doubt that it has been a terrible bushfire season, and of course we should be aware that the season may well not have ended. It has resulted in devastating losses. In terms of loss of life, there were four lives lost in the Australian Capital Territory, one in Queensland and one in Western Australia. I understand over 500 people have been injured and some serious burns victims are still in hospital in Canberra. It has been devastating in terms of loss of property and possessions, both private property and public property such as major infrastructure, bridges, electricity and the like. There has also been a terrible loss in terms of irreplaceable biodiversity.</para><para>The motion has been moved particularly to express sympathy to those who have suffered and to thank those who have contributed to fighting the fires, both the professionals and the volunteers. In excess of 10,000 firefighters, I understand, have been involved in combating the fires—as we said in the motion, some professionals and many volunteers—assisted by firefighters moving from state to state and also by those who have come from overseas. Firefighters from the United States and New Zealand were involved in fighting the Victorian fires. </para><para>I want to make particular mention—not surprisingly, I suppose—of the contribution of the Australian Defence Force. Their support included helicopters, water tankers, fuel tankers, generators, accommodation, bedding and rations, graders, fire trucks and personnel to clear firebreaks. I also want to make mention of the many government personnel in organisations who have been involved, because their contribution is often overlooked—those from Commonwealth instrumentalities, including PM&amp;C, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Department of Family and Community Services and Centrelink. For example, I was told this morning of the tremendous contribution the met bureau made in assisting firefighters by predicting movements of winds and the like. I also want to mention the volunteers other than the firefighters who again are sometimes overlooked—Red Cross volunteers et cetera. Many other areas have also supported this national effort in fighting these fires.</para><para>In concluding, although we will never be able to totally avoid bushfires in Australia it is important to assess the lessons learnt after each of these terrible experiences. It is time for further debate on preventive actions and on the appropriate management of national parks—for example, whether there should be more cool burns at appropriate times of the year rather than allowing the build-up of undergrowth with the terrible devastating consequences of hot burns, or further consideration of building codes and planning rules and the like to better prevent the consequences that we have experienced this season. It is time, of course, to look also at our firefighting efforts again and whether we are using appropriately all the technologies and opportunities that are available to most effectively fight these fires. It is time also to again look at whether we as a community are adequately responding to those who have suffered in terms of providing sensitive and appropriate support in all the circumstances. While you can prevent fires affecting property, you will never rule out fires within the Australian bush. It does seem to me that the way in which we manage the bushlands of Australia has led to fewer but much hotter burns with a much greater consequential loss of native species. That is a legacy that we can ill afford and it is an issue that we as a nation ought to give greater attention to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>8184</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I associate the opposition with the motion that has been moved by Senator Hill. There is no doubt that the Canberra fires were a reminder to all Australians of the harsh extremes that this continent can conjure up and the risks that many Australians face, whether they live in the bush or the city. The destruction in Canberra suburbs such as Duffy, Kambah, Chapman and Holder really does exemplify those risks. January 18 was a terrible day for the Canberra community—four lives were lost, 530 homes were destroyed, more than 30 farms were razed, and 3,000 sheep, 130 cattle and over 30 horses were killed. That is destruction on a massive scale. The fires in the Victorian high country and through the Kosciuszko National Park were not as destructive to property and to life but they wiped out a vast area of national park. During the worst of the fire period they too were a grave risk to whole communities and to the firefighters who spent many weeks tackling them. One firefighter died north of Perth last week during Western Australia's worst bushfires in many years.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that in this extraordinary season of fire emergencies Canberra has been hit hardest. The opposition's sympathies are especially with the families who lost loved ones in the fires. We also feel very deeply for the families who lost homes and property, and of course for the wider Canberra community, which has been so shaken by the events of a fortnight ago. To lose everything can be psychologically devastating and it puts on hold a person's life for quite some time. There has been a lot of comment about the community spirit that rose from the ashes over the past few weeks and I want to congratulate Canberrans on just hopping in and helping people in their community in the way they did. I would like to mention the local ABC 666 radio station, which came to play a pivotal role during the fires, providing minute-by-minute information on the emergency and assisting in the coordination of the emergency service activities. Special thanks go to the emergency workers, public servants and ordinary citizens who worked so hard and who are still working to help those who were affected—fixing the damaged infrastructure, housing families and putting out the fires. </para><para>The opposition welcomes the move by the ACT government under Mr Stanhope for a judicial inquiry into the tragedy. I think that is very important. Now that the back-burning is about done and the spot fires are put out we can move on to analysis and long-term planning. I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate that it is appropriate to have a debate around these sorts of issues. But I was disappointed to hear Mr Tuckey and Senator Macdonald questioning actions by the ACT and New South Wales governments while the emergency workers were still coping with the disaster. We all know that what happened was the result of many complex factors, and the reasons for this disaster will take some time to unravel. It is important and necessary that the circumstances of this tragedy are investigated so that we are better able in the future to avoid some similar disaster. But at the moment it is appropriate for us to focus on the human dimension of the tragedy—the lives lost, the lives shattered and the lives that have been affected. The Canberra community's response has helped immensely. I have the highest admiration, as does the opposition, for all those who have assisted the victims of the fires and lent a hand in putting lives back together. Mr President, the opposition supports strongly the resolution that has been moved. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>8185</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of my National Party colleagues to associate ourselves with the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and supported by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. We have absorbed the enormity of the bushfires that have ravaged the country in recent months. I suppose the only good thing to come out of those fires is that the spirit of Australia—the spirit of mateship and the spirit of getting in and lending a hand—is alive and well. </para></talk.start><para>The statistics are overwhelming, with only a few states untouched by the devastation. Approximately three million hectares have been burnt out, 600 homes have been lost—a staggering 530 in the ACT. Yesterday I had a look at the devastation of the affected areas of Canberra. It is something that you do not ever want to see again. I have also inspected the fires in Stanthorpe.</para><para>Every one of these fires represents a personal tragedy. Not only has there been a loss of family homes but a loss of precious family and personal memorabilia, such as photos, on which you cannot put any monetary value. The impact on the agricultural sector has been enormous. Precious stock, crops and water supplies were lost in farming communities where farmers were already struggling with the drought. The Commonwealth has in place natural disaster relief arrangements which reimburse states and territories for expenditure on relief measures, such as concessional loans and grants to farmers and small businesses to replace their damaged assets.</para><para>Seven lives were lost nationally—four in the ACT, one in Queensland and two in Western Australia—and hundreds of other people were injured. Given the magnitude of the fires over all those states, it is a miracle that more lives were not lost and it is a tribute to the outstanding efforts of our firefighters. I want to put on record my admiration for the firefighters, the police, the emergency services, the defence services and the many volunteers who fought the fires and provided assistance to those who suffered injury and loss. They put their lives on the line and were an inspiration to us all. More than 20,000 people have been involved in fighting the fires this season, including volunteer firefighters, support personnel from other emergency services and non-government organisations, and even firefighters from New Zealand and the United States. I want to pay tribute to the way Australians have responded to the needs of their neighbours and strangers alike, offering them accommodation, food and clothing. Again, it all speaks well for the Aussie spirit. We should not forget the donations of money and possessions to get the homeless back on their feet. </para><para>We pray for rain. We know that the threat of further fires still looms and our thoughts are with all those in communities that continue to face possible danger from bushfires. The Commonwealth government is working with territory and state authorities to provide the assistance that is needed. I offer my heartfelt sympathy to all those affected at this time as they try to rebuild their shattered lives and their communities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>8186</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats join with other members of the Senate in expressing our support for this motion and extending our sympathies to those many Australians who have been affected directly or indirectly by the bushfires that have raged through many parts of the country. It is worth noting that some of these fires are still ongoing and there are communities still threatened, particularly in Victoria. I know my Victorian colleague and deputy leader, Senator Allison, wants to particularly associate herself with this motion. </para></talk.start><para>Victorian bushfires alone have burnt out about 920,000 hectares from Mount Buffalo to the New South Wales border and firefighters are still on high alert in many areas as we speak. Many towns were affected dramatically. There are over 5,000 firefighters and emergency workers in Victoria, including people from the Department of Sustainability and Environment, the fire authority and the state's emergency services, and it is worth noting the important role played by the Army Reserve and the Australian Navy at times like this. Five hundred or so schoolchildren in affected areas of Victoria remain at home today. They are missing the start of the school year due to the dangers the fires pose. I guess when you are that age it might sound like a fun thing to miss school, but we all know the importance of ensuring access to education. </para><para>There has also been significant environmental damage to parks and forests, wildlife and livestock. It is a tribute to the efforts of so many that no people in Victoria have died. Over 400 people have been treated for injuries though and the ambulance service and health workers also deserve recognition. </para><para>My New South Wales colleague Senator Ridgeway also wanted to note the impact on his home state. Many thousands of volunteer firefighters have spent basically all of this year so far battling hundreds of bushfires across various regions of the state, but most recently in the south-east and Snowy Mountains region. Again, it is worth emphasising that these bushfire threats and their impacts have not just been for one day for many people. There has been the ongoing stress, the ongoing effort and the ongoing danger day after day for weeks on end.</para><para>From both those states, as well as from other states in Australia, firefighters also travelled here to Canberra to provide support during the particularly terrible events of 18 January which saw well over 500 homes destroyed and four people lose their lives. I pay tribute to the volunteers, who came from all states, including my home state of Queensland, to assist the people of Canberra, and to the firefighters from the USA. At a time when there is some antagonism towards the policy of the US government in relation to war, it is worth emphasising that that, at least from the Democrats' point of view, does not extend to blanket anti-Americanism. The bond that exists between many in the USA and Australia was demonstrated by the US firefighters coming here to assist.</para><para>The focus of this motion is on Canberra. I think that is appropriate, not just because of the massive damage and the loss of life but also because this parliament is based in Canberra. In many ways, sometimes the citizens of Canberra have their reputations slightly blackened by being associated with the actions of the federal government and the federal parliament when of course there is a Canberra community that is completely distinct from this parliament. Many people— workers in this building, staff, those whom we work with—in many ways were amongst those affected directly by the loss of homes, major damage and financial loss. Our thoughts and condolences go out to them.  </para><para>In Canberra, as well as the privately owned houses that were lost, it is worth noting that over 72 properties belonging to ACT Housing were also lost—that is, homes of public housing tenants. When public housing stock is a serious issue already, that puts a major dent in the availability of stock. An unknown number of private renters were affected. Seventy per cent of renters are known not to have contents insurance, often because they cannot afford it. The immediate needs of those people need to be focused on now. Whilst we know that the ACT government is providing assistance, we call on the federal government to explore whether or not they should provide appropriate assistance, particularly in terms of housing. There will be a need to examine ongoing issues relating to fire management. I think there will be time for that. At the moment it is time to extend our sympathies and condolences to those who have been affected and to those who are still being affected by fires. It is time to address their immediate needs—whether it is housing, whether it is protecting people from fires that are ongoing or whether it is the impact on volunteers. Once the threat dies away, that will be the time to look at some of the broader issues in a long-term sense.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>8187</page.no><name role="metadata">Reid, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name><name.id>VI4</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too support the motion that has been moved. In the short time available, I will address my remarks specifically to the events in the Australian Capital Territory on 18 January 2003. Everybody was affected by what happened that day. The whole of the territory was covered by thick smoke. One could see fire, sometimes in several directions at the same time. Nobody knew quite where it was coming from, where it would go or whether or not they would be affected by it. Many, many people were evacuated from their houses. Everybody responded to this. It was an incredible sense of threat. Nobody knew where it would end. There were extremely high winds. No vehicle could have travelled at the speed the fire was travelling at. There were extremely high temperatures. No house had been lost by this type of fire in the ACT since 1952, and 530 were lost that day.</para></talk.start><para>It is an enormous cost in so many respects to the community here—the things that people have lost of a personal nature that can never be replaced. A number of people here in Parliament House, as you know, lost their houses. Four people died: Alison Tener, Dorothy McGrath, Doug Fraser and Peter Brooke. Nobody in Canberra that day could really believe that the number was so few, that it was contained to that. How it was not much higher none of us will ever know. Three hundred people were injured. I commend the Canberra Hospital for the extraordinary way that it coped with the number of people going to the hospital. As has been mentioned, some are still in hospital in Sydney, suffering from the burns from that day. </para><para>Senator Faulkner referred to the loss of stock. In addition, thousands of native animals in this area were lost. Rural farms have been affected—I think 61 rural lessees—the livelihood of many of them put very much at risk. Huge acreages were affected. Namadgi National Park and the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve were virtually wiped out, including the breeding programs for native animals in the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. The loss of Mount Stromlo was something that Canberrans felt very deeply, because it is an icon in this place. It just melted down, which gives an indication of the heat of this fire. It was extraordinary. There are other places to talk of the detail of the infrastructure losses. Even the Kambah fire station went.</para><para>In Kambah, the waterlilies closed at 3.20 p.m. That is an indication of the darkness that lay over the suburb. The power went out at about 3.30 p.m. It had already gone out in Chapman, Holder, Duffy and the other suburbs. There was an enormous sense for everybody of isolation and detachment, of not knowing what would happen. The fire went over Mount Taylor, down to Torrens and Farrer. Then, subsequently, when we got radio coverage, it was in Lyons, 4½ kilometres from Parliament House. Three houses were lost there. People returning from the coast who heard about it were stopped from going to their houses, quite sensibly because it was so dangerous. How would they have felt, knowing the risk? </para><para>The response from the emergency services was outstanding. Tirelessly, they worked for days and days—because there have been a couple of other very serious situations since the 18th. The chief police officer, John Murray; Mike Castle of the Emergency Services Bureau; Peter Lucas-Smith, the ACT fire controller; and Ian Bennett, the Fire Commissioner, must all be commended. I particularly want to refer to the leadership of Jon Stanhope, the Chief Minister of the ACT, and to the outstanding personal qualities that he showed of compassion, tireless energy and leadership which were so important to our community during that time. The evacuation centres sprang up immediately, and one of them was further evacuated as the fire got close to Phillip.</para><para>All of the emergency services, and in particular the volunteers who worked so tirelessly during this time, were absolutely amazing. The Army rebuilt the bridge at the Cotter within days. That meant so much to a lot of people who were really cut off from the ACT by not being able to use the bridge. I also commend Telstra, the public service in Canberra, the ACT Ambulance Service, the ACT Emergency Services Bureau, the fire units—both rural and city—and, of course, the magic helicopters. It was one time when you were pleased to hear helicopters around, but for much of the week it was too smoky for them to operate—it was that bad. I shall not waste time on some of the ignorant articles that were written in some of the out-of-town newspapers—those articles were appalling.</para><para>I too, like Senator Faulkner, want to refer to the ABC. There was a wonderful cartoon of a fellow getting into a taxi at the airport. The radio was on and the call of `666 Canberra' was announced. The passenger who had just got off a plane from somewhere said, `666—I thought that was the devil's number.' The taxi driver said, `Not here, it's not.' Radio 2CN provided a lifeline to the community of Canberra. We could not have done without it. The station was not broadcasting from Canberra on that Saturday when the fire happened; it was broadcasting in the afternoon from Sydney as usual. The staff of the ABC voluntarily went in to put the station on air in Canberra. The staff of the ABC from Parliament House also went to the station on Northbourne Avenue. They just turned up and knew that it was necessary for this to happen, and they broadcast continuously over the following few days and, subsequently, over the next weekend. I cannot tell you how significant it was and how important it was to overcome that dreadful feeling of isolation. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> published graphic photos and stories. They too were a significant link for people knowing what was happening, for knowing where to go, for knowing what phone numbers to ring and for presenting information in a way that was absolutely essential. To those organisations, we all sincerely say thank you very much.</para><para>I could have spent all my allocated time today talking about Actew/AGL—that is, the electricity, water supply, sewerage and gas services in Canberra. Fifty thousand Canberrans in one day were without power and 7,000 were without gas. When the power goes off, you are in darkness—that is one thing—but when the gas is interfered with, it involves visiting all 7,000 homes to see that they are made safe. It was a huge job—visiting house to house. The lower Molonglo sewerage system was burnt but not totally out of action. That was serious because overflow from there would go into the Murrumbidgee River, which itself has little water at the moment because of the drought. So it was vitally important to restore the system. There was an appeal on the Saturday— straightaway—for people to cut down on what went into the sewerage system. Amazingly, within 24 hours there was less than 50 per cent of the normal flow. People responded so dramatically and the result was that the overflow dam did not spill into the Murrumbidgee River. That was extraordinary. </para><para>The competitors of Actew/AGL just came into town and helped restore the services: Agility from Melbourne, Energy Australia, Integral Energy, TransGrid, Country Energy. They all seemed to just arrive. One thousand poles were replaced within days and 75 substations were rebuilt. As I said, one could give a whole speech on this. Both the water treatment plants were shut down and were not responding on the day. They were restored quite quickly. As an example of this, there is a water reservoir on the small hill behind Chapman. The roof was blown off that reservoir and I am told it weighed eight tonnes. That is the strength of what was going on that day—nobody could have withstood it. Rain has been mentioned. We need rain, we need it desperately but, my goodness, it had better come gently. All around our reservoirs have been burnt out. There are lots of dead animals around and the department is making a supreme effort to collect them so that they do not pollute the water supply. But even with that effort the debris that would be washed into the water supply would be absolutely devastating. </para><para>But it is the community most of all that needs to be commended. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were in Canberra early on the Sunday morning. Centrelink, Canberra Community Services and ACT Housing were all out at the evacuation centres helping those who had lost so much. I have heard nothing but good stories about insurers responding promptly to what has occurred, and the response of the community was outstanding in every respect. I have not shown this, but I seek leave to incorporate a media release about the community knitting quilts for owners of all the houses that were lost. I would like to give some publicity to that cause. There is also an ABC concert at Stage 88 for all Canberrans next Sunday night.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Is leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Without precedent.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">MEDIA RELEASE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">33,000 SQUARES TO BE KNITTED BY CANBERRA COMMUNITY TO WRAP UP THOSE AFFECTED BY BUSHFIRES</inline></para><para>The Canberra community is invited to show their support in a practical way for those Canberrans who lost their homes in the January 18 bushfires by knitting squares to be sewn into 530 patchwork rugs.</para><para>A number of Canberra women have formed a group called Wrap-up Canberra to co-ordinate the knitting of woollen squares and their assembly into rugs.

As the other senator from the ACT, I too am deeply saddened to find myself speaking to this motion of condolence. There has been immense personal loss and emotional torment experienced by many people in the ACT and elsewhere in Australia as the fires continue to ravage this land. The experience felt by many Canberrans on that day is something that they have conveyed to me cannot be described. It has not been experienced before by many of the firefighters or by those who had to face the fire on the day. The magnitude, the heat and the ferocity of the fire that took place was something beyond imagination.</para></talk.start><para>I want to take the time to reinforce that point today because, if you visit the ravaged areas of Canberra, you can see what that fire left, but you cannot get a sense of just what happened and how quickly it happened. Over 600 homes were destroyed and 530 of those, as we know, were in Canberra. Around the country, seven people have died in the fires and four of those were here in Canberra on Saturday, 18 January. Alison Tener, aged 38, of Duffy, was the mother of three boys: Simon, Jason and Adam. Her husband David and her boys said that Mrs Tener gave of herself to help others and that she was the `best mummy' a kid could hope for. She loved her family and spending time together on Sunday picnics, having pizza on Friday nights and those wonderful simple family things that meant so much to her.</para><para>Dorothy McGrath, aged 83, of the Stromlo Forestry Settlement, is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers. Known to her neighbours as Dolly, she was a quiet, elderly woman who loved her dogs and who lost her life fighting to save her home. Mrs McGrath died, overcome by smoke, in the front yard of her home as she tried desperately to hose down her property. All but three homes in the small community in which she lived were lost. </para><para>Doug Fraser, aged 61, of Duffy, was the loving father of three, Wendy, Robyn and David; grandfather of Oliver and Emma, who was born just four days before the tragedy; and husband to Anne. He died whilst trying to protect his house in Burrendong Street, Duffy. He had very strong community connections, having given his time as the treasurer of the Weston Creek Wildcats, a local junior AFL club.</para><para>Peter Brooke, aged 73, of Duffy, was a retired Sydney businessman who died when his son's Duffy home was consumed by fire. Mr Brooke was a retired engineer and had moved to Canberra with his wife, Beverley, to be closer to his son Gary. Mr Brooke was a very keen gardener and cooking connoisseur who made good use of his home-grown vegetables.</para><para>The stories of these people whose lives were lost, and also the stories of many of the survivors, will continue to make the sense of tragedy very real to so many Canberrans. There were those of us who were not part of it, who just saw the smoke and the fires. Like many others, I was travelling home from the coast that day, and I drove into Canberra and saw the extraordinarily red sky. It was almost pitch black because the lights were out in so many suburbs. It was a horrifying day for those people directly affected, and those watching and listening expressed their fear. </para><para>I, like my colleague Senator Reid, would like to acknowledge those on the day who took a hands-on approach to what was happening. I refer to the crew at Triple 6. I mention in particular Leanne Scott, who was out on the scene, taking reports, putting them to air and providing very practical advice which, I believe, saved lives on that day. I acknowledge the role subsequently played by the media as they came together in order to provide a conduit for information and get the messages out from the ACT government. The ACT government have done everything possible and everything right in responding to this disaster, and as we now move into a recovery phase. They have channelled information through the media in order to get it to the people in need. I also mention the efforts of the FM stations, Mix 106.3 and FM 104.7, who conducted a radiothon last week because their staff wanted to do something tangible and meaningful. They raised tens of thousands of dollars by calling for donations from around Canberra.</para><para>There are many more stories of heroism that I am not able to refer to today. I also acknowledge Mike Castle, Peter Lucas-Smith, John Murray, Ian Bennett, and particularly my colleagues in the ACT Assembly, who have done an incredible job not only in responding to the disaster but in pulling together in what will be an extensive recovery phase. </para><para>Finally, I extend thanks on behalf of everyone affected to the emergency service workers—the firies, the ambulance officers, the police. Everybody came together and did the best job that they could in order to save lives. Hopefully, lessons have been learnt and we will now move on and be more prepared if we are confronted with such a tragedy ever again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>8191</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Bushfires are tragic and frightening events and few bushfire seasons have been more tragic than the season we are now enduring. Many have commented that the loss of life and property in this season has been the most severe since the 1967 Hobart fires. Let me remind the Senate that on 7 February 1967 some 110 fires burned within 40 kilometres of the city of Hobart, and that ultimately led to the burning out of the fringes of Hobart and the Channel districts, being 264,000 hectares, with the loss of 61 lives and more than 1,700 homes. So it is quite a comparison to say that this is probably the worst fire season since that time.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, for the families of those who lose loved ones and those who lose their homes and businesses, such comparisons are meaningless. The scale of loss experienced by so many Australian families in this bushfire season is immense by any standard. I hope that this proposed resolution conveys to those who have experienced such loss the immense sympathy and sadness of the Australian Senate. I hope that this proposed resolution also conveys to the firefighters and other emergency workers who have risked so much to contain these fires our deep gratitude for their efforts. </para><para>Following recent bushfire damage in the ACT, New South Wales, Victoria and my state of Tasmania, many have leapt quickly to apportion blame. It is clear that there are contributing factors, including the severe and sustained drought. Perhaps some human intervention or lack thereof contributed to bushfire damage. The time for a post mortem will come, but that time is not now. Now is the time to prepare for the remainder of this season and support those who have lost so much.</para><para>In that regard, as the shadow minister for primary industries and resources, I have a special interest in that area. Farmers, who are already suffering from the consequences of drought, have been hard hit. Property, stock and fodder losses have been great. Equally great has been the contribution of these same farmers and other rural residents to volunteer fire brigades.</para><para>I acknowledge the announcement made in recent days by the New South Wales and Victorian governments on recovery assistance for primary producers. The Carr government has extended drought based fodder and transport subsidies to farmers suffering stockfeed shortages due to fire. The Bracks government has extended assistance to fire-affected producers in the form of low interest loans. Senators will be aware that the opposition's National Bushfire Strategy was released by Mr Gavan O'Connor and Mr Simon Crean on 11 December last year. It heeded the warnings of Australia's top firefighters and ought to be considered by the government as part of its response to this season's fire emergency. Its elements included national plans for preparedness, response and recovery, investing more in our research effort, and working with the states and territories to establish a national pool of up to 11 aircraft. </para><para>Australia needs better operational coordination. I am sure that the government will work with the opposition and state and territory governments in order to learn from the losses of the past few weeks and do better in future. I implore the Prime Minister to lead this process himself and not to leave it to Minister Tuckey.</para><para>The past 12 months have been a period of almost unimaginable suffering for many Australians. Natural and human disasters have loomed in our lives on a scale almost unprecedented outside times of war. I think I can say this without fear of contradiction: we all hope for better times.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>8192</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support this motion not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of the ministers whom I represent in this chamber: Mr Tuckey, who is in charge of Emergency Management Australia, and Mr Warren Truss, who is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I particularly want to associate myself and my colleagues with the condolences to the bereaved and extend an understanding to those people, many of whom we work with every day here in Canberra in the various departments of government, who have suffered in so many ways as a result of the bushfires. </para></talk.start><para>Crises bring out the strength of the Australian spirit, and in times of crisis Canberra is no different from any other community in Australia when natural calamities occur, as they inevitably will in a country like Australia. Emergency service workers, particularly volunteers, have our admiration of and congratulations on their work, dedication and courage. Many people from my own department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, were involved in the emergency and recovery work, including, I might add, the veterinarians from my department who assisted with the tragedies that befell some animals. </para><para>As Senator Hill has said, there needs to be a full, open and independent inquiry into the bushfires around Australia. The federal government has understood the need for research into bushfires. In the middle of last year, the federal government allocated some $25 million to the Cooperative Research Centre for bushfires. The CRC will be doing very useful work in regard to bushfires in the future. </para><para>I have said that governments need to be careful when declaring national parks and that they should not do so unless at the same time they can give permanent and long-term resourcing to the proper management of those parks. As I understand it, no human action could have prevented the carnage which occurred around Australia in the last several weeks, but with proper management we can lessen the impact of fires when they do occur.</para><para>I should put into perspective the extent of the loss of our forests in Australia. For example, in Victoria in the last week fires have ravaged over 920,000 hectares of forest. The annual harvest of timber in Victoria is 10,000 hectares. The trees that we have lost in the last week or so represent 90 years of harvesting in Victoria. That puts into perspective the extent of the loss in the forests in Victoria alone in recent times.</para><para>I conclude by saying to all of those affected by the fires and the other calamities which have occurred in our nation since Christmas that the Parliament of Australia is with you in spirit, and the Parliament of Australia certainly supports all those impacted upon by the calamities in recent times.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>8193</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Greens, I join with everybody else in supporting this motion to send our condolences to those people whose lives and properties have been lost, who have been injured and who will be scarred by these fires for many years to come, if not for the rest of their lives, and to add a word of admiration of all those people ranging from neighbours to national services personnel who helped to ameliorate the impact of the holocaust and to minimise the damage in the heroic way in which they faced that emergency. It is an awesome, recurrent tragedy for Australia and Australians. It is remarkable to see how the community responds when holocaust comes upon the community and how brave people are in those circumstances.

We, all of us, hope that it will still be possible to find an outcome acceptable to the international community without military force being used. The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored. </para><para>The other point of agreement shared by senators, by our community and by the community of nations is that Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction—for the security and stability of our world, it must be disarmed.</para><para>For years the nations of the world have sought to persuade Iraq to abandon these most offensive of weapons.

Only one nation, acting alone, can make the choice for peace.

Saddam Hussein will not abandon his chemical and biological weapons programs. He will keep striving to build a nuclear capacity. And he will almost certainly, at some time in the future, use these weapons to fulfil his ambition to dominate his region.</para><para>Given his aggressive history, who could blame his neighbours, when faced with an Iraq allowed to keep, through the default of the international community, weapons of mass destruction, if they decided that their own security necessitated a corresponding arsenal.</para><para>Worse still, other rogue states observing the world community's failure to deal with Iraq will be encouraged to flout the international conventions on arms control and develop their own chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons.</para><para>We should all be deeply concerned about a world in which weapons of mass destruction become the norm. The more nations that possess these weapons the greater the risk that they will be used. The likelihood of them falling into the hands of terrorists multiplies as their numbers proliferate. Proliferation of these weapons will make the world a much more dangerous place for all of us.</para><para>Through failure to deal once and for all with Iraq, the world will have effectively given a green light to the further spread of these weapons and have further undermined the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and the conventions on chemical and biological weapons which the world—and not least Australia—has worked so hard to build over the last 30 or more years.</para><para>At the heart of this debate must be a recognition of the threat posed to the security of the world through the progressive breakdown of the international covenants against proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of chemical and biological weapons.</para><para>The world has developed over time a series of treaties, conventions, protocols and control regimes both to prevent the proliferation of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and, where possible, to eliminate such of those weapons as may exist.</para><para>Australia is vehemently opposed to the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We do not possess these weapons and we wish to ensure that they do not become an acceptable part of every nation's arsenal. They are too dangerous. Their destructive power is hundreds of times greater than conventional weapons—terrible as they may be. Their destructive force is not easily contained or controlled and their effects can span the generations. These are no ordinary weapons. </para><para>Every time a nation is allowed to undermine the international treaties and agreements put in place to restrict or prohibit the spread of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the world becomes more dangerous for all nations.</para><para>Australia—under both coalition and Labor governments—has been a staunch supporter and active proponent of multilateral action to stop the spread of these weapons.</para><para>We, therefore, have a direct and lively interest in ensuring that the international order against the spread of such weapons is not eroded but rather reinforced.</para><para>It is true that too many nations already include weapons of mass destruction in their armouries. Other nations have developed nuclear weapons—but only two stand accused of breaching the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty: Iraq and North Korea.</para><para>Iraq has been thumbing its nose at the United Nations persistently and publicly for 12 years. In North Korea's case the extent of its breach of international commitments has only recently become apparent.</para><para>The international community, with Australia playing a leading role, has begun to deal with North Korea. The security of our region and that of the broader world demands that North Korea be brought back into compliance with the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.</para><para>It is ludicrous to suggest, as some have, that because Australia wants the Iraqi issue resolved then we are passive or indifferent about North Korea. Both pose great threats to world security. Both are of intense interest to Australia. It is not a question of choice— both must be dealt with.</para><para>I pose the simple question. What hope does the world have of dealing peacefully and effectively with North Korea if the Security Council is seen to deal weakly with Iraq?</para><para>Just as we accept without reservation that stability in North Asia is crucial to our economy and our security, we must recognise that the Middle East is not remote or irrelevant to Australia.</para><para>Australia is home to several hundred thousand people of Middle Eastern background. We welcomed them, some of them refugees from Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, and we appreciate their contribution to our nation. Many of them could be torn between seeing Saddam brought to account and the possible dangers facing their families back in Iraq. During this time, they will need our compassion and our support. All Australians should ensure that this is offered.</para><para>For almost 20 years Iraq has been a constant threat to its neighbours. If Iraq emerges from its current confrontation with world opinion with its arsenal of chemical and biological weapons intact, the potential for Saddam Hussein's aggression against his neighbours to be renewed will be greatly enhanced. Iraq will again feel free to coerce and intimidate countries in the region.</para><para>The old policy of containment is eroding. Saddam Hussein has increasingly been able to subvert the sanctions. Smuggling of oil from Iraq and the illegal importation of proscribed goods into Iraq have increased dramatically in the last few years.</para><para>Despite the valiant efforts of the weapons inspectors—who destroyed far more of Iraq's weapons programs than Saddam Hussein ever expected—Iraq has still been able to hang on to most of the knowledge and equipment it needs.</para><para>Inspectors have never been able to eradicate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs—at best they slowed their development.</para><para>There will be no stability—no security— for the nations of the Gulf until Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction— totally and permanently.</para><para>Disarming Iraq will bring enormous benefits to the Middle East and will be widely welcomed. </para><para>Clearly, however, the international community must redouble its efforts to resolve the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</para><para>I again call on both sides to bring an end to the violence affecting Israelis and Palestinians. Neither side should make the mistake of alienating, through violence, those who are willing and ready to negotiate a settlement.</para><para>Israel has no stauncher ally than Australia in its pursuit of the right to exist within secure and internationally recognised borders.</para><para>Australia strongly supports the creation of a viable independent Palestinian state.</para><para>It remains a great tragedy that the courageous efforts of Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who offered the Palestinians the great bulk of their demands, were ultimately repudiated by the Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat.</para><para>As a genuine friend of Israel's, I urge Ariel Sharon to use the authority of his re-election to take whatever opportunity might reasonably arise to engage the Palestinian Authority in constructive peace discussions.</para><para>He should facilitate all bona fide international attempts to bring the parties together.</para><para>Can I, however, Mr President, say this to the members of the Palestinian Authority.</para><para>How can the Prime Minister of Israel be expected to do these things while ever the murderous pattern of suicide bombing continues to be inflicted on the Israelis?</para><para>In the end result, however, any action taken against Iraq must be justified on its own merits. It will not and cannot be predicated on whether or not other challenges to world security have been addressed.</para><para>The overriding concern about Iraq is its record of aggression and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein clearly does not see them as weapons of last resort. He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.</para><para>This is a doleful distinction, which Iraq shares with no other country.</para><para>Iraq has form. Saddam Hussein has without provocation invaded Iran and Kuwait. He has fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain and Qatar. He has bullied, threatened and extorted Syria, Jordan and the Gulf States.</para><para>Who knows what other horrors he might have perpetrated on the Kurds or the Shiah Muslims if not for the no-fly zones which Britain and the United States have enforced for these last 12 years.</para><para>Iraq also has a long history of training and supporting regional terrorist groups. It supports Palestinian suicide bombers who have caused such death and destruction in Israel.</para><para>Iraq's history of relationships with and support for terrorist organisations magnify our concerns. The rise of international terrorism adds a new and frightening dimension to the threat posed by the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.</para><para>The ultimate nightmare for us all must be that weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of terrorists. The more the world leaves unchecked either the possession of such weapons by rogue states or the spread of those weapons, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will acquire and use them.</para><para>It cannot be stressed too strongly, Mr President, that all of this is added to the fact that Iraq has flouted with impunity the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.</para><para>The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.</para><para>We share the view of many that, unless checked, Iraq could, even without outside help, develop nuclear weapons in about five years.</para><para>Even before the report of the head of the United Nations weapons inspection body there was compelling evidence to support these beliefs within the published detailed dossiers of British and American intelligence.</para><para>On the basis of the intelligence available, the British Joint Intelligence Committee judged that: </para><para>·	Iraq has a useable chemical and biological weapons capability, which has included recent production of chemical and biological agents.</para><para>·	Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons—uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil nuclear application in Iraq.</para><para>·	Iraq possesses extended range versions of the Scud ballistic missile in breach of Security Council resolutions, which are capable of reaching Cyprus, Turkey, Tehran and Israel.</para><para>·	Iraq's current military planning specifically envisages the use of chemical and biological weapons. In its view, Saddam Hussein is determined to retain these capabilities.</para><para>The analysis provided by the Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency reached similar conclusions; that is:</para><para>·	Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.</para><para>·	It has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin and VX.</para><para>·	All key aspects—R&amp;D, production, and weaponisation—of Iraq's offensive biological weapons program are active and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War.</para><para>The intelligence material collected over recent times, to which Australia has contributed, points overwhelmingly to Saddam Hussein having acted in systematic defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council, maintained his stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and sought to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. </para><para>Given the strong and critical language of the Blix report, the nations which comprise the Security Council face a stark and difficult choice.</para><para>The council must either act to ensure full compliance by Iraq with resolution 1441 or, through either excessive delay or indifference, risk crippling its own authority.</para><para>To emphasise the weight of responsibility, which rests upon the current members of the Security Council, it is worth recalling to the Senate some brief history of this matter.</para><para>In 1991, the United Nations Security Council wanted to ensure that the Iraqi President was no longer in a position to launch any more unprovoked attacks on his neighbours. It resolved that Iraq must declare and then destroy all of its chemical and biological weapons and any materials or facilities connected with Saddam's attempts to achieve nuclear capability—his weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was prohibited from ever again possessing such weapons.</para><para>When an aggressor is defeated it is a normal and wise practice for the world to seek greater security by demanding the destruction of its offensive weapons—both Germany and Japan were required to disarm after World War II. Both did so and have maintained their commitment to, and championed the cause of, peace.</para><para>Saddam Hussein too agreed to disarmament—to allow the United Nations to supervise and record the destruction of his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear capacity.</para><para>On this basis, and this basis alone, the world community agreed to cease hostilities against Iraq in April of 1991. Iraq was allowed to maintain a conventional force—no-one questions Iraq's right as a sovereign nation to protect itself by maintaining conventional defensive weapons.</para><para>The cease-fire effectively was conditional on Iraq continuing to comply with the terms laid down by the Security Council—including, and importantly, the commitment to renounce weapons of mass destruction. To ensure compliance, the UN determined to continue economic sanctions against Iraq.</para><para>For 12 years the community of nations has tried to cajole and encourage Iraq to honour the Security Council resolutions.</para><para>For 12 years the international community has tried to contain his ambitions and limit his capacity to keep or manufacture weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>For 12 years Australian Navy personnel have supported the multinational interception force in the Persian Gulf, which enforces sanctions against Iraq—the crew of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, which was farewelled on 23 January last, are our most recent contribution to this important operation. </para><para>For eight years the Iraqi President obstructed the weapons inspection teams, who were charged with verifying his compliance with the UN resolutions. And for the last four years, until last December, he refused them entry to Iraq.</para><para>Iraq has not complied with 24 out of the 27 provisions contained in successive Security Council resolutions. Over the last 12 years the Security Council has passed no fewer than nine resolutions condemning Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors. Iraq has had a lot of time and plenty of opportunities to get it right.</para><para>The government has consistently argued that the United Nations needs to deal with Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the Security Council's authority.</para><para>This was the view that I put to President Bush shortly before his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, in September last year. I then argued to him the merits of working through the United Nations.</para><para>That has been the steady theme of a strong diplomatic effort by Australia, ably led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para><para>He has supported a leading role for the United Nations in addressing this threat. Our close relationship and our ready access to the US administration has meant that our views are heard and respected.</para><para>We approached Security Council members in capitals and in New York to encourage a constructive resolution. We recently sent an envoy to South-East Asia to consult key partners in the region and inform them of Australia's position.</para><para>The foreign minister's consultations in Europe last week demonstrated we are not alone, neither in our concern, nor in our preparedness, ultimately to act if necessary.</para><para>On 8 November last year, the Security Council passed resolution 1441. The nations which comprise the council, large and small, from all the regions of the world, of almost every faith and political persuasion decided, unanimously, that Iraq had been, and remained, in breach of its obligations. In particular they drew attention to Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors and to complete the required disarmament actions.</para><para>The resolution puts Iraq on notice—the consequences of non-compliance will be serious.</para><para>If the compelling terms of this last resolution are not enforced, then the Security Council's deeds will have failed to match its rhetoric and serious long-term damage will have been done to the United Nations.</para><para>In hindsight the world has been too trusting—not careful enough in our dealings with the Iraqi President. But the situation is different now. Iraq has not changed—but we have. We now understand, after the events in Bali and those of 11 September 2001, that we are living in a world where unexpected and devastating terrorist attacks on free and open societies can occur in ways that we have never imagined possible.</para><para>There is a new dimension to international relations and we cannot ignore it. The atrocity in Bali demonstrated something Australia had never fully understood until then—that we are truly vulnerable. In light of this we have reappraised the way we view and deal with the threat of terrorism. We understand the danger of leaving threats unaddressed.</para><para>As the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, said last Saturday there are two grave issues the world must now confront: the problem of weapons of mass destruction and the challenge of international terrorism. </para><para>He said that if both were not dealt with, they would sooner or later come together with terrifying consequences for the world.</para><para>On 8 November, the Security Council decided to—and I will use the words of resolution 1441—`afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations'. </para><para>The Security Council has given the Iraqi President one last opportunity to demonstrate his willingness to fulfil the commitments he gave in 1991. The terms of the resolution are explicit and prescriptive. Iraq is required to demonstrate compliance. The onus is not on the inspectors to find prohibited weapons or programmes. It is on Iraq to prove that it has destroyed its weapons and dismantled its programmes. </para><para>And how has Iraq responded? </para><para>The weapons inspectors have given their first comprehensive report. They have been very critical of Iraq's attitude—in Dr Blix's view Iraq has cooperated on process but not on substance. The studied impudence of Iraq to the rest of the world has again been on display.</para><para>Without Iraq's active and sincere cooperation the weapons inspectors are wasting their time. Inspectors can assist Iraq disarm, they can verify to the world community that Iraq is disarming—they cannot, simply by their presence, achieve disarmament.</para><para>Dr Blix did not expressly ask for more time. He did, however, ask for more cooperation. Those who argue that the key issue is to give the inspectors more time have missed the point. </para><para>The inspectors don't need time. They need Iraq's cooperation. If Iraq was demonstrating full compliance, I would argue they be given all the time in the world. But this is demonstrably not the case. </para><para>At the end of last month, Dr Blix reported to the Security Council that all the questions concerning disarmament of Iraq remain outstanding.</para><para>The resolution had posed two important tests by which Iraq could demonstrate compliance—the provision of a full and accurate declaration of the regime's weapons of mass destruction and active cooperation with the inspection process. </para><para>Dr Blix reported that Iraq had failed both tests.</para><para>The point must clearly be understood that, following its defeat in the Gulf War, Iraq admitted to possessing chemical and biological weapons and to developing a nuclear programme. In those circumstances the overwhelming imperative is that Iraq demonstrates to the world that it has destroyed those weapons and disbanded those programmes. That, in fact, is what this debate is all about.</para><para>The world demands to know precisely what happened to Iraq's pre-1998 weapons and material. Iraq claims to have destroyed them—but Dr Blix is right to demand proof.</para><para>There are 6,500 chemical bombs—including 550 shells filled with mustard gas, 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent— including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve agent VX, 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals—300 tonnes of which could only be used for the production of VX, and over 30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents—all unaccounted for.</para><para>In 1995, the international community was confronted by Iraq's massive programme for developing offensive biological weapons— one of the largest and most advanced in the world. </para><para>Despite four years of intensive inquiries and searches, the weapons inspectors did not even know of its existence until Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, defected. Faced with its duplicity Iraq finally admitted to producing aflatoxin—which causes cancers, the paralysing poison botulinum and anthrax bacteria.</para><para>It admitted to manufacturing 8,500 litres of anthrax. A single gram is enough for millions of fatal doses. Dr Blix wants proof that the anthrax has been destroyed—and so do we.</para><para>Iraq must account for the large quantity of its undeclared growth media for biological weapons and for all its Scud B ballistic missiles. It must explain why it has rebuilt equipment and facilities destroyed by previous inspection teams. </para><para>It must allow the unfettered, unrestricted reconnaissance flights so relevant data can be collected and analysed. And it must allow the inspectors unsupervised access to relevant members of the Iraqi science community.</para><para>Other countries have, in recent years, volunteered to undertake a disarmament process—South Africa, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Disarmament can involve complex technical checks and processes—but it is still relatively simple provided there is a high-level political commitment to disarm, sound planning and most importantly full cooperation and transparency with weapons inspection teams. </para><para>The transparent, openly cooperative, behaviour of those three countries in disarming could not present a more vivid contrast with the stubborn, deceitful behaviour of Iraq, which has all the hallmarks of a nation which is hiding something.</para><para>The world community is not asking the Iraqi regime to prove the impossible. It is asking for straightforward answers to a series of very serious questions.</para><para>Now is not the time to relieve the pressure on Iraq.</para><para>And there is only one form of pressure that Saddam Hussein understands—the threat of military force. </para><para>We have tried sanctions and containment. Sanctions can be a very powerful instrument of persuasion but have little influence over a dictator who cares nothing for the wellbeing of his people.</para><para>The brutal treatment by Saddam Hussein of his own people can be seen through his cruel and cynical manipulation of the oil for food program developed by the United Nations.</para><para>For the last 12 years Iraq has been able to trade its oil for humanitarian goods—food and medicines—under United Nations supervision.</para><para>Tragically for the Iraqi people, Saddam Hussein has rorted the program, violated its provisions and evaded its constraints. A significant portion of the humanitarian goods are re-exported from Iraq for cash and oil is routinely smuggled out and sold illegally so that Saddam Hussein can finance his weapons programs.</para><para>It is the threat of military action which has proved to be the most effective, and perhaps the only, means of attracting President Hussein's attention.</para><para>The Secretary General of the United Nations has recognised the value of this strategy. Kofi Annan has stated publicly that in his opinion if the Americans had not applied military pressure through the build-up of forces in the Gulf, the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. There can be no stronger statement of the diplomatic value of the military deployment. There could be no more explicit rejection of America's critics.</para><para>The Australian government has the same view. Like the Secretary General, we recognise the value of this strategy and do not consider that the burden of it should fall to the United States and the United Kingdom alone.</para><para>That is one of the reasons why elements of the ADF are being pre-positioned in the Persian Gulf.</para><para>Mr President, this is not the first time that Australia has pre-positioned forces in the Gulf, both to apply diplomatic pressure against Saddam Hussein and in anticipation of possible military action against Iraq.</para><para>In 1998, in the lead up to Operation Desert Fox the government pre-positioned Special Air Service forces and two refuelling aircraft with British and American forces in the Gulf. We did so in the absence of any new, specific, Security Council authorisation and on the understanding that a final decision to commit to military action had not been taken at the time of deployment. The aim then, as now, was to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. The circumstances of the pre-positioning of Australian forces in 1998 are so similar as to be nearly identical. </para><para>In 1998, the then Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Brand—a former defence minister—recognised the value of the strategy, when he said and I quote:</para><quote><para>... part of the reason why we have supported the government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the United Nations Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the United Nations Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred.</para></quote><para>In deciding to pre-position our troops, we were also responding to advice from the Australian Defence Force that if, at some time in the near future, we wish to participate in military action our troops would be advantaged by having the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise. </para><para>Mr President, over the past few months there has been sustained criticism from some quarters, both here and abroad, regarding the role of the United States on this whole issue.</para><para>So much of that criticism has been either wrong, unfair or downright prejudiced.</para><para>No criticism is more outrageous than the claim that US behaviour is driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves. Self-evidently, if cheap oil supplies were America's dominant motive, then years before now the United States would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions in return for plentiful supplies of low-priced oil.</para><para>I have no doubt that the driving force behind American policy towards Iraq now is that, in the wake of the events of 11 September, they have a justifiable concern that the twin evils of weapons of mass destruction, in the hands of rogue states, and international terrorism come together with horrific consequences.</para><para>The United States has also been falsely accused of acting unilaterally and thus in contemptuous disregard for the role of the United Nations.</para><para>The issue of Iraq is now before the Security Council precisely because of the actions and pressure of the United States.</para><para>For almost four years the Security Council had left Iraq in the too-hard basket. On 12 September 2002, President Bush addressed the General Assembly and reminded the United Nations of its responsibility to deal with Iraq's repeated defiance of Security Council resolutions. </para><para>Unless, therefore, it is regarded as provocative and contemptuous of the United States to charge the United Nations with the obligation of enforcing its own decisions, this allegation against the United States is without any substance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—What about Israel?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—I dealt with Israel earlier; I am sorry you were not here.

That authority was never sought because of an apprehended Russian veto.</para><para>A subsequent joint Sino-Russian motion condemning the NATO action was defeated. There the matter rested. The Security Council was taken to have acquiesced in the NATO action.</para><para>Our goal is disarmament. We want to see a renewed commitment to the principle of nonproliferation.

We want Iraq back in the community of nations—because it would be good for the world, good for Australia, and good for the people of Iraq. Most of all we want the conflict resolved without resort to military force.</para><para>If the international community does not act now to disarm Iraq, it will have made a mockery of years of effort to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It will have encouraged others to mimic Iraq. It will make dealing with North Korea almost impossible. And, most importantly, failure to act will gravely compromise the authority of the United Nations. </para><para>Clearly the pre-positioning of Australian forces and the contingency planning with the US military—to which ministers and the Prime Minister have referred frequently over recent months—have put Australia in a position where it can effectively, and in circumstances providing the best assurances of safety for our forces, contribute to a military operation against Iraq, should a final decision be taken for this to occur.</para><para>The moment for that final decision has yet to arrive.

Yesterday at a press conference the Prime Minister said of the deployment:</para><quote><para>... what I owe to the Australian people is the honest prosecution and commitment to what I believe ...</para></quote><para>They are the Prime Minister's words. Maybe he is being honest with himself, but he is not being honest with the rest of Australia. Mr Howard's conduct in committing our young people to war, but then saying that he is off to Washington on a peace mission, is doublespeak. His failure to explain to our defence personnel whom he is committing to war why they should go and what proof he has of Saddam Hussein's stockpile of weapons is even worse. The fact that Mr Howard has spent the last few months gearing up for war in cahoots with President Bush but without telling Australians is reprehensible. Australians deserve an explanation. They deserve answers. </para><para>We need to know what deals have been struck. We need to know about the contingencies. We need to know who is in command of our troops. Are they under Australian or US command? So far, Mr Howard has failed to come clean to the Australian people. The Prime Minister has breached the trust that exists between a nation and its leader. Mr Howard claims that he has deployed our troops to bring the maximum pressure to bear on Iraq to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction. He claims that if there is no UN mandate for military action he can bring the troops back even if the US decides to go it alone. The Prime Minister has said that he would withdraw Australian forces if there were a possibility that nuclear weapons could be used. But how could this be done? How does he propose to achieve this? What, if any, assurances has Prime Minister Howard personally sought from the Bush administration?</para><para>The Prime Minister had the chance today—perhaps his last chance—to tell the Australian people the truth on these crucial aspects of the deployment that he has already set in train. But he has chosen again not to bring the Australian people into his confidence. We in the opposition believe, and the majority of Australians believe, that Mr Howard has already made the commitment to war. We believe that the grounds are strong for the Senate to censure the government for undertaking the deployment of Australian troops to a potential theatre of war in the absence of any United Nations authorisation and without revealing to the Australian people the commitments on which that deployment is based.</para><para>President Bush's State of the Union address last week made it crystal clear that he is prepared to undertake military action against Iraq with or without authorisation from the United Nations. This is precisely the sort of unilateral adventurism that was consigned to the past by the establishment of the United Nations, in particular the United Nations Security Council. But in contrast to President Bush setting out his intentions clearly before the American people, Prime Minister Howard still refuses to tell the Australian people whether he will remain in lock step with President Bush in bombing Iraq even if the UN does not authorise military action at that stage. </para><para>Labor believes that Australian troops should not have been sent before the UN processes were concluded. We believe that the weapons inspectors are still doing their job and they ought to be given the chance to finish it. We believe in the authority of the United Nations Security Council to deal with the issue of disarming Iraq, and we have said that since April last year. The Prime Minister has not consulted the Australian people. He has not consulted the Australian parliament. But he has consulted President Bush—or at least President Bush may have talked to him. He said he was sending the troops because it was in the national interest. We want to know in whose national interest.</para><para>Let us not understate the size of the confidence trick that is being played on the Australian people. We are sending more than 2,000 troops. For a nation with a defence force the size of ours it is a huge commitment. It is twice what we have committed to Afghanistan. It is three times what we committed to the Gulf in 1991. This is the largest single commitment of combat troops since Vietnam. Such a decision should only be taken once a just cause has been established, and this has not happened. No evidence has yet been produced of a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. The weapons inspectors have not been given the chance to complete their job. Military action has not been authorised by the United Nations. </para><para>The Prime Minister said yesterday that he was going to Washington to inform President Bush of the views of the Australian people. I think we can assist the Prime Minister to say what those views are. The Australian people do not want a war. They do not want John Howard's war. They do not want George Bush's war. The majority of the Australian people certainly want to see Iraq disarmed but they want it done under the mandate of the United Nations and they want it done with the authority of international law. That is the position that the Australian Labor Party has consistently argued since April of last year. The Prime Minister is not going to the United States to tell President Bush what the views of the Australian people are. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—How do you know what he is going to tell him?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I know he is going to get his riding instructions. That is what he is going for. Everybody knows he is going to get his riding instructions. Let us look at the Howard government's flip-flopping on this issue. Last year when the Labor Party released its detailed policy statement on Iraq the foreign minister and the Treasurer accused us of being appeasers and said that we were `talking like Saddam Hussein' because we wanted the issue to go back to the United Nations Security Council. But in September when President Bush decided to address the General Assembly these ministers in the Australian government changed their tune. The government's rhetoric to some extent has come into accord with what Labor has been saying since April but now we await the government's actions actually matching that rhetoric.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The clear difference between the government and the opposition on this issue, I suppose, does come from a fundamental divergence of principle. Labor has supported the United Nations and the rule of international law. We helped create the United Nations from the ashes of the Second World War. Those efforts to settle international disputes through peaceful means were a proud achievement, and the forging of our strong relationship with the United States has also been a proud achievement. </para><para>I want to be clear about this: the Labor Party supports the US alliance. But we want a mature one. We do not want a toadying one. This alliance has existed for over 50 years. In Australian politics it has always had bipartisan support. It does not mean that we have to agree with every policy position of every US administration. We have had our differences in the past. But the alliance has endured because, fundamentally, Americans and Australians believe in the same things. They believe in democracy. They believe in freedom, and they believe in respect for the rule of law. But if the US flouts decisions of the United Nations it sends a signal to other nations not to be bound by those decisions. </para><para>It is in the interests of nations like Australia for the rule of law to be strong. A strong UN can ensure that nations disarm and can stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in our region. The Prime Minister says that his main reason for deploying Australian troops to Iraq is to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But ask yourself this question: what has the Howard government done in the last seven years to strengthen UN arms control? Nothing that I can see. The Prime Minister has remained silent on the Canberra Commission report. The Canberra Commission clearly said:</para><quote><para>The possession of nuclear weapons by any state is a constant stimulus to other states to acquire them.</para></quote><para>Where is Mr Howard's brave new initiative to push forward on nuclear arms control? Labor has called for the Canberra Commission to be reconvened with a new mandate to decide what steps are needed to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missiles. The Prime Minister has been unable to convince the US government to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which even Foreign Minister Downer described as a major milestone which will bring the nuclear arms race to a definite end. Mr Howard said nothing when, last year, the US government walked away from negotiations towards a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention which could have provided the transparency and confidence that all countries were working towards eliminating these terrible weapons. Mr Howard says he has been told that nothing in the US preparations for war with Iraq includes the possible use of nuclear weapons, but a White House spokesman admitted that `all options are on the table'. The Bush administration has made it clear that it reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force, including through the use of nuclear weapons. So the question remains: what action will Mr Howard take in relation to the deployment of Australian troops, should the US make plans to or indeed actually use nuclear weapons? </para><para>Today the Senate is considering the unusual action of expressing no confidence in the Prime Minister's handling of matters relating to military action in Iraq. The opposition do not move this motion lightly. We have carefully considered all the issues involved. We have expressed our unequivocal support for the members of the Australian Defence Force who have, through the process of decisions made by the government of the day, been deployed overseas in readiness for military action in the near future. Those ADF personnel will certainly continue to have the full support of the Labor Party and of the Senate if this motion is passed. The opposition have no quarrel with the ADF; our quarrel is with the government. The Australian Defence Force takes its instructions from the government, and that is how it should be in a democracy. We will never condemn our defence forces for following those instructions, as they are obliged to do. So, even though Labor disagree with the government's political decision, we will not turn our backs on the young people of the Australian Defence Force. We believe that those personnel, their families and the entire Australian community deserve to be brought into the confidence of the government about why the deployments are proposed, what action will be undertaken during those deployments and how the deployments are authorised by the world community through the United Nations.</para><para>The Prime Minister has deliberately chosen to keep these ADF personnel, their families and the Australian community in the dark over recent months. I think he has continued that deception today. We are no closer to knowing what commitments he has given to George W. Bush, what joint plans are agreed for military action on the other side of the world or what UN authorisation would be necessary for Australian troops to undertake warlike action. We do not know what price Mr Howard is prepared to pay in his support for President Bush. We do not know how Mr Howard can justify the massive use of military force, including the possible use of weapons of mass destruction, in pursuit of removing weapons of mass destruction from the hands of the dictator of Iraq. We do not know whether Mr Howard backs President Bush's stated aim of regime change in Iraq. We do not know if or why Mr Howard accepts US statements about links between al-Qaeda and Iraq. We do not know any of these things, because Mr Howard refuses to bring the Australian people into his confidence about one of the most serious decisions that any Australian Prime Minister, any government, can make. Is there a more serious decision than one to send Australian troops to war? It is for these reasons, for this fundamental failure of basic responsibilities on behalf of the Australian people, that we believe that Prime Minister Howard deserves the strongest possible censure by this house of the Australian parliament, the Senate. I urge the Senate to support Labor's amendment to the motion before the chair.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>8206</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats welcome the Prime Minister finally giving us a statement on this crucial issue affecting our nation. We welcome the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner in relation to this matter. As early as March last year, it was reported that the Prime Minister, while in London, had stated his belief that the Australian public would support extending our involvement in the war on terrorism to other theatres such as Iraq. It has taken this long for the Prime Minister to share his rationale with the parliament and the Australian people. We all know that the Australian public do not support extending our involvement to theatres such as Iraq. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats first questioned the Minister for Defence in March of last year about Australia's potential involvement in a war on Iraq. We called as long ago as May and June of last year for full parliamentary debates on this issue. It has taken a long time for the Prime Minister to step forward and make a statement to the parliament and to enable a parliamentary debate at this level. But, unfortunately, the statement he has made does not make the case for the extreme action of putting Australia at war. Perhaps, in a sense, it is fortunate that he has not made that case. But it is also unfortunate that he has not made an attempt to outline a pathway to peace. This is a great hole in the entire content of the Prime Minister's very long statement. </para><para>We still have a significant threat, not just of Australia being involved in a war that should not occur but that of a war that may involve nuclear weapons. Neither the US nor the UK governments have categorically ruled out using nuclear weapons against Iraq. The Democrats urge the Prime Minister, while he is overseas next week, to seek absolute guarantees from the US and UK leaders that nuclear weapons will not be used under any circumstances. If those guarantees are not available, the Prime Minister should honour his previous statements to the Australian people that our nation will not be involved in a war if there is a prospect of nuclear weapons being used, and he should withdraw Australia's support forthwith. We welcome that aspect of the amendment that has been moved by Senator Faulkner. We acknowledge and thank the opposition for their cooperation in drawing up an important motion that I hope and believe will be adopted by the Senate. In his statement, the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>Our close relationship and our ready access to the US administration has meant that our views are heard and respected.</para></quote><para>That being the case, the Democrats urge the Prime Minister to use Australia's relationship with the US to ensure that this conflict does not escalate into war and that the views of the Australian people are heard and respected by the United States of America. In March of last year, the Democrats asked for assurance that Australia would not make any further military commitment without the full approval of the UN Security Council and of the Australian parliament. Instead, we have seen the Prime Minister commit Australian troops despite not getting ratification by the parliament or having the approval of the UN Security Council.</para><para>The Democrats welcome and support the motion before the chamber censuring the government for forward deployment of Australian troops to a potential theatre of war without the authorisation of the UN, without revealing to the Australian people the commitments undertaken and without any mandate from or even ratification by the Australian parliament. The Democrats have called, and continue to call, for a conscience vote for parliamentarians on Australia's involvement in a war against Iraq. We have had conscience votes on issues defined as moral issues in the past in this chamber, a principle the Democrats strongly support. It is hard to think of a more fundamental moral issue than whether or not our nation should commit itself to war. It is a disgrace that our parliamentarians are not able to have—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—That is a dumb statement.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—Senator Boswell apparently thinks that is a dumb statement.

I suggest you pay attention to having your National Party colleagues stay awake during your leader's speeches rather than worrying about what others are saying. It is hard to think of a more moral issue than whether or not a nation should commit itself to war. It is astonishing to the Democrats that parliamentarians in other parties are not able to have a free vote on questions relating to that matter.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Over the past 11 months, the Democrats have asked many questions of the government, particularly of the Minister for Defence, and have moved many motions calling on the government to listen to the Australian people. It is a tragedy we have only a couple of sitting days for the Senate this month to further pursue those issues. We proposed that a Senate inquiry be conducted by the defence and foreign affairs committee to examine the very issues we are trying to extract information on from the government today. If that proposal had been adopted at the time—I think it was in August last year—then we would have been able to get many of these answers put on the table. Unfortunately, that proposal was defeated by the government and the opposition.</para><para>As well as the debate in parliament, it is crucial to emphasise the ongoing campaigns out in the community. It is at that level where I believe this issue can still be won. I urge everybody in the Australian community who has concerns about the prospect of Australia being drawn into a war on Iraq or of any country being drawn into an attack on Iraq to make their views known now. It is clear we do not have much time. It is clear from every survey that the majority of Australian people do not support war. The Gallup International survey released today found that just 12 per cent of Australians supported unilateral action by the United States and its allies. I am pleased that the motion before the Senate at the moment rules out support for any such action. </para><para>There has been any number of comments and expressions of concern by people across the political spectrum. This is not some extremist, left-wing, fundamentalist, anti-American position. It is not risky politics; it is common sense and it is as mainstream as you get. It is a position that the vast majority of the Australian public support in terms of trying to prevent involvement in war. We have seen comments from many former veterans—probably they are the people who know better than anybody else the absolute horror of being involved in war—expressing concern for, and opposition to, the government's approach. We have seen organisations such as the RSL, at state level and nationally, expressing concern and opposition to the government's decision to predeploy troops. We have seen former prime ministers, key ranking people in the Liberal Party and former high-ranking Defence officials all expressing strong opposition to what this government has done. That is despite nearly 12 months of the Prime Minister's long campaign to try to convince Australians that this is a just war, a necessary war and a war which Australia should be involved in. The Australian people are not convinced, and nor should they be convinced, because there has been no case made and there are no good arguments for a war to occur in this context.</para><para>It is worth putting on record the Democrats' position in a bit more detail. If the United Nations does mandate military force against Iraq down the track, the Democrats will not automatically support Australia's involvement in a war. We support the amendment to the motion that has been put forward today requiring any activity to be through the United Nations. That is a necessary condition but it is not a sufficient condition as far as the Democrats are concerned. War must always be an absolutely last resort. It should be in response to a clear and imminent threat or invasion. A strong, clear case has to be made that there is no other option in avoiding significant bloodshed. Such a case has not been made before, and it certainly has not been made today, by the Prime Minister. Without a UN mandate, the Democrats believe that any military action would be not only highly dangerous and damaging but also illegal under international law.</para><para>I emphasise that in my view this would not make Australian soldiers war criminals. Whilst there is no doubt that a non-UN sanctioned attack would breach international law, the Australian government would be guilty of that breach. However, war crimes equate to major atrocities—genocide and activities like that. I am certainly not going to be party to giving weight to an argument that suggests that Australia's personnel that are sent to this war are automatically guilty of war crimes. It is worth emphasising the reference in the amendment to the motion before the chamber to the support for our Australian service men and women. The Democrats certainly support our Australian service men and women. Whilst we oppose the fact that the government has chosen to deploy them, nonetheless we still send our best wishes to them and hope they do not come to harm. We hope they are able to avoid being involved in any military action. The opposition to the war by the Australian community should be directed at the government, not at our service men and women.</para><para>As well as the uncertainty about whether or not the US and the UK will use nuclear weapons, there is ongoing concern about the fact that many weapons use depleted uranium. Major health consequences have been alleged as a result of those weapons being used in the last Gulf War. The Democrats believe that such weapons should not be used in any conflict in Iraq or, indeed, anywhere.</para><para>There have been many reports that the plans that are being developed for the attack by the United States and others involve massive bombing of infrastructure and targets in Baghdad, including civilians. There is no doubt that this would lead to widespread civilian deaths. We should not forget the thousands of Iraqi civilians who were killed during the 1991 Gulf War and the estimated 110,000 Iraqi civilians who died later due to infrastructure damage and the collapse of the health system. In Iraq, war would result in civilian deaths not just from military attack but also from starvation, exposure and disease, as infrastructure such as electricity, sewerage, water and food supplies is likely to be severely damaged. The United Nations oil for food program, which currently feeds around 24 million Iraqis, is likely to be suspended during any military action, creating an even greater probability of starvation or reliance on a completely inadequate emergency food supply. Any long-term interruption of this distribution system would create a monumental humanitarian disaster.  </para><para>It is worth making the point, when we note and mourn appropriately the deaths of comparatively very small numbers of people in bushfires and accidents, and having regard to the almost deification of seven US astronauts after their accident, that what we are talking about here with this potential war is hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians being killed. These are the same people who President Bush, in his address to the nation, said were `our friends'. President Bush said, `We are here to liberate you from the dictator Hussein.' But every reported action likely in terms of the milliary action that would occur would involve the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians. That is some way to treat your friends!</para><para>It is also worth noting that we as a nation operate in terms of international law not just via the UN Security Council but via many other conventions that have been put together, born of bitter experience, not least of which are the Geneva convention and protocols. Article 48 of the 1977 protocol, under `basic rules', states: </para><quote><para>In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.</para></quote><para>Clearly, from every piece of information about the likelihood of how any attack on Iraq would be conducted, there will be a deliberate strategy of targeting civilian objects such as infrastructure, electricity supplies, water, sewerage, roads and bridges. It will have a massive impact on the civilian population. If the reports are true—again, they have not been denied—of absolutely enormous numbers of cruise missiles blanket bombing Baghdad over the first two days of any invasion, inevitably there will be immeasurable numbers of civilian casualties. </para><para>It is beyond doubt that such an approach would blatantly breach the contents of the Geneva convention and protocols. It would be a deliberate disregard at best for the wellbeing of the civilian population. Australia as a nation should not even be seen to be giving consideration to lending its support to such a method of military attack. The Democrats call on the Prime Minister, when he is in Washington, New York and London next week, to make certain points clear regarding any combat that occurs—and we all hope that it will not occur; the Democrats will continue to oppose such combat occurring. If the Australian government go down this path, they must as a minimum get guarantees that we will support it militarily or in any other way—even politically—if it is conducted in accordance with basic international law and basic human rights principles and conventions. So far it seems clear to the Democrats that it will not be so conducted. </para><para>The Prime Minister should use his good relationship with the US and the UK to ensure that any combat that occurs does not go down those lines, not just for the sake of those many thousands of Iraqi civilians but for all our sakes. If we do not stick to accepted conventions and international law on this occasion, we will have no grounds in the future to request any other nation to do the same. That will put all Australians at much greater risk and make us all far more insecure in the future, as would be the case with anybody else in the world.</para><para>It is sometimes difficult to recognise and fully address the horrors of war. I do not want to be a scaremonger or cause distress to the families and friends of our troops, but the reality must be faced that there are likely to be Australian casualties of a war, even if it is as quick and sharp as some people suggest it will be. It will certainly be very bloody from the Iraqi side of things. But even if it is a re-run of the Gulf War, in that war there were 750 Australians involved just in that one-month or six-week period in 1991. Of those, around 164 Gulf War veterans are receiving a disability pension—a compensation pension—for disabilities which are causally related to that war. Nineteen of them have been assessed as totally and permanently incapacitated. That is around one in five veterans of the Gulf War—a war where we were obviously not involved in ground activities or anything like that.  </para><para>I note that the health survey of the 1991 Gulf War veterans is still not publicly available, despite the minister saying in October last year that it would be available in late 2002 or early 2003. You have to wonder if we will be waiting for the finish of this war in Iraq before we find out the health costs to our personnel from the last war in Iraq. Our personnel should not be put in such a dangerous environment simply to satisfy the political imperatives of the USA and the UK. Australia is already inadequate in how it treats many of its veterans. We should not be creating a new generation of veterans on such a flimsy pretext. </para><para>With regard to the Prime Minister's long statement on the evils of Saddam Hussein— and no person, certainly not the Democrats, could argue against the evil that is Saddam Hussein—ironically, in Australia we still have asylum seekers who are detained in detention centres, most of them for two years or more, and this Prime Minister and this government at this moment are still trying to pressure them to return to Iraq to face the monumental evil of this man of whom the Prime Minister has spoken so long about today. The hypocrisy of that is breathtaking.</para><para>We still have no details about the actual costs of war to Australia. The government have prepared documents relating to increased defence expenditure for a war on Iraq, but they have not released those documents when they have been requested. They have consistently said that no decision has been made about our involvement in a war with Iraq, but they are already creating a budget for such an involvement. Australians are entitled to know how much the government are intending to increase funding on defence, how much extra this will cost us, how much more funding this will drain out of our education and health systems and out of assistance for our drought-stricken farmers, and how much it is going to distort the operational effectiveness of our armed forces. At a time when the armed forces are stretched beyond belief already, when there is so much need for them in our own region and when the government are drawing attention, through their own mail-outs, to some of the threats to the security of Australians in our own region, the government are deploying massive numbers, by Australian standards, of our overstretched defence personnel to the other side of the world. We should be investing those sorts of resources in peace, through increased foreign aid and cooperation in the region—not putting more money into a bloody war that will lead to long-term consequences for the globe as a whole. As well, if we are going to be involved, we should be responsible for helping clean up the aftermath, yet last week in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> the Prime Minister disgracefully indicated that Australia would not be involved in any long-term way if we did go into a war, that we would leave that job to others.

But this path leads to problems which become bigger and bigger problems. The world is now faced with certain facts. All intelligence—American, English and our own—and Dr Blix's report have clearly identified that Iraq does have weapons of chemical and biological origin, and other weapons of mass destruction. According to the polls, 75 per cent of Australian people believe that Hussein is hiding weapons of mass destruction, and 65 per cent believe he is a threat to global security. There is not a lot of sympathy out there for Saddam Hussein's position.  </para></talk.start><para>The UN Security Council passed resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 enabling weapons inspectors to go back into Iraq. The weapons inspectors have reported that there are sizeable discrepancies between the actual figures: 6,500 chemical warfare bombs are unaccounted for and 300 rocket engines and anthrax supplies have mysteriously disappeared. The Blix report says that there are clearly weapons that have not been disclosed. This clearly points out that the Hussein regime in Iraq has not complied with resolution 1441. The United Nations Security Council will meet on 5 February to hear more evidence, and it is hoped that the Security Council will put up other resolutions to clarify and resolve the matter of compliance with resolution 1441. We trust that that resolution will come forward. We hope it will be clear and will give a signal that the United Nations is willing to accept its responsibilities and act. If it does not act, it risks becoming irrelevant. </para><para>Not only do the leaders of the USA, Australia and Britain want United Nations Security Council action to force Baghdad to disarm but also the smaller states of Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Denmark have expressed their support and asked the United Nations to take the necessary action—and many other countries, including Canada, will be urging UN action. It is hoped that the Security Council will listen to evidence to be presented by Colin Powell on 5 February and take the necessary action to ensure Iraq's disarmament. I am pleased that the Prime Minister is going over to America to ensure that Australia's interests and points of view are represented and listened to.</para><para>In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The coalition of forces that repelled the invasion and defeated Iraq could have forced a regime change at that time. Due to commitments given by the Iraqi government, the coalition agreed to suspend further attacks on Iraq. These commitments are outlined in United Nations resolutions 686 through to 688 put forward in 1991. The Gulf War cease-fire was negotiated based on the acceptance by Iraq of the provisions in those resolutions, including full disarmament and inspection of that disarmament.</para><para>For 12 years, Saddam Hussein has defied the resolutions, thumbed his nose at the rest of the world and played a game of denial. It is only due to the forward deployment of troops that there has been any movement. That is the only reason for which weapons inspectors have been able to gain entry into Iraq. This is very clear.</para><para>The Labor Party seems to have shifted positions on disarming Iraq. There is a significant difference between Mr Crean, who does not believe our armed forces should be forward deployed in the Gulf, and the previous leader. Mr Crean told troops on the docks:</para><quote><para>I don't want to mince my words, because I don't believe that you should be going. I don't think that there should be a deployment of troops to Iraq ahead of the United Nations determining it.</para></quote><para>I do, however, recognise that in the past the Labor Party have acknowledged the lack of movement in Iraq and supported pressure through forward deployment. In fact, in 1998, under Mr Beazley, Labor supported an ADF forward deployment of 150 Australian special forces soldiers and two midair refuelling planes in response to a request from the United States to apply further pressure on Saddam Hussein. This was without any specific UN direction. In direct contrast with Mr Crean, Mr Beazley said:</para><quote><para>And part of the reason why we have supported the Government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the UN Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the UN Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred. </para></quote><para>I want to point out that there are a lot of red herrings being put up about the possibility of a conflict in Iraq. One is that America is only in it for the oil. I have had the unpleasant experience of exposure to many conspiracy theories, but this one has got to take the cake. It defies belief that America would go to war solely for the purpose of gaining access to oil. I do not think this opinion should even be considered in this debate. It should be totally disregarded, put in the conspiracy bin and thrown out along with all of the other conspiracy theories that float around.</para><para>Iraq does have a lot of oil. In fact, it is one of the largest producers of oil in the world. It has huge areas of fertile country to be farmed to provide food for its citizens and to provide fodder. Iraq could be one of the wealthiest countries in the region, but Iraq under Saddam Hussein unfortunately has not provided wealth, security and a stable way of life for many of its citizens. Saddam has oppressed the minorities of the area—the Kurds and the marsh people. He has run a regime of terror and fear and has used nerve gas on his own people. He has invaded his neighbours in Kuwait and other areas. We are dealing here with not a rational person but a person who has made terror into an art form. The world has tried for over 12 years to peacefully negotiate settlements with Saddam Hussein, but we have not been able to do it. Unfortunately, it has not been achieved—and it never will be as long as Saddam refuses to take part in regional dialogue.</para><para>I want to make it clear that the National Party does not take lightly the question of our nation's commitment to deploy troops. However, we remain strongly in support of the government's position on Iraq. Not unlike other parties, we of course have people who are understandably concerned. Some of them ask questions, but on this issue support for the government is firm in National Party circles.</para><para>As I said, we do not make these commitments lightly. The government announced on the weekend that there will be forward deployment of Royal Australian Air Force elements to the Middle East, joining the 350 ADF personnel pre-positioned on the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> to provide support and prepare for a potential military campaign against Iraq, in case such action should become necessary. Fourteen FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft, three Hercules transport planes and their forward command element will leave Australia in the coming weeks.</para><para>Without question, the one person who can avert a conflict and end this situation peacefully is Saddam Hussein. The lesson that Australia has learned from the September 11 terrorist attack and the Bali bombings is that we now live in a different world. Ignoring the problem of Iraq will not make it go away. We now have to face the evils of terrorism. The sad fact is that we have been blooded by the deaths of so many Australians in Bali.</para><para>The National and Liberal parties are facing the realities of the world as it is today. Currently, there is a problem of concealment of weapons of mass destruction.

What could be so urgent, so threatening to Australian and world safety that would cause John Howard and his government to dispatch a military force of this magnitude? </para><para>Consider your incredulity when you learn that the mobilisation of Australian forces is in support of the 1991 United Nations decision to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, that it is the threat posed by Iraq's failure over the past 12 years to comply with United Nations demands that has allegedly necessitated the deployment of Australia's largest combat force in over 30 years. And not only that, consider that those forces have been deployed without the support of any decision by the United Nations to endorse military action. That is the incredible reality confronting all Australians today: Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard, has committed our largest combat force in 30 years to join an invasion of Iraq, led by the United States and the United Kingdom. The lives of 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel have now been put at risk. What is so inimical to Australia's national interests that could justify that momentous decision? Senators, there is no threat to Australia's national interests to warrant this massive military deployment. The real reason for the deployment is found in John Howard's own words:</para><quote><para>America, in the end, is a<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>country that means more to our security<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>than any other nation.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>... we'd be a very foolish nation if we lightly discounted the centrality of the American alliance to this country.</para></quote><para>In a world of one superpower, John Howard has determined that America's foreign policy should be our foreign policy. Labor has a very different view. Labor seeks to promote and articulate Australia's national interests, not the interests of any other nation. We value our alliance with the United States but we first seek to advance Australia's national interests. Australia's national interest is not well served by this deployment. Labor opposes this deployment and what it represents. It poses a threat to our troops and a threat to relations with our neighbours, and it undermines support for international law. There is no doubt that Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein is an evil, dangerous dictator who poses a serious risk to regional and international security.</para><para>Since 1991, the Australian Labor Party has consistently supported UN efforts to disarm Iraq. Our policy has been consistent and directed at supporting UN resolution of the issue. We have opposed any unilateral military action by the United States and have expressed concern at the government's flirtation with theories of pre-emptive action. We have argued that the UN should be given a reasonable time to enforce its mandate in Iraq and that weapons inspectors should be given the time they require to do their jobs. We have maintained that any use of force must be authorised explicitly by a second resolution of the United Nations Security Council, following on from resolution 1441.</para><para>Significantly, Hans Blix's report to the United Nations Security Council last week establishes that the Iraqi government is not complying with resolution 1441. Unless Iraq significantly changes its approach, it will remain in breach of this resolution. That is not a matter of contention. The key issue distinguishing the government from the Labor Party is what the appropriate action should be in the face of Iraq's continuing refusal to disarm its weapons of mass destruction. Labor argues for UN processes to run their course, while the government has committed to a US invasion of Iraq regardless of the outcome at the UN.</para><para>Ours is not a pacifist position. It is not a position that rejects military intervention at any time. The logic of Labor's position is that it may be necessary to support military involvement in Iraq if Iraq fails to comply and if other measures fail to bring it to compliance. Labor has urged the government for nine months now to galvanise the combined political might of the Security Council rather than support any unilateral actions of the United States and the United Kingdom. This is because the United Nations is the best expression of collective will that the world possesses. That is not to say that the United Nations is perfect, because its processes and decisions are obviously constrained by national and sectional interests. It is in Australia's national interest that the UN's exclusive legal authority to determine when a security threat should be met by military force is respected. If legal restraints against unilateral military action are removed, global security risks increase. As the man who was Chief of Australia's Defence Force at the time of the UN authorised Gulf War, General Peter Gration, stated recently: </para><quote><para>The best hope for global security and the war on terror is to pursue a rules-based international order based on the UN.</para></quote><para>If the United Nations were to launch war against Iraq without Security Council authorisation, international law and the UN would be undermined. Equally, if properly arrived at decisions of the United Nations are not supported by its members, United Nations authority and international law are also undermined. The government seems to have taken a decision that in a world of one superpower, our relationship with that power is the most important consideration. Labor believes that you can be a good international citizen, support the rule of law and be a good ally.</para><para>It is worth commenting on the size and nature of the forces that John Howard committed to the Gulf on 10 January this year. The Prime Minister forward deployed the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, key elements of a special forces task group, PC3 Orion planes, a Sea King helicopter, Army landing craft, an Air Force air defence attachment and an explosives ordnance team. They join two other Australian frigates already in the Gulf and 14 FA18 Hornets. Troops from the Incident Response Regiment, troop-lift helicopters, C130 aircraft and elements of the 4RAR Commando Unit have also been put on alert for deployment.</para><para>This is a significant contribution of combat forces. The Prime Minister committed the FA18 aircraft, which the government has indicated would contribute to the bombing of Iraq. This would be the first Australian combat aircraft deployed since the Vietnam War to participate in such attacks. The fleet of FA18s deployed has the capacity to drop over 100 tonnes of bombs. To put this into an historical context, Australia deployed a squadron of Canberra bombers to Vietnam that carried just over 21 tonnes of bombs— in other words, one fifth of the tonnage capacity that the government is committing to deployment on Iraqi targets.</para><para>After the invasion of Kuwait and UN support for the Gulf War in 1991, Australia deployed a frigate, a destroyer and a supply ship. No combat forces were committed to that campaign. No-one argued that we had not played our part. The Prime Minister has also committed to send more than 250 ground troops, the SAS and commandos who are likely to be sent into Iraq and confront its forces. If war breaks out, we are likely to see our troops shooting at and being shot at by Iraqi soldiers. This will be occurring more than 13,000 kilometres from Australia's shores.</para><para>Australia has already deployed its largest combat force since Vietnam to the other side of the world. We should be clear that this deployment is about war, not peace. This is not another East Timor, where Australians were deployed under the UN flag in a security and peacekeeping mission to help in the rebuilding of that country. This is not like Rwanda or Somalia, where personnel were sent under UN auspices to provide medical assistance and humanitarian aid. This is about Australia sending a combat force to Iraq to help destroy targets and to be involved in actions that will, inevitably, see the deaths of citizens of Iraq.</para><para>The question that John Howard has been unable to answer is: why has he committed more than 2,000 Australians to a potential war more than 13,000 kilometres from our shores? Why has he sent the largest Australian combat force since the Vietnam War to the other side of the world to fight Iraq without UN backing? Does Iraq pose such an immediate and present danger to Australia's national interests that we must commit such a large force? What is the government's case for this massive deployment of combat troops? No convincing case has been made, and nothing said today has changed that. </para><para>Iraq has been in breach of the UN's resolution since late 1998 when weapons inspectors were withdrawn in the face of noncompliance from Saddam Hussein. The Prime Minister did not utter a word when the inspectors were withdrawn. In fact, he did not say a word on Iraq in parliament until August last year; that is how pressing it was for this Prime Minister. He did not say a word on Iraq in parliament until four years after the inspectors were withdrawn, and then only in response to questions from Labor.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It's called September 11.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—I would like to hear the senator make a case for the link between September 11 and the invasion of Iraq; I will listen to his speech with interest. Clearly, Iraq's noncompliance with the UN did not rate too highly in terms of our national interest in the Prime Minister's eyes over the last five years. So why the change of heart now? As the senator says, September 11 is sometimes cited as the reason. The argument George Bush has been trying to make, in his attempt to expand the war on terror and incorporate the unrelated objective of overthrowing Saddam within it, is that we now realise that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction could be passed to terrorists and used against us. But do Iraq's weapons of mass destruction really pose a threat to us? With UN inspectors on the ground in Iraq and no evidence of active weapons programs found to date, it is difficult to argue that Iraq poses an immediate or unmanageable threat.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Prior to the inspectors going into Iraq, the government was keen to highlight the danger of Iraq obtaining a nuclear bomb, but the IAEA has found no evidence, yet, of an active nuclear program. Is there a threat that Iraq would pass on whatever weapons it possesses to terrorists who might target Australia? No credible evidence has been made public to link the Iraqi government with those terrorists. Many analysts highlight that historically no such links have existed between them because they are not in support of Saddam's interests or ambitions. The UN must assess the risk posed by the Iraqi regime following Dr Blix's final report. It must weigh up the evidence and consider carefully the available options. Australia should make its voice heard in that debate.</para><para>I hope that the alternatives to regime change through total war are seriously considered by the UN. Other viable options to contain and restrict Iraq's WMD may still be available to us. The government's position on Iraq has highlighted its confusion surrounding Australia's defence and security policies. Senator Hill has made little progress in reshaping the priorities of our strategic defence following the terrorist attacks in the United States and Indonesia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Why do you say that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—Well, the strategic review of the 2000 white paper, which sets out Australia's national interests and priorities, has been delayed time and time again. The minister's battles with cabinet and his department on this issue are well known. Indeed, who could possibly write a policy that incorporated John Howard's commitments to George Bush as if it represented a strategic vision of Australia's national interests? The government's commitment can only be understood in terms of its desire to put support for the US alliance as Australia's primary strategic priority. How else can we explain John Howard's startling decision to dispatch the largest combat force in over 30 years to a distant conflict in support of a 1991 UN decision?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The defence white paper, formulated by this government only two years ago, laid out our country's strategic priorities. They received broad endorsement. This deployment flies in the face of those priorities. The decision to commit combat troops has nothing to do with the defence of Australia, allegedly our first strategic priority; nor will it foster the security of our immediate neighbourhood, the second priority; nor does it promote stability, security and cooperation in South-East Asia, which is the third priority; nor does it the fourth objective, which is to contribute to the stability of the wider Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>This deployment is arguably about the fifth order priority of Australia's defence strategy, which is to support global security. Putting aside whether it supports or detracts from global security, if this mobilisation were seriously about that fifth priority of Australia, wouldn't we be making only a modest contribution? We certainly would not be committing a combat force of this magnitude. But then, it is clear that this commitment has nothing to do with our defined strategic interests. It certainly is not about Australia's national interest. </para><para>This deployment—the deployment of the largest combat force in over 30 years—represents John Howard's commitment to George Bush's war. Through his actions, John Howard has made it clear that the new No. 1 strategic priority for Australia is its alliance with the US. No wonder the minister has been unable to produce a strategic review paper that reflects that reality. The government's actions have undermined UN authority, rejected regional priorities, torn up the assumptions of its own white paper and given practical effect to its support for the first-strike doctrine. While it does not actually have the courage to say so, the government's actions show that it will support an attack with or without UN authorisation. While the Howard government has paid lip-service to supporting the UN process of disarmament, it has committed itself to the US administration's plans. It has committed our troops to their battle plan. Our officers are part of General Tommy Franks's command structure. Our forces are there specifically to meet niche needs in a combined USA-UK-Australia force.</para><para>In order to imbue the current impasse with Iraq with the sense of urgency that the US war plans need, the Howard government has had to repeat the US claims that Iraq poses an immediate threat and that time is running out. The claim is based on the claims, firstly, that Iraq could potentially have a WMD program and could be manufacturing a nuclear bomb and, secondly, that it might pass weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Yet there is little public evidence that either of these claims can be supported. Weapons inspectors in Iraq have not found any evidence of large-scale WMD production or of significant stockpiles of weapons. They have found no evidence of any nuclear weapons program or plans for such a program. The Howard government has presented no evidence of the Iraqi government sponsoring al-Qaeda or other terrorist organisations. If there is evidence to support any of these claims, let it be presented. Labor and the Australian community would be happy to examine that evidence and consider an appropriate response.</para><para>This debate is long overdue. I think it has been forced on the Prime Minister by the weight of public concern. The PM's failure to debate the commitment to Iraq has disturbed the Australian electorate. Unfortunately, all Australians know that the PM has taken the decisions that effectively put us at war when George Bush calls. Labor supports the disarmament of Saddam Hussein. Labor also supports the rule of international law and the authority of the United Nations. Labor does not support a USA-led strike against Iraq without UN authorisation. Labor does not support the deployment of Australian forces to join a USA-UK led invasion of Iraq without that UN authority.</para><para>Australians deserve a much better argument for the deployment of this invasion force than that which the government has provided. The families of the ADF personnel deserve a much better rationale to justify the risks their loved ones have been subjected to. The ADF personnel deserve much better than to be placed at such risk without the legitimacy of UN authorisation for their actions. The government should pull back and formulate a new response based on Australia's national interests, the rule of law and support for the United Nations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>8216</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Greens absolutely oppose the deployment of Australia's defence personnel, its men and women, to the theatre of war in Iraq and call on the Prime Minister to reverse that decision and bring those men and women home.

United Nations reports predict that the attack—leave aside the military death and destruction—will lead to hapless civilians caught between President Hussein and President Bush being delivered the following destruction: it is estimated that some 100,000 people will be killed.

The majority of Iraqis—some 18 million—will urgently need water treatment, sewage treatment and equipment to be provided to protect their health. That is all providing that there is not the use of nuclear weapons.</para><para>Yet the Prime Minister says to us in sending Australians to this unnecessary attack on Baghdad, `Let us not kill,' and, `Let us love our neighbours.'

This is not Australia's war. This is an oil war. This is the United States recognising that as the economic empire of the age it needs oil to maintain its pre-eminence. Two-thirds of that oil is in the Middle East, and yet one-third of the oil currently fuelling the world's economy is coming out of the Middle East, so it has the stores which are going to be essential as the United States runs down on oil supplies in the coming years. The chair of the White House National Economic Council, Dr Larry Lindsay, who was interviewed in the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline>, quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 9 September, said: </para><quote><para>When there is regime change in Iraq, you could add 3 million to 5 million barrels of oil production to world supply daily ...

This is not Australia's war. This is a war deliberated upon by the oil barons in the United States, who largely financed the Bush campaign, who have enormous connections and interoffice placements with the White House staff and who are aware that a key to the future prosperity of the economy of the United States— five per cent of the world's people—depends on who controls that 65 per cent of the world's oil resource.</para><para>Yet President Bush is determined, relentlessly indicating that he is going to prosecute an attack on Saddam Hussein—which means the 27 million Iraqis—regardless of whether the United Nations gives its imprimatur to that attack. Prime Minister Blair in Britain is also following suit against public opinion. In this country we have a very third-rate leader of state trying to join that duo to make a triumvirate for this attack on Iraq in which Australia has no real business.</para><para>Who gave Saddam Hussein the weapons of mass destruction? Where did they come from? They came from the American, French, German and Russian corporate sectors. I do not know Mr Scott Burchill, the Lecturer in International Relations at the School of Social and International Studies at Deakin University in Melbourne, but I have read his material.

Where is the precautionary principle that is going to be brought into international affairs to stop this dangerous spectre which is coming out of the laboratories of the wealthy and which is hanging over the future of all humanity and all life on this planet? Who will tackle that? We Greens will do our best. But does it await leadership of a totally different order before the commonsense, decency and far-sightedness that humanity as a whole and as a community can express get through to the leadership, which is so tainted and influenced by materialism, big money and those who are making a fortune out of technologies and weapons of mass destruction? This question must be on our agenda. This question must be tackled. This issue must be resolved if we are to bring confidence and security back into the future of everybody on this planet.</para><para>I will finish as I began by saying this: this Prime Minister has let this country down. John Howard has acted without the authority of this parliament, without the backing of the Australian people and without the request of the United Nations in sending 2,000 Australians good and true to the theatre of war in Iraq, where they will be deployed at the behest of the Pentagon and the White House if present circumstances continue and the war begins in the coming weeks. The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing by our defence personnel and he has done the wrong thing by this nation. Instead of sending out kits or requests for people to get kits to protect themselves from the threat, the fear and the potential of terror, this Prime Minister should reduce the fear and the threat of terrorism in this country by bringing our defence personnel home. This is not Australia's war, Prime Minister Howard. This is not Australia's war and Australians do not want you to prosecute this war for them. The best thing the Prime Minister can do to get the good wishes of Australia and to lessen the feelings of threat, terror, helplessness and anger in the Australian community is bring the 2,000 Australians home.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Peter (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cook)</inline>—I understand that for the rest of this debate informal arrangements have been made between the parties that the speeches from now on will be limited to 10 minutes each.

I notice that on the front page, apart from Senator Cook, who has just made it down near the bottom, every speaker on the opposition side is a member of the Left of the Labor Party. I wonder just who is controlling the agenda in the Labor Party in relation to any decision that they might take on their attitude towards a possible conflict in Iraq. You may correct me, Senator Sherry, if I am wrong, but I am pretty sure that on the front page, amongst the first five speakers, only members of the Labor Left are speaking. It included Senator Evans, who did say that we are committed—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—You are wrong.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—Am I wrong?

Senator Evans said that we were committed to an invasion of Iraq. Nothing is further from the truth. We are not committed to an invasion of Iraq. We are committed to trying every possible solution to disarm Iraq prior to using any force. We are supportive of any commitment of force being used in Iraq. `Iraq must be disarmed,' said Senator Evans. I could not agree with him more. Senator Evans said they must have more time. They have only had 12 years but they must have more time to disarm. For Senator Evans, 12 years is simply not enough.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a situation where a number of people have decided that 12 years is enough for a country to disarm itself of these weapons. Iraq has made no attempt to inform the United Nations or the weapons inspection team of those weapons that are still there. The briefings to the Security Council by the heads of UNMOVIC are a damning indictment of Iraq's ongoing refusal to cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors. Even Executive Chairman Blix said to the Security Council that `Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today'. After 12 years, Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance. </para><para>Double standards exist within the Labor Party with their talk that there should be no military action without the authorisation of the United Nations. I wonder where the Labor Party stood during the time of the liberation of Kosovo when, without United Nations authorisation, NATO bombed Serbia and thus freed the Muslims of Kosovo—and others, of course, but predominantly the Muslim province of Kosovo. So double standards exist. There should be no military action without United Nations authorisation; yet in the case of Kosovo, when there was no United Nations authorisation, the Labor Party were quite happy to see these people, who had been so badly mistreated by the Serbian and the Yugoslav governments, liberated. Senators opposite stood in here and made a great song and dance about the people who were being forced to go back at the end of their temporary protection. They have double standards and I would like them to think back on some of the commitments that they have made in the past before they continue to score cheap political points in this current argument about the responsible position that has been taken by this government in relation to Iraq and its refusal to give up weapons of mass destruction. </para><para>Like Senator Bolkus, whom I see in the chamber, and a number of others in this place, we have spent some time at the United Nations and seen it in action and how it works. I spent some 3½ months there only two years ago. I observed while there that the United Nations is very good at some things and very poor at others. It is very good at things like world health, world education and promoting democracy amongst the emerging democracies of the world—it is the one body that can do that—but when it comes to solving political conflicts the United Nations is spectacularly unsuccessful. You only have to look at the Israeli situation to know how unsuccessful it can be. For 54 years, the United Nations has been unable to come up with a peaceful solution for the Middle East. Since 1948 and the formation of Israel or very soon after that, the United Nations has been unable to solve political conflicts unless there is political will on both sides to fix the problem. Without that political will, it has been spectacularly unsuccessful. This is the downfall of the United Nations process. Whether we like it or not, the United Nations now consists of 190 sovereign nations, all with their own particular position on most issues. The one thing the United Nations cannot do is make laws. It sponsors international agreements, but it does not make international laws. Each one of those 190 sovereign nations of the United Nations puts their own interests first before they look at what else may be happening around the world.</para><para>We have a situation where the weapons inspectors having gone into Iraq have come back and said that Iraq does not appear to have a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm. Iraq says that it wants more time. The issue is not whether the inspectors need more time but whether Iraq is willing to cooperate with the United Nations and its inspectors. With all the time in the world, for months and years to come, without Iraqi cooperation the inspectors will not be able to do their job. So what is the point of giving them much more time if the Iraqis will not cooperate and let them do their job?</para><para>As Executive Chairman Blix himself noted, cooperation needs to be active. It is not enough to open doors. Inspection is not a game of catch as catch can. The onus is on Iraq, not on the weapons inspectors. We know that Iraq has developed and pursued weapons of mass destruction and we know that it has used them in the past. What we do not know and will never know unless Iraq is forthcoming and cooperates with weapons inspectors is whether Iraq has rid itself of these weapons as it is required to do under the United Nations resolutions and under the terms of the cease-fire that was drawn up at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It is important that the facts be put on the record and that there not be political point scoring, as we have seen from the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>8221</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was a very sad speech for the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

I also rise to express my concern at the direct and obvious consequences of this conflict— the consequences for world peace, the consequences for regional stability both here and in the Middle East, the consequences for the United Nations and for the international rule of law and the consequences for the Australian public, who will definitely become a target both at home and abroad.</para></talk.start><para>I also rise to express my concern for the Australian armed services, who have been sent in advance to be used, I believe, as political sacrificial lambs under the control of the United States, whose interests are obviously to protect their own first. Haven't we learnt from our history? Haven't we learnt to put our national interests first? It is quite obvious that the Howard administration has not learnt. Like most Australians, I believe that there is a way to bring about a disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime—a most necessary disarmament—within the forums of the international processes while maintaining an alliance with the United States, as we should and as we have been able to do in the past when we have disagreed with it from time to time on day-to-day policy. </para><para>To go to war is the gravest and most onerous decision a country and a government can make. We were misled into Vietnam and paid the price—and we continue to pay the price. We are now being misled into Iraq and will pay a price. We need an honest, open debate on this issue. That is one thing the Prime Minister is not allowing. That is one thing that the Howard government is not allowing. The Australian public are not being led into this war with any sense of dignity. They are not being led into this war in Iraq; they are being misled into this war. They have been dragged into this war. John Howard is not leading Australians into war; he is misleading Australians into war. He is not courageous enough to tell the truth, he is not brave enough to tell the truth, because he knows that truth does not at this stage substantiate his case.</para><para>The Prime Minister continues to mislead as he claims that he has not committed our forces. But such a claim is so opaquely dishonest; we all know that he has. We all know why they were sent overseas. We all know that preparations were started some months ago for our engagement. No-one believes that the Australian forces are being sent off to do duty-free shopping in the Emirates, for instance—that is farcical. Neither does anyone believe that those forces can be withdrawn before engagement. No-one believes that this Prime Minister will say to George Bush, as Bush is about to drop the axe on Saddam Hussein, `We're not going to be sending our forces on.

Our national interests are second pegging to those of another country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why won't this Prime Minister tell the truth to the Australian people? We see, day after day, the sanctimonious hand wringing, but what is it? This sanctimonious hand wringing is nothing but a cover for a lack of courage, a lack of ticker. If he really believed in what he was doing, he would open up and tell the Australian public the truth about the engagement, the truth about the commitment. He loves to be photographed with the armed forces, but he has never been brave enough to fight with them. The only army this Prime Minister has ever had the courage to enlist in has been the Salvation Army, and that has kept him at home. He will glean political points off the back of the armed services. He is very keen to send them off to fight a war. But, as I say, the interests that he puts first are not those of Australia. This is all about Prime Minister Howard and the conservatives in this parliament sucking up to the Bush White House. He makes a pathetic figure as he does that—a figure that the Australian public, more and more, are waking up to. Australians are waking up to the truth and to the fraud that has been perpetrated upon them.</para><para>The Prime Minister has continued this perception over recent days, as he claims to be going off on a mission for peace. What a demolition job of the English language. What a distortion of the English language. What deception. What gall. He has conned some in the media, but no-one in the public believes that this Prime Minister is on a mission of peace as he goes to Washington and to the UK. If this is the sort of action he commits us to whilst he is pursuing peace, I hate to think what he would be doing if he were pursuing war.</para><para>Australians are opposed to this war, and for good reason. The case for it has not been made. There are other rogue states of concern—North Korea and Saudi Arabia, for instance. This process is a bullying of the United Nations and its processes. As I said earlier, it undermines the international rule of law. Australians are increasingly concerned and scared about the leadership qualities of President Bush, hearing night after night the inanities `I'm doing it for daddy' or `This is like an old movie rerun'. This sort of rhetoric does not instil in people the confidence that the free world—as President Bush would like it to be seen—is in capable hands. There is a man with faraway eyes that they see on TV every night, and they wonder what is behind them. </para><para>As I have said, Australians are opposed to this engagement for good reasons. Another reason they are opposed to it is that they do not see it as being in our national interests. Our national interests are very much in our region, and Australians are concerned that we will become a target. Of the coalition of the willing, the coalition that President Bush has put together, we are the only country that has in its proximity the problems of Muslim extremism, of terrorism. States close to us— Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, for instance—have their hands full trying to maintain some control over them. What we are in the process of doing is making the job more difficult for our regional neighbours. It is going to make it more difficult for them as we give more and more oxygen to terrorists and as we not only make ourselves a target but by our actions—leading the pack, going out there in advance of the world community and in advance of the United Nations—invite, incite and provoke retaliation on Australians and Australian interests.</para><para>We as a nation are concerned at the impact that the current processes and decisions will have on world stability, particularly on moderate states in the Middle East and on Israel—which I am sure could become a target if this conflict gets out of control. Australians are also opposed to this war in that they are asking themselves: `Whatever happened to bin Laden? Wasn't he the target? Wasn't he the perpetrator?' The connection has not been drawn between bin Laden and Iraq. But whatever happened to him? The US administration lost track of his mobile phone and they lost him! That also does not instil much confidence in the way that world affairs are being run at the moment.</para><para>I want to express another concern on behalf of the Australian people and that is the way that they are being denied the truth not just by the government but also by the Australian newspapers. I particularly point out an example on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this morning in an article written by Dennis Shanahan. He claims that the `battlers' are turning to the Prime Minister's war. The concept of a UN endorsed war is, in Mr Shanahan's eyes, the policy proposal of the Prime Minister. Anyone with a memory span longer than that of a goldfish would have known that this is not the Prime Minister's preferred position. Anyone with a memory span longer than a goldfish would have realised that when Simon Crean was putting up this proposal some eight to 10 months ago he was abused by the government—from the Prime Minister to the Minister for Foreign Affairs—as being an appeaser and as talking like Saddam Hussein.</para><para>This is just another example of this paper's continual cry for war. It has maintained this month after month. You will not get a balanced appreciation of the international conflict in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. What you will get is not just barracking for a conflict, for the right-wing US administration and its position but also continual apologies for John Howard's position. This is a paper that should change its name from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> to the <inline font-style="italic">War Cry</inline>. The downside of this sort of censorship in the paper, this sort of biased reporting, is that the Australian public is being denied a lot of facts that people in Europe, in particular, are getting in relation to this conflict. This is a war that Australians do not support and they do not support it for good reason.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>8223</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To decide to go to war is a momentous decision, one of the most momentous decisions that a particular country can make. We as Australians need to consider this very, very carefully indeed. We should not be dictated to by anti-Americanism or by accusations about certain journalists—people who cannot protect themselves here. We need to make our decision by having a look at the principles of a just war. These principles have been around for 15 centuries, largely, and if I may I will indicate my recollection of them. Firstly, there must be a just cause; secondly, the decision to go to war must be taken by a legal authority; thirdly, it must be for the right reason; fourthly, there must be a reasonable chance of success; fifthly, there must be proportionality; and, sixthly, every other reasonable method must have been used to try to obtain the eventual end, which is peace. </para></talk.start><para>Let us have a look at those, beginning with the question of cause. It could be said that Saddam Hussein is a dictator who treats his people appallingly—or at least some of them, with the exception of the elites. But then again there are a number of other dictators. There has been a history of denials by Iraq of UN decisions and resolutions leading up to this particular point in time. It is clear that Iraq is not observing the spirit, the intent or the actual wording of Security Council resolution 1441. But one has to look at it from Australia's point of view. One has to consider whether or not there is an imminent danger to Australia's interests and security. No-one wants to go to war. Everybody hates war, and to send our young people off to war we must be absolutely certain that the cause is a just one.</para><para>I am yet to receive that information. Last week I was hoping that we might be able to have briefings for the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. Tomorrow, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is going to speak to the committee and answer questions. That is good from a political point of view, but we need to have the facts. Colin Powell is to address the Security Council on Wednesday, US time, and perhaps more will come out of that. But, at the moment, there have been problems. The Australian people need to be told more on the question of whether it is a just cause.</para><para>I do not necessarily say that the UN is the be-all and end-all when it comes to the issue of legal authority. In respect of this matter, there has to be a clear, moral decision on the part of the government. If, for example, the decision by the Security Council is vetoed, what do we do? I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has left that question quite open. I do not say that it ought necessarily to be determined by the United Nations, because these sorts of things can occur and decisions are vetoed. If there is to be a sending of Australian forces—as per the third principle—it has to be done for the right reason. For example, it has to be done not for revenge against Saddam Hussein but for a clear, right reason.</para><para>The fourth point is that there must be a real chance of the success of the operation. Not much has been said about that. There must be proportionality—that is, collateral damage should be far less than the damage that would be done if there were no action taken at all. Of course, that is a judgment, but I believe we need to have further information before that judgment is taken or a view is determined. Also, all other reasonable methods need to be attempted.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> has gone off. Is that to be used, as the Navy was used previously, to support previous resolutions of the Security Council—that is, on the embargo and so on? If so, let us hear it and let us have that detailed to us. Essentially, in the conduct of any such conflict, there must be absolute protection of and immunity for civilians. The Iraqis are human beings. Most of them seem to be oppressed by the dictator. We must be sure that in the event of such a conflict civilians are protected and also that the military action is proportionate to the objectives to be obtained.</para><para>In all of this we need to have mature discernment. In my view, many questions are outstanding. They may be able to answer but, in my view, they are as yet unanswered. People might say: `Who are you? You are not the government. In these areas the government ought to be the one to decide.' But I, as well as every other person in Australia, need to grapple with the issues surrounding this whole question. Yes, it is the government's responsibility, in the end, to decide the matter. I appeal to the government to provide as much information as possible so that the people of Australia will also be able to make up their minds after mature consideration of the facts. No-one likes war. I will end by simply saying that not only must we have discernment but also we must pray for those who have gone to the Gulf region; we pray for peace. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>8225</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree, as Senator Harradine said, that we as a nation ought to be praying for peace. Australia is a nation blessed—blessed with unparalleled freedoms, both personal and economic. These freedoms are enjoyed in an environment of peace. As we consider our approach to the violent and dictatorial regime of Iraq, I trust that we in our comfort zone will not turn away from our moral duty and obligation to the plight of the Iraqi people and the threat to the world community.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has a proud history. We do our bit in theatres all around the world—be it in Europe, North Africa or Asia—promoting peace and freedom, even when Australia herself is not under direct threat. I trust that we in this Senate are all agreed that the Iraqi regime is evil and murderous and has committed genocide. In case you have any doubts, just ask the Iraqi refugees in our own country. I trust that we are all agreed that the Iraqi regime has, and continues to develop, weapons of mass destruction, and has used them. I invite honourable senators to read the book <inline font-style="italic">Saddam's Bombmaker, </inline>by Khidir Hamza, who escaped from Iraq in 1994 after the UN sanctions had already been implemented. He gives chapter and verse about what occurred, and—by the way—about, strangely, the support of German technology and French materiel. You then wonder why France and Germany are so out of line with the rest of Europe—countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Hungary. I trust we are also agreed that the Iraqi regime is in ongoing breach of 16 UN Security Council resolutions spanning a decade. For proof of that, I suggest you just have a look at the 16 resolutions. </para><para>Faced with these facts, the genuine question needs to be asked: what is to be done? Clearly, the regime needs to be removed if it fails to comply with the 16 UN resolutions. The Iraqi people need liberation and the world community deserves liberation from the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The next question is: how is that to be achieved? Preferably, of course, it is to be achieved peacefully and with the support of the United Nations taking resolute action on its resolutions, which have now been blatantly violated for over a decade. But, if the UN refuses to act on its own resolutions and thereby makes itself irrelevant, what do we do as a nation? Are we, because of UN impotence, absolved of our moral responsibility? I suggest to the Senate that the cause of removing the heinous Iraqi regime is right, proper and moral if Iraq fails to comply with the UN resolutions, irrespective of UN sanction. The UN should sanction the regime's removal if the regime fails to fully disarm and abide by all the 16 UN Security Council resolutions. If the UN does not, I pose the question: does the regime somehow gain some moral imprimatur because of that failure to act? For me, the answer is absolutely not. The cause remains right and just, irrespective of UN sanction. </para><para>With the time left, I will try to debunk some of the arguments that seem to be gaining currency. The first one is that the US supported the Iraqi regime in the 1980s. That may well be true, but so what? A country has no permanent friends, only permanent interests. We supported communist Russia in 1943 not because we loved them, but because the greater risk at the time was a victory by national socialism. We supported communist China in 1944 not because we liked that regime, but because the consequences of Japanese militarism would have been even worse. By 1950, we actively and quite properly opposed both communist China and communist Russia.</para><para>We were told in one senator's contribution that there are no links between Iraq and Osama bin Laden. That may or may not be the case, but it is interesting that the Czech government is now supportive of the US position. Let me remind those that are not aware that Czech intelligence officials have confirmed that an Iraqi diplomat, later expelled for espionage, met with the leader of the 9-11 hijackers, Mohamed Atta, when Atta was in Czechoslovakia prior to going to the US.</para><para>I turn to Labor's amendments. I can see why the names of Senators Ray and Conroy are absent from speakers list. I can see why Mr Beazley did not want to take a position on the front bench of the Labor Party when I have a look at this disgraceful amendment. It is full of errors, and the suggestions in it clearly show that the Australian Labor Party is not fit for the government of this great country. First of all, Labor would censure the government for forward-deploying Australian troops in the absence of any United Nations authorisation. Does the Labor Party provide the same condemnation for NATO activity in Kosovo, which in fact helped protect Muslims? There was no UN sanction for that action. What about the actions in the Falklands Islands and during the Cuban missile crisis? There is no requirement that there be UN authorisation. It is my hope and prayer that that in fact does occur.  </para><para>We are then told that Labor `declares its opposition to a unilateral military attack on Iraq by the United States'. I hope it will not be unilateral and I hope it will not be necessary, but I assure honourable senators opposite that, if it does become necessary—and I hope and pray it does not—it will not be unilateral. It will have the support of many other nations and therefore it will be multilateral. The Labor Party knows that and it should amend its amendment accordingly.</para><para>It then insists that the disarmament of Iraq proceed under the authority of the United Nations. I agree, but what happens if the United Nations fails? Then the disarmament of Iraq no longer becomes a concern of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party seeks to hide behind the United Nations' apron strings rather than saying what is moral, right and just, irrespective of the stance of the United Nations. The Labor Party would seek to condemn the government's decision to forward deploy some of our servicemen and women; they have all volunteered to serve. The government's decision has been to send troops; all those that have gone have volunteered. Why is that not in the motion? I think we know why.</para><para>Further, we are told that the Labor Party expresses its total opposition to any use of nuclear arms: `In any operation where such weaponry may be used, Australia should not be involved.' Does that mean that if Iraq were to use such weapons, Australia should remove itself from the theatre? That is what this motion says. This motion is strangely silent about where Labor actually stands on Iraq.

One enduring commitment that both the major parties have shared, and still do, is to the importance of the World Trade Organisation; that is instructive. Australia is a middle, not a major, economic power. We need merit, not might, to triumph in the conduct of world trade. We need and support an international rules based organisation—the WTO—to achieve this. That gives us an independent voice. It also enables the nimble footwork necessary to maintain our commitments to long-term friends and allies without compromising the basic integrity of our principles and our national interests.</para></talk.start><para>What the WTO is to trade, the United Nations is to world affairs. Like the WTO, the United Nations is not a perfect organisation. But we should support these bodies and seek to improve them rather than criticise and undermine them. The United Nations and the World Trade Organisation have these things in common: both are essential to good global governance, both have strong support, and in their own ways both can deliver peace and prosperity to the world. Without them, we would have chaos and anarchy—a world in which Australia's security, economy and vital interests would be dangerously imperilled.</para><para>The Labor Party wants bipartisanship on the United Nations. The Howard government should make the same commitment to the UN as it makes to the WTO. There is no difference between ordered, rules based, independent action for Australia in the WTO, as there should be in the United Nations. In international relations, Australia needs to protect its own independence while being able to play the constructive role within the US alliance that our nation requires. It can only do that through a strengthened and strong United Nations. </para><para>It was documented last week that this government has acted to weaken the authority of the UN on 77 different occasions. Now the Prime Minister is at it again. He has committed Australian troops to war if Washington decides to take action on Iraq without United Nations authority. Labor says: `Commit to the United Nations, commit to the United Nations processes, act with the mandate of the Security Council, and allow the steps laid down for weapons inspection and verification to be carried through properly.'</para><para>On Iraq, the United Nations processes are the right ones. The inspectors need to complete their job. Decisions should be made about what they find on the facts—not on artificially whipped up war hysteria. The next decisions on this subject are serious indeed. They potentially involve the loss of human life, the destruction of property, the creation of homelessness, injury, family break-up and the generation of a huge refugee population. Of course, all the decisions we make on international affairs should be considered and responsible. But the decisions that the world and Australia are now on the threshold of taking should be made carefully and calmly and be based on a thorough consideration of the evidence and the options. That is what the Australian people want, and that is what Labor is committed to.</para><para>But Labor says something more. It is time this government told the Australian people the truth—and the whole truth—about these circumstances. What secretive and confidential deals have been entered into between our Prime Minister and the US President? Does Mr Howard have credibility any more? Don't we remember the `children overboard' incident, when the then Minister for Defence blatantly lied to the Australian people about what happened? For example, take in this current debate the invented word `predeployment'. Not only is the word `predeployment' a contradiction in terms—you cannot be predeployed, just like you cannot be a little bit pregnant—but `predeployment' is a word that is now being coined to cover the commitment of Australians to conflict ahead of the UN, before a proper parliamentary debate, and without the support of the Australian public.</para><para>There are now around 2,000 Australian military personnel and billions of dollars worth of Australian military equipment in a war zone before the proper democratic processes in Australia have been followed. No-one believes that this nation has not been pre-empted by the Prime Minister. `He's played us for mugs,' is a common sentiment among Australians. But that is a direct criticism of Mr Howard and of the government he leads and not a criticism of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. While we will criticise the government, justifiably, we have confidence in our Defence Force personnel. It is their job to obey government orders; our disagreement with those orders is no reflection on their endeavours, their standing or their credibility.</para><para>On the subject of credibility, let me now go back to the Prime Minister. The credibility of the Prime Minister is in question not only because of private undertakings he may have given to Mr Bush committing Australia to war but also because of the consequences that logically flow from a conflict with Iraq. Does this mean that Australia is automatically committed to be part of an occupying force in that war-torn country after the conflict is over? If so, how long will we be there? Will this also mean that we will transfer, by force of necessity, our major foreign policy interests from Asia to the Middle East? How does that serve the future welfare of this country? Does that make us a bigger and more obvious target for international terrorism? Are we committed to action against other `axis of evil' countries? There are a number of them, and some would argue that many of them are a more dangerous threat than the threat allegedly posed by Iraq. </para><para>It is hard to believe that these issues were not discussed during Mr Howard's last visit to the Oval Office. It is impossible to believe that they will not be discussed in the talks he will have with President Bush in Washington next week. But did we hear any of these issues canvassed in the statements delivered in this parliament today, in either the other place or here? Neither Senator Hill nor Mr Howard answered any of those questions. The Australian people still do not have answers about the wider context in which the proposition that the Australian government is leading—that is, a war with Iraq—might arise.</para><para>Not only do the Australian people want to know the answers to these questions but it is disingenuous for the government to tell only part of the story—the convenient part—and leave out all of the inconvenient obligations. Are we getting into another open-ended Vietnam-type commitment? This is an important question. Since a lot of the world community and many Australians believe that this is all about oil and not about weapons of mass destruction and the restoration of democracy in Iraq, why does the government not canvass these wider issues and provide us with a sense of its vision for the future and the direction it wants to take in managing them? These are important matters. Australians should at least have an understanding of what is in the government's mind so that they can put into context the actions the government is taking here and overseas—in the UN and in the Persian Gulf.</para><para>I believe the Prime Minister will be going to Washington not to represent the view of the majority of Australians—which is that the UN process should be supported and followed through—but to confirm his commitment to unilateral US action in Iraq. He will be going to receive his final orders before war commences, irrespective of UN deliberations and world opinion.</para><para>In the context of having made the decision to commit Australian service personnel to a war in Iraq, the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia has to be seen as too little, too late. The government has consistently acted in a way that has allowed Australia's relationship with our neighbours in South-East Asia to deteriorate, yet these countries are the key to our future security in this region. It is in our own region that Australia has been most affected by terrorist activity, when bombs went off in the Sari Club and Paddy's Bar. Rather than work to secure Australia through regional cooperation, the Prime Minister has committed our diplomatic and defence resources in pursuit of Iraq without having presented evidence of links with terrorist activity.</para><para>Regardless of the reality, whether we like it or not, there will be those that will interpret any attack on Iraq as an attack on Islam, and it is well known that our nearest neighbour has the largest Muslim population in the world. Without indulging in the fearmongering of the Howard government, logic dictates that Australia has been made a target by the commitment of this government to supporting unilateral US action in Iraq. At the same time, by neglecting our relationship with countries in our own region, our ability to meet this challenge has been eroded. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>8228</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Abetz, I seek leave to incorporate the last paragraph of Senator Abetz's speech.

Australians stand divided over the possibility of war in Iraq. We have seen demonstrations and direct actions against the potential war. Even the Liberal Party itself is internally divided, as evidenced by John Valder's highly critical letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last week. One Nation believes that the most democratic way to deal with this important issue would have been to hold a referendum and let the people decide. The government has missed the opportunity to poll the Australian people. An amount of $15 million was spent on distributing antiterrorism information to all households across Australia. Why not include a ballot paper and a return envelope for consultation, at least allowing the people to have their say? </para></talk.start><para>One Nation believes that senators and members should be allowed a conscience vote on this issue, as a war on Iraq could have far-reaching financial and political implications, some of those being the costs associated with a military commitment, increases in oil prices, substantial declines in financial markets, interest on any debt accumulated because of the war, terrorist acts of reprisal in Australia and the high casualties which may result if military forces in Iraq are involved in urban combat. President Saddam Hussein would have every incentive to use weapons of mass destruction against US forces and allies if attacked.</para><para>No modelling of the possible impacts on the Australian economy has been released by the federal government. It is difficult to determine exactly what the effects of a war with Iraq would be because there are many unknown factors, such as the type of campaign, how many personnel will be involved, what kind of equipment will be used, the type and quality of munitions that will be expended, how long the conflict will last, how long the country will be occupied after the war and the level of contribution from other countries. In 1999 the federal government introduced a special tax—that is, the Medicare levy—for people who earn in excess of $50,000 per annum, to pay for an increased Australian Defence Force commitment in East Timor. Taxpayers who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 pay an additional 0.5 per cent, and those who earn over $100,000 pay an extra one per cent.</para><para>If the government wants the cost of military contributions to Iraq to be budget neutral, spending in areas such as health, education and social programs might be forgone. Military personnel are paid irrespective of war; however, military involvement will require additional spending. To what extent can the additional spending be met from within the current budget allocation? The 2002-03 budget estimates indicate that the Defence outlay expenses for that year will be 1.7 per cent of GDP—that is, $13,144 million. Oil prices have already partially risen in expectation of a war. The effect on short-term prices will depend on a number of possible developments, and it could be that prices would quickly return to normal levels. It should not be assumed that prices would necessarily stay high.</para><para>A war would increase pressure on the US federal budget, which is already in deficit. With an increased deficit the Bush administration would come under pressure to cut other forms of spending, and financing the deficit could lead to a rise in US interest rates. However, a slowing US economy would put downward pressure on interest rates. If the economy continued to slow, the American Federal Reserve would come under pressure to lower interest rates to stimulate demand. So the net effect on interest rates would be unclear. Whatever the effect on US interest rates, any differential that emerges between the US and Australian interest rates would lead capital to follow the currency with the higher rates. Other possible effects may come through the exchange rate. A rise in oil prices would increase the cost of imports. All other things being equal, that would tend to push the value of the Australian dollar down against other currencies. If the US economy moved into recession, that would reduce Australia's exports, putting further downward pressure on the Australian dollar.</para><para>What are the reasons for a possible war with Iraq? Observers and analysts have provided several explanations for the singling out of Iraq for action by the US. Saddam Hussein provides a real target, unlike the frustrating campaign against the shadowy and decentralised al-Qaeda. The risk of containing Saddam Hussein and allowing his administration to develop nuclear weapons is too high. President Bush and his supporters have argued that replacing Saddam Hussein and establishing democracy could deter other regimes supporting an anti-US group and could also act as a catalyst for democratic change in other Arab states. </para><para>Since the September 11 terrorist attack in the United States there have been renewed concerns about the security of the world's oil supplies. I will quote briefly from a Country Analysis Brief from EIA, in America, dated October 2002, which states:</para><quote><para>Iraq contains 112 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the second largest in the world (behind Saudi Arabia) along with roughly 220 billion barrels of probable and possible resources. Iraq's true resource potential may be far greater than this, however, as the country is relatively unexplored due to years of war and sanctions. Deep oil-bearing formations located mainly in the vast Western Desert region, for instance, could yield large additional oil resources (possibly another 100 billion barrels), but have not been explored. Iraq's oil production costs are amongst the lowest in the world, making it a highly attractive oil prospect.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Tony Blair, has said that `the two grave issues that the world must confront are weapons of mass destruction and terrorism'. I would add two other threats to that: oil and water depletion. Sixty-five per cent of the world's known petroleum reserves lie beneath the Middle East, and key issues that divide Israel and its Arab neighbours are the control of the Jordan River and the West Bank aquifers. Without oil, the Middle East cannot live well; without water, it cannot live at all. There is already an issue between Iraq and Turkey over the Ataturk Dam, and more problems are brewing over proposals by Turkey to install a series of dams along the Euphrates River. The possibility looms that Iraq would then have to buy its water from Turkey. One Nation challenges Senator Hill's claim that US behaviour is not driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves. Senator Hill has stated:</para><quote><para>Self-evidently, if cheap oil supplies were America's dominant motive, then years before now the United States would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions in return for plentiful supplies of low-priced oil.</para></quote><para>The fact is that there is a plentiful supply of low-priced oil in Iraq, and the Energy Information Administration, whose document I previously quoted, refers to that. This is because Iraq's oil comes from enormous fields that can be tapped by relatively shallow wells, producing a high flow rate. More than a third of Iraq's oil lies less than 600 metres below the surface.</para><para>The capability of the Australian Defence Force is another issue. There is currently an absence of a broad military coalition such as that which was formed in 1991 in the Gulf War. In closing, I would like to say that a war with Iraq will also divert attention and resources from pressing domestic issues such as the drought, the bushfires and the crises in health, welfare and education. I have no doubt that Australians will pull together if war erupts and that our military forces will serve Australia with courage, bravery and expertise. I say to Australia's Defence Force personnel: One Nation publicly and emphatically expresses our support to each one of you personally in your commitment to the services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>8230</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today, in the other place, the Prime Minister made a very important contribution to the debate around security issues—one of the most important debates we will hear in our time in this place—and Senator Hill has made a ministerial statement in similar terms in this place. I had the privilege to be here when last this parliament debated the Iraq situation, back when the Gulf War was declared. That debate, I believe, was a very important debate for this parliament. We are not debating Australia's involvement in a war at the moment—although the possibility of Australia being involved in a war in the Gulf region is, of course, significant. The parliament is addressing that at the moment and the Prime Minister, in his detailed statement, has set out very eloquently and very clearly the pressures and the forces that are at work and why we are faced with this situation, which, I know—from my discussions during the summer recess—concerns many Australians, particularly Western Australians.</para></talk.start><para>One of the concerns that people have shared with me is that there is a picture being painted of the United States and Australia wanting to move towards war with some sort of passion. I say to those people and to all my Western Australian constituents—indeed, to all Australians—that my assessment is that the Prime Minister is, in fact, trying to do whatever he can, with all his skills and enormous capacity as a very successful national leader and world statesman, to ensure that war does not take place. He does not want Australian troops in conflict in the Middle East, if that can be avoided. He also does not want—and the government does not want—to have a situation perpetuated where a significant threat hangs over freedom loving and peace loving people throughout the world because of the convergence of the increasing threat of international terrorism and terrorist activity. </para><para>Terrorism brutally destroyed human life and property in New York and at the Pentagon in Washington on September 11 and, closer to home—particularly close to Western Australia and to many Western Australians—in Legian Street in Kuta, Bali only a few months ago. So there is the threat of terrorism and the convergence of it with the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction being available to rogue states which have flouted the conventions, protocols and treaties in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other treaties governing chemical and biological weapons. As Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, has said, the convergence of those two threats is the reason for the focus on Iraq.</para><para>I think Senator Harris's approach is a rather cynical one. It picks up the populist, left-wing media approach to the subject, which is that it is about oil. It is demonstrably not about oil; the Prime Minister addressed that very clearly. If the Americans were interested in oil, they would do a deal and buy it like they always do. If they were interested in oil, they would have got it from Kuwait when they liberated it—with the assistance of Australia and many other nations—back in 1991. It is about ensuring for Australia, America, Great Britain and all freedom loving people of the world, particularly the democracies of the world, that we, our children and grandchildren do not live in an era of terror and that we do not allow someone like Saddam Hussein—if this parliament and this government were to let him get away with it—to destroy the good work of good people in governments and parliaments around the world over the past 50 years.</para><para>Recently I had the pleasure of finally finishing a biography of President Eisenhower—something I tried to read all of last year on flights to and from Canberra. President Eisenhower—and, to his credit, Khrushchev, the Soviet leader back in the 1950s—sought to create an international environment where weapons of mass destruction were controlled. These weapons scared the daylights out of Eisenhower. He had seen the destruction that war can bring to people and to mankind. Khrushchev saw that as well. Both of them, being former army officers, knew that war was not a solution. Eisenhower spent all his time trying to devise ways to stop the arms race—unsuccessfully, as it proved. Eisenhower and Khrushchev put in place negotiations between the superpowers—distrustful as they were, in those days. They put in place communication systems and international diplomacy systems that, ultimately, through the work of Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Johnson and all the presidents down the track—past Presidents Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton to President George Bush Jr today—have achieved an international system of treaties which have allowed the world to live in relative peace and not be threatened by weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction are now a bigger threat than ever because of convergence with the threat of highly organised international terrorism, which has already blighted the world so much in the last 18 months. That is the threat.</para><para>What the Prime Minister, the government and the leaders of the Western nations that are combining to confront the issues in Iraq are seeking to do is to weigh up the risk of doing nothing, of not being steadfast and of not, for example, ensuring that in Saddam Hussein's mind there is a very real risk that, if he does not comply with the UN—if he does not finally comply after 12 years of defying the people of the world and the United Nations, that great instrument of peace created out of the embers of World War II by the great leaders of the post World War II era—then there will be a consequence. And if you do not have a forward deployment of troops—if you do not have troops, aircraft carriers, fighter planes and bombers amassed on the border ready to ensure that there is a significant consequence if Iraq fails to comply with the UN resolution—then, of course, there will be a repeat of what has happened every month and every year for the last 12 years. </para><para>To conclude where I commenced, I think that is an issue that does build on the concern of people in the community—from people whom I know personally and, more broadly, from constituents whom I do not know so well but who write to me and phone me. The picture of troops moving into the Middle East makes them think that there is some keenness to get to war. In fact, even the Secretary-General of the United Nations has made it very clear, and the Prime Minister quoted the words, that, had there not been a serious threat of imminent military action— and Kofi Annan has said publicly that, in his opinion, had the Americans not applied that military pressure through the build-up of forces in the gulf—then the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. I think that is an important thing.</para><para>I say to all Australians that this is important. If you want to get a resolution and disarmament of Iraq—which is what we all want; the one thing that everybody here agrees on is that we want Iraq disarmed and we want the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to be taken away—then you need the weapons inspectors there. I reassure Australians that that is why our troops are there. When Iraq disarms—and we hope that that is before the UN's deadlines—then our troops can come home, and that is what we all want. We want them to come home safe and secure—and secure also in the knowledge that they have made the world a safer place, free from the threats of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>8232</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to table a document that I circulated to the whips earlier.

It is not a necessary consequence of the atrocities committed in New York and Bali in recent times. It is not, as Senator Hill told us today, a necessary consequence of any new dimension to international relations flowing from those events. For centuries, leaders have committed young men and women to war to fight noble causes on their behalf. For centuries, leaders have told their people that war is inevitable, necessary or just. Sometimes it is all of those things, but that is rarely the case. I do not believe that unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is necessary or just. But there is a growing sense of inevitability about such action, because the Bush administration appears determined to act.</para></talk.start><para>Regrettably, the Bush administration has received the full support of the Howard government in this regard. This support has been delivered in defiance of the wishes of the Australian people and without recourse to this parliament. No doubt the government thinks that it has fooled some of the people with its recent rhetoric on the role of the United Nations in resolving the Iraq crisis. Maybe some people are fooled into believing that the Prime Minister's upcoming mission to Washington has something to do with peace when, in fact, it has everything to do with war. Maybe the Prime Minister thinks that today's debate in the parliament constitutes adequate consultation with the parliament.</para><para>The fact is that the Prime Minister has already sent 2,000 Australians to a theatre of war. He has done this for the very purpose of preparing Australia's forces for military action in concert with the United States. Even the government's newfound support for the UN Security Council's reconsideration of the Iraq matter is based on his view that a second resolution will make the inevitable military attack more powerful. It is the sort of doublespeak that we have come to expect from this Prime Minister. Labor called for the United Nations to resolve the crisis and that led to this government labelling our action as appeasement. The Prime Minister's latest trip to Washington for war talks is a so-called peace mission. </para><para>The dimensions of war are great and its ultimate consequences are often unknown. What we do know is that unilateral military action will seriously damage our relationship with the Middle East and will most likely damage relations with nations in our own part of this world. Damage to our trade links will be an inevitable consequence of a war. US President Bush told the Congress during his recent State of the Union address that food aid is a component of his plan for Iraq following his removal of the Iraqi regime. President Bush said:</para><quote><para>... we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies—and freedom.</para></quote><para>Senators from rural and regional Australia and those with an interest in trade will know that Iraq has been a key market for Australian wheat for many years. Any move to substitute Australian wheat with wheat of other nations, including that of the United States, will threaten Australian farmers' access to Iraqi markets. There has been serious criticism of the statements made by ministers of this government early last year which, through the failure of the Howard government to support a peaceful resolution of the Iraq crisis, cost Australian farmers $400 million in wheat contracts. The Australian Wheat Board said in August last year that they thought they had recovered the situation in relation to those contracts but, clearly, that is not now the case.</para><para>Our wheat farmers, currently savaged by drought, are paying the price for the Howard government's rush to war through the loss of those forward wheat export orders. The Howard government's actions on Iraq have denied our farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in income and are providing an opportunity for our trade competitors to fill our hard-won wheat orders. So far, the Howard government has done nothing to protect Australian farmers from the consequences of its warmongering—nothing at all—but it is my hope that our farmers will not be counted amongst the collateral damage of any non-UN sanctioned military action. The original motion and its amending motion would appear to suggest that there is sharp division on this matter. Let me say that there are some things on which we all—or most of us, at least—surely agree. The first point on which we are at one is in our support for the men and women of the Australian defence forces.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—I take that interjection. We are at one, and Simon Crean is at one with us, in support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The fact that he was prepared to go to them when they were leaving this country at the direction of the Prime Minister and tell them that, but that we did not support the Prime Minister's decision to send them, was an action of courage which I totally support and which I think has won him a great deal of respect in the community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second thing on which we surely agree is that no-one believes preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is anything other than a critical security issue for the world. The third thing we all agree upon is that Saddam Hussein must abide by the terms of Security Council resolution 1441. It is therefore profoundly disappointing that today the parliament and the nation are divided on the question of Australia's actions in the Middle East. It did not have to be this way. The government should have adopted Labor's commitment to exhausting the processes of the United Nations before amassing the forces of war. I do not accept the argument that that amassing of forces will somehow change the ultimate outcome of this matter.</para><para>The Prime Minister should have told the United States that his first responsibility is the protection of Australia's national interest. He should have told President Bush that Australia's interests dictate support for the United Nations and the resolution of conflict without resorting to war. Sadly, the Prime Minister has done none of those things. Unfortunately, I have to say that Australia deserves better. We should be supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Faulkner. If, ultimately, resolution 1441 is not abided by then the United Nations Security Council has made very clear its position, which ultimately will be tested against the performance of Iraq. The Security Council has decided to convene immediately upon receipt of a report, in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 11 of the resolution, in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security. It recalls that in that context the council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. That is the strength of the position of the United Nations. That is the position we should be behind. We should reject unilateralism. Australia should not be sending troops to the Middle East at this time. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>8234</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When Minister Hill delivered the Prime Minister's statement to this chamber, he detailed a list of what the government considers to be reasons for the imminent bombing of the people of Iraq. It certainly seems imminent. It seems as the days go by and more and more of our troops are sent that we have got ourselves into something that it is simply not going to be possible to get ourselves out of. In the brief time I have to speak, I would like to quickly look at some of the key issues raised in that speech and issues that have been raised by other senators in this debate.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I wish to look at the person Saddam Hussein—the one it is claimed is a danger to his people and, indeed, to the world. I do not think there is any doubt that Saddam Hussein has little, if any, regard for his people. There is a long list of atrocities, including the use of chemical weapons against minority groups. The many refugees that have come out to Australia tell quite horrific stories of what happens to ordinary Iraqis at the hands of Saddam Hussein. But, unfortunately, he is certainly not alone. As we look around the world we have a long list of regimes where people are not cared for; they are not even considered in the manic determination of their rulers to hang on to power.</para><para>One example which is relevant to us at the moment and which we can look at briefly is that of Mugabe in Zimbabwe, the atrocities that are occurring there and the mass starvation of the people of Zimbabwe. But what is our response? We are off to play cricket. I very much oppose the Australian team going there to play cricket, but I highlight that simply to show the inconsistencies surrounding the whole argument as to why we now have to head off to war.</para><para>Is Saddam Hussein a risk to his region? He may well be, but certainly if we look at his record since 1991 he has not stepped over any borders and he has not made any sign that he is going to invade his neighbours. So I argue very strongly that while he may not be the choice of the United States as president of Iraq, it is simply unacceptable that they lead a military attack for regime change. It is totally unacceptable that Australia is out there in the front line tagging along wanting to be one of the first nations to sign up in step with the United States as part of that move for regime change. It is regime change in a nation that is very rich in oil, as has been discussed by a number of other speakers.</para><para>Secondly, there is the whole question of whether or not Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and, if it does not actually have them, whether it wants to develop them. That is possible. Indeed, when it comes to biological weapons, it is even probable. But again, there are many other such countries, particularly in terms of nuclear weapons. Again, you can go through the list. So far, various pressures and international actions have averted their use since World War II. But, if we do want to talk about nuclear weapons, it is likely that there are about eight nations that have those capabilities—starting, of course, with the US itself. It, we know, is the only country to have ever actually used them. The US apparently has at least 10,000 in active deployment and another 2,000 to 3,000 stockpiled. If we go down the list of countries, there is Israel, with an estimated arsenal of at least 100 warheads, most with long-range capabilities. As far as Israel is concerned, it also has a long list of UN resolutions that it has not abided by. In fact, I think it takes the prize as the country which has ignored the most UN resolutions—there have been some 32. By using its power of veto, the US has prevented any more UN resolutions actually coming into force as far as Israel is concerned. There are other countries such as North Korea, which has been mentioned by both the Prime Minister and other speakers. There, we are still talking and we are prepared to work through the issues. Indeed, what they seem to be doing is basically trying to buy off the rest of the world with their requests for additional aid. We can move down the list to India and Pakistan. Apparently there, thank goodness, we are not going to go to war and there seems to be very little concern now that they too have an arsenal of nuclear weapons. </para><para>With sanctions and surveillance in place, everything that I have found to read indicates that Iraq has not been able to re-establish any nuclear capabilities. Indeed, that is what the inspectors also seem to have found. As far as biological weapons are concerned, again, the inspectors have found nothing. But we know that there may well be some missing, because, after all, it is the US and its allies who supplied them with the ingredients in the first place. So Saddam Hussein may be hiding something and he may not be fully cooperating with weapons inspectors, but surely we have time to keep the pressure on and perhaps offer some carrots rather than all this threatening with sticks and certainly with war.</para><para>As I mentioned, in terms of resolutions there are many other countries—led by Israel—who have failed to abide by UN resolutions. I think Turkey is on the list, and Morocco is also on the list—with some 17 resolutions not complied with—and so it goes on. As far as the UN and these resolutions are concerned, surely it is the UN's first and foremost responsibility to work to prevent war. It is not their job to go to war in case one might be started. Indeed, I would suggest that it is an absolute nonsense to say that the way to prevent war is to actually go to war.</para><para>In the last Gulf War, the US military used about 944,000 rounds of depleted uranium bullets. The impact on the Iraqi people has been horrific. There has been an increase in cancer of something like five times the rate that was there before the war. This has included cancers such as bronchial cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancer, stomach cancers and leukaemias et cetera. Birth defects have doubled since the war—these details are from the <inline font-style="italic">British Medical Journal</inline>—there have been children born without eyes, fingers, limbs et cetera. The last war and the UN sanctions have contributed to widespread hardship right across Iraq. There have been increases in the prevalence of diseases like polio, TB and hepatitis. Low birth weight babies have been born and there has been an increase in infectious diseases. Malnutrition has dramatically increased. There has been a deterioration in water quality and quantity, a deterioration in health services and a decrease in the medicines and medical services available. There is a long list of problems relating to transport and general services. From 1991-98 children under five died in their thousands month after month. The figures for children's deaths from diseases relating to malnutrition are somewhere between 2,690 to well over 5,000 per month. The WHO reports that some 800,000 children under five are chronically malnourished. So the coming war will have absolutely horrific consequences for the ordinary people of Iraq, further destroying services and infrastructure and further making their lives an absolute misery, particularly if the US plans for precision bombing go ahead.</para><para>I want to go to the links to terrorism. As other speakers have said, there is no direct link to the atrocities of September 11. As we look around for who is to blame there, there are a number of other countries such as Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries—perhaps Egypt and certainly Afghanistan—where there does seem to be some link between the perpetrators and particular nations. Indeed, if we look at the relationship between Iraq and those who perpetrated the September 11 atrocities, al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein have a history of antipathy. Apparently that is because they come from different Islamic creeds which are hostile to each other. It is highly likely that bin Laden considers Hussein's regime too secular, and I imagine that Saddam Hussein would consider his own country at risk from such fundamentalism. If we move to the issue of Bali, again, there are no direct links with those atrocities. It seems the bombers were Indonesian with links to the Muslim extremist al-Qaeda group. </para><para>Is Saddam Hussein a risk? I would argue that the greatest risk is that if we bomb the people of Iraq we give the extremists another incentive to wage war, to wage their campaigns, to carry on with their terrorist activities. By attacking Iraq we will increase the risk of creating the situation that we most fear: increasing, not decreasing, the risk of terrorism. We must not proceed down this road. Even if our troops are already there, the Australian people do not want to be involved in the bombing of the men, women and children of Iraq.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>8236</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a unique time in our history and the history of the world, particularly in terms of international power structures. The world's strategic balance has developed in a way predicted by analysts at the end of Cold War and that is the fragmentation of power into what are now called rogue states and terrorist organisations that may or may not coalesce with each other. Unfortunately, there appears to be an inevitable closing of the gap between these two challenges, and the so-called axis of evil is born. On September 11, the United States, the remaining superpower of the world, was near paralysed by an example of this evil.</para></talk.start><para>There are times when democratic governments must stand up and make tough decisions. Tough decisions have more credibility if the government is trusted and has a history of doing what is in the best interests of its citizens. The coalition government has that record. The decision of the government to be part of the coalition of the willing to exert pressure on the government of Iraq is in the best interests of Australia. This decision, like others the Prime Minister has made, particularly in regard to East Timor, is courageous. I doubt that the Prime Minister would be offended to be made an example of the theory of history that there are no great people, just ordinary people who rise to extraordinary circumstances. I for one have more confidence in that sort of leader. He is a man hardened by tough decisions and the weight of leadership.</para><para>The Prime Minister understands the Australian people more than any other leader in our time. He knows there is a reluctance for war, particularly without the sanction of the United Nations. He also understands that to do nothing is not an option for Australia and particularly not for the United Nations, which must act responsibly. If the United Nations does not act responsibly, what sort of future does it have to play in any collective international responsibility for the resolution of world conflicts? The events of September 11 reinvigorated the desire by the United States and others to confront Iraq on both its weapons of mass destruction and its nuclear development capacity.</para><para>The question people ask is: why act now? We have had 12 years of attempting to bring Iraq to heel through sanctions and other means. The 1991 cease-fire at the end of the Gulf War was based on Iraq being willing to yield up evidence of its weapons of mass destruction and destroy them. Essentially, the Iraqi debate has continued to be about that. We have seen the Richard Butler led UN inspectors become so frustrated that they left. We have seen Saddam Hussein continue to persecute his own people, financially reward PLO bomber families and develop his weapons of mass destruction, of which there is no doubt. Since September 11, we have seen the US committed to making the United Nations confront its responsibilities.</para><para>Iraq has continued to ignore UN resolutions. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan says, without the ability of the United States to bring pressure on Saddam the Iraqi government would not have allowed in the new weapons inspectors in the last few months. To go to the core of the Blix report to the UN, it is clear that Iraq cooperated in process but not in substance. That is the situation that we confront this day, 4 February 2003.</para><para>Iraq is a country rich in resources and, unlike some other Middle Eastern countries, it has the capacity to feed itself. Above all, it has a population entitled to democracy with a role to play in world affairs. It has always fascinated me as to why Saddam continues his charade when his country has so much to gain and so little to lose by complying with UN resolutions. While sanctions remain in force, such as the oil for food embargo in which the Royal Australian Navy has played a part since 1991, Iraq will steadily go downhill domestically and continue to be a world pariah state. Saddam Hussein alone has the power to make the decision to ensure a peaceful outcome to this problem. It is not too late for him. The message to the Iraqi government is still there to be heard: shape up or ship out. I remind my fellow senators and Australians of the old maxim: all that is required for evil to prevail is for good people to remain silent. We must not remain silent on this issue. I am proud to be a part of a government that is brave enough to take tough but proper decisions for the future of world peace and security but particularly for our region. </para><para>I want to finish by hitting on the head the furphy that this dispute is about the West getting access to Iraqi oil reserves. Nothing could be further from the truth or from reality. Firstly, world oil companies have worked cooperatively with Iraqi oil producers over the last decade and oil prices have remained very stable. Secondly, Iraq would be agreeable at any time to flood the world with oil in exchange for a reduction in or a removal of sanctions. Oil prices or access to Iraqi oil reserves is not the motivation for disarming Iraq.</para><para> It is now up to the Security Council to determine further action, and further meetings of the council are expected over the next few weeks. It is appropriate that the Prime Minister visit New York to put Australia's case in person, and he is to do that. We hope that a peaceful solution can still be found. However, we cannot allow this issue to go on unresolved. After 12 years of noncooperation, the international community must act decisively to eliminate the threat posed by Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. If we do not act today, we will certainly regret our inaction tomorrow.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>8237</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government today stands condemned and accused by the Labor Party of misleading the people of Australia.

This was October last year. Of this conversation between Mr Downer and the New Zealand High Commissioner, Laurie Oakes says:</para><quote><para>Mr Downer said that Australia would indeed prefer UN backing. However, and this was not a point that could be made publicly, Australia was not in a position, if the UN process broke down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf.</para></quote><para>What a telling statement it is from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that `this was not a point that could be made publicly'. The reality is that, for all the rhetoric and hyperbole that this government has fed the Australian people, it has no intention of paying any attention whatsoever to the processes of the United Nations. Despite coalition speaker after coalition speaker getting up here and saying things such as `It will depend on the UN', `We would prefer it to go to the UN' and `The UN has a massive responsibility', the government stands condemned by the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, when he said in this conversation last October that if the UN process broke down we would not be in a position to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf but that he could not make this point publicly. Why not? Why couldn't he make this point publicly? Why would he mislead the Australian people to that degree?</para><para>This is a damning indictment of the coalition government's position. Why on earth haven't they come clean with the Australian people, given that this was their position in October last year? Why haven't they come clean and said, `We have no intention of paying any attention whatsoever to the UN processes'? This quote is basically saying: `Too bad what the UN decides. We are not withdrawing our troops, irrespective of any UN decision; but, by the way, people of Australia, we're not going to tell you about it. We will not make this comment publicly.' What an absolute indictment of this government. We, the Labor Party, accuse the government of keeping the people of Australia in the dark. And this revelation on Channel 9 tonight totally vindicates the position of the Labor Party in this respect. </para><para>How stupid does the government think the people of Australia are? Does the government seriously think that people will believe, after the predeployment of 2,000 troops, that if the United Nations process works very smoothly and things go according to plan those troops will be withdrawn or that the government has had a Damascan revelation about internationalism through the processes of the United Nations—`Let us hope there is peace' et cetera—when the Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted in October last year in a private conversation that this government had no intention whatsoever of withdrawing those troops if the UN processes broke down but he could not say it publicly?</para><para>I think that speaks volumes. That says to the Australian people something that they have known for a long time in relation to this issue—that you cannot trust this government. They are not coming clean. They are not telling the truth to the Australian people. You just have to talk to people on the street to realise they know this. Here we have, in October last year, an admission from the foreign affairs minister, Mr Downer, that there has never been any intention to withdraw the troops, irrespective of any UN decision. I think that is absolutely startling and very revealing information. It will simply add to the distrust the people of Australia already have of the sycophantic behaviour of the government towards the United States.</para><para>I noticed that the Prime Minister quite recently talked about Vietnam in relation to this issue. In fact, in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>of Saturday, 1 February 2003, he said:</para><quote><para>I think the arguments here are even more compelling than they were in relation to Vietnam.</para></quote><para>Obviously we have a Prime Minister who still believes that the action in Vietnam was correct. I do not meet anybody these days who thinks that the action in Vietnam was correct—nobody—but the Prime Minister says `even more compelling than Vietnam'. What an indictment that is. The government is not putting the interests of Australians first. Instead, Australia's national interest is coming second—look at the obsequious behaviour of the government towards George W. Bush—to George W. Bush's obsession with destroying Saddam Hussein.</para><para>After the disastrous events of September 11, we all said that a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq had to be found to prove a clear and present danger there. There has been no evidence to date of such a link. What the American government sought to do, however, was distort the issue in relation to those tragic events of September 11 by trying to involve Saddam Hussein. I want to put on the record that nobody here in this parliament thinks that Saddam Hussein is anything other than a tyrant and a thug—nobody here thinks anything other than that. Obviously the Iraqi people would be far better off without Saddam Hussein, but the same could be said, as Senator Lees said, about many governments across the world.</para><para>Many people would argue that in fact North Korea poses a greater threat to the world than Iraq. Not only is North Korea known to have nuclear capability but it has withdrawn from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and has threatened to resume its nuclear program. What has the response of the Bush administration been to North Korea? Far less hawkish than it has been towards Iraq. If ever there were a country that might merit the sort of argument put forward in relation to Iraq, North Korea would be streets ahead. It has made active threats and it has withdrawn from the treaty.</para><para>It is no wonder that people across the world, including in Australia, are legitimately asking, `Why Iraq?' Why Iraq? Why has the Iraqi regime under Hussein been elevated to the position of public enemy No. 1?' I have to disagree with the previous speaker; I believe that a lot of it has to do with Iraq having huge oilfields and with the fact that the US currently consumes around 25 per cent of the world's oil supplies. We know that the United States Department of Energy announced recently that by 2025 US oil imports will be around 70 per cent of total US domestic demand, up from 55 per cent two years ago. International oilfields are becoming increasingly depleted, and there is an increased likelihood that in the future world oil supplies will be dependent on Gulf oil. We also know that there are many people in the Bush administration who advocate the argument that resource or energy security is a primary mission for the US military. That the Bush administration believes its strategic and economic interests will benefit from a regime change in Iraq to a government more supportive of American interests is patently clear. We also know that one of the reasons that President Bush has been talking up war in Iraq for a long time is to shore up domestic support for the Republican Party in the recent congressional elections. I have to say that that bit of wedge politics paid off big time. The White House is now using the threat of war against Iraq as a convenient way of distracting the American people from any concerns about the faltering state of the United States economy. </para><para>The decision by the Prime Minister to deploy Australian troops to the Gulf region in January was the wrong decision. We now know that when those troops went off in January this government had no intention whatsoever of bringing them back. I bring the Senate back to the startling admission today on Channel 9 that Alexander Downer indicated to the New Zealand High Commissioner in October last year that, if the UN process broke down, Australia was not in a position to withdraw ships, troops or presence in the Gulf but that this was not a point that could be made publicly. I ask the government to respond, perhaps through its next speaker, as to whether this statement is in fact correct. I ask the government to explain to the Australian people why it did not say that in October last year and why it continues to perpetuate this fiction that the situation is not QED.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>8239</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like many, I came to parliament this week acutely aware of my responsibilities as an elected representative of South Australians. Surveys and polls over the last few months, including today, have demonstrated that the vast majority of Australians are opposed to Australia's involvement in a US-led war against Iraq. Today I speak together with those Australians. I share their deep concerns and I share the many, many questions that they and others in this chamber have.</para></talk.start><para>I want to make two things very clear from the outset. Firstly, I deplore the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and I am appalled by the atrocities that have been committed in the name of that dictatorship. I want the Iraqi people to be democratically governed and to have their fundamental human rights respected. I also want the Iraqi people—as I want the people of Zimbabwe, North Korea, China, Tibet and Burma, among others—to be protected from human rights abuses and to have the opportunity to freely elect their political representatives. Secondly, I am unequivocally opposed to the development, storage and use of weapons of mass destruction—whether by India, Pakistan, Iraq, France, Russia or indeed the United States of America. Yet despite my very strong feelings on these issues I do not support Australia's involvement in military action against Iraq.</para><para>War is not just another strategy to achieve desired ends. War is a desperate measure. Only the most exceptional circumstances can ever justify the killing of other human beings. Not only must war be eminently justified but its objectives must be clear and precise. The objectives of military action against Iraq are anything but clear at this stage. The reasons given by Tony Blair, George W. Bush and, indeed, our own Prime Minister for such military action do not assist us. In fact, they simply raise more questions. These are questions they have failed to answer and questions that I know many Australians would like the Prime Minister to address. It is disappointing that we did not have question time today as that would have enabled us to ask the government some of these questions. In the absence of question time, I am going to put on notice and put on the public record a number of the questions that we have. </para><para>We know that Iraq has consistently failed to meet its obligations relating to disarmament and weapons inspections following the Gulf War. Of course it is vitally important to ensure that Iraq complies with these obligations. But, if the war is about forcing Iraq to comply with international law, why are we contemplating illegal military action to achieve this compliance? It simply does not make sense to break the law, in this case, in order to enforce it. Nor does it make sense to abandon the procedures of the United Nations in order to enforce the resolutions of the United Nations. The inconsistency—indeed, the hypocrisy—of this was illustrated in the recent State of the Union address given by President Bush. The President accused Iraq of being in contempt of the United Nations. He then went on to make it clear that the United States would not depend on the decisions of others.</para><para>We do not need to rely on the words of President Bush to understand the attitude of the United States towards international law on occasions. If the United States is so committed to international law, as outlined by President Bush, then how does it explain the imposition of embargoes on the supply of food and medicine to Cuba when such embargoes have been repeatedly condemned by UN resolutions and described as `serious violation of international law'? The United States has also ignored international law, specifically the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Beijing rules, when it has executed people who were under the age of 18 when they committed a crime. What legal or moral authority does the United States have to make other countries comply with their international obligations when this is its own track record?</para><para>The Prime Minister has consistently stated that the purpose of any proposed war would be to address the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. If this is the purpose, then why are we not also going to war against North Korea? Many nations around this world have weapons of mass destruction. The United States, as we know, has an abundance of such weapons. For a nation which professes such a strong opposition to weapons of mass destruction, it is interesting to note that the US remains the only nation which has ever resorted to the use of nuclear weapons during military warfare. It also refuses to sign the protocol to the biological weapons convention.</para><para>Yet the fundamental distinction that is relied upon is that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of so-called rogue states, which has been referred to repeatedly today, present a particular threat to international security. There is no doubt that Iraq is a rogue state. What is not clear, however, is what exactly defines a rogue state and why we are not pursuing military action against other rogue states that possess weapons of mass destruction. If a rogue state is one which is not democratically governed, then what about North Korea? If it is a state in which human rights abuses occur, then what about China? How does the United Kingdom justify the exportation of key nuclear weapons-grade material to Iran? If the US and the UK are so opposed to weapons of mass destruction, why is it that neither country will rule out the use of nuclear weapons in military action against Iraq? If the war is really about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, why has President Bush said that the voluntary exile of Saddam Hussein would be one way to prevent the war?</para><para>This brings me to the issue of regime change. There are many reasons to abhor the regime of Saddam Hussein and to seek an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people under that regime. We have all heard the stories of torture and murder. They appal us all. The stories that we hear appal me; they anger me; they grieve me. Yet while the United States and Australia condemned these practices in Iraq, neither country was prepared to support the optional protocol to the convention against torture. If the purpose of the war is really to topple a cruel and undemocratic dictatorship, then why aren't we also going to war against Zimbabwe? The Prime Minister will not even stop the Australian cricket team from playing in Zimbabwe as a sign of our opposition to that regime; yet he will risk the lives of Australians to put an end to Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.</para><para>If the war is to save the Iraqi people, why does Washington intend to adopt a strategy in which 800 missiles could be launched on Baghdad, where almost five million Iraqis live? If the purpose of this war is to achieve regime change, what exactly are we hoping to change the regime to? How will it work? What is the post war assistance that we are going to offer Iraq? None, according to our Prime Minister, who told us last week that Australia would not be involved in any such rebuilding process. </para><para>It appears that none of the reasons given for this war really stacks up, which begs the question: what is the real underlying motivation for this war? Some suggest oil; others suggest US imperialism. I am not going to speculate on those allegations, but one thing is clear: no persuasive argument has been made to justify any military action against Iraq at this stage. The Prime Minister tells us that the decision as to whether or not Australia should participate in this war weighs heavily on him. I say to the Prime Minister: this is not your burden to bear. When faced with such a grave decision, the Prime Minister should turn to the Australian people. That is what democracy is all about. That is what differentiates regimes such as that of Saddam Hussein and those of democratic governments.</para><para>It is time to change the rhetoric in this debate. It is time we stopped restricting the debate to the terms dictated by George W. Bush, our Prime Minister or even Tony Blair. Going to war against Iraq does not demonstrate leadership. It demonstrates failure. The Prime Minister risks associating his premiership with a rush to failure. War represents failure because it gives up on those things that characterise decent civilisation: negotiation, rational discussion, persuasion, the use of international goodwill and the offer of help in return for cooperation. If the combined brains of the international community cannot avoid war, we have failed desperately. John Winston Howard should have regard to another Winston—Winston Churchill. Despite his great reputation as a wartime leader and warrior chief, despite the glory that came his way, Churchill said it best when in the fifties he said: `To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war.' He said this in Washington. Let the Prime Minister go to Washington and jaw-jaw.</para><para>We the people do not want war. We do not want to send our younger or older Australians to terrible fields of conflict to use disgusting weaponry against each other, against their fellow human beings, and to risk them returning to their homeland injured, limbless and demented by the horrors they have witnessed or coming home dead. We want people to live peacefully without the deaths of thousands, if not millions, on our conscience. We want to face the problems that we have; we do not want to create new ones. We want to write our history. We want to say sorry. We do not want to create more and more reasons for being sorry. There are no sufficient reasons for being involved in this conflict. There are no reasons to include Australians; bring the troops home. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>8241</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If we are to be honest in this debate, we must accept that Iraq is a world problem.

Australians understand that, if he will not disarm, he will have to be disarmed. Australians understand that this is a risk and that sometimes you have to take risks to do the right thing. Sometimes you have to make a stand and that time is now. Under American leadership and in partnership with Britain and other countries, we are making a stand.</para></talk.start><para>War is an abhorrent notion, as we have heard here repeatedly today. It is to be avoided whenever there is an alternative path. But sometimes being decisive today— even at the risk of war—can avoid conflict or save us a greater and more deadly conflict later. The world is trying to avoid a war today by making it clear to Saddam Hussein that his time has run out. I believe time has also run out for those who want Australians to believe that there is no such thing as a just war. Labor and Simon Crean are in grave danger of falling into this trap. In fact, they seem to want to fall into it—another abject failure of the party that aspires to be the alternative government. So, too, are the churches, some of whose leading members have been prominent in the peace not war movement that is trying to take over our streets and apparently has taken over some of our churches. Their `no need for war' position overturns a millennium of Christian tradition and threatens to remove the moral force of the church from genuinely influencing state policy in times of conflict. Last year when he was asked if he thought Saddam was a dangerous person, the Anglican Primate of Australia, Archbishop Peter Carnley, said Saddam was `morally suspect'. </para><para>Is it merely morally suspect to wage war on your neighbours and your own people? Is it merely morally suspect to act as paymaster for suicide bombers who attack and wreck Israel? Is it merely morally suspect to seek to acquire chemical, biological, and possibly nuclear, weapons for clearly offensive purposes? Can the Anglican Primate of Australia possibly and genuinely believe this? </para><para>The Saddam regime in Iraq has played games with the world, with the UN, for 12 years, since it was evicted from Kuwait. Saddam Hussein has shown no willingness to mediate his circumstances and his demands against those of the world community. We hope the UN will, through action to enforce Iraq's compliance with resolution 1441. But if it will not, if it again allows Saddam Hussein to thumb his nose at the world and continue his oppression and weapons acquisition, then nations with sufficient moral fibre will, in my personal view, have a real job to do and they will need to do it. We want to avoid that, of course. We believe that, ultimately, the moral force of the argument presented by the Americans—and pre-eminently by President Bush in his State of the Union address to Congress last week—will persuade the Security Council to hold firm.</para><para>These are the facts: Saddam Hussein has a record of murderous behaviour and dangerous weapons. The United Nations must play its full role or it will have to be bypassed. Leadership has come from various sources; if the UN will not provide it, then other options, in my view, need to be considered. Leadership came from America in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when the United States faced down the Soviet Union. Leadership came from Britain in the Falklands in 1982, when the UK fought to regain the Falklands on behalf of the 1,800 islanders— British subjects—from the regime of the Argentine generals. Leadership again came from America on September 11, 2001, when the United States suffered direct attack by terrorists. </para><para>But the stand we are making is not one that must inevitably lead to war. It is a stand designed to avoid war, to force the opponent to back down without a fight. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate noted in his speech this afternoon, the history of the 20th century demonstrates with stark and murderous clarity the folly of trying to appease dictators. It teaches in blood how sometimes it is better to fight a small war than to wait for a big one to start. I believe that, with Iraq, the Prime Minister has shown tremendous leadership and great courage. The opposition leader has not, and that is a real shame. It is a shame on him, it is a shame on his party— which aspires to government—and it is a shame on this country. Under its present leader, the Labor Party has let this country down. It has played shrill politics where it could and should have played statesman politics.</para><para>Of course Australians are concerned about the risk that their country may find itself at war. Of course Australians—all Australians, religious or not, and of whatever creed— pray that the volunteer members of the Australian Defence Force in the Gulf, or on the way there, will be safe and that they will not have to go to war. The government's strategy is to avoid war. The Labor Party and other critics of the Prime Minister and his policy must understand that, because that is the reality. The Australian deployment to the region bolsters—by a measured and appropriate amount, taking into account our national interests and our military capabilities—the forces deployed there or being deployed there by the United States and Britain. One reason for the deployment ahead of possible events is that personnel need to acclimatise, and equipment and in-theatre training have to be worked up—something else Senator Hill mentioned in his speech. The opposition leader might pretend he does not know this. His predecessor is too honest to make such a hollow pretence. Another reason for the early deployment is to put the Iraqi regime in as tight a vice as possible in order to persuade it to back down. The opposition leader may pretend he does not know this. His predecessor is too honest to do so. </para><para>President George Bush's State of the Union address last week put tremendous pressure on the Security Council to stick to its guns and insist that the Iraqi regime does what the UN says is required of it. It should eventually bring France and Germany into line. We note that Italy and Spain are already on board with Britain. The European Union really should be able to speak with one voice on so important an international issue if it expects to be taken seriously as a unified voice in world affairs. The Prime Minister's visit to Washington, New York and London next week for talks with President Bush, the UN, and the British Prime Minister is a measured response to Iraq's continued defiance of the UN. It is not about `all the way with George W.

For the residents of Victoria, while the loss of life has not been an issue, the loss of property and the issue of national heritage, in some instances going up in flames, is something that I sympathise with greatly. I wish to extend my sincere condolences to them. </para></talk.start><para>However, at a time when we have not had the best summer season in the world, nor have trade and other seasonal conditions been favouring farmers, I would like to look to the future. In this instance, I would like to examine the report of the Sex Discrimination Unit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which last year handed down its blueprint for a national paid maternity leave scheme.</para><para>I welcome this proposal, as it contains some important considerations for the future of Australian families. I would like to bring the report to the attention of all senators. The proposal is entitled <inline font-style="italic">A time to value.</inline> In its recommendations, the scheme is to be Commonwealth government funded, with employers encouraged to top up the payment through enterprise bargaining. Women in full-time, part-time or casual work for 40 out of the past 52 weeks are to be eligible. There will be a 14-week minimum entitlement of the federal minimum wage of $431 per week or the equivalent of the recipient's previous weekly earnings from all jobs, whichever is the lesser amount.  </para><para>Women receiving paid maternity leave will not be able to claim baby bonus, maternity allowance or family tax benefit. I would also like to point out that 85,000 women annually are expected to receive paid maternity leave. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth government of paid maternity leave would be $460 million gross, and that would be offset by the cost of baby bonus, maternity allowance or family tax benefit. The cost of the scheme is calculated to be $213 million for 2003-04.</para><para>Australia is one of only two OECD countries that do not have a system of paid maternity leave. At the heart of the proposal is the changing face of the Australian family, the combination of commitments for working mothers and the overarching need for newborn babies to be with their mothers, rather than separated through financial necessity. Information for the proposal was collected through consultation with a wide range of employer and employee groups, unions, women's organisations and community organisations in all states. The report was based on the input from those groups, who represent the views of the majority of Australian women. Given the level of consultation, and the primary role of the Howard coalition government in the preservation and protection of families, I would like to see my government consider the proposal in the context of work and family policy settings.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—You might have to talk to Nick Minchin about that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name></talker><para>—I will be, Senator Crossin. Juggling work and family responsibilities can weigh heavily on men and women alike, but it can prove particularly difficult for working mothers. The report contends that it is part of the broader issue of work and life balance. The proposal reflects accounts of women who, after their husbands have lost their jobs, have, in order to breastfeed, returned to work with a two-week-old under the counter. You would hope that in the Australia of 2003 that prospect would not have to be contemplated. Other women report that they do not have enough leave or money saved up to have another child. You would hope that such contemplations would not play a part in the sort of family planning that I would like to see. Others, who deferred motherhood due to financial concerns, discovered that it was biologically too late to start a family.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The proposal on paid maternity leave, as put forward by the unit, takes into account the undeniable change in today's family structure. This has been attributed to `irreversible global factors' as well as the incorporated cost of living, job uncertainty, high divorce rates and the changed expectations of men and women. The proposal also asserts that government family policy must evolve and modify to suit the changes to the overall family and social environment.</para><para>The government has already demonstrated its commitment to Australian families. In accordance with that commitment, I would like to look seriously at the recommendations laid out in the report and in the perspective of the changed structure of the modern family. This proposal tables a fundamental question: `Is the concept of modern family, and a woman's choice to have a child, a right or a privilege?' The proposal concludes that the scheme will be of most benefit to women in low-pay, low-skill jobs with limited bargaining power. As such, almost half of the recipients of the proposed paid maternity leave scheme would receive the equivalent of full wage replacement for up to 14 weeks.</para><para>This report may not as yet be the archetypical response to the issue of paid maternity leave, and it acknowledges that implementation is not a panacea. I am sure that there will be sufficient debate and further consultation required before policy on this issue is determined. I would like to think that the government, and the Senate in particular, would contemplate this proposal based on the current considerations to family benefit, but in that wider context of work and family policy. The document contains vital considerations of national importance and I urge all senators to review its recommendations.  </para><para>As a Victorian senator, a parent of five and a grandparent of three, I can reflect on my own experiences as a working mother. I would like to think that a government view on family and work policy had changed sufficiently over the last 20 to 25 years and that we could take further considerations into account. I would like to point out that it is not a solution to the problem of the fertility rate, which is due to other considerations that are outside the scope of this report, but it is a possible solution, and a financial solution, for those mothers and fathers who choose to have children. </para><para>I have been very proud to serve in a government that has a demonstrated commitment to work and family issues. I would like all senators to consult within their own families and communities on this issue so that when the final result comes, as I hope it does, it is a holistic reflection of the requirements of Australia's families.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bushfires</title><page.no>8246</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>8246</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the Chief Minister of the ACT, I have never felt so proud to be part of the Canberra community. In my adjournment speech this evening, I would like to focus on the caring sense of community shown by so many Canberra people. Reflections such as this have been long and loud in the Canberra community over the last few weeks, but now that parliament has resumed I want to take the opportunity to make these reflections in this place.</para></talk.start><para>Firefighters and hundreds of emergency services personnel and volunteers risked their lives and pushed themselves beyond their limits when they were confronted with the firestorm on 18 January this year. The heroism, effort and generosity displayed will forever be part of Canberra's heritage and history. So much for Canberra's alleged reputation as some sort of artificial city with no soul! No-one in Canberra has felt like that, and this is an opportunity to demonstrate to everybody that we not only have a soul but are an extraordinary city.</para><para>Like the dire circumstances in other places in Australia and around the world in which people do incredible things when confronted with adversity, here in Canberra we had our own confrontation. The efforts of many people prevented the losses of lives and homes from entering the thousands. We cannot thank them enough for their commitment. The service crews from utilities like ActewAGL and communications companies have worked tirelessly to restore gas, water and power to the thousands of affected homes, and they continue to do that work—it is not over yet, and will not be for some time.</para><para>Through all of this, the spirit of the Canberra people has shone through. There are countless stories of not only personal loss but courageous rescues, of whole neighbourhoods who banded together to save their homes and their neighbours' homes, who triumphed in their successes and grieved together in their losses. In the face of adversity, people risked their lives and their own homes for the sake of others—for their neighbour up the street; in many cases for people that might have lived over the back fence for years but they had never met before.</para><para>The Canberra community rallied together, helping their neighbours to clear debris, clean out gutters, block down-pipes and hose down walls and roofs, donating extraordinary amounts of bedding, food, housing, clothes and drink to local charities, initially through the evacuation centres and then through the traditional charities. Local hotels and motels provided free accommodation. Local businesses have provided goods and services without wanting any recognition.</para><para>How can we ever repay the hundreds of volunteers—many of whom have themselves been severely affected—who staffed the centres and the phones around the clock? I know of many people who themselves lost their homes or had no knowledge of what was going on in their own streets in the affected areas who continued to work as volunteers through that period on that afternoon.</para><para>As the recovery from this tragedy begins, I have to say that we are extraordinarily proud of the leadership shown within the community and the leadership shown by the elected representatives of the ACT, with Jon Stanhope and the Labor government here in Canberra. They coordinated the set-up of the evacuation centres, which sheltered thousands of people on the nights immediately after the firestorm. Since then, they have established the ACT Recovery Centre, a fantastic achievement given the short time frame involved. </para><para>Having the recovery centre means that people will be able to receive support, advice and assistance with their immediate needs, including accommodation, financial advice and counselling—there is a child-care service being set up there—all at one location. This one-stop shop environment minimises the logistics for people putting their lives back together. In my own visit to that centre, I saw that the Salvation Army was there, showing people where to go. So when you first arrived you knew where to go—someone was there to walk you up to the registration area and then down to the other support areas. That personal touch is incredibly important if you—as an individual or family— are facing a tragedy. People also have access to advice about the longer term support options that are available. I know that the contractors engaged to clear debris have also established an office at that recovery centre.</para><para>A bushfire recovery appeal has been set up and is receiving strong local and outside support, with many businesses and organisations donating quite extraordinary amounts of money. About $3½ million has been collected to date. From memory, the target was $10 million for this fund. I would like to mention some of the donors to that fund. Licensed clubs throughout Canberra have rallied to the emergency by not only donating large amounts of money to the bushfire recovery appeal through ClubsACT but providing food and facilities and supporting emergency services and the efforts of other organisations. In some cases, this was as straightforward as making sandwiches on the day. In the week following the firestorm— when Belconnen and other places were still on alert; we had no idea if the fires were going to come back—those clubs made sandwiches to make sure that the volunteers, the firies and the emergency services workers had food to be able to keep going. Those little things really mattered and made a big difference.</para><para>A huge contribution was made by the service clubs, such as Apex and Lions. They acted immediately to provide people on the ground, supporting all kinds of fundraising. For example, in addition to their cash donations, the Lions Club provided staff for barbecue and drinks outlets at the Vikings rugby club's fundraising night. That was a particularly successful night, where a rugby union club got together with the Raiders and other league clubs to have a sevens competition here in Canberra. They had a great turnout— thousands upon thousands of Canberrans turned up, paid their $10, had a great night and watched some terrific football played by some of our greatest Australian football stars. Vanessa Amarossi and great local talent provided entertainment. As I said, many of the service clubs provided the support around that event. As well, many unions and all sorts of clubs have rallied around their members who have been devastated, who have lost their homes. Everyone who is part of the community through these clubs and organisations has found support there when they most needed it.</para><para>In particular, I would like to thank Chris Peters from the ACT and Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry and his staff for their efforts in coordinating many of the business donations. It was quite a logistical challenge. MiX 106.3 and FM104.7 made a great contribution to the appeal, raising $132,000 in a radiothon on one day. Individual efforts and donations have been outstanding. People are raising money for fire victims in very personal ways. I know of one couple who hosted a birthday party and said, `No presents, but donations to bushfire appeals are welcome.' The Canberra Capitals had a basketball game out at the stadium the other night, and they took money at the gate for car parking—five dollars a car—which went directly to the bushfire appeal. I mentioned that the Vikings rugby club hosted an event. Just about every club—whether it is a commercial licensed club, a community club or whatever—is doing some sort of grassroots fundraising to help in whatever way they can. </para><para>Canberra is truly indebted to ABC radio 666, 2CN, and its staff for their constant bushfire coverage, and for taking the initiative and having the flexibility as a local radio outlet to say, `Hang on, this is more important than what we're piping out through our network and we're going to follow it through.' There were a number of individuals who put themselves on the line to take those steps and made the effort to keep Canberrans apprised of safety issues.</para><para>There are many other things I would like to discuss. I have just about run out of time but one thing I would like to mention is, I guess, a warning about what seems to be an effort from some of the local Liberals to start playing politics on this issue. I agree with Jon Stanhope on the matter: this issue is above politics. We all have a long way to go in the recovery process. I would hate to see an effort by the opposition in the local assembly to try to make this their issue for the next local campaign. That is absurd and it certainly is not welcome or needed at the moment. I reiterate my comment that all the appropriate inquiries are in place. The response to this issue needs to be efficient, tight, meaningful and comprehensive, but most of all we need to support those people who did their best on the day. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: HIV-AIDS</title><page.no>8248</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>8248</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to discuss the issue of AIDS. In its third decade the AIDS crisis is still having a catastrophic impact—I think that is undeniable. It is a disease that strikes indiscriminately. The human toll is unbearable, there are countless children without parents and there are families without support. Fourteen thousand people become HIV positive every day and 42 million people worldwide are currently HIV positive or have the AIDS virus. AIDS claimed more than three million lives last year, with more than five million people acquiring the virus. However, it is believed that the worst is yet to come. The United Nations estimates that by 2010 an additional 45 million people will become infected, and in low- to middle-income countries 45 million. Such a staggering rate of growth is not inevitable; however, immediate action is required if such an outcome is to be averted.</para></talk.start><para>We all have a responsibility to address the humanitarian crisis that is gripping our world in this form. AIDS and HIV have affected various nations around the globe, including our own; however, today I will confine my discussion to the worst-hit places. Firstly, in the Asia-Pacific region almost one million people acquired the virus last year, bringing the total number affected to 7.2 million—a 10 per cent increase from 2001. In China alone it is estimated that one million people live with HIV-AIDS, and a further 10 million are forecast by the end of this decade—a number equal, say, to the entire population of Belgium. This epidemic is widespread and the virus does not discriminate. There are certain groups within the community who are at a greater risk. In the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Guandong, HIV is prevalent among sex workers and, according to the most recent statistics, I think 11 per cent of them are affected. Much is attributed to an alarming absence of information about the virus and other sexually transmitted diseases and to the low use of condoms. Clearly, unsafe drug injecting methods dramatically enhance risk, and in some countries— namely Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and the city of Manipur in India—50 per cent of users are HIV positive. This can be attributed to high rates of needle sharing and an alarming lack of available risk reduction and prevention services.</para><para>Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected region. It is home to 29.4 million people who are living with HIV-AIDS. In 2002 alone there were approximately 3½ million new infections and 2.4 million deaths. Ten million young people aged between 15 and 24 and three million children under the age of 15 have HIV-AIDS. These are staggering statistics and are hard for us to begin to comprehend when we are talking in millions. Women are particularly affected. In fact twice as many women than men acquire HIV-AIDS. This is attributed now to a variety of factors. Women of this region face discrimination with regard to access to education, health care and employment. As nations' economies crumble, they become particularly vulnerable. As a result, women often seek relationships with those who can provide them with essential financial and social security. Older men are generally more likely to be in a position to provide this, but they are also more likely to have HIV or AIDS. In addition, social expectations make it extremely difficult for women to demand safe sex practices or to leave relationships involving a high risk of infection from men. This, coupled with a lack of sufficient knowledge about sexual health, makes women particularly vulnerable to the epidemic. </para><para>In some countries the levels of the prevalence of the virus are staggering: in Botswana, 38.8 per cent of the population have HIV-AIDS; in Swaziland, 33.4 per cent; and in Zimbabwe, 33.7 per cent. A very small percentage of these people who require treatment actually receive it, and millions are without vital medicines to treat opportunistic infections. There is a disturbing absence of effective preventive treatment and care programs, and this is indicative of the ability of the global community to adequately respond to the magnitude of the AIDS-HIV epidemic.</para><para>There is, however, some cause for optimism, and the success of sexual education, prevention and treatment campaigns potentially serve as a prototype for a broader, expanded strategy. For instance, in South Africa in 2001 the HIV prevalence rates among pregnant women under the age of 20 fell, based on the 1998 statistics. A similar decline, apparently, has also been noted among young inner city women in Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia. Infection levels among women aged from 15 to 24 attending antenatal clinics fell by almost 10 per cent, from 24.2 in 1995 to 15.1 in 2001. However, these figures are not typical and have not been repeated throughout the country.</para><para>Although such results are positive, they should not be the cause for complacency. Modest successes are undermined by disturbing levels of growth in some nations. For example, in eight West and Central African countries HIV prevalence now hovers above five per cent. Furthermore, although there has been a decrease in HIV prevalence among young pregnant women in South Africa, there has been a significant rise among older pregnant women aged between 25 to 29, to just over 30 per cent—a staggering statistic. Clearly such a resurgence is cause for concern and underlines more than ever the importance of prevention campaigns.</para><para>This region faces enormous challenges in both sustaining and expanding successful prevention methods and in treating and supporting those millions living with HIV-AIDS and, of course, their families. This is a mammoth task. It is one that, clearly, cannot be undertaken without assistance. This is a global problem and therefore requires global attention. This epidemic also grips Latin America and the Caribbean. Approximately 1.9 million people from this region are living with HIV. Rising levels of HIV prevalence are believed to be attributed to unequal socioeconomic development and, as in many other regions of the world, socially marginalised sections of the community are particularly affected.</para><para>Finally, in the Middle East and North Africa a crisis is also taking hold with more than half a million people living with HIV-AIDS. Commonplace unsafe sex is something that needs to be addressed and in many countries the need for effective preventative and treatment methods is growing rapidly. In some nations ravaged by war and plagued with starvation, the epidemic renders traditional coping strategies useless. Weakened by AIDS, it becomes impossible for nations to cope with conflict and severe food shortages. This is particularly evident in southern Africa. This deadly combination so often evolves into a humanitarian crisis.</para><para>HIV and AIDS soon transform a food shortage into a food crisis as families and whole communities lose valuable labour and hence the ability to produce or afford food. This in turn leads to disrupted education, strained health systems, mass migration and increased sexual exploitation of women and children so desperate for money and food. Such factors all lead—it is a vicious cycle— to an increase in HIV-AIDS. For many, there is no escape from this cycle. There is clearly a nexus between desperate food emergencies and the HIV epidemics—we have seen that; it is very clear. In South Africa, for instance, a nation in the grip of a terrible drought, almost 15 million people were living with AIDS at the end of 2001. </para><para>Households and communities affected by HIV-AIDS see a dramatic depletion in their labour supplies and hence their finances. Sick adults are unable to work on the land. Women and children are often required to care for the sick—devoting less time to paid tasks—and therefore you see a slashing of the family's income. Farmers are, as a result, unable to afford pest control, weeding is neglected and the fields are left fallow. Many adjust their farming methods to cultivate less demanding crops, but profits are generally small with incomes severely restricted. In Kenya, the death of the head of the household is typically associated with transfer to smaller farms and hence a staggering 68 per cent reduction in the net value of farming outputs.</para><para>Women are severely disadvantaged generally—as I said—but particularly when there is a husband with an illness. A survey conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania showed that women are devoting 60 per cent less time to paid work—that is how much more time they are spending looking after the sick. Obviously the loss of a family member has unquantifiable repercussions for those left behind. Children who lose both parents lose the benefit of knowledge and skills traditionally passed on from one generation to the next. This means that many such children lack the knowledge regarding farming methods which are essential for survival. I do want to outline the good work that Oxfarm International—among other organisations—is doing in proposing a comprehensive plan for action addressing HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria in unison. The response from wealthy nations has been lukewarm. Australia has yet to contribute to that plan and only with this international support can this plan have any chance of success. I seek leave to incorporate the remaining paragraphs of my speech.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>The burden placed upon children is unimaginable, with many forced out of school to care for sick parents—others forced to look for employment to compensate for a lost wage. Some, along with women, even offer sex in exchange for money—so desperate is their situation.</para><para>In nations torn by conflict, war leads to physical/sexual abuse, displacement and destitution. An environment where AIDS/HIV thrives. The Rwanda experience provides an example of this.</para><para>Rape, aside from the severe psychological scars it inflicts, leads to an increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence among the civilian community as armed forces personnel are generally more likely to carry the virus.</para><para>Paradoxically, as the AIDS/HIV epidemic has been increasing, funding from wealthy nations has been decreasing. In 1998, for instance, funding given to Sub-Saharan Africa to assist 28 million people with the virus, was the equivalent of just $3 to $5 per infected person. This would barely purchase a cup of coffee, let alone provide treatment and medication.</para><para>There is an urgent need for action. As an international community it is essential that we come to terms with the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic.</para><para>There is a desperate need in many regions for preventative measures (including education regarding safe sex/safe drug injecting practices, and the provision of condoms), more effective treatment and care. Any such response must not simply address AIDS in isolation, but also tackle the factors such as food shortages and conflict (as I have identified) that so often compound the problem.</para><para>Long term strategies that boost livelihoods and save families from destruction must remain a priority.</para><para>As so many nations of the Western World experience heightened levels of nationalism and a belief in their independent sovereignty; obsessed with protecting borders, disregarding the United Nations... it is important that we stop and take pause... That we do not neglect fellow nations of the world. That we fulfil our International obligations. That we help those in need, where-ever they may reside.</para><para>I acknowledge the significant financial contribution the Commonwealth government has made to addressing this problem. I understand that in 2001 the government committed $1 million to the establishment of the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS and $9 million in 2002 to an initiative designed to combat HIV related harm resulting from drug use in South East Asia and Southern China. Funding for both these initiatives came from the Global AIDS/HIV initiative—a 6 year $200 million government program. However, having said, this there is still room to do more. </para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfall Train Tragedy</title><page.no>8251</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>8251</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Friday, 31 January, the 6.24 a.m. train left Central Station bound for Port Kembla. As we all know, it never arrived. At 7.14 a.m. just four kilometres past Waterfall on the edge of the Sutherland Shire, in the tranquil bush of the Royal National Park, the train was derailed in a horrific accident. Tragically, seven people were killed and 41 people were injured—some of those remain in hospital. Whilst we can try to imagine the horror that these passengers faced, it is impossible to truly understand what they experienced as their lives and indeed they were literally turned upside down in an instant.</para></talk.start><para>It is also difficult to imagine the trauma that family and friends went through after they first heard the news and waited throughout the day for news of whether their loved ones were still alive. I take this opportunity tonight to extend my profound sympathy to the family and friends of those who died in this accident last Friday. I also extend my best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who remain injured—as I said, some are quite seriously injured and are still in hospital.</para><para>In recent times in Australia we have had a series of tragedies involving loss of life which we have had to come to terms with. We have had the horrific events of Bali last year. We have had the devastating bushfires, particularly here in Canberra a couple of weeks ago. In this parliament today we remembered and gave our condolences to the victims of those fires. Similarly, this train tragedy has shocked and saddened us all, particularly those in Sydney and in the area where I live in the Sutherland Shire and the Illawarra.</para><para>I have spoken about this area in parliament on previous occasions. It is one of the more beautiful parts of Sydney, particularly the Royal National Park and the beaches. The shire, the south coast and Illawarra have enormous beauty. It is also an area that has faced tragedies before, particularly bushfires. We are familiar with the impact of bushfires as they occur nearly every year in that part of Sydney. We have had situations in the past where lives have been lost; so we understand and appreciate fully what the citizens of Canberra experienced just two weeks ago. Indeed, many personnel from our region were down here assisting in fighting those fires to save life and property.</para><para>What we also saw on earlier occasions, and what we saw again last Friday in Waterfall, was the magnificent dedication, professionalism and courage of our emergency services personnel and other authorities who responded so quickly to the disaster. The accident occurred in a part of the national park that is difficult to reach. There is no easy access, as I am sure people who have read the media reports have learned. Yet, within a matter of minutes once the alarm was raised and the reports started to filter in, police, firefighters, ambulance services and emergency rescue teams responded. No doubt, they probably saved lives through the assistance that they were able to provide as quickly.</para><para>Equally, stories of courage and assistance by passengers are being reported. Local newspapers such as the <inline font-style="italic">St George and Sutherland Shire Leader </inline>have reported on the acts of heroism of some of the people—of both passengers and the personnel who went to their assistance—on that morning. I would just mention one, although there are so many. Gareth Redshaw, a student from Caringbah, was on the train. He managed to free himself from the wreckage. He raced along the tracks and raised the alarm by dialling the emergency number. He then returned to the carriages and assisted and comforted an injured woman. He remained with her for four hours. He is just one of many people—many of whose names we do not know—who, despite their own predicament and their own injuries, helped others to safety.</para><para>The response from local services also was quick and professional. Police from the Sutherland and Miranda police centres were there within a few minutes. Officers and volunteers from bushfire services at Helensburgh and Engadine raced to the scene. Indeed I, along with all of the residents in that area of Engadine, heard constantly the wail of the fire brigade, ambulance, police and other rescue services vehicles as they raced up and down the Princes Highway. The emergency teams at local hospitals in Wollongong, Sutherland and St George along with those further into the city, such as Prince of Wales and others, were equally professional in providing treatment and comfort to the injured. </para><para>This tragedy occurred just five days after Australia Day. Australia Day is a day on which we celebrate the founding of European settlement in Sydney Cove, which subsequently led to the development of the modern Australian nation. Australia Day is a day on which the names of many Australians who are honoured with awards for service to their nation or to their community appear in newspapers. But the real people who deserve those awards are not the captains of industry, the politicians, the public servants, the High Court judges or even the sporting stars who seem to spend much of their time overseas. Rather, the people who deserve those awards are those who work in communities, either in their full-time employment or as volunteers, in emergency services—those who are called upon in events such as that in Waterfall last week to help their fellow citizens. They are called upon to provide aid in disasters such as that which occurred last Friday or, indeed, in Canberra just two weeks ago.</para><para>On Australia Day this year it was a day of celebration in the Sutherland Shire, like everywhere else. I attended a ceremony at Cronulla Beach. The fireworks had been cancelled, quite appropriately, out of respect for the fact that much of Australia—and certainly New South Wales—was faced with a terrible bushfire threat at that time. But it was still a very festive occasion. It was the annual `Opera in the Park' festival. It was attended by many thousands of local residents and visitors to the shire and the beaches of Cronulla. At the start of the festivities, a tribute was paid to those who lost their lives in Bali. A large video screen was there and a video was shown. Particular mention was made of the courage shown by a group of young men from the Garie Board Riders Club. Garie is a small beach in the Royal National Park just a few kilometres from Waterfall. I would like to quote from the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Leader</inline> newspaper regarding the tribute paid that evening on Australia Day:</para><quote><para>A moving segment marking the tragedy in Bali and honouring six local boys who formed a human rescue chain brought many people close to tears at the Australia Day <inline font-style="italic">Opera on the Beach</inline> at Cronulla on Sunday night.</para><para>Sutherland Shire mayor, Cr Phil Blight, made a special presentation to the six young members of the Garie Board Riders Club who helped rescue dozens of people from the burning Sari Club immediately after the bombings.</para><para>David McKay, Brett Russell, David Roberts, Luke Gordon, Robert Meredith and Andrew Miller were given plaques in recognition of their acts of bravery before a minute's silence was held in honour of the Bali victims.</para></quote><para>It is people like those young men of the Garie Board Riders Club and all of those others who came to the aid of the victims and the injured last Friday in Waterfall who truly deserve our recognition. Tomorrow I will be moving a notice of motion to that effect in this parliament and I ask all senators to support it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>8252</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>8252</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Firstly, I wish to pay tribute to space shuttle <inline font-style="italic">Columbia</inline> and her crew.

I would also like to associate myself with the tribute just paid by Senator Forshaw to the people involved in the Waterfall train crash and the tribute paid earlier by Senator Troeth to the firefighters.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight I rise to contribute to the debate on Iraq that took place in the chamber earlier. In doing so, I wish to take a slightly different approach from that of much of the discussion that carried through this afternoon. I wish to draw a parallel between Iraq and Vietnam. This is a parallel that the Democrats have already been drawing with very little subtlety and that the Labor Party have been trying to draw with a bit more timidity.</para><para>On Sunday, 26 January I attended and was a speaker at the Springvale Lunar New Year Festival in Victoria. The opposition leader Mr Simon Crean also attended and was the main speaker. After speaking briefly in tribute to the firefighters he spoke at some length on his opposition to Australia's position on Iraq, describing it as a potentially Vietnam-like mistake. At the time I thought his remarks were quite inappropriate on a festival occasion like that, but I suppose the presence of three metropolitan television station cameras and a number of reporters from the metropolitan press put too much pressure on him. It is ironic that Mr Crean chose to speak about Vietnam amongst the Indochinese communities in Springvale on such a festive occasion. </para><para>Indeed Vietnam was an important watershed in Australia's collective psyche. Very few of us who lived in Australia in the sixties and seventies were not touched by the memory of the street protests, the way the community was encouraged to force the government to change its position on our international commitment on Vietnam and the way the community's resolve to take a moral stance on the world's stage was tested. However, the real impact Vietnam had on Australia was not of our troops going to and sometimes dying in Vietnam but of the subsequent coming of Vietnamese refugees to Australia after the fall of South Vietnam. That event was made possible by a courageous political decision by the Fraser Liberal government— courageous because it was made not without political opposition, particularly from those people who stage-managed much of the protest, who regarded the Vietnamese refugee boat people as war criminals escaping from justice, which was easily proved to be a lie, and also particularly from the union movement, who saw it as leading to a likely reduction in Australian living standards. I remember a newspaper report of the then ACTU president Mr Bob Hawke threatening to take a delegation to Darwin to blockade the international airport when the first plane load of Vietnamese refugees were due to arrive in Australia. I cannot exactly recall whether he did go to Darwin, but I certainly vividly remember the newspaper report about his threatening to do so.</para><para>The coming of Vietnamese refugees to Australia gave an impetus to the development of productive diversity that is so much a character of Australia's multiculturalism. In a few years it advanced Australian multiculturalism way beyond what the original architects of multiculturalism ever hoped for. It tested and proved the Australian community's tolerance and acceptance of people of different backgrounds and cultures. It proved how these different cultures could work together to advance Australia's common interests—our economy, our social developments—and gave us the society that today we accept as commonplace and take as a matter of course. So Vietnam's loss was Australia's gain. But that does not justify why Vietnam should lose these people or why these Vietnamese people should leave their home and loved ones and endure the danger of the high seas of piracy and uncertainty to come to Australia to build a new life.</para><para>Let me take the chamber back one step. Let us consider why our experience in Vietnam was considered such a failure—a failure of foreign policy and a failure of judgment. It was considered a failure because it involved the conscription of 20-year-olds—at that time 20-year-olds could not vote as the voting age was 21. It was considered a failure because it was said that the South Vietnamese government was incompetent and corrupted. It was considered a failure because the allied strategies were said to be confused and the tactics blundering—we failed to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.</para><para>Senators would know that it is somewhat ironic talking about conscription for 20-year-olds when today 18-year-olds have the vote, and indeed it proves to be a passing concern. Sure, we can say that the South Vietnamese government at that time was probably incompetent and probably corrupt, but it was not the only government which was corrupt or incompetent. We in Australia have experienced some incompetent and corrupt governments, and we will probably continue to do so from time to time. The war was not conducted with a great deal of skill, but that is how war is sometimes conducted.</para><para>The important thing about South Vietnam, which a lot of people missed, was that it was a democracy. It was an imperfect democracy—as I said, it was incompetent and corrupt in some places—but nevertheless it was a working democracy. Elections were held and governments were changed peacefully as a result of those elections, although that only happened on one occasion because that is all the time they had. But they had a change and it was a democracy. As long as there is democracy people have a chance to change the government that they find incompetent or otherwise unacceptable. That is the nature of democracy. What Vietnam has had since 1975, after we withdrew and turned our backs on South Vietnam, is an undemocratic and despotic government. There have been no elections and there is no way of changing the government. There is no religious freedom. There is no liberty and no respect for human rights. That is what we have had in Vietnam for the last 25 or 26 years. </para><para>So our true failure in Vietnam was actually a failure of morality. It is not that we were immoral to be involved in Vietnam, but we lost morality when we gave way to irresoluteness and to those people in our own communities who put their own moral comfort above and ahead of our collective moral responsibility to the wider community to help our fellow human beings to improve their conditions. That was our failure in Vietnam. The lesson is that irresoluteness on our part leads to the betrayal of those people we should help. Today we Australians again face a challenge of this kind. We again face a challenge from some people in our community who would have us betray our fellow human beings who suffer at the hands of dictators and despots because it may cause them discomfort.</para><para>We have seen in the last few months the proliferation of Saddam Hussein protection associations right across Australia. People are sending out emails—I have received hundreds of emails and letters—and saying in newspapers: `No war. Think of the children of Iraq. No war.' Yes, let us think about the children of Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime. He has been in power for—what is it?—35 years, 25 years? Think of the children of Iraq over all that time.</para><para>Surely all of us have a responsibility to uphold justice and right wrongs wherever we find them and to whatever extent we are able. Surely avoiding pain to ourselves cannot be the primary consideration in whether we do the right thing by those people who are unable to help themselves and need our help. That is the moral challenge we face on this issue of Iraq and whether we should be involved. It is not a question of whether we are dominated by the United States and following their example but a question of what to do about the people of Iraq—how we can help them. We are not yet at war with Iraq. I, and I think all Australians, hope—as the Prime Minister said this afternoon—that we will not come to be at war, because none of us wish for war. We hope that, if any action is to be taken against Saddam Hussein, we do it with a new United Nations resolution and we do it together with the world community.</para><para>Let me make two points. Firstly, it takes two to make peace. It takes Saddam Hussein's compliance with United Nations instructions. It is not about the rest of the world wanting a war with Iraq or Saddam Hussein but about whether Saddam Hussein is prepared to comply with United Nations instructions and the wish of the rest of the world to avoid war. That is the first issue. Secondly, we would prefer to have a new UN resolution, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon, which sets out in unambiguous terms what Saddam Hussein must do and what we will do. However, I draw your attention to the fact that a newresolution is in fact not necessary. Under resolution 1441, Saddam Hussein is required to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors and to demonstrate that he has destroyed his stock of weapons of mass destruction. Failing that, the UN and the rest of the world are able to take action against him. That is an important point.</para><para>Given this situation, it is important that Mr Crean makes his own position clear. He is the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian parliament, so he is the alternative Prime Minister. He is not a heartbeat away from the prime ministership in our democratic system, but he is the alternative leader of choice in an election. He needs to come clean on exactly where he stands on this issue. Australians deserve to know, firstly, where Mr Crean and the Labor Party stand on the US alliance. Mr Crean can skirt around this issue but sooner or later he has to answer that question. The Australian people expect it. Secondly, he must come clean on his position on Saddam Hussein and the oppressed Iraqi people. Would he let this man,the Butcher of Baghdad, stay in power because it is too much trouble to get rid of him? Would he let Hussein stay and dominate and oppress the Iraqi people and their neighbours because they are too far away? That is hardly a moral position. It may be a comfortable position for the Greens and the Democrats to adopt, but for someone who is the alternative Prime Minister he has to prove he is not simply a pretender. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.17 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>8256</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Government Policy</title><page.no>8256</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 304)</subtitle><id.no>304</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8256</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many people are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to allow voluntary contributions to superannuation beyond 70 to age 75 in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond.</para><para>(2)	How many people are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to reduce the tax rate on excessive Eligible Termination Payments in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond.</para><para>(3)	(a) How many people are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to increase the deduction limit for the self-employed in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond; and (b) how many of these people fall into the income ranges of: (i) $0-$9,999, (ii) $10,000-$19,999, (iii) $20,000-$29,999 (iv) $30,000-$39,999, (v) $40,000-$49,999, (vi) $50,000-$59,999, (vii) $60,000-$69,999, and (viii) $70,000 plus.</para><para>(4)	(a) How many people are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to allow splitting of superannuation contributions in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond; and (b) how many of these people fall into the income ranges of: (i) $0-$9,999, (ii) $10,000-$19,999, (iii) $20,000-$29,999, (iv) $30,000-$39,999, (v) $40,000-$49,999, (vi) $50,000-$59,999, (vii) $60,000-$69,999, and (viii) $70,000 plus.</para><para>(5)	(a) How many people are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to reduce the rate of the surcharge contributions tax in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond; and (b) how many of these people fall into the income ranges of: (i) $80,000-$89,999, (ii) $90,000-$99,999 (iii) $100,000-$109,999, (iv) $110,000-$149,999, (v) $150,000-$249,999, (vi) $250,000-$499,999, (vii) $500,000-$999,999, and (viii) $1 million plus.</para><para>(6)	(a) How many people (in terms of those who are making the contributions and those who receive them) are expected to benefit from the Government's election promise to allow superannuation contributions for children in the first year of its operation and for the 3 years beyond; and (b) how many of these people fall into the income ranges of: (i) $0-$9,999, (ii) $10,000-19,999, (iii) $20,000-$29,999, (iv) $30,000-$39,999, (v) $40,000-$49,999, (vi) $50,000-$59,999, (vii) $60,000-$69,999, (viii) $70,000-$79,999, (ix) $80,000-$89,999, (x) $90,000-$99,000, (xi) $100,000-$109,999, (xii) $110,000-$149,999, (xiii) $150,000-$249,000, (xiv) $250,000-$499,999, (xv) $500,000-$999,999, and (xvi) $1 million plus.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8256</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) to (6)	The rationale and costings underlying the Coalition election commitments referred to in the question were outlined in election policy documents.

Because of its large size, diversity and uniqueness, the Great Barrier Reef is an internationally significant ecological resource. As a consequence, it has World Heritage status.</para><para>The management of fish stocks in the GBRMP and World Heritage Area (WHA) is the responsibility of Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), in keeping with its responsibility to protect the natural resources of the GBRMP whilst providing for reasonable use of the Great Barrier Reef Region, contributes to the management of fishing primarily through the use of management zones that restrict certain fishing activities in specific areas.</para><para>The East Coast Trawl Fishery is Queensland's largest commercial fishery in terms of number of operators, level and value of production, and area. The fishery targets prawns, scallops, bugs and squid, with a wide range of other species taken incidentally. Some 170,890 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (about 50%) is open to trawling and, historically, about 70% of the effort in the fishery has occurred in the Marine Park.</para><para>A recent major research program (1991-1996) on the impacts of trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park commissioned by GBRMPA and undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries found that trawling has major impacts on the seabed. The study found that for every tonne of prawns taken by a trawler, 6-10 tonnes of bycatch is taken, most of which is discarded. Each pass of a trawl net along the seabed removes 5-25% of seabed life. The impact is cumulative, with 13 passes of a trawl net removing 70-90% of seabed life. The study clearly demonstrated that trawling has a significant adverse impact on marine, particularly seabed, ecosystems and is in line with the findings of similar studies on the impacts of bottom trawling undertaken in other parts of the world. </para><para>Following extensive negotiations between the Commonwealth, Queensland and industry, Queensland recently introduced revised management arrangements for the East Coast Trawl Fishery, which made significant improvements to the management of the fishery. These changes included the capping of fishing effort; a reduction in effort of 10.86% via a structural adjustment scheme funded jointly by the Commonwealth and State governments; a further 5% across-the-board effort reduction by industry; the introduction of tradable effort units; effort unit penalties upon trading to compensate for increases in effort due to improvements in technology; the introduction of a satellite-based vessel monitoring system; the closure of areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park where trawling historically had not occurred in order to prevent expansion of the fishery; and the introduction of turtle excluder devices and bycatch reduction devices in trawl nets used in the Marine Park.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What is the problem being addressed?</inline></para><para>The issue addressed by the proposed Regulation is the elimination of repeated and extensive fish kills in the Mission Beach area (northern Queensland) as a result of discarded bycatch from trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow (up to 10m deep), inshore waters.</para><para>Such fish kills have occurred at regular intervals since trawling became common in the Mission Beach area in the 1970s. On one occasion in the 1980s, so many fish were washed up on local beaches that a local Shire grader was used to bury the discards. Residents have noticed changes in the abundance and variety of fish off Mission Beach since trawling began.</para><para>As a recent example, in May 2001, dead fish were found along a 10km-stretch of local beaches. In addition, a slick of dead fish 600m-1km wide and 3.5-4km long was recorded 2km offshore by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The density of dead fish in the slick varied, but in some places was as high as 40-50 fish per square metre. The dead fish included dollarfish (Family Leiognathidae), trevally (Carangidae), grunter (Haemulidae), silver jewfish (Sciaenidae), stripies and fingermark bream (Lutjanidae). Such occurrences are unacceptable as part of any fishery that purports to be ecologically sustainable, all the more so if the fishery occurs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and a World Heritage Area, in a prime tourism and recreational region.</para><para>Apart from the ecological impacts, such extensive fish kills caused by trawling have an impact on recreational amenity, tourism businesses and the Commonwealth's reputation as the guardian of a World Heritage Area. The value of tourism to the Queensland economy, in terms of jobs and income, is substantial. Most tourists who visit Queensland come to see one of the natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef. The occurrence of dead fish on beaches and floating on the water are not the images that domestic and international tourists expect to take home after visiting the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What are the objectives of Government action?</inline></para><para>To prevent the occurrence of extensive fish kills caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach, which in turn will:</para><para>(1)	protect biodiversity and conserve the natural resources of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as required under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975;</para><para>(2)	reduce the impact on the recreational amenity of a major tourism area; and</para><para>(3)	satisfy the Commonwealth's stewardship obligations for a World Heritage site.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Which options for dealing with the problem were considered?</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Option 1 - The status quo</inline></para><para>Recent changes in management arrangements for the East Coast Trawl Fishery under Queensland fisheries legislation have not addressed the issue of dead fish on beaches in the Mission Beach area caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters. The mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices in trawlers operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has not solved the problem. Indeed, the on-going occurrence of extensive fish kills as a result of trawl discards in the Mission Beach area points to the inadequacy of such devices in significantly reducing fish bycatch in inshore trawl fisheries.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Option 2 - Industry Self Regulation</inline></para><para>A voluntary code of conduct, introduced by local trawler operators in an attempt to address the problem, has proved ineffective. Any trawler operator with a T1 endorsement in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery can trawl in the area and can choose to adopt or ignore any local codes of conduct.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Option 3 - Proposed new Regulations</inline></para><para>To prevent the occurrence of fish kills caused by trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach, it is proposed that a new Regulation be introduced to prohibit trawling in shallow, inshore waters in the area.</para><para>The proposed trawl closure (see map) covers an area of about 400 square kilometres. It incorporates some existing Great Barrier Reef Marine Park zones in which trawling is prohibited already; these zones collectively make up some 130 square kilometres. In addition, some 16 square kilometres in the proposed trawl closure are closed to trawling under Queensland fisheries legislation. Consequently, the area in the proposed closure that will be closed to trawling for the first time is 254 square kilometres or about a seventh of 1% of the 170,890 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park currently open to trawling. </para><para>Although there is broad agreement on the need for a trawl closure, the extent of the closure was the subject of intense debate and involved consideration of closures proposed by the two community-based, local marine advisory committees (LMACs) at Mission Beach and Hinchinbrook, a proposal submitted by the Queensland Seafood Industry Association and the recommendation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).</para><para>The Mission Beach LMAC proposal included all of Rockingham Bay, located immediately to the south of the proposed trawl closure. The Hinchinbrook LMAC supported the Mission Beach LMAC's proposed trawl closure north of Dunk Island, but proposed an alternative closure boundary running about 4km offshore in Rockingham Bay, immediately north of Hinchinbrook Island. The Hinchinbrook LMAC's rationale for its proposed closure boundary in Rockingham Bay was that trawling for banana prawns in inshore areas is the primary cause of the fish kills and that the Mission Beach LMAC's proposal would cause unnecessary hardship to trawler operators targeting tiger prawns in deeper, offshore waters. However, the Hinchinbrook LMAC's proposal does not include all the shallow areas in Rockingham Bay. Under its proposal, some areas of shallow water would still be open to trawling.</para><para>The Queensland Seafood Industry Association proposed a much smaller closure than those proposed by the LMACs.</para><para>The closure recommended by the GBRMPA was a compromise between the closures proposed by the two community-based LMACs at Mission Beach and Hinchinbrook. The GBRMPA proposal took into account the bathymetry of the area. Under this option, the area closed to trawling for the first time would have been some 610 square kilometres. It included all shallow inshore waters in Rockingham Bay, but excluded from the closure most of the deeper waters in which tiger prawns occur. Banana prawns typically are caught in shallow, inshore waters to a depth of about 10m, whereas tiger prawns typically are taken at depths of 10-25m. The GBRMPA recommendation was based on achieving the best environmental outcomes by protecting inshore habitat, particularly sea grass beds and dugong habitat, and minimising the potential for fish kills caused by trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow inshore waters, while at the same time enabling trawlers to continue to target tiger prawns in deeper offshore waters. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Who is likely to be affected?</inline></para><para>The primary benefit of the proposed Regulation is greater protection of the natural resources and biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area for the Australian and world community.</para><para>This has major flow-on benefits to recreational users of the area and the tourism industry, which is focused on providing visitors with an experience of the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area, and contributes substantially to the Queensland and Australian economies.</para><para>The value of tourism to the Queensland economy, in terms of jobs and income, is substantial. According to Tourism Queensland, tourism contributes over $6 billion annually to the Queensland economy, $2.4 billion of which is in export earnings, and employs almost 150,000 people.</para><para>A study of the economic and financial values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park carried out by KPMG Consulting estimated that in recent years (1993/94-1997/98), the gross, annual, financial value of direct commercial tourism use of the Marine Park ranged from $411 million to $507 million. During the same period, the gross, annual, financial value of direct recreational fishing and boating use of the Marine Park was estimated to range from $108 million to $120 million. In comparison, during the same period, the gross, annual, financial value of direct commercial fishing in the Marine Park ranged from $121 million to $149 million. Thus, the combined gross, annual, financial values of direct tourism and recreational fishing and boating use of the Marine Park is more than four times the gross, annual, financial values of direct commercial fishing.</para><para>The above estimates of the financial values of the direct uses of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park do not include consideration of the flow-on impacts or the effects of linkages of these activities with other industries in the Queensland economy. KPMG Consulting extended the direct contribution analysis and considered the indirect or flow-on effects of these activities in terms of output and employment. For the 1994-95 financial year, the total output effects of tourism and recreational boating and fishing ($1,099,300 million) were 5.7 times greater than those for commercial fishing ($193,900 million). Similarly, for the 1994-95 financial year, the total employment effects of tourism and recreational boating and fishing ($14,896 million) were 5.5 times greater than those for commercial fishing ($2,720 million).</para><para>The KPMG study clearly demonstrates that tourism and recreational boating and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are worth substantially more to the economy than commercial fishing in the Marine Park both in terms of direct financial value and flow-on effects. Furthermore, tourism and recreational boating and fishing have substantially less impact on the environment than bottom trawling. </para><para>The Queensland East Coast Trawl fleet is characterised by a high degree of mobility. Most trawlers involved in the fishery operate in several areas and travel extensive distances while doing so. This characteristic is thought to be a response to the seasonal nature of the various species taken in the fishery. All trawler operators with a T1 endorsement can trawl throughout the Queensland East Coast from the tip of Cape York to the Queensland/New South Wales border. The proposed closure will impact on those trawler operators who target banana prawns in the shallow inshore waters off Mission Beach. However, the proposed closure is very small compared with the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in which trawlers can operate.</para><para>The banana prawn catch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery is extremely variable (depending on climatic conditions), varying between 300 and 1100 tonnes per year. Typically, banana prawns make up about 6% of the annual catch in the fishery, with 75% of the banana prawns taken south of Ingham, i.e. in areas south of the proposed closure. Tiger prawns are also taken in the Mission Beach area, usually in deeper offshore waters. The main season for banana prawns is March-May, whereas for tiger prawns it is March-August. Most banana prawns are sold on the domestic market, while most tiger prawns are exported. Current prices paid to fishers by a processor in Mackay, central Queensland, are $14-15 per kg for banana prawns and $19 per kg for tiger prawns. </para><para>The proposed Mission Beach trawl closure extends across two 30-minute, logbook-recording grids (I18 and I19 of Queensland East Coast trawler operators' logbooks). The average recorded catch over the period 1995-2000 for these two grids was 51 tonnes of banana prawns and 108 tonnes of tiger prawns per year. Given existing trawl exclusion zones in these grids, there are about 4000 square kilometres available to trawling. The trawl grounds to be closed under the proposed Mission Beach closure make up about 10% of this area. Trawler operators will be prevented from taking prawns in the shallow water off Mission Beach. Some of the tiger prawn grounds off Mission Beach will be included in the proposed closure, but most of the tiger prawn grounds will remain outside the proposed closure. Since tiger prawns move between the two areas, trawler operators will still be able to access tiger prawns in the offshore grounds.</para><para>Under the GBRMPA recommendation, most of Rockingham Bay immediately to the south of the proposed Mission Beach trawl closure would also have been closed to trawling, thereby preventing access by trawler operators to the banana prawn grounds in the shallow, inshore waters of the Bay. Trawler operators would also have been prevented from accessing some of the tiger prawn grounds in the deeper waters of Rockingham Bay. </para><para>The average number of trawlers that reported operating in logbook grids I18 and I19 from 1995 to 2000 was 233. Some trawlers targeted banana prawns only, some targeted tiger prawns only, and others reported catching both tiger prawns and banana prawns:

The study was undertaken between August 1999 and April 2000, so its findings can be related to the logbook data for 1999 and 2000.</para><para>The analysis was based on questionnaires filled in by 1008 commercial fishers, representing 41.2% of all commercial fishers. Of the respondents, 106 said that they fished in the area that is to be covered by the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay area. Of these, 88 were classified as “roamers” (i.e. they did not live in the area, but fished in the area) and between 62 and 82 per month reported trawling in the area; the remaining 20 said they were “localisers” (i.e. lived in the area and worked in the area) and between 3 and 6 per month reported trawling in the area.</para><para>Given that the study was based on 41.2% of commercial fishers, then multiplying by 2.4 would gives a rough estimate of the behaviour of all fishers. On this basis, only about 7 - 14 trawler operators, who live and work in the area, actually work the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay closure area each month. On the other hand, 149 - 197 trawler operators, who live outside the area but work part of the time in the area, work in the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay area each month. These figures appear close to the mark because the total number of trawlers that reported in their log books that they operated in grids I18 and I19 in 1999 and 2000 (the period covered by the study) was 222 and 206 respectively. Since this study was undertaken, some 240 vessels have been removed from Queensland East Coast trawl fleet (see below), so the number of trawler operators impacted by the closure will be correspondingly less.</para><para>Recent reform of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery has reduced effort in the fishery by some 15% (10% via a structural adjustment scheme, to which the Commonwealth and Queensland governments each contributed $10m). In 1999, there were 750 trawlers operating the East Coast Trawl Fishery. As a result of the government-funded licence buyback scheme and other mechanisms in the trawl fishery management plan, there are now some 240 trawlers less operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park than there were two years ago.  </para><para>In essence, today, there are fewer trawlers operating in the East Coast Trawl Fishery and fewer days spent trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park than there were two years ago. Furthermore, to address the issue of effort creep due to improvements in technology and fishing practices (estimated to be about 3% per year), penalties on effort units are imposed on transfers of licences, transfers of effort units and replacement of fishing vessels. Given that the proposed closure is so small compared to the remaining trawl grounds and that effort in the fishery has been substantially reduced in the past two years, it is unlikely that the proposed closure will cause any significant increase in effort in other areas.</para><para>As far as the consumers of local seafood are concerned, any shortfall in the overall catch of banana prawns in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery can be more than made up by the production of banana prawns in aquaculture. Banana prawns are now well established in the Queensland aquaculture industry to the extent that aquaculture production of banana prawns in 2000-01 exceeded the wild catch of banana prawns in the East Coast Trawl Fishery for the same period. Aquaculture production is likely to increase substantially over the next decade. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Aquaculture) were introduced in February 2000 to ensure that aquaculture developments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are undertaken in an ecologically sustainable manner.</para><para>The inshore area off Mission Beach is a source of broodstock for the leader (black tiger) prawn aquaculture industry in Australia. Leader prawns are not common along the Queensland east coast, but are taken in banana prawn catches in shallow water close to shore. Each mature female leader prawn is capable of producing 250,000-400,000 offspring. Australian prawn hatcheries require 3000-5000 broodstock per year, with 1500 broodstock on average collected each year in the Mission Beach area. In general, trawl operators have not entered the leader prawn broodstock market because most prawns caught by trawling are dead by the time they are sorted from the catch. According to the Australian Prawn Farmers' Association, local prawn hatcheries are finding it difficult to obtain broodstock because most of the estimated 100,000 leader prawns caught each year in the Queensland trawl fishery are usually mixed with banana prawns and sold dead, either fresh or frozen. However, many broodstock leader prawns caught off the Queensland coast are sold overseas where they command a much higher price than locally. Some sources say that as much as 85% of the broodstock leader prawns taken along the Queensland coast is exported. The proposed regulation provides for the issuing of up to five permissions (from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority) for the collection of live leader prawns in the Mission Beach trawl closure for aquaculture broodstock so that the Australian aquaculture industry is not impacted by the proposed trawl closure. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Consultation</inline></para><para>There has been extensive consultation on the proposed trawl closure at a local level.</para><para>A trawl closure was recommended by the two, local, community-based groups established by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to advise it on local marine issues. These LMACs are representative of their local communities and typically comprise commercial fishing interests, recreational fishing interests, charter boat/fishing guides, recreational boating/yachting interests, conservation interests, Aboriginal interests, tourism interests, local government authorities, progress associations, local user groups involved in the management of natural resources and others who can demonstrate a separate significant stakeholder interest in marine resource matters in the region. Representatives of the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency (including the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries also attend meetings of these committees.</para><para>The proposed trawl closure was discussed at Queensland's Trawl Management Advisory Committee (established to provide advice to the Queensland Fisheries Service on the management of Queensland's trawl fisheries) and at the GBRMPA's Fisheries Reef Advisory Committee (established to provide advice to the Authority on fisheries issues, particularly in relation to auditing fisheries in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development).</para><para>The proposed trawl closure was discussed with local trawler operators at a meeting in Innisfail, at which fishing industry representatives from Cairns and Townsville also were present, and at a meeting between the GBRMPA, LMAC representatives, fishing industry representatives and the local State Member of Parliament. </para><para>Before the decision on the extent of the proposed trawl closure was finalised, extensive discussions were held between the GBRMPA, the Queensland Seafood Industry Association and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. </para><para>In summary, the local communities in the Mission Beach area support a trawl closure, as do recreational fishers, the tourism industry and conservation groups. Commercial fishers are concerned about any loss of access to local trawl grounds.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion and adopted option</inline></para><para>To help safeguard the natural resources of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area and, at the same time, reduce the adverse impacts on the recreational amenity in a prime tourism area, the on-going and extensive fish kills in the Mission Beach area caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters must be prevented.</para><para>It is recommended that trawling be prohibited in the shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach.</para><para>Given the high mobility of the Queensland East Coast trawl fleet, those trawler operators who historically have targeted banana prawns in the shallow inshore waters off Mission Beach and who will be directly impacted by the adopted option will still be able to target banana prawns in most of Rockingham Bay immediately to the south of the proposed closure and continue to operate in other parts of the trawl fishery.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Implementation and review</inline></para><para>The proposed Regulation will be introduced under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975.</para><para>Any fines imposed as a result of the proposed Regulations will be by a court of competent jurisdiction. A person against whom a fine is imposed will be able to appeal if the requirements of the relevant court are satisfied.</para><para>As agreed at the 28th Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will audit the performance of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery on an annual basis to determine if it achieves its objective of ecological sustainability within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. In carrying out the audit, the Authority will apply the National Fisheries Assessment Guidelines developed by Environment Australia. The proposed regulation will be reviewed as part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's audit of the trawl fishery.</para><para>The impact of the proposed trawl closure will be monitored closely. If extensions to the closure are needed to avoid on-going problems of fish kills, then extensions to the proposed closure will be considered.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: Consultants</title><page.no>8264</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 576)</subtitle><id.no>576</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8264</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 23 August 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What sum has the department spent on consultants in each of the following financial years: (a) 1999-2000; (b) 2000-01; (c) 2001-02; and (d) 2002-03.</para><para>(2)	For each consultancy: (a) what was the name of the consultant employed; (b) what was the cost; (c) what was the purpose; (d) what was the period during which the consultant was engaged; (e) what role did the Minister and/or his office have in the engagement of the consultant; and (f) was the consultancy subject to a tender process; if not, why not; if so, was it an open tender or a select tender.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8264</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spent on consultants in each of the following financial years:

As a result the estimated level of savings for this measure is dependent upon the timing and passage of the legislation.  </para><para>Legislation for another five measures (numbers 2, 3, 5, 9 and 13) was amended at the time of passage of legislation thus reducing the level of savings for each measure, and in one instance, `Further simplification of the Social Security Act' (number 13) became an expenditure measure. The revised figures for measures where the level of savings was amended is shown on the table in part (1) (a) above.</para><para>Savings have been achieved for five of the measures, `Align invalidity service pension assessments', `Change the date of effect for grants and variations to compensation payments' and `Improving the use of cholesterol lowering medicines on the PBS', and the two relating to the Output Pricing Review (numbers 2, 9, 14, 15 and 18). The quantification of the level of savings from two other measures `Home Support - extend the HomeFront initiative' and `Managing Health Care Information' will be available later this financial year (numbers 4 and 8). Savings from the measure `Veterans' Home Care' (number 7) is the subject of a report to Cabinet and as such cannot be published at this time.</para><para>Five of the measures (numbers 6, 7.1, 10, 16 and 17) were initiatives of the Health and Ageing portfolio and the Department of Health and Ageing is responsible for the monitoring of savings for those measures.1. The full implementation of number 11 was delayed and as a result the realisation of savings was delayed. The Health and Ageing portfolio will carry out an evaluation of savings in the next year.</para><para>Although `Enhance Debt Recovery' commenced realising savings in 2001-02, it is too early in the operation of the measure to undertake an evaluation of the level of savings achieved (number 3). A further five measures are being implemented this financial year and an evaluation at this stage is not practicable (numbers 20-24), and two are not scheduled to realise savings until 2003-04 and 2005-06 respectively (numbers 15 and 5). Implementation of, and therefore savings relating to, number 19 was delayed.</para><para>One measure has not achieved the savings estimated. This is number 12 `Revised means test treatment of private trusts and private companies'. Savings of $1.8m were achieved in 2001-02 (against $2.6m estimated), and it is estimated that $3.7m will be achieved in 2002-03 (against $8.8m estimated). This measure was an initiative of the Department of Family and Community Services and encompassed the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Experience has shown that service pensioners have a different level of participation in private trusts and companies than age pensioners, thus the level of savings was lower than expected. </para><para>(2)	For the measure `Revised means test treatment of private trusts and private companies' where savings are lower than estimated, the service pension estimates were adjusted to take account of the difference.</para><para>1. The impact of these measures on the Veterans' Affairs portfolio should be considered in context of the entire measure. As an example, the impact on Health and Ageing of numbers 7.1 and 10 is:</para><para>number 7.1:

The Ministers for Trade, Foreign Affairs, and Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry meet on a regular basis and frequently discuss agriculture trade issues, which are a high priority for the Government. The Government's approach to reform of the EU's sugar regime comprises a combination of bilateral pressure on the EU and continued pressure through the WTO.</para><para>Negotiations to liberalise trade in agriculture under the WTO offer the prospect of reducing subsidised competition and creating more open markets for agricultural products, including sugar. An econometric study by ABARE in 1999 concluded that multilateral sugar trade reform would lift world raw sugar prices by over 40 per cent, resulting in savings to US, EU and Japanese consumers of $4.8 billion annually. A multilateral coalition of sugar producers has formed to advocate reform, and WTO coalitions like the Cairns Group are arguing for reform in the current Doha round of negotiations. Given the interest of the majority of the WTO membership in agricultural trade reform, sugar trade reform is essential if global trade negotiations are to succeed.</para><para>The Australian Government approach to agricultural reform through the WTO has received the support of the domestic agricultural industry, from organisations such as Cairns Group Farm Leaders (chaired by the National Farmers Federation) and from the Global Alliance for Sugar Trade Reform and Liberalisation (chaired by Queensland Sugar Limited).</para><para>Australia is also exercising its rights under the WTO to start dispute settlement consultations with the EU over its sugar regime. The aim of taking the EU through the WTO disputes process is to force changes to the EC sugar regime to benefit Australian producers and establish additional leverage in the Doha negotiations. It is important to note that it could take up to two-three years for this dispute process to run its course and the benefits may not be readily quantifiable.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Quarantine: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title><page.no>8373</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 798)</subtitle><id.no>798</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8373</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 15 October 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) staff directly involved in the procedures of X-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage were posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002. </para><para>(2) 	How many AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of X-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage were posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para><para>(3)	How many passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002.</para><para>(4)	How many passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para><para>(5)	What percentage of passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined of by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002.</para><para>(6)	What percentage of passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined of by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8374</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The number of AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of x-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of June, July, August and September 2002 was 314 per week. </para><para>(2)	The number of AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of x-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of June, July, August and September 2001 was:

For each industry the costs for sampling &amp; testing and administration are presented separately. Figures for successive years can be compared to determine the level of increase or decrease.</para><para>(b)	It is not possible to predict accurately the changes in costs to each industry for financial year 2003-04. Salary costs may increase under a new certified agreement to commence on 1 July 2003. As a guide only, salary increases in the past five years have ranged from 2% to 4% per annum. Laboratory analytical costs may decrease for some programs as sample numbers decline under the influence of the drought, but this could be offset by an increased cost per sample if contracted laboratories choose to renegotiate their contracts. Management Services charges, and the model by which these are attributed across AFFA business units, will be tested for equity and robustness during the next few months and this process may result in changes to the charges to industry. All other costs for goods and services could be expected to increase by approximately 3%, though freight costs will depend largely on the price of fuel which could be more volatile than general costs. </para><para>(2)	(a)	Over the period 1998-99 to 2001-02 the NRS faced a number of cost increases that were recovered from all participating industries. </para><para>In 1998-99 staff salaries increased 4%.</para><para>In 1999-2000 AFFA outsourced information technology service provision with a resultant doubling of the cost to the NRS. Staff salaries rose 2%.</para><para>In 2000-01 costs increased for a number of industries as a new charging system was introduced by the Levies Revenue Service. Staff salaries increased by 3%. The failure of one laboratory providing antimicrobial testing and the subsequent transfer of this contract to another laboratory significantly increased analytical charges to meat and animal product industries and this increase carried through to 2001-02. An EU audit found the Central Receival and Despatch facility required improved security and so a new facility was constructed at Barton. Construction costs were $145, recovered over a seven-year period, and annual rental increased by $40,000. The costs of laboratory analyses increased under a new 2-year contract.</para><para>In 2001-02 charges for collection of grains and horticulture samples were transferred to the NRS as State officials took over that service previously provided by AQIS and directly cost-recovered by them from industry. A new database management system was implemented at a cost of $503,000 recovered from industry over a 5-year period. The collapse of Ansett Airlines resulted in a doubling in freight costs. Staff salaries increased 3%. </para><para>In 2002-03 charges for AFFA management services increased by $332,000. Staff salaries increased 4%. The cost of laboratory services increased under new 2-year contracts.</para><para>Throughout the period costs have increased for the provision of laboratory proficiency testing as the range of tests and required level of accuracy have increased.</para><para>(b)	The NRS derives revenue from industry either by statutory levies on producers or by direct transfer from industry bodies. Industry funds in the NRS reserve that are surplus to immediate requirement are invested and the interest generated is credited to each industry according to their equity in the reserve. Laboratory analysis costs, and any increases in those costs, incurred on behalf of each industry are charged to industry. Other costs such as staff salaries are charged to industry on the basis of a cost-attribution model calculated on the number of samples for that program relative to the total number of samples across all programs. Minor adjustments to this model have been made to ensure equitable attribution across programs.</para><para>(c)	The NRS has a number of formal and informal consultation mechanisms with industry through which any changes in program costs are presented and discussed. For some industries there are formal advisory or consultative groups such as: the NRS Beef Industry Advisory Committee, SAFEMEAT, and the Seafood Export Consultative Committee (NRS Working Group). For all industries, NRS program managers consult with peak industry body executive officers on a regular basis, and make presentations to council and annual general meetings when requested by industry. In 2002-03 all industries are receiving quarterly operational and financial reports for their programs.</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black"

Irrigators can however gain access on a commercial basis with Snowy Hydro to water in the Snowy that is additional to guaranteed annual minimum releases from the Snowy scheme.

This work is ongoing but Commission discussions to date have resulted in agreement to share projected shortfalls in water supply between South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria this season; a review of operating policies and strategies minimising impacts on water supplies; and agreement to a NSW request for an advance of up to 160 GL from the Snowy Scheme for Murray Irrigation Limited for delivery in the later part of the irrigation season. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Air Traffic Controlers</title><page.no>8420</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 833)</subtitle><id.no>833</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8420</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 1 November 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What action has the Australian Air Force taken to address the significant shortfall of air traffic controllers that existed on 1 July 2001. </para><para>(2)	How many air traffic controllers have been newly recruited to the Australian Air Force since 1 July 2001.</para><para>(3)	How many air traffic controllers have separated from the Australian Air Force since 1 July 2001 (can the information on separations be broken down to show the length of service of those personnel that separated from the Air Force).</para><para>(4)	Does the Australian Air Force conduct exit surveys as a means of determining why personnel with specialist skills are separating from the Air Force.

In addition to this training, some highly specialist roles such as scientific analysis personnel will receive training from civilian institutions as an initial competency baseline. Enhancement of these skills will occur through employment and research within the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. These individual skills obtained by specialist personnel are employed within an operational context through troop, squadron and regimental training activities conducted within the unit and conducted in coordination with other emergency management and Defence agencies. Activities involving other agencies may include collective workshops with like response agencies such as police explosive ordnance disposal units or state fire hazardous materials units. These activities are aimed at exchanging information and ensuring coherency in procedures and responses at all levels. (a) In respect to the training programs, individual skills development and program is developed within Army. The collective training program is a collaborative process between the Attorney-General's Department and Defence. This collaborative training program is continually being refined to address developing threats. (b) Yes. (c) (i) The training of personnel to support counter terrorism operations conducted by the ADF Tactical Assault Groups. (ii) The training of personnel to support forces deployed on operations. This includes an ability to conduct reconnaissance of contaminated areas, detection of agents, monitoring for the release of agents, battle damage assessments, decontamination and the provision of advice to senior commanders on the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) threats.

Work on elements of the Strategy is being undertaken by officials out of session, with further formal talks currently scheduled to take place in the first half of 2003.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Dairy Industry</title><page.no>8434</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 869)</subtitle><id.no>869</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8434</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 7 November 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What role did the department have in the development of: (a) the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy; and (b) the Regional Action Plan.</para><para>(2)	Which stakeholders were involved in the development of: (a) the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy; and (b) the Regional Action Plan.</para><para>(3)	When were the following finalised: (a) the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy; and (b) the Regional Action Plan.</para><para>(4)	Can copies of the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy Regional Action Plan be provided; if not, why not.</para><para>(5)	Has the implementation of measures commenced under (a) the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy; and (b) the Regional Action Plan.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8434</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (AFFA) did not have a direct role in the development of the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy and the associated Regional Action Plans. An AFFA program, the National Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA), which is funded from the Natural Heritage Trust, initiated a project entitled “Sustaining our Natural Resources - Dairying for Tomorrow” with the Dairy Research and Development Corporation (DRDC). This work was undertaken as part of the Audit's Theme 5 (productivity and sustainability) and was also linked to the Audit's Theme 6 (capacity for change). The aim of the project was to review the environmental sustainability of dairy farm practices and develop plans for continual improvement in resource management. As a result of this work the National Dairy Sustainability Strategy “Dairying for Tomorrow” - a national plan for the dairying industry to work with government and community partners to sustain its natural resources and the eight Regional Action Plans (RAP) were jointly developed by the DRDC, the NLWRA and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation (ADFF). </para><para>(2)	The National Dairy Sustainability strategy is a partnership between the Commonwealth, the dairy industry, farmers and State and local governments. Key stakeholders involved in the development of the national Strategy were: DRDC, the ADFF and the NLWRA. Officers from the office of the Murray Darling Basin Commission, and AFFA attended meetings on the development of the Strategy, as observers. In developing the Regional Action Plans key stakeholders included; the DRDC, the ADFF and NLWRA, state agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agencies, agriculture and natural resource management departments, catchment management authorities and regional development bodies.</para><para>(3)	Both the strategy and regional plans were released publicly in March 2002.</para><para>(4)	Copies of the strategy and regional plans are attached. They are also available from the DRDC website:</para><para>http://www.dairyingfortomorrow.com/welcome.htm</para><para>(5)	The Strategy and the associated RAPs are now moving into the implementation phase. Areas of regional priority identified in the eight RAPs are now being developed into projects, the target outcomes of which should contribute directly to the “Dairying for Tomorrow” strategy. A listing of these projects will then be posted on the above website.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Asbestos Removal</title><page.no>8435</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 878)</subtitle><id.no>878</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8435</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 November 2002:</para></talk.start><para>The list of contracts signed in 2001-02 includes the following entry:

The first workshop introduced producers to a benchmarking system so they better understood the current health of their business and the second workshop provided them with critical business planning skills and personal options to make more informed decisions in the future. Producers were also assisted in developing individually tailored business plans at the second workshop, and encouraged to take up the option to receive further hands on assistance through individual on-farm consultations.</para><para>There were 69 consultations for pork producing businesses (where often more than one person attended from each business), on farms nearby the locations of workshops.</para><para>The cost of the workshops and farm consultations was subsidised by the program by up to 70% such that producers paid only $400 for 5 days of training workshops and then $300 for the optional personalised on-farm consultation. The program aimed to encourage more than one participant per farm and hence a second person from the same business was able to attend workshops at no extra charge. Often a husband and wife or farm owner and manager combination would attend, meaning an estimated 270 people from the 194 businesses attended workshops. </para><para>Towards the end of the program, 16 pork producing businesses from two groups who had attended earlier workshops, revisited data and re-considered their position after another financial year, at one day follow-up workshops in Bendigo and Murray Bridge.

The CSA is governed by the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, in raising assessments and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 (`the Registration and Collection Act'), which deals with collection matters. These Acts are publicly available on the Internet, eg at: http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/ or on the CSA's website at www.csa.gov.au.</para><para>CSA's policies, including policies in relation to collection are also published on www.csa.gov.au as `The Guide'. A chapter deals specifically with collection, and the Registrar's administrative and legal powers. The CSA's Debt Policy 2001 is also available by accessing the “legal” icon on the homepage and then through the “debt policies” tab.</para><para>Child support debts, which have not been paid by the due date, may be collected using administrative powers set out in the Registration and Collection Act. These include recovery from the payer's tax refund (s.72), collection from Family Tax Benefit (s.72AB) or Centrelink entitlements (s.72AA) or by intercepting money of the payer held by other persons or companies (s.72A). This enables recovery from a bank account of the payer.</para><para>(2)	CSA endeavours to make contact with a parent after the first default in payment. Different aspects of the policy are applied at any time following default in payment.</para><para>(3)	The child support legislation specifies that taxable income is to be used by the CSA to assess the amount of child support payable. CSA accepts the taxable income determined by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). If the ATO has not determined a taxable income, CSA will determine a default income using the best available information. This includes information provided by the client. If a parent's current income has reduced a parent can estimate their income. The CSA will verify their information when appropriate. Finally, the CSA can instigate a change of assessment process that examines the financial resources of both parents if it considers the parent's real income or earning capacity is not adequately reflected in an assessment.</para><para>(4)	The CSA can adjust the income used for child support assessments where the taxable income does not reflect the income or earning capacity of the parent. This does not necessarily indicate the parent's taxable income is incorrect, or is in dispute. However, the CSA would advise the ATO of cases where it is apparent that a parent's income tax return is substantially inaccurate.</para><para>(5)	The CSA does not have a legislative requirement to notify the ATO that a person has incorrectly stated his or her income. However, as stated in (4) above, the CSA would advise the ATO of cases where it is apparent that a parent's income tax return is substantially inaccurate. </para><para>(6)	No. However, the CSA provides information to the ATO to enable it to make a decision.</para><para>(7)	The CSA does not keep records on this information. </para><para>(8)	(a)	The CSA does not have this information.</para><para>(b)	If a child support client believes that the other parent's income or earning capacity is not adequately reflected in the child support assessment they can apply for a change of assessment. A Senior Case Officer will take into account the financial circumstances of both parents and adjust the assessment where appropriate.</para><para>From 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2002, there were 10 074 applications made for a change of assessment due to this reason. Of these, 3779 resulted in an increased amount of child support payable. 2136 resulted in a decrease in the child support payable. 186 resulted in a change where the direction of the change is to date not recorded. The remaining 3973 resulted in no change, were incomplete, are still unfinalised or have been withdrawn. Many of those that resulted in a change would have been as a result of the changed circumstances of a parent. </para><para>(9)	There are 27 staff employed to manage the CSA's complaints service. </para><para>(10)	The CSA complaints telephone service is a national service for all CSA clients. Officers located in Canberra, Penrith, Wollongong, Box Hill, Moonee Ponds, Albury, Brisbane, Townsville, Adelaide and Perth respond to client queries from all areas of Australia.</para><para>(11)	Yes, however the CSA would seek voluntary compliance initially, and then examine administrative collection approaches before considering legal action.</para><para>(12)	The nature and timing of any recovery action is dependent on the circumstances of each individual case. The parents' current income and assets are important aspects to these decisions.</para><para>(13)	Payment is sought initially via voluntary payment. If this fails, actions to secure child support for the benefit of the children may occur:</para><para>·	Negotiated payment arrangements</para><para>·	Employer Withholding (garnishee of salary/wage)</para><para>·	Garnishee of other amounts eg. securing money from bank accounts, third parties, ongoing deductions from a contractor/subcontractor (for non-salary and wage earners).</para><para>·	Deductions from Centrelink if a parent is on Centrelink benefits.</para><para>·	Issue an order preventing a paying parent from leaving Australia while still owing a child support debt.</para><para>·	Court action where an asset or income stream has been identified.</para><para>(14)	Although the CSA cannot attach a lien against a business for monies owed, it can issue an order so that monies owed to the business are paid directly to the CSA. A court order would be required to attach a lien. </para><para>(15)	The CSA regularly garnishees monies owed to a non-paying parent from employers, the ATO, Centrelink, banks and other third parties.

At this stage there is no AFS label. </para><para>The Joint Accreditation System Australia and New Zealand (JAS ANZ), Australia and New Zealand's national body for accreditation of certification bodies, is developing a programme for accrediting third party independent bodies that will assess whether forest management meets the requirements for AFS certification.</para><para>(2)	The certification framework is described in detail at Section 5 of the AFS. A pre-publication copy is available at the AFS website: www.forestrystandard.org.au. </para><para>(3)	Timber products, companies or Government agencies do not receive AFS certification, instead management of a defined forest area is certified.</para><para>A certificate could be held by a company or Government agency but equally by an individual landholder or a group of forest managers acting in a cooperative manner.</para><para>(4)	AFS certification is a voluntary undertaking and consistent with other international certification schemes such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme. Any forest managed for wood production may be assessed against the requirements contained in the Standard. However, the AFS has a clear definition of what significant biological diversity values need to be maintained. These include protecting forest types (such as rainforest) and old-growth forest, which are threatened or under represented in the forest reserve system.</para><para>(5)	Certification of Australian forest managers will require a thorough review of their management practices to ensure that they comply with the requirements in the AFS.

JP 117 Phase 2 remains unapproved. JP 117 Phase 1 will provide the necessary information to allow the Government to make an informed decision on Phase 2 at 2nd Pass Approval, which is currently planned to occur in FY 04/05.</para><para>(2)	JP 117 Phase 1 is a Project Definition Study (PDS) being conducted to determine robust costing and capability information required for Government to consider project approval. JP 117 Phase 2 is the acquisition phase of the project. </para><para>(3)	When Phase 1 was approved in 1996 (as Land Project 117) the in-service date for JP117 was, for planning purposes, 2002.</para><para>(4)	The budget for Phase 1 on approval in 1996 was $3.760m (December 1996 prices). At the time Phase 1 was approved the provision for Phase 2 was $822.72m (December 1996 prices).</para><para>(5)	The initial market survey element of JP 117 Phase 1 was completed in 1998. The further definition work necessary to update cost estimates and define technical solutions to provide a basis for Government consideration of Phase 2 is targeted to be complete by the third quarter of 2004. Subject to the outcome of Phase 1, Phase 2 is planned to be complete by the end of 2010.</para><para>(6)	(a)	The funding estimate was not revised upwards by $100m between the 2001 and the 2002 DCP supplement. The project funding estimate was adjusted in line with the global price and exchange adjustment, which placed it in the next costing band in the unclassified 2002 DCP supplement. (b) The current estimate for the expenditure for JP 117 is being examined as part of the annual DCP review process and will be refined throughout the Phase 1 Project Definition Study. The level agreed by Government will reflect judgements about the performance level and basis of provisioning appropriate to our current strategic circumstances.</para><para>(7)	Rapier and RBS are Short Range Air Defence Weapon Systems optimised for use against low flying aircraft. Longer range and higher level engagement of targets would need to be undertaken by other elements of the ADF air defence capability, such as fighter aircraft.</para><para>(8)	Yes, current planning is still based on 2005.</para><para>(9)	RBS70 has for some time been the GBAD system of choice deployed to support ADF operations. Given that the RBS 70 and Rapier are broadly similar in capability the withdrawal of Rapier will not represent a real capability reduction, noting that additional RBS70 systems are being acquired to equip four Air Defence Troops.</para><para>(10)	The RBS70 is only one part of the total ADF air defence capability, which is very substantial in regional terms. The reason for planning the introduction of a new system under JP117 is not to address current shortfalls in RBS70, but to ensure that the total ADF air defence capability grows to meet emerging challenges.</para><para>(11)	Yes. Alternatives were considered and rejected on the basis that they were assessed as offering less value for money and higher risk than acquiring additional RBS 70 systems. </para><para>(12)	(a) The current target date is FY 04/05, subject to the outcome of the current DCP review by the Government. (b) Based on a FY 04/05 decision on Phase 2, the current target in-service delivery date remains around 2009, with project completion around 2010. These dates will be clarified following completion of Phase 1.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence Capability Plan</title><page.no>8472</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 967)</subtitle><id.no>967</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8472</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the LAND 19 Phase 5A project in the Defence Capability Plan:</para><para>(1)	When did the Government grant approval for this project.</para><para>(2)	(a) When was the request for tender issued; and (b) what was the closing date for tenders.</para><para>(3)	(a) How many tenders were submitted; and (b) which organisation submitted tenders.</para><para>(4)	(a) When was the preferred tenderer selected; and (b) when was the contract signed. </para><para>(5)	(a) What was the budget for this project at the time approval was granted; and (b) has the budget changed since approval was granted; if so, what is the current budget.</para><para>(6)	What is the completion date for this project and is this still the expected completion date.</para><para>(7)	When did the RBS 70 system enter service and when was the end-of-life for the RBS 70 system originally due to occur. </para><para>(8)	When will the end-of-life for the RBS 70 system occur following the life-of-type extension under this project.</para><para>(9)	(a) Were any options apart from a life-of-type extension considered; (b) what were the options; and (c) why was it decided to proceed with a life-of-type extension and not the other options. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8473</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	2001.</para><para>(2)	(a) 8 March 2002.

(b) When applying for a transit visa and on arrival in Australia by air, it is a legislative requirement that seafarers present a valid passport or seafarer's identity document. Further, it is a policy requirement that on application and on arrival at an airport the seafarer also present the following details as provided by the shipping agent: the names of the persons joining the vessel as crew; the names of the persons they are replacing; the name of the vessel; the date of arrival in Australia of the persons to be visaed; the port and date they are expected to join the vessel; and if they are not the vessel's owner, a copy of the request for crew from the vessel's agent in Australia which contains the details of the crew members applying for visas.</para><para>(13)(a)    The following conditions apply to all transit visas:</para></quote><para>·	The holder must enter on or before the date specified by the Minister for the purpose and </para><para>·	Conditions 8101 (the holder must not engage in work in Australia) and 8201 (while in Australia the holder must not engage, for more than 3 months, in any studies or training).</para><para>Any one or more of conditions 8501, 8514 and 8516 may also be imposed.

Condition 8516 states that the holder must continue to be a person who would satisfy the primary or secondary criteria, as the case requires, for the grant of the visa.</para><quote><para>	(b)  There are no specific checks made to ensure that the conditions of a transit visa are met. As with all other visa holders, a transit visa holder may be subject to questioning by immigration airport staff on entry or by immigration compliance staff after entry if there is a reason to believe that the holder may not be complying with the conditions of his/her visa.</para><para>(14)	No. Under current legislation transit visas can be evidenced in Seafarer's Identity Documents when the holder is travelling to Australia to join their vessel.</para><para>(15)	(a) There are no specific measures to ensure seafarers join their ship within the validity of their transit visa. As with all visa holders, if seafarers overstay the validity of their visa they become unlawful non-citizens liable for detention and removal.

(c) Not applicable.</para><para>(17)	(a) Seafarers may first arrive in Australia by air as holders of transit visas. They then have 72 hours to sign-on to their vessel, at which time they are taken to hold a Special Purpose Visa by operation of law. Australian Customs Service (ACS) Officers attend vessels where such a crew change occurs to verify the seafarer's identity and ensure his or her details appear on the crew manifest. (b) a Special Purpose Visa is granted by operation of law.</para><para>(18)	(a) and (b) If a seafarer leaves their ship in an Australian port without the permission of the master of the vessel they are considered to be a deserter and their Special Purpose Visa ceases at midnight of the day on which they desert. If a seafarer permanently leaves their ship in an Australian port with the permission of the master they continue to hold their Special Purpose Visa for the period specified in the maintenance letter signed by the master (to a maximum of 30 days). If such a seafarer wishes to remain longer in Australia for tourism or other purposes, they are required to apply for the appropriate visa.  </para><para>(19)	(a) The Department of Transport and Regional Services has advised that the CSL Stadacona did not complete a Melbourne-Brisbane-Port Pirie voyage in May or June this year. (b) Not applicable. (c) During May and June this year the Stadacona was Australian crewed. (d) I am not able to advise if the crew are still in Australia.</para><para>(20)	(a) Foreign crew working on vessels in Australian waters generally hold Special Purpose Visas; (b) The Special Purpose Visa is the authority under which they would be working in Australia; (c) The Australian Customs Service monitors ships operating in Australian waters.</para><para>(21)	This would depend on the circumstances of an individual vessel. In general vessels that hold either a Single Voyage Permit or a Continuing Voyage Permit are considered to be international vessels. However, whether the vessel is considered to be one on an international voyage would depend upon the details of that vessels voyage pattern. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Legislation: Community Consultation</title><page.no>8480</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 992)</subtitle><id.no>992</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8480</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 December 2002:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice no.864 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 3 December 2002, p. 6713) concerning consultation on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999: What is the total budgeted cost of the 12-month, full-time position at the National Farmers' Federation that commenced on 19 November 2002.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8480</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>The budgeted cost of the position is $110,239.04 plus associated minor costs in relation to printing of information about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: National Greenhouse Funding</title><page.no>8480</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 995)</subtitle><id.no>995</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8480</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator Nettle</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 December 2002:</para></talk.start><para>Will Federal funding: (a) for the Cities for Climate Protection Program; and (b) to support Local Agenda 21 planning, be provided after the 2002-03 financial year; if not, why not; if so, will this funding be less than, equal to, or more than the funding for the 2002-03 financial year.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8480</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>The Government recognises that local governments have a vital role in our national greenhouse response, due to the unique way that they deliver services, interact with, and influence people at a local level.

If the postcode is supplied it is entered into an online system which automatically notifies the customer service officer of a match against a list of designated Regional Law Hotline postcodes. </para><para>From 1 October 2001 to 31 January 2002 a total of 193 calls were recorded as being made to either the Family or Regional Law Hotlines from Regional Law Hotline designated postcodes. Of these calls: (a) none were recorded to specifically relate to queries on Family Tax Benefit A and B debt advices; (b) none were recorded to specifically relate to Centrelink issues directly relating to Family Tax Benefit A or B, although 33 calls were recorded as seeking non specified general information or legal advice or other non specified assistance; and (c) all but one call was handled to the satisfaction of the caller.</para><para>(2)	(a) Callers are asked to indicate the level of satisfaction with the service they have received at the end of each call. Centrelink customer service officers check one or more check boxes to indicate the level of caller satisfaction on an electronic form at the end of each call. Where a caller is dissatisfied the reason is also recorded in a free text field on the electronic form. (b) The caller who expressed dissatisfaction was unable to accept that legal advice was unavailable to her at 7 pm. No further action was taken in this particular case.</para><para>(3)	No calls were recorded as being referred for clarification of a debt.</para><para>(4)	For the period 1 October 2001 to 31 January 2002 the maximum and minimum average duration of calls to the Regional and Family Law Hotlines were 9.8 and 5.2 minutes respectively.</para><para>(5)	The difference between the actual expenditure in 2001-02 and the estimated expenditure for 2002-03 for the Centrelink call centre service is due to a fall in the average daily customer service officer sign-on hours. </para><para>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Centrelink which governs the operation of the Regional and Family Law Hotline call centres makes provision for call centre staffing levels to be adjusted periodically to reflect actual call volumes. The MOU also provides for a service level that requires 80% of calls to be answered within 30 seconds.</para><para>Initially the Attorney-General's Department asked for enough staff to handle 250,000 calls per year. However this estimate was higher than the actual number of calls received. The call centre staffing level has been progressively adjusted to reflect the actual number of calls being made. Staffing levels have been progressively reduced from 193 sign-on hours per day in June 2001 to 42 in September 2002. As a consequence of this adjustment the monthly charge from Centrelink for operating the telephone service has fallen from $280,330 in June 2001 to $72,696 in September 2002.</para><para>(6)	Centrelink has reduced the number of customer service officers in the Regional and Family Law Hotline call centres. The level of service provided to callers has been maintained within the agreed standard as specified in the MOU with Centrelink. Therefore callers should not be adversely affected by the reduction in staffing levels. </para><para>(7)	The Australian Law Online call centre service is comprised of the Regional and Family Law Hotlines. Payments made to Centrelink are based on the following factors:</para><para>(a)	the actual Regional and Family Law Hotline call centre customer service officer staffing level measured in sign-on hours; and </para><para>(b)	the telecommunication costs associated with calls to the toll free Regional and Family Law Hotlines.</para><para>(8)	The reduction in funding was to match the service to the actual demand - it has not meant a reduction in service to callers. The Department will continue to closely monitor call volumes to ensure that call centre staffing is aligned with actual demand and that the MOU service level is maintained. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attorney-General's: Copyright </title><page.no>8486</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1010)</subtitle><id.no>1010</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8486</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 10 December 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many offences of the Copyright Act 1968 in relation to piracy have resulted in: (a) a conviction; (b) a maximum penalty fine of $65 000 being imposed; and/or (c) imprisonment.</para><para>(2)	Can information be provided on individual cases where prosecution of these crimes have led to conviction, financial penalties and/or imprisonment.</para><para>(3)	In cases where piracy was found to have occurred, what happened to the copying devices used to pirate movies or sound recordings.</para><para>(4)	In each conviction in relation to piracy of movies or sound recordings, did the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions make a submission on behalf of the Government during the trial or sentencing phase which requested the court to take into consideration the quantity and value of the items seized; if so, what was the court's comment or finding in each case in relation to this submission.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8486</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	My answer to Question on Notice 823(1)(a)-(c) remains current.</para><para>(2)	My answer to Question on Notice 823(2) remains current.</para><para>(3)	My answer to Question on Notice 823(3) remains current.</para><para>(4)	My answer to Question on Notice 823(4) remains current .</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Entitlements</title><page.no>8486</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1011)</subtitle><id.no>1011</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8486</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 December 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	With reference to question on notice no. 744, how many of the successful claims have been brought to the attention of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and, in particular, the ADF Medical Service.</para><para>(2)	What proportion of claims accepted were based on diagnoses of private medical practitioners.</para><para>(3)	How many claims have been rejected.</para><para>(4)	What is the current fortnightly tax free value of the Total and Permanent Incapacity Pension being paid.</para><para>(5)	How many accepted claimants are also in receipt of service pension (invalidity).</para><para>(6)	In the event that the Department of Defence is unaware of the payment of such pensions, to either serving or discharged personnel, is that pension additional to salary and/or superannuation payments.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8486</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Department of Veterans' Affairs has not provided the Australian Defence Force with details of any individual who had service in East Timor and who has had a successful application for benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.  </para><para>The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) is bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.

Any salary or wage payments paid in respect of such limited work would have no impact on the payment of special rate pension. Salary payment reflecting any greater work capacity would debar the veteran from receiving special rate pension.</para><para>The special rate pension will be reduced by an actuarially determined amount whenever other parties, including Defence, also pay compensation for the same incapacity.</para><para>Any superannuation payment would be additional to any disability pension payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA).</para><para>With respect to invalid service pension or age service pension, income and assets tests apply and any income, assessable under the VEA, will affect the rate of pension payable. Disability pension is excluded from the income test.
