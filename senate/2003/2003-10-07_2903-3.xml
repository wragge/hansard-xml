I point out that no committee has considered that bill and there has been no widespread consultation, as there ought to be, with the community, including the legal community. It is a far-reaching bill. It in effect extends Australian law to Australians who are serving the country overseas in various ways at the expense of the domestic law in whichever country they may be serving. For example, it will cover Australian personnel working in Iraq so that if they commit a crime while in Iraq they will be brought to justice under Australian law rather than Iraqi law. There are good arguments for and against that, but this bill is quite a deal wider than the New Zealand equivalent, which extends, in the case of that country, to personnel from New Zealand in the Solomon Islands. But behind it is the whole matter of the jurisdiction of countries that have a controlling interest, for one reason or another, over domestic countries and who may get into trouble and then their law becomes supreme over that country's domestic law.</para></talk.start><para>Where is the international debate about this? What are the United Nations's norms on this? Why is it that under this legislation we suddenly are going to cover the whole world instead of just the Solomon Islands and/or Iraq? These are matters that we ought to be hearing a debate on. There should be a Senate inquiry, and there should be reference to international experts on the matter. Instead of that, we are getting the cut-off here, the bill being brought in and debated this afternoon, the bill passing and its becoming law. I think that is a wholly inefficient way of dealing with an extremely important piece of legislation like this. It has very great ramifications in international law as well as our domestic law. It is on that basis that the Greens are opposing this cut-off motion. It simply denies the Senate both the right and the obligation to adequately confer with the experts in the field on this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15655</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is within the Senate's capacity to send any bill to a committee.

I am not sure, because I do not have the information at my fingertips, but I understand that no senator sought that this bill be referred to a committee. If Senator Brown, after consideration of it, after the selection of bills meeting and after all of the processes of the parliament, has decided that it should go to a committee, he has obviously woken up to it a bit late, but no other senator has shown any interest in having this bill referred to a committee. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Not every bill goes to a committee. Back in the old days, in the nineties, in the last millennium, I think—and I am speaking off the top of my head—something like 15 per cent of bills used to go to committees. I think that about 30 per cent now do. That is a good thing for the scrutiny of legislation by the parliament. It frustrates government sometimes when bills go to committee and take a long time to come back, but the reality is that good committee consideration of a bill is good for the legislation. It usually picks up things that the government, bureaucrats and draftspeople have not picked up, and it generally can improve bills. It allows the community, as Senator Brown has said, to have a say on legislation. So it is a good process, but not every bill needs to go to a committee. Roughly, 30 per cent of bills do; 70 per cent of them do not. This one has fallen into the 70 per cent category. And, of course, when it gets into the parliament, it can have proper scrutiny through the committee stage here. I commend my motion to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15656</page.no><id.no>R1815</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1816</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1812</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>15656</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 18 September.</para><para>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and opposition amendment (3) on sheet 3067 moved by Senator Sherry.

These amendments are very important. They continue the debate that we had in the last sitting fortnight about the importance of recognising a broader definition of `dependant' and a broader definition of `spouse' in both superannuation and tax law. These particular amendments go to the heart of the discriminatory provisions in that they deal with not just the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act but also the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para><para>We raise two issues here. One is the definition of `spouse', which we dealt with extensively on the last occasion. I would reiterate the very strong view of the Democrats that the definition of `spouse' in federal superannuation law is archaic and needs to be updated. It has now been updated in all state legislation to ensure that de facto couples, regardless of their sexuality, are given equal treatment, and it is time we do it at the federal level. We have had this debate in this place on 11 previous occasions—in fact, 12 occasions including the last sitting fortnight—and I do not propose to raise it again, but I do believe it is a matter of importance for human rights and I certainly commend these amendments to the chamber.</para><para>We also include in these amendments, probably for the first time in the 12 times we have debated these issues in the chamber, a second category of definition, which is the definition of what we call an `interdependency relationship'. An interdependency relationship is defined as a relationship between two people that is acknowledged by both and which involves residing together and being closely interdependent and having a continuing commitment to mutual emotional and financial support. This definition is a very important one. It draws on section 238 of the Migration Act, so it is recognising a well-defined area of law at the moment. It picks up not just the area of spouses but also the broader area of family or genuine domestic relationships where there is a genuine commitment to each other, a genuine sharing of financial resources and also a genuine notion of interdependence. That is very important. Under the current superannuation act, under the definition of `dependant', which is also replicated in section 27AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the issue of dependence has been found by the courts to come down to the issue of not just full financial dependence but partial financial dependence. </para><para>So we are getting down to the situation where it has been found in some of the cases that payment of maybe $25 or $35 board a week to another person makes that person dependent on them for the purposes of tax and super law. So we are getting down into an area of picking up some of these very complicated genuine domestic relationships that exist out there. But the whole notion of where there is interdependence, shared financial resources, shared emotional resources and shared living resources is not yet picked up under the act. The Democrats come from the fundamental point of view that we do not believe that tax law or super law should ultimately dictate who you can and cannot leave your death benefits to and whether or not those death benefits should be taxed. I hope at some stage the government will consider this fairly fundamental issue on its merits—the notion of whether tax law should dictate which types of relationships, which types of families, which types of households are respected for the purpose of superannuation law and which types of death benefits are or are not taxed for the purposes of tax law. </para><para>This definition at least will include and broaden out that area of partial financial dependency, which is currently reflected under the tax law, and take it out to include interdependency, which includes people who have made a decision to share their resources and their lives with each other. It may not be spouses living together, but it covers situations of mothers and sons living together, brothers living together and very old friends living together who have chosen to make a commitment of financially and emotionally supporting each other. Under migration law this area has been well established. It has resulted in a great deal of fairness and equity being added into migration law in this country. I certainly commend these provisions to the chamber.</para><para>I acknowledge that, if these amendments were passed, regulations would need to be established, as exist under the Migration Act, to broaden out what these definitions apply to. It is a very important area. I come back to my fundamental point that, if the government believes in providing more choice in superannuation, choice should extend to not just what happens to your super when you are alive but what happens to your super when you are dead. If the government is fundamentally opposed to death duties, as it has said in many leaflets criticising the Democrats over many years, then it should also start raising the question as to why certain death benefits of superannuation are taxed and why some are not. This amendment tries to get to the bottom of that by taking out the notion of partial dependency, which is currently recognised at law, to include interdependency. It is an important amendment. It is an important advance. I hope that, on this particular occasion, we will eventually get government support for it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15659</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in favour of the amendments moved by Senator Cherry. I would like to revisit briefly part of the debate we were having in this broad area when we last sat on 18 September 2003. Later that day when I returned to my office I received the following email, which I would like to read with the sender's consent. I was contacted by Mr Bruce Baker, who is President of Boutique Financial Planning Principals Groups Inc., which he notes is a small AFS licensees association. We were debating at the time the notion raised in part by Senator Harradine that perhaps one way to deal with this would be for superannuants to leave their moneys to a will. Mr Baker raised the following points with me, and he makes a good point which has not been covered in much of the discussion we have had so far. His email says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>While driving yesterday, I heard (on NewsRadio) part of the discussion regarding how a person who is a member of a super fund might make arrangements for their dependants in the event of this person's death.</para><para>I heard part of what you had to say. </para></quote><para>He is referring to me when he says `you'. The email continues:</para><quote><para>I had the impression there was a belief that a person's Will could direct a super fund trustee to pay superannuation death benefits to the person of their choice (as long as they were a dependant as defined under the SIS Act). This is not so—for 99.99% of super funds. In the vast bulk of cases, a Will might record the member's wishes but does not have the force of law to compel the super fund trustee to comply.</para><para>In the vast majority of cases, a member may nominate a death beneficiary, but the trustee has discretion (after taking the member's wishes—and the needs of other beneficiaries into account) as to whom the benefit is paid. This is quite problematic and can readily lead to death benefits being paid to others than those intended—in a range of circumstances. Trustees' discretion in this matter has also led to a range of complaints to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para><para>To try to deal with this problem, the SIS Act was amended a few years ago to allow a fund to offer a binding death benefit nomination—to increase the certainty as to whom death benefits were paid. However, this still leaves 2 problematic issues:</para><para>* First a large proportion of superannuation funds do not offer binding death benefit nominations.</para><para>* Second, a binding death benefit nomination lapses if not refreshed every 3 years. If the super fund member suffers dementia (i.e. legal incompetence) during these 3 years, he/she cannot refresh their death benefit nomination—</para></quote><para>and it lapses—</para><quote><para>and the death benefit may (depending on the trust deed of the fund) revert to trustees discretion. Clearly the people to whom binding death benefit nominations are most important (older people) are also the people most likely to suffer dementia. This is a very serious weakness in the SIS Act. If a Will does not lapse after 3 years if not refreshed, a binding death benefit nomination should not lapse after 3 years if not refreshed. Wills and Binding Death Benefit Nominations are very similar instruments—so there should be similar rules—to help reduce the confusion that the public has about these matters—and to just be consistent. </para><para>I would appreciate it if you could raise this issue in the Senate.</para></quote><para>And I am pleased to have done so. In the context of that email, obviously I reiterate my strong desire for this issue to be resolved in the manner the chamber is articulating—three or four different sets of amendments, some of which have been passed and another which we have before us—and to go to the heart of this matter, rather than try to circumvent the issue by trying to, if you like, launder superannuation death benefits through a will. I have already said that there are several problematic reasons with that. Mr Baker has rightly pointed out there are further reasons which I was not conscious of at the time and on which I now have better information. For that reason, the amendments that Senator Cherry is advocating ought to be strongly supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15660</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Greens support these amendments and have some complementary amendments. The committee is dealing with superannuation legislation to which these amendments have been added to eliminate discrimination against same sex and dependent partners in the field of superannuation insofar as we can both in the public sector and the private sector. Labor, the Greens and the Democrats have moved and are moving a series of amendments which, put together, would have that effect. For the reasons that Senator Greig has just outlined and, before him, Senator Cherry, you see quite clearly that leaving the legislation as it is is totally unsatisfactory and discriminatory. For example, if a mother and daughter have depended on each other and lived together for many years in the same household, superannuation going to the daughter will have accrued, but if the daughter were to precede her mother in dying and if the mother did in fact receive the superannuation benefits they would be taxed. </para></talk.start><para>We have been talking about same sex couples who, despite decades together, cannot be assured that when one dies the other will be the beneficiary of superannuation. What they do know is that in that process they may lose 30 per cent of the superannuation in taxation, whereas heterosexual couples do not have that applying to them. So it is very discriminatory. The process in these amendments is basically to bring justice to all citizens who earn and pay for superannuation and want to see the same value come from their superannuation contributions as would be the case for any other citizen. That is what this suite of amendments would do.</para><para>In the two-week period since we last debated this there has been some press speculation that the Democrats are not going to insist on these amendments. It would help if we could have the air cleared on that, because the process we are debating now is an important one. It appears that these amendments will go through. They will go to the House of Representatives. The government is not going to accept them. We will then be in a position where the legislation comes back to the chamber and the chamber has to decide whether it will stand firm on the amendments. It may be that the Democrats have not decided what they will do at that stage, but it would certainly help the process of this legislation if we knew whether a decision had been made on the matter.</para><para>I should say that the Democrats have been champions in this field for many years. What has changed is that the Labor Party has changed its past objections to amendments like these and is now supporting them. That has created a difficult position for the Democrats, because they were supporting the government's package of legislation—influenced and improved by the Democrats—but these amendments have now been added and are a very important third component of it. I would like to know the direction in which we are headed as far as this important component of it is concerned, and I know that many people in the community would as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15661</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party will be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats that we are currently considering. I think Senator Brown still has his amendment. We will deal with that shortly. When we debated this issue in the last sitting week I moved an amendment to remove the discriminations that apply to superannuation in respect of same sex couples. I do not want to go back through that debate at any great length, but there are two important issues. One is the important principle of removing discrimination against same sex couples in a range of areas in our society. In order to do that with respect to superannuation, the amendments that we are now considering—and the amendment we have already passed and, indeed, Senator Brown's amendment—need to be carried.</para></talk.start><para>There is an additional argument with respect to superannuation—that is, superannuation is the individual property of a person. Government does not interfere with the property rights of individuals and to whom they would choose to leave their property in any other circumstance that I can think of. The one area where government—the state—does interfere and attempts to change the wishes of an individual is in respect of superannuation, which is the individual's own property. That is fundamentally wrong. In moving the amendments successfully in the last sitting week and in supporting the amendments today, Labor has taken the view that, because we have a package—an agreement—between the government and the Democrats, there is at least a reasonable chance that we will be able to progress this issue.</para><para>I do not know what the future holds. Senator Brown has asked Senator Cherry to clarify on behalf of the Democrats what they will be doing when the message returns from the House of Representatives. Given the statements on the record by the minister, Senator Coonan, and subsequently in the media following the last sitting fortnight, presumably the government will reject the amendment that Labor successfully moved, the amendment that will be passed here that the Democrats have moved and the amendment that will be passed that Senator Brown has moved. The government will reject those; there will be a message to the Senate. It would be useful to know what the government's position and Senator Cherry's and the Australian Democrats' position will be.</para><para>Secondly, Senator Greig has read an email communication from a financial planner. There was some discussion about at least some of these issues on the last occasion. The binding death benefit is a partial solution. Very few people enter into a binding death benefit with respect to superannuation. I do not have the statistics, though I have tried to find out, but I understand that it is very rare for a person to enter into a binding death benefit with respect to superannuation. Therefore, it is not a solution to argue that people should enter into a binding death benefit. They simply do not do it. Most people do not even know it exists, so it is not a solution.</para><para>Senator Greig today has drawn our attention to an issue that we did not discuss on the last occasion, though it was an issue I was aware of. Generally, most people in the community are not aware that their will can be overridden by superannuation trustees whether they are part of a same sex couple or not. The issue has occasionally been raised with me where a will has indicated the property distribution of an individual, and I have found that people in the community are not aware that superannuation trustees do not have to take any notice of the will. Generally, they do. From my discussions of this issue with trustees over the last couple of weeks, I know that they generally follow the will. But they do not have to. In some cases, of course, where they are not legally required to take notice of the will, there can be very debilitating, lengthy and costly legal proceedings involving the superannuation trustees and very difficult disputes where the trustees choose to ignore the wishes of the will—if there is one.</para><para>The other process is that, when most Australians join a superannuation fund, they can indicate on the form that goes to the superannuation fund their preferred beneficiary. Again, I have checked this. Apparently, less than half of the Australians who are in a superannuation fund actually nominate a preferred beneficiary and, where they do, they often do not change it afterwards if there are changed circumstances. Generally, Australians do not change the death beneficiary on their superannuation.</para><para>Given the amount of moneys in superannuation—that is, the total of the savings, which is increasing over time—and particularly given issues relating to death and disability insurance, this can become a very messy area. It can become an area of significant disputation for not just same sex couples but all people in the community who have superannuation. I am not sure what the answer is, to be frank, for the general community or how to address the difficulties people have if they do not nominate a beneficiary of their superannuation or if they do not have a binding death nomination. I am not sure what the solution to this problem is. However, we are dealing with amendments moved by the Democrats that I think deal conclusively with ending discrimination against same sex couples in respect of their superannuation. As I said, I support them on behalf of the Labor Party. I think it is appropriate that we progress the issue in this area. This is an opportunity to do so on a package of bills we know the government wants. We know the government wants this legislation, and the Democrats obviously want the legislation because they are party to some signed-up document that I have not seen but that the minister has referred to. I hope we can progress this issue.</para><para>I notice that some in the media have analysed some comments made by, amongst others, the minister, Senator Coonan, before she entered the parliament. Those comments are on the public record. I notice there has been some examination of comments made on the public record by some other people, such as Mr Abbott and Dr Nelson. Dr Nelson's public comments on this issue do not surprise me; I guess I was a little surprised at Mr Abbott's public utterances on this issue.</para><para>Labor is hopeful that we can progress this issue via these amendments. I would hope that, since we last debated the issue two weeks ago, the government has had a change of heart. I would be interested to know from the minister whether this matter has been re-examined in the last fortnight and whether what I think have been convincing arguments and debate in the chamber around this issue have led to a change of attitude by the government. I could ask for the details of the debate that I hope occurred around the cabinet table since the committee last met, and I could ask for an outline of Senator Coonan's recommendations, Mr Abbott's position and Dr Nelson's position—and I am sure there are a number of others who expressed a view—but I would not get it because of cabinet confidentiality. It would have been interesting to have been a fly on the wall in that debate, if it occurred, in cabinet in the last two weeks. Labor will support the amendments before the chair.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>15663</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to put on the record on behalf of all of the Democrats, and to clear up any confusion about it—and there has been some confusion and some misinformation as well about what the Democrats' approach is to both the issue before the chamber at the moment, the Democrats amendments, and the legislation more broadly—the Democrats' position on this issue. The amendments before the chamber, as Senator Sherry quite rightly said, clearly and effectively address the discrimination currently faced by same sex couples in aspects of superannuation law. That is only one aspect of the discrimination against same sex couples in many areas of Commonwealth law. As has been acknowledged, the Democrats have been trying for a long time to address that discrimination across the board rather than in bits and pieces. It has been a matter of intense frustration to us as a party that we have not been able to make progress on that through the Senate with either of the major parties. It is therefore significant and welcome that Labor is supporting these and other amendments that address discrimination against same sex couples.</para></talk.start><para>It is worth noting, and I suspect it is not completely irrelevant, that Labor have chosen to support amendments such as these to a bill they do not support. That support is, of course, crucial with respect to their willingness to support these amendments, which deal with discrimination against same sex couples. But it is nonetheless welcome and it signals to the Democrats that there has been—potentially—a change of heart in the ALP, and we will redouble our efforts to move appropriate amendments to other legislation where possible to address discrimination in other areas. I would have to say that superannuation is probably not the largest area where discrimination affects same sex couples. I would say taxation is the biggest, but there are plenty of other areas as well: immigration law, the social security and welfare system, superannuation and other financial areas and the affairs of veterans and defence forces. That is to name just a few areas where there are Public Service rules. I happily signal to the chamber—and it is worth the government noting this in terms of other issues they may wish to progress—that the Democrats will further utilise the potential shift in attitudes of the major parties to try and remove some of this discrimination in a whole range of areas.</para><para>To indicate the Democrats' view on what we will do once the government has considered these amendments, I can simply say—as has been suggested—that we have not decided what we will do if the government decides to insist. At this stage we want to maximise the pressure on the government to not insist, particularly with respect to these amendments. It is worth noting, of course, that the government does change its position, despite what it may say in this chamber or publicly. There is no easier example of that to point to than the significant changes in position in relation to health issues and the area of medical indemnity insurance—an area in which Senator Coonan herself made quite strong and unequivocal statements. The government's position has changed. That is not a criticism of Senator Coonan. If anything, it is a word of praise that this government is willing to change its view given further reflection, further consideration and further assessment of the political realities and the policy issues. I do not think it is accurate to say that there is no prospect of any change in the government's attitude. I do not even think it is particularly worth while getting further indications from the minister at the moment about what she or the government may do, because obviously it is a matter for the government to consider more fully once it has the final legislation before it after it has passed through the Senate.</para><para>I think the debate should now focus on finalising the legislation and getting it passed through the Senate. We have been debating it for quite a period of time, and I think many people in the community thought it was passed a couple of weeks ago. Of course we still have some matters to deal with, but no doubt we can deal with those today. It is an issue that the Democrats are obviously keen to progress because—unlike the ALP and, as I understand it, the Green party—we do support the significantly amended legislation, including the same sex amendments. It is a significant win for low-income earners—a significant amount of money has been removed from high-income earners and has been dramatically expanded in providing savings assistance to low-income earners. It is not a magic solution to everything, but it is a significant step forward and a significant achievement that the Democrats have managed, and we are keen to see it progress.</para><para>It is no secret to anybody in this chamber or in the community that we are also keen to see the issue of the removal of discrimination against same sex couples progressed. We will continue to examine every parliamentary and political opportunity to progress that issue. It is a significant area of injustice in our society, which has been identified for a long period of time but which continues to be resisted at the federal parliamentary level. To get those changes through, of course, we have to get parliamentary approval, and this is a good opportunity for the Senate to try to advance the chances of that outcome.</para><para>As I said before—and I signal now to the government and the minister—there are plenty of other bills and issues on the table, some of which the Democrats will be pivotal in enabling or otherwise the passage of. It is an issue which the government will need to continue to confront, particularly if the ALP's position remains consistent in removing discrimination against same sex couples. Whether or not that approach will continue consistently on bills that the ALP support as opposed to bills the ALP oppose, we shall have to wait and see. But that is part of the unknowns that we will be seeing in the near future in this chamber and that, amongst other things, will determine what the Democrats' approach will be to the future outcome of this legislation—should the government not agree to the amendments that the chamber makes. But that, as is not uncommon, is an issue to be considered down the track rather than predetermining what we will do. It is obviously less than ideal to predetermine what we will do in relation to a particular outcome when there are so many different factors in play and so many potential and possible responses from a variety of players, including not just the government but the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15665</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bartlett—I do not think deliberately—misrepresents our position. We are considering two measures: one is the exclusive tax cut on superannuation for high-income earners. It is an exclusive tax cut that only applies to those Australians whose taxable income is greater than $95,600—I think the figure is. The Labor Party do not support that approach in respect of an exclusive tax cut. We do not support that, Senator Bartlett, and I have said that very consistently over a long period of time.</para></talk.start><para>The second measure, which the Labor Party do support, is the low-income earner co-contribution. We support that because it is an improvement that is reasonably well targeted. I have subjected the minister to a range of questions about who exactly benefits from the measure. While I have some concerns about at least some of those who will benefit from the measure actually being low- or middle-income earners—I think there will be some areas where higher income earners will take advantage—on balance Labor agree with the co-contribution for low-income earners. I might say that this co-contribution proposal is in fact a very much watered-down version of the Labor Party's proposal of 1995-96. In 1995-96, the Labor Party proposed a co-contribution of three per cent from government and three per cent from the employee for all superannuation fund members—guaranteed.</para><para>In 1997, this government dropped that and substituted a so-called `savings rebate' which then was dropped approximately a year later. We were left with nothing. So the chamber is considering today what is a very much watered-down version of what Labor initially proposed. To give you some comparative figures: the Labor Party's co-contribution of three per cent from the government and three per cent from the employee would have delivered into superannuation for everyone—not one in 10, but for everyone—an additional $4½ billion from government and obviously a matching contribution from employees. That would have meant an additional $9 billion a year in superannuation savings in this country. The Liberal government scrapped that in 1997 and have brought back a very much watered-down version which delivers a benefit for approximately one in 10 of the lower to middle-income earners in this country—approximately one in 10.</para><para>Effectively what we have seen is Labor proposing 10 steps forward and the government abandoning that and now taking one step forward. However, the Labor Party is confronted with the reality that the government have bundled together both the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners and the low-income earners co-contribution. That is the government's call, not the Labor Party's. They have bundled together two quite different measures. The Labor Party do not agree with an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, so ultimately we will have to make a call on the package when we have the final vote in the Senate on the measures before us.</para><para>In conclusion I want to emphasise that, despite our critical analysis of at least some of the beneficiaries of the low-income earners co-contribution, it is effectively an idea that was advanced by the Labor Party in a much more rigorous and expansive form back in 1996. For that reason, we support it in principle.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15666</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It does seem like the Greens are the only ones who know exactly what they will be doing now and next time, and that is to oppose the legislation, with the exception of supporting the amendments for same sex couples and co-dependent partners regardless. That becomes an important and pre-eminent issue. It will be interesting to hear what the government has to say on the matter. The breakthrough there is absolutely crucial if you are looking for social justice. What we find with the legislation in itself, as Senator Sherry has just been indicating, is that it is very much weighted to high-income earners. Even the copayments at the lower level will be picked up by partnerships in which there is a high-income component more readily than partnerships in which two people are on very low incomes. That being said, it is going to be very important and will set the parameters for a debate going into next year, should the Democrats allow the government to say, `Hold on, we will review this matter and at some later time introduce legislation which, in part or in full, gets rid of discrimination against same sex couples and co-dependent partners.' I can predict that what will happen then is the government will see this as an opportunity to get rid of the spectre of a double dissolution, which it is not all that keen on, to be able to leverage much greater concessions from the Democrats further down the line in return for a much delayed but inevitable change to the law to get rid of discrimination right across the field in Australia. That will be a catch-up not only with the States but with just about every equivalent country in the world in terms of ending discrimination against same sex couples and people who are in co-dependent relationships.</para></talk.start><para>I would advise very strongly against that, because the government will drive an extremely hard bargain. There are a number of bills it wants to get through but which face the hurdle of a double dissolution because they have been set aside by the Senate for being manifestly unfair, in one way or another, as far as the Australian people are concerned. The politics of this is very important. I think people should seize this opportunity. It comes about because the Labor Party has always blocked it before but has now changed direction, as Senator Bartlett said, and decided to come on board with the Greens and Democrats in moving to end discrimination against same sex partners and people in co-dependent relationships. It is an opportunity and it should be taken up and insisted upon by the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>15666</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have two questions for the minister, which she may be able to get some advice on, relating to issues that have been raised with me in the last fortnight. They are not in the area of same sex couples. Firstly, I understand that the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> applies to Norfolk Island. I had a call from someone on Norfolk Island who asked why the surcharge tax reduction bill did not apply to people on Norfolk Island. I know it is a very specific question. I presume the surcharge does not apply on Norfolk Island, but I was asked to confirm whether that is the case because of the unique arrangements that apply to Norfolk Island.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, in the Treasurer's announcement of the surplus for the last financial year there was a two-line note announcing that the surcharge tax revenue that was collected had gone up in the last financial year by some $290 million—I think that was the figure. If that is the case, does that mean the tax reduction in the surcharge bill, which we have passed, will cost more? Was that increased revenue taken into account when calculating the costs to budget of the loss of revenue with the passing of the reduction in the rates for the surcharge tax bill? The circumstances of the increase in tax collection from the surcharge tax in the last financial year may have been unique to that financial year and therefore will have no longer term impact, but it is an issue that has, again, been specifically raised with me in the last week. If the minister is able to provide an answer either now or at some later time, I would be interested to know it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>15667</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of issues that I will very briefly address. Firstly, a number of speakers this afternoon have referred to the need for the government to be flexible. I think the mere fact that we are here debating these bills with some prospect of them getting through either now or later is an indication of the government's flexibility and determination to concentrate on the policy purpose of these bills, which is, of course, to assist those earners of particularly low incomes to have opportunities to save for their retirement.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the same sex issues that have taken up a great deal of the debate, what I want to say very clearly is that there does appear—whatever the merits or otherwise of everything that has been said about same sex couples—to be a misunderstanding about the intended operation of these particular bills and their application to same sex couples. I want to place on the record very clearly again that the co-contribution and surcharge measures in the bills only apply to the individual. The bills do not distinguish between eligible individuals in same sex relationships or those in any other relationship. The co-contribution, for example, is just as available to an eligible gay or lesbian person as it is to an eligible married person or an eligible single heterosexual person. The same sex amendments, therefore, have no application to these bills because there is no possible discrimination in respect of the operation of these bills. I think that is the critically differentiating point. The government will honour the agreement it has with the Australian Democrats, which is confined to the subject matter of these bills. I do trust that this has clarified the basis of the government's decision.</para><para>There are a couple of other issues that I will deal with very briefly. I note the couple of issues raised by Senator Sherry. I do believe that Norfolk Island has some unique tax arrangements, and I suspect that that is the basis for the distinguished position in relation to the surcharge, but I will obviously check it. My understanding is that this was probably a one-off in relation to the increased revenue in this year's budget, but I will also check that. The information I have is that the surcharge revenue outcome was $299 million higher than expected in 2003-04, and the stronger than expected accrual outcome largely reflects a change in the accounting treatment for unfunded liabilities in respect of defined benefit schemes. Previously the liabilities associated with these schemes have not been recognised in the revenue estimates and outcomes. The recognition of unfunded liabilities reflects the change in accrued liabilities for unfunded defined benefit schemes since the introduction of the surcharge. In the 2003-04 year, the change in receivables for the surcharge will only include the change for the year.</para><para>That means that the figures in the supplementary explanatory memorandum have not been revised, and no change has occurred to the proportion of benefits flowing to the co-contribution compared to the surcharge rate reduction. It brings me to an earlier point: that the benefits still remain at 66 to 34 in favour of co-contribution, as we earlier put on the record. The figures have been estimated on a cash and not an accrual basis, and the change in the final budget outcome relates to an accrual basis, not a cash basis. That deals with the figures, but I will check the Norfolk Island issue.</para><para>There are a couple of other points that I want to raise. Senator Bartlett quite rightly alluded to the fact that issues to do with same sex relationships are not confined to superannuation. Indeed, it may be one of those areas where there is not so much an issue as perhaps in other areas of the law. If you were to get down to look at this, you would see it obviously requires further work and examination. Obviously, in those circumstances, you could also look at what to do with preferred beneficiaries and binding death benefits but, in any event, the government is not persuaded that changing definitions is an appropriate way to deal with the bills currently under consideration.</para><para>Without pre-empting Senator Brown's amendment, I do just want to say something very briefly about the amendment being moved by Senator Cherry. Senator Cherry is moving an amendment to section 10(1) of the SI(S) Act to amend the definition of `dependant'. I simply draw to the Senate's attention that the Democrats have already supported Senator Sherry's amendment to the same definition. It certainly would be helpful if we could clarify just what definition the Senate hopes to insert, because otherwise I think we will have a conflict. I raise it in the context of Senator Brown also bringing forward a similar amendment. We want a definition that does not conflict.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>15668</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In answer to Minister Coonan's previous question, the difference between my amendment and Senator Sherry's amendment is only the addition of the recognition of interdependency relationships.

The minister said—and again I am paraphrasing—that this bill does not discriminate against an individual on the basis of their sexuality. I think that is a disingenuous argument. It is not the case.</para></talk.start><para>I would make two points here. Firstly, all superannuation bills that come before this chamber are appropriate avenues to try and address this issue. The minister said—in what I took as a disparaging way—that we had debated the issue of same sex couples for some considerable time and at great length on this bill. The reality is that we are going to be debating same sex couple issues until we get a resolution. It is, in my view, the last great human rights movement, following the black civil rights movement and the wave of feminism. Certainly from my perspective—and obviously I have a personal interest—the most outstanding human rights issue in terms of lack of legislation is the way in which we acknowledge lesbian and gay people and their relationships. As a Western democracy, we fall far behind comparable jurisdictions in the way we do that. So I would say to the minister: yes, we have debated this at great length, but it is not the end of it, by any means. If it should fail on this occasion then there will be another and another and another. Persistence is what it is all about.</para><para>More importantly, the specific point I wanted to make was that it is not the case, in my view, that this bill is not one which ought to be addressed in terms of same sex couple amendments. I would argue that, should it pass, somebody taking advantage of the co-contributions under this scheme, whether they are a low- or high-income earner, may like the opportunity down the track or believe they have the right to leave the benefit they have gained under this scheme to their same sex partner. That is when the discrimination will come into play. This is an opportunity to attach these amendments. It is an opportunity to progress the debate and the issue, and it is a bill to which we ought to be considering these relationship amendments.</para><para>It is true, as the minister said, that there are many other areas of discrimination under Commonwealth law, not just quarantine and superannuation. There is similar discrimination in social security, taxation, veterans' affairs, the Federal Police, immigration and industrial relations. The only opportunity we have to debate all of those things fully, in a comprehensive and holistic way, is with an omnibus bill that deals with that. I remind the Senate again that we Democrats have such a bill and would dearly love Senate time and the opportunity to debate that thoroughly. That has not been the case to date. If the minister is indicating that the government might perhaps offer that opportunity in the future so that we could discuss all of these things in a comprehensive way, to the point of having a thorough debate and a vote on those issues, then I would very much welcome that. But, failing that, the only opportunity for those of us trying to prosecute this human rights agenda is with amendments to piecemeal pieces of legislation, and this is but one of them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>15669</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Greig is absolutely right. The figures are rough, but I want to bring that home. Under this legislation, if a copayment from the government is worth $1,000 with an extra contribution of $1,000 made by a low-income person to her superannuation fund and she wishes to leave that to her same sex partner, that same sex partner, in the event of her death, will get hit with 30 per cent tax. So actually $700 of the copayment, and $700 that the person has put in, will flow over rather than the $1,000. The discrimination that sits there in superannuation law flows into these amendments. The amendments coming from the Greens, Labor and the Democrats reverse that. These amendments, which end discrimination, flow back into superannuation law to get rid of discrimination altogether.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15669</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 3104:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 32), after item 9, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">9A Schedule (Form of Trust Deed) subrule 7(4) (definition of </inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">spouse</inline><inline font-weight="bold">)</inline></para><para>Repeal the definition, substitute:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">spouse</inline>, in relation to a member, means a person who is legally married to the member and includes a person who, although not legally married to the member, ordinarily lives with the member as his or her husband or wife or partner, as the case may be, on a permanent and bona fide basis.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">9B Schedule 1, paragraphs 9 (c) and (d)</inline></para><para>After “husband or wife” (twice occurring), insert “or partner”.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">9C Clause 12</inline></para><para>Repeal the clause, substitute:</para></quote><para>12.

So it is a definition that enforces the understanding that we are talking of here about the right of a person who is a superannuant to pass that superannuation on to a person with whom they have a relationship regardless.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>15670</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I have already indicated to the chamber on two previous occasions, the opposition supports these amendments. I have one final comment, which I should have mentioned earlier. Senator Brown would be well aware that in Tasmania we have recently had a debate on a package of measures to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. Whilst the total package did not pass, the area of superannuation was absolutely non-contentious. The removal of discrimination against same-sex couples for superannuation purposes in the state public service, where state government law applies, I do not think was even debated. It was accepted broadly by a very conservative upper house. There was no argument or resistance to ending the discrimination in superannuation in the state public sector funds in Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>I think Tasmania is probably the last state to remove discrimination in superannuation at a state government level. I am not absolutely sure about that. Certainly, I think that almost every other state and territory has removed the discrimination at a state level.

The opposition are particularly disappointed with the government's response to the Senate's amendments. We would have preferred a much better and different outcome for the Australian populace, or perhaps a better explanation as to why those amendments were not accepted by the government. The amendments moved in the Senate would have demonstrated a genuine commitment on the part of this parliament to ensure that the law gives greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant and breastfeeding women. The need for a change to the law was demonstrated by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Susan Halliday, in her role in the 1999 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>For all the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this issue about work and family, his government shelved that report for 17 months and took more than 2½ years to draw up the legislation. You could hardly argue that this government has embraced policies on work and family; in fact, you could easily draw the conclusion that the government has not embraced the issue and has not seen fit to deal with it in any substantive way. Perhaps what is worse is that the Howard government's legislation does not expand the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act to give greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant or breastfeeding women. The government's response to that report was less than weak. In the answer provided in the chamber today, I had hoped for a more broad explanation as to why the government has rejected the amendments and why it has decided not to pursue a broader approach on this issue.</para><para>The report clearly highlighted the issues, and I addressed them during the second reading contribution that I delivered on behalf of the shadow minister. Unfortunately, though, we ultimately find ourselves in a position of having to support the bill as printed. It is extremely disappointing that this government is not prepared to reconsider its weak response to these serious concerns. We have been placed in this position because of the inability of this government to pick up these work and family issues and progress them. It is acknowledged that the changes to the bill do assist but not to the extent that the report of the then commissioner, Susan Halliday, or the amendments proposed in this Senate could have. On that note, rather than prolong the issue any further, on behalf of the opposition I advise the Senate of our extreme disappointment. The government has again shown to the broader community a lack of commitment to work and family issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>15673</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Ludwig is correct: it is not only disappointing; it is extraordinarily disappointing. It was bad enough that the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline> was almost a couple of years after the significant recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Not only were the amendments piecemeal but they were pretty much clarifications of the existing provisions in the act. A number of the recommendations put forward by HREOC in an attempt to alleviate and/or prevent discrimination against women who were pregnant were left out. So we had a piece of legislation that did not do much but did a little bit. Thus, everyone now feels compelled to vote for it because women in the workplace who have faced this sort of discrimination have waited so long for such legislation. The fact that fundamentally important policy suggestions and recommendations put forward by HREOC were left out of this legislation has made aspects of it a joke. That is why we had a detailed, impressive and effective discussion about this legislation. That is why the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party moved amendments that would put into the legislation some of those badly needed changes—that is, the recommendations contained within the HREOC report. That is why the amendments should be insisted upon today but, as I have said, and certainly as Senator Ludwig articulated before me, because this legislation contains such urgent, necessary reform, people feel compelled to let it pass.</para></talk.start><para>When we debated this legislation last time, some of the amendments that were passed by a majority of the Senate included expanding the coverage of the act to federal statutory employees, judicial office-holders and members of parliament; extending the coverage of the act to unpaid workers; extending protection to employees who intend to or are in the process of adopting a child; removing the exemption of religious educational institutions—I acknowledge that that amendment, put forward by the Australian Democrats, was amended by the Labor Party and that that amendment passed the Senate—a provision that set out pregnancy discrimination standards, again with a further amendment by the Labor Party to the Democrat amendment; allowing complaints about discriminatory advertisements to be made notwithstanding that the complainant is not a person directly affected by that advertisement; allowing the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards to the Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement that he or she had received a written complaint; and a change to the bill's title to read: `A bill for an act relating to pregnancy and work and for related purposes'. That is, of course, from the original bill for an `Act to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and for related purposes'.</para><para>Beyond that, the Australian Democrats moved—unsuccessfully—a number of amendments that dealt with our ongoing concern that there is no national paid maternity leave scheme in this country, once again making Australia one of two OECD countries that do not have what is a basic work entitlement for its working women, and the impact it has on women in the work force, whether it is in relation to discrimination, people giving up their jobs—women's largely increasing expertise in the workplace being underutilised because they have to leave their jobs—or indeed deferring having children. Evidence tells us that this is having an impact on fertility rates in Australia, but this government keeps teasing women with the prospect of work and family reform. I think it is four times now that, publicly, our Prime Minister has teased Australian working women with the notion that they might get an entitlement that other women around the world take for granted, as they should.</para><para>Other Democrat amendments that were unsuccessful related to the issue of breastfeeding and the right of women to breastfeed in the workplace. But they would of course need certain entitlements to do so—for example, a place where women could express milk, store milk et cetera. Unfortunately those amendments were not successful. But the ones that were successful and have been rejected by the House of Representatives should be insisted upon. They should have been part of legislative reform not just today but years ago. I think everyone in this chamber knows that, so I still do not quite understand why the government has rejected the amendments. I am not talking about the paltry excuses that have been offered by the House of Representatives today and last time we had this debate.</para><para>I think this feeds into a broader debate, a debate that was probably touched on in the last debate that we just had in this chamber on superannuation. That is the fact that this country does not provide for full equality for all people. Equality denied includes equality that is delayed, and we have been delaying these amendments and these much-needed reforms for working women and for pregnant women, just as some people in this chamber very broadly would have the rights of gay and lesbian people denied as part of other debates, but I am sure we will get back to that.</para><para>The bill currently only clarifies existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and it ignores changes that would be more meaningfully able to assist Australian women. While the government's legislation implements only three of the 12 HREOC recommendations relating to the act, our amendments—and I am talking about the Democrat amendments with Labor support or with Labor amendments, or indeed the Labor amendments—would have incorporated most of those outstanding recommendations into the legislation. The rejection of the Senate's amendments is the government's latest refusal to deal with the needs of working women in this country. I have mentioned paid maternity leave and the broader issue of work and family balance. While I was not surprised that my amendments to this legislation to try and enact a national paid maternity leave scheme for the first time in Australia were not successful, that will not stop the Democrats continuing to campaign on this issue—indeed, continuing to promote the fact that we do have historic legislation tabled in this chamber ready to go that implements a scheme of paid maternity leave. </para><para>There are a range of other issues affecting working women and women who are not in the work force as well. I look at the issue of gender pay gaps, which has been highlighted recently. It is 30 years since we have had the equal pay for work of equal value campaigns, yet the women's and men's wages disparity continues to increase. We have seen in the last week a new census of Australia's top 200 companies that reveals that women make up only 8.8 per cent of executive managers compared with 15 per cent in the United States. Only four of these 200 companies have a female CEO. Of the 1,300 directors in these companies, only 109 are women. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency found that the percentage of company boards that do not contain any women increased from 46.7 per cent to 47.3 per cent in the last year. So it is getting worse, and I cannot say that federal legislation is doing anything to assist this process. In fact, dare I suggest that in the 21st century we are actually going backwards when it comes to women's rights in the workplace and women's rights in this country generally.</para><para>So, if I seem a little angry about this legislation, it is because I refuse to say that I am simply disappointed. I am angry. This legislation is long overdue. It was long overdue years ago, yet this government dillydallied around with actually putting anything into legislation. And, when they do, women of Australia and men of Australia too are supposed to be pathetically grateful that they have finally seen the implementation of the recommendations contained in that Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. And what are they? Three of the 12—and most of them are technical changes or clarifications to the act. If that is the best this government can do for Australian working women, I have no idea how they continue to get support from women and indeed men. If anyone in this chamber and anyone in this community cares about equality for all, not only would they be insisting on these amendments but the government would not have to be forced to make these changes, they would have initiated the changes. So not only is this disappointing but it certainly is an indictment on this government's record in relation to working women in particular, and specifically women who are pregnant. These are the same kind of women and the same kind of so-called family values that our Prime Minister is the first to boast about, the first to invoke, when he wants to talk about good values.</para><para>There is not much good news in this legislation for women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant and who do not want to face what seems to be in some workplaces inevitable workplace discrimination on that basis. So, yes, I am disappointed that the government did not take the opportunity to enact better legislation thanks to Democrat and Labor amendments, but I am pretty angry that it is trying to fob us off with what is a piecemeal piece of legislation that does not make much difference to the lives of Australia's working women.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>15675</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I said in my speech on the second reading of the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>, it was a disappointing bill for the reasons that the previous speaker outlined in terms of taking into consideration so few of the HREOC recommendations when framing the bill that was presented to the Senate some time ago. When that bill was presented to the Senate, the Senate improved the legislation to deal with many of the other HREOC recommendations put forward to deal with discrimination that women face in the workplace. It also put forward something on the public agenda that this Prime Minister has constantly ignored, which is the need for a national maternity leave scheme. The Greens supported that improvement to the legislation to ensure that women did have security in terms of their workplace and did have the capacity to balance work and family that this Prime Minister so constantly talks about, in a way which truly recognises the contribution that mothers make to the raising of children in this country.</para></talk.start><para>We saw yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper the Prime Minister commenting further on this issue. In his comments he again argued against the $213 million a year scheme put forward by the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, saying that he did not believe that it would increase fertility rates. We have had the previous speaker talk about the way in which it is already in fact having an impact on fertility rates. But to speak just about fertility rates within this debate is to miss the main point of the debate. It is about ensuring work entitlements for women who seek to balance work and family responsibilities. These are the improvements the Senate put into this poor piece of legislation that came before us. The Greens believe we should be insisting on these amendments so that we can have at least some steps towards improving the capacity for working mothers to be able to balance their family and work responsibilities.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>15676</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15676</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 29 September 2003 the Prime Minister announced significant changes to his ministry, which will further strengthen the government.

It is true that the Howard government remain committed to the responsible and strong management of the Australian economy. We have made the tough but necessary decisions to keep the budget in surplus. We have been able to direct money towards the important areas of health, education, national security and environment, while paying off the crippling debt we inherited from Labor's bungled management of the economy. The Australian economy continues to perform strongly. The International Monetary Fund, in its September 2003 world economic outlook, predicted that Australia will continue to be one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in the world. Despite the weak global economy and the lingering impact of the drought, the IMF forecasts that the Australian economy will grow by three per cent in 2003 and by 3.5 per cent in 2004.</para></talk.start><para>The particular good news is that unemployment is also expected to remain at record low levels. The IMF again commented favourably on our commitment to continuing repayment of public debt. So our policy proposals are fully costed and affordable. That is, of course, where we fundamentally differ from the Australian Labor Party. We thought the Labor Party might have seen the light.

We have had hints that Labor have the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate for the chopping block. That of course would not be surprising, because we know that Labor have never supported private health insurance. They have not had the courage to do so, but if they move in that direction it will of course detrimentally affect millions of Australians.

It is interesting to hear someone like Senator Bolkus making a contribution to this debate. I am surprised that he even knows what a sheep looks like, unless he looks at the seats in front of him! The import risk assessment process is now occurring. It will continue to occur should the sheep return to Australia. I mention again that the sheep returning to Australia is the last option. We are trying to do everything possible to sell them in the region where they currently are, now that they have been certified as being safe for human consumption and without any particular diseases. So that is the approach. Senator O'Brien also asked me whether we will make that import risk assessment available. I will refer that matter to Mr Truss, but I do not think there would be any difficulty in doing that. It is an issue. If the sheep do return to Australia, we will have to work very closely with the industry—in fact we are doing that at the moment—and we will also have to work very closely with all of the state governments. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We had a very long and involved discussion with all of the state ministers at the ministerial council meeting in Perth last Thursday. All of the state governments recognise that this is a difficult problem, one that needs a lot of goodwill and good thinking to overcome it. All of the states are cooperating and will be helpful in the approach. In fact, a joint Commonwealth-state group called the National Management Group, comprising state and Commonwealth officials, is already looking at that particular issue. I know that the states are supportive and are prepared to help—some more so than others, I might say. One state in particular was trying to make political points out of this because it is a Labor state, but the other six state and territory governments are all Labor states and they were most supportive. I understand that they addressed this in a most mature way. There will be a risk assessment done. I am assuming that it will be made public. It will have to be for the state governments, the industry and all those involved to address the risks that are determined.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15679</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The Northern Territory minister was at the ministerial council meeting where it was fully discussed. I do not recall him making any issue of it at the time. Perhaps he has done so since.

Last week the Treasurer released the final budget outcome for the 2002-03 financial year. That document very pleasingly showed that the cash surplus for 2002-03 was $7.5 billion, up from $3.9 billion forecast in May and the $2.1 billion surplus forecast at the time of the 2002-03 budget. The biggest driver of this better than expected surplus was the fact that company tax receipts were up $2 billion on the May forecast, an increase of 6.7 per cent. That of course is very good news because it reflects the continuing strength of company profits in Australia and the underlying strength of the economy, despite the drought and patchy world growth. It is also entirely consistent with the government's policy of keeping the budget in balance over the course of the economic cycle. Total cash payments in 2002-03 were down 0.8 per cent or $1.3 billion compared with the May estimate but were in fact $5 billion higher in 2002-03 than in the previous year.</para></talk.start><para>When we run a surplus of that kind, the surplus increases our cash reserves and thus reduces net debt. The 2002-03 surplus has the effect of reducing general government net debt to just $29.6 billion. So our government in 7½ years have now paid back $67 billion of Labor's debt, more than offsetting the $65 billion which the Labor government racked up in just their last four years in office. Our interest payments in 2002-03 were $3.6 billion. That is $4.8 billion less than we were paying when we came into office to pay off Labor's debt. We are saving $5 billion every year as a result of our reducing the debt we inherited from the Labor government. It is the first time since 1991-92 that the net debt has been below $30 billion and it is the lowest level of net debt to GDP since 1981-82. We have reduced our net debt to GDP to levels not seen since Bob Hawke became Prime Minister 20 years ago. </para><para>The obvious beneficiaries of this very good, very disciplined fiscal management are Australian families and Australian small businesses, because they are experiencing sustained low interest rates as a result of this fiscal discipline. Under the previous government, with all the debt they racked up, interest rates peaked at 17 per cent and they were still 10½ per cent when we came into office. Today the mortgage rate is only 6.55 per cent.</para><para>The 2002-03 budget outcome is very good news for Australian families and taxpayers. It confirms the strength of Australian companies, and that is very good for the people who work for those companies and for the Australians who are shareholders in those companies. It reduces debt to levels not seen since before the Hawke Labor government came to power and it keeps downward pressure on interest rates to the lasting benefit of home owners, consumers and small businesses.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title><page.no>15681</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15681</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads.

It is fair to say that there have been suggestions that either Christmas or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands could be used as a place to deliver the sheep and, ultimately, have them slaughtered. The reality, however, is that the facilities available on either Christmas or Cocos are quite limited. I think it is fair to say that either option would be regarded by the minister, Minister Truss.

There would be significant logistical problems in, firstly, unloading the sheep at either Christmas or Cocos.

The government's commitment is to ensure that the sheep remain healthy. Clearly, that cannot go on forever. I heard the vet's report—I think it was on Friday night or Saturday night's news—saying that the sheep were in remarkably good condition. But even that independent vet said that this cannot go on forever.

My information differs from yours, but I do agree with Senator Crossin that there are definitely logistical problems. There are definitely space problems, but also there are problems with water supply and with pellet supply.

Yes, I was aware of the changes because I was there; I was actually part of the announcement made together with the incoming health minister, Mr Abbott. Nothing changed between the previous few days and the date of the announcement. If you looked carefully at what I said in both my announcements and my press release, you would see what we were talking about was the low amounts of money incurred by the levy—that is, 80 per cent of doctors were being asked to pay not more than $1,500 per annum and 93 per cent of doctors were being asked to pay not more than $5,000 per annum. I had always indicated that, in respect of the higher amounts charged to specialists and certain specialist surgeons, there may be some anomalies within the way in which the IBNR was struck and that that was indeed something that the government could and would look at. I had always made that clear.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to look at the IBNR and the announcement made by Minister Abbott as giving a circuit-breaker to allow doctors to maintain their posts while the levy is looked at further. As we all know, the levy is not the only issue in medical indemnity. What is required is a much greater structural readjustment, which is well under way. That has two thrusts to it. The first is that the medical indemnity organisations have to be stable and that the medical indemnity industry must be financially viable in going forward, and the earlier part of that is in my portfolio. The second thrust to it is the affordability of arrangements that have to be made to enable the medical indemnity industry to be stable, and that is in Minister Abbott's portfolio. They interrelate in respect of some organisations, such as UMP-AMIL, which was the largest provider of medical indemnity to doctors in Australia and which is about to come out of provisional liquidation.</para><para>From the point of view of my portfolio responsibilities, there has been a major restructure of the medical indemnity industry so that all of these organisations are now subject to prudential requirements and subject to actuarial valuations so that they are unlikely to fall over in the way in which UMP-AMIL did. There are also ongoing issues to do with tort law reform, which is a state issue, but there has been in respect of most states substantial movement on tort law reform which will ultimately have a downward pressure on fees, charges and premiums. Another very important initiative that is being progressed through the ministerial meetings is the whole notion of risk management and professional standards. All of these things have to go forward, together with looking at other work force issues and other matters to enable doctors to be confident that these issues are being addressed. We all know that this was not of the government's making, but the government are here to fix this issue and fix it we will with measures designed to improve both the structure of the industry and the work force conditions of doctors going forward.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15684</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

In fact, most of the matters referred to in the press release and in earlier press releases still apply, such as the blue sky scheme to limit the liability of doctors in claims over $20 million, the run-off cover for retirement, the issues to do with exemptions under the levy so that retired doctors and those over 65 are exempt from the levy, and that those who are substantially in the public hospital system are still exempt from the levy. The important issues to do with the levy are that all doctors subject to it will pay up to $1,000, and there will be a moratorium while other issues are looked at as to whether there any anomalies in the overall design of the levy. But it is part of a very large package, as I indicated in my earlier answer—a package that I might say was supported by the Labor Party and which now needs to be supported again. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>15685</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

How is it that a statutory organisation, at arm's length from the government, can speak on behalf of the government on an issue of grave importance to the whole of humankind? Did the minister responsible for the cloning issue approve, or was he even consulted on, the text delivered by the National Health and Medical Research Council to the United Nations?

I have sought some information on this issue. Firstly, I am not aware of what consultation might have taken place between the minister and the NHMRC. Senator Harradine talks about whether or not they speak on behalf of the government. I would be surprised if they did; as an independent agency, I think they speak on their own behalf. As to whether they represent the government's views, if I accept what Senator Harradine has said—and I have not read what they said at the General Assembly—and if it is in conflict with the government's position, which I will now define to the Senate, then clearly they do not.</para></talk.start><para>The government's position is that we will continue to work towards a convention that is consistent with the act passed by this parliament—that is, the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act. We support the urgent development of a convention to ban human reproductive cloning. We are concerned that, given the absence of a consensus in the working group on this, attempts to develop a convention to ban all forms of cloning immediately may delay a ban on human reproductive cloning. While the Australian legislation bans both human reproductive and therapeutic cloning, we are also required to undertake an independent review on the operation of this legislation. That review, as most senators will recall, commences in December 2004. </para><para>To put it succinctly: the government's actions at the UN are in fact in total harmony with what the parliament wanted to do. We are pursuing the convention on the prohibition of human cloning. We understand that to pursue the further ban on cloning would actually hinder that progress. What we are doing is in harmony with what the parliament said. Also, because the parliament itself spoke on the issue of a review of therapeutic cloning, our activities in the UN to pursue the ban on human cloning convention and not to progress the other until our review has taken place are in fact—in the limited time I have been briefed on this—entirely in harmony with the parliament's will as well. That is the government's position and that is the position that the foreign minister communicated, as I understand it, to the UN. I will get back to the Senate in relation to what capacity the NHMRC speak at these international fora and also what consultation took place between the minister and the NHMRC on this issue.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15686</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question on two things.

As I indicated in the very first question, I will seek Mr Truss's advice, but I cannot imagine there would be any difficulty in releasing it publicly. The industry have been part of the assessment and have been taken into confidence, and all the state governments have had an input. With respect to some of my colleagues in the state governments, the lines of communication between Senator O'Brien, his advisor and many of the state governments are not all that secure from a government point of view. All of those things have to be involved. We will consult widely. For that reason, I cannot imagine why the import risk assessment would not be released at the appropriate time.

Might I congratulate the senator on an excellent question—and one, I might say, from a senator who, as with most Western Australian senators, as I look at my colleagues, spends an enormous amount of time on WA roads. Senator Peter Cook would support in a bipartisan way the fact that Western Australians understand about roads because, per capita, we have an enormous distance of them. What Senator Peter Cook may not agree with me on—in fact, he may privately—is the fact that, as the Australian government is working harder and harder to help Western Australia with roads, the Western Australian state Labor government and their transport minister are actually taking the money away.</para></talk.start><para>I think that Senator David Johnston would share with me and my Western Australian Senate colleagues the concern for not only this short-sighted approach of the state Labor government but in fact the long-term risks that that puts the state of Western Australia and ultimately the economy into. It will place at risk not just the economy—because we rely in Western Australia on transportation for our great industries outside the capital city and the regional centres to move equipment to the mines and to move stock and feed up and down from the farms to the ports—but also, very importantly, our tourism trade and the safety of families who travel vast distances for their normal holidays or the safety of those who, living in the north, visit Perth to see their families. We need good roads and we need safe roads for two obvious reasons. One is that they are the backbone of our economy; the other is that they are vital to the safety of families who get into the family sedan or four-wheel drive and travel across the vast and beautiful state of Western Australia, quite often in the holidays.</para><para>So what has the West Australian government done in the last couple of years in relation to road funding? It has quite clearly pursued an ideology which is to take money away particularly from non-metropolitan roads and redirect it for other purposes outside the roads portfolio into the metropolitan area. The state minister has pursued a policy that has slashed the maintenance budget for roads over the last three years, but she has not stopped there. The minister has just revealed that the WA state Labor government razor gang will slice $200 million off roads over the next four years. Can I just inform the Senate that Australian taxpayers, including WA taxpayers, will in fact put $200 million a year into WA roads. The $200 million we put in this year is being ripped out by the state minister over the next four years. We are putting in $200 million every year; she is taking out $200 million over the next four years.</para><para>As I have said, the state Labor minister and the state Labor government are slashing maintenance expenditure.

I apologise for misleading the Senate to that extent.</para><para>I wondered whether Senator Ian Macdonald was going to do the same thing when he stood up following question time to refer to some additional information he had. Certainly, in answer to the second question I asked of him at question time today, he advised that the process of completing an import risk assessment had not been concluded and that, when it was, he thought that information would be available. The fact of the matter is that, on 30 September, Minister Truss announced that a scientific import risk assessment had been done—that is, at the end of last month, the assessment to which I was referring in my question had been done. Obviously Senator Ian Macdonald had not been advised of that in his brief and was put in the embarrassing situation of misleading the Senate. I think that, on reflection, he will look at his answers and find the need to come in and correct the record because, unfortunately, I suspect that Minister Truss has again left one of the ministers in this place hanging out to dry.</para><para>The four questions we asked today were about the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> matter. The questions concerned sheep mortality aboard the livestock carrier, the quarantine risks associated with the return of the sheep and consideration of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as an offshore quarantine facility should the repatriation of the sheep proceed. Consistent with its behaviour throughout the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> crisis the government, and particularly Minister Truss, refused to provide comprehensive answers to the Senate on these important matters, and Senator Ian Macdonald's failure to provide precise mortality figures, including the projected mortality from any repatriation, is frankly no surprise.</para><para>Senators will recall the government's disgraceful response on 18 September this year to a Senate order for the production of documents related to sheep mortality on the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>. The government refused to comply with the order of the Senate due to `sensitive negotiations' on the fate of the sheep. That is a fair while ago, of course, and the negotiations have achieved nothing. But the government knew then how many sheep had died, as we now know they do get daily reports—that was admitted by Minister Macdonald. The government was quite prepared to divulge that information to foreign governments during negotiations to offload the sheep, but refused to comply with its obligations to the parliament. On 17 September, the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Taylor, similarly failed to provide a committee of this Senate with advice on mortality, claiming that he had been in Sydney and had not caught up with the latest news. Mr Taylor's trip must have been pretty exciting because the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee has waited 21 days, and counting, for the promised advice—it still has not arrived.</para><para>The second matter addressed in Labor's questions on live sheep concerned the import risk analysis related to the proposed return of the sheep to Australia. As I have touched on, it is clear that an analysis exists, yet Senator Ian Macdonald suggested in his first answer that it did not. He is obviously now clear that one does exist, and hopefully he is now in no uncertain terms advising Minister Truss's office that if he is to be briefed on these matters he should be properly and fully briefed so that he does not mislead the Senate.</para><para>Serious views are held about the potential quarantine risks associated with the return of a shipload of sheep that have spent at least six weeks in the gulf region. Dr Bill Gee, a former Commonwealth director of animal hygiene, a foundation director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Health, a former director of AQIS and a past president of both the Australian Veterinary Association and the world animal health organisation, the OIE, has expressed grave fears about the risks posed by the return of the sheep. The current president of the AVA has expressed deep concerns about this matter, as have important rural commodity and representative groups with regard to their imports, as well as meat processors in various parts of the country, given the impact that this is having on our exports of lamb to Europe and beef to Japan. In relation to this important import risk assessment, I have been calling for it from at least 24 September, but clearly the minister has put it in the public domain in the sense that it existed from 30 September. It should be released today. I look forward to it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15693</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think what Senator O'Brien has outlined in his contribution to this debate this afternoon reflects the view that all of us share in relation to this issue as it affects Australia's rural industries. The wool industry and the live sheep industry have had a terrible 10 years. This is not, of course, the first time that the live sheep trade to the Middle East has encountered difficulties. In fact, in the early 1990s—I think during Senator O'Brien's period as a member of the government at the time—the live sheep trade to the Middle East was suspended for some years. Prior to my coming into this place, I was a member of a delegation that visited the Middle East during the period in which the live sheep trade had been suspended. We visited Saudi Arabia and spoke with a number of representatives there. It was very clear that this was a particularly complex issue and that the answers were not simple. Fortunately, on that occasion, the live sheep trade was able to be resumed and has continued to this day.</para></talk.start><para>This ship aside, there are other shipments of live sheep that have gone to the Middle East and are being sold and unloaded without difficulty. At the moment the ship is in Kuwait and is reprovisioning. Notwithstanding the small fire that occurred on the ship a couple of days ago, it is due to leave this week. Hopefully by that time there will be some resolution of the issue and a new buyer for the sheep will have been found. Arrangements have been made to have an AQIS veterinarian and two experienced stockmen on board the vessel when it does sail from Kuwait later in the week.</para><para>Interestingly enough, while the ship has been in port, an independent veterinary inspection has been conducted by a veterinarian who reported that, notwithstanding the amount of time that these sheep have been in international waters—a very long time; I think we all agree that it is far too long—they are clinically fit and healthy. They are free from disease and are suitable for admission to any country in the region for human consumption. As I understand it, the veterinarian who carried out this inspection is from the animal version of the World Health Organisation, the OIE. As well, and importantly, this veterinarian reported that there was no evidence of scabby mouth on the sheep.</para><para>The Australian government's priority remains finding a home for these sheep. With so many countries looking for food, it is hard to believe that an acceptable resolution to this matter cannot be achieved. I understand that all options are being pursued to locate a suitable port so the sheep can be unloaded and transported to a new destination. However, in the event that there are no suitable ports in the region, work is continuing on the option to bring the sheep back to Australia, which I am sure is a resolution that nobody wants.</para><para>Nobody wants those sheep to have to travel back to Australia. There are a number of difficulties related to that, and some of them were outlined today by the minister. It is very clear that bringing them back is not the best option either for the sheep or for those growers in Australia, who do not want the sheep or any of the diseases that the ship may now be carrying coming back to dock in our port. However, at this stage we have three days when the ship will be in port in Kuwait. I know that the minister and other senior ministers in the government are focused on finding a resolution to this very difficult and complex question for the sake of the animals and for the sake of a very important and very valuable industry to Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15694</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was some 63 days ago that 57,000 Western Australian sheep left the port of Fremantle. Ever since that time, they have been travelling around the Middle East looking for a new home. As we now understand it, they are in Kuwait, where the ship is being resupplied with feed and provisions. There are now, at most, 52,000 sheep. The minister indicated that, when the ship, the MV <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>, docked at Kuwait, the government would use the time it took for the ship to be resupplied with feed and provisions to find a new purchaser and, if an alternative port were not found, the sheep would return to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The return of the sheep to Australia and their welfare are the main concerns. As Senator O'Brien pursued today, the government needs to come clean with the import risk assessment. The government also needs to come clean with any of its quarantine arrangements, which are part of that import risk assessment, if they return to Australia. If they are to return to Australia, the Howard government must address all the potential risks associated with that return. Those risks include quarantine from fodder- and insect-borne diseases. As we all know, the Middle East is one of the riskiest areas in the world for animal diseases, and the existing Australian import protocols prevent the importation of live sheep from that region for any reason. In fact, the Australian import protocols prevent the importation of live sheep from anywhere other than New Zealand.</para><para>For all we know, the sheep aboard the MV <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> may have been exposed to exotic diseases, including bluetongue. The return of these sheep without adequate quarantine protocols would be inconsistent with the conservative quarantine regime Australia has maintained quite proudly for some 200 years. We need to ensure that Australia's livestock industry enjoys continuing freedom from the many pests and diseases endemic in many other countries, particularly bluetongue. I know that that is of concern to my home state government in Western Australia. As has been outlined before, the Northern Territory government has expressed similar concerns and therefore has looked at ruling out accepting the return of the sheep.</para><para>The Western Australian government has advised that, if the sheep were returned to Fremantle or some other port, it would demand an ironclad assurance from the Commonwealth that there was not an unacceptable level biosecurity risk—that is, risk of disease or quarantine breaches. That is a particularly important issue not just for the long-term security of the industry but also for public confidence in what is quite a controversial industry and quite a controversial trade. Indeed, it was Labor that ensured an independent review of the live sheep trade at the Primary Industries Ministerial Council in Perth on 2 October. It was Labor that pursued these issues, not the Howard government. It is Labor that supports a humane trade in live animals but recognises the future of the industry is at stake if the Commonwealth cannot give certainty in animal welfare outcomes to the Australian people as well as to our overseas markets.</para><para>In view of the adverse international media coverage of the MV <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> and the other incidents that have been alluded to, it is vital to the interests of all Australians and to our international trade that the Commonwealth reviews its current arrangements to provide for much greater transparency in reporting and public confidence in animal welfare outcomes. During this debacle the remaining sheep have now been repurchased by LiveCorp. LiveCorp is mainly an industry body. It is my view and Labor's view that there does not appear to be an appropriate separation of regulation from the direct industry involvement. There has been an outright criticism of LiveCorp in that it plays both the role of industry representative body and regulator. In a situation like this, that is inappropriate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15695</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am disappointed that the Labor Party, the official opposition, has taken the stance of criticising the devastation that has been caused to the live sheep export trade without offering any solutions whatsoever. As a grower of wool for many years on a reasonably large scale and as an exporter of sheep, I feel as if I have some authority on this subject and can speak about it in this chamber. The troubles with the live sheep export by this particular ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>, started perhaps before it slipped the hawsers in Fremantle and the sheep ceased to belong to Australia. On inspection, the sheep had an estimated 0.035 per cent scabby mouth. Scabby mouth can be brought about by a disease factor—it is contagious—or an appearance of it can be brought about through eating hard pellets, which often causes abrasions to the sheep's mouth and passes as scabby mouth. </para></talk.start><para>The sheep have been inspected in the gulf prior to the proposed unloading and after they had been rejected by Saudi Arabia. Because there was no scabby mouth found or any other disease, the sheep were offered to other countries. Other countries, most notably with significant Muslim populations, all rejected the sheep for one reason or another. I am at a loss to say why Saudi Arabia rejected the sheep when they were owned by a Saudi Arabian. I am at a loss to say why they should not have been purchased by another country. I am also at a loss as to why they should not return to Australia and that action be endorsed by this chamber if those sheep are found to be disease free, which they are at the time of speaking. Not only are those sheep disease free but they are actually putting on weight on the ship. </para><para>If the sheep are not sold, I understand tomorrow or Thursday is the arbitrary time given for when they will be returned to Australia. But I understand that countries on the east coast of Africa have also been approached. There may be a sale to the countries on the east coast of Africa; I am unsure of that.

It amazes me that people with a union background who are not associated with rural or primary industries suddenly are becoming experts on them. I can tell you this, Mr Deputy President: the feedlots on which these sheep are fattened and the feedlots to which they go in Saudi Arabia and other areas in the Middle East are infinitely smaller than that proposed on a place like Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and that destination is a place they could be tested for any disease that is not apparent now. There are no identifiable diseases in the sheep at the moment. Yes, I would be a purchaser of those sheep if they came to the mainland, not if they are on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The sheep are fit and healthy and they are free from disease, as I said, at the time of speaking. They were passed for slaughter in the regions of these destinations and they are also passed for human consumption. There is no evidence, according to the veterinarians on the ship, of scabby mouth. I say that because perhaps the experts on the other side with trade union backgrounds, disassociated from primary production, have a different opinion.

It is a pity that such attention was not given to others that lay wanting at sea over the past couple of years under this government. But let us get to the issue at hand. It seems that anything trapped at sea under this government really has no prospect of a good future. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to whether or not these sheep ought to be offloaded on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, it was very disappointing of the minister, in answer to his first question as minister, not to be able to categorically rule out that Cocos Island would be used. It is very sad to see, and let us hope that Minister Campbell is not going to continue the legacy of poor relationships that this government has had with Christmas and Cocos islands as we have seen under Senator Ian Macdonald and Mr Tuckey. I was hoping we might have had at least a change of heart under this minister. One waits to see whether that is going to be the case. Here was his perfect opportunity to stand up and say that he would categorically rule out the sheep being offloaded on Cocos Island, but he did not do that. In fact, he said, `I would not want to rule it out.' That is very disappointing. </para><para>Why can't the sheep go to Cocos Island? For starters, there is no port for the ship to moor in in order to offload the sheep. I assume they would have to be dumped into rubber dinghies or into patrol boats and taken ashore 100 at a time. But there is actually no port at Cocos Island because it is a coral atoll. It is West Island we are talking about, which is only 600 metres wide by 14 kilometres long. There is an old quarantine station on Cocos Island that has not been used for that purpose for many years. It was used to house 70 Sri Lankan asylum seekers some years back but it has not been used as a quarantine station for many years. </para><para>In fact, earlier this year during the estimates process and during a parliamentary committee meeting with the department of territories looking into the annual reports of Christmas and Cocos Islands, a question was asked about the quarantine station, the unused facility on the islands. Labor representatives believe that this is a facility that should be handed back to the Cocos shire. When officials were asked earlier this year in a parliamentary committee hearing whether or not they believed that should happen, their view was yes, and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service representative said that, although the site was currently listed as a Commonwealth asset, it had no value attached to it. The official also advised that the facility was so degraded that it could not be used without major structural upgrades.</para><para>The shire of Cocos Island have been calling for a long time for this facility to be handed over to them so that they can actually use it. There are a couple of hundred acres of land and it is very overrun; the grass was extremely tall and overrun the last time I was there. This is a section of land that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council could well use, but no-one wants to use it to offload this government's problem and 50,000 sheep. I might add that there are 600 people on Cocos Island so, at this rate, they would all get 900 sheep each on a per head of population ratio. They would all get 900 sheep each. That is pretty well enough roast legs of lamb to last them about 18 years, so maybe at the end of the day they could do well out of this. I do not think that a big rush on roast lamb is what is needed on Cocos Island.</para><para>What is needed is for this government to sit down and talk to the people on Christmas and Cocos islands. That would be an unusual event for this government, because this government have constantly used the Indian Ocean territories to dump their problems. It is a kind of out of sight out of mind view regarding Christmas and Cocos islands. Cocos Island is not an appropriate place to put the sheep. The CEO of the shire council, Mr Jarvis, said so last Saturday. The island is too small and the facilities are inadequate. You could not get the sheep off the ship, let alone house them or feed them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Human Cloning</title><page.no>15697</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>15697</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (Senator Ian Campbell) to a question without notice asked by Senator Harradine today relating to the cloning of human embryos.</para></motion><para>Minister Campbell indicated that he had received advice and he quoted from some of that advice. Some of the advice suggested that the action Australia is taking at the United Nations would ensure that there would not be a delay in a reproductive cloning ban—those were the words that were given to him. Cloning is cloning is cloning. It is exactly the same process whether the outcome is for reproductive purposes or whether it is for the purposes of cloning a human embryo specifically for destructive experimentation. You could have two embryos, for example, from the same process—one is transferred to the womb of a woman and the other one is killed for the purpose of utilisation in research. There should be a condemnation of both those uses.</para><para>The minister referred to `therapeutic cloning'. That is a misstatement, and the term was used in the National Health and Medical Research Council's invitation to state and territory health authorities. The Australian Health Ethics Committee is a statutory body, and the NHMRC must observe its rules. The chairperson said this about the particular phrase:</para><quote><para>In the ethical guidelines AHEC reaffirmed and applied the well accepted distinction between a) therapeutic research and b) non-therapeutic research. Therapeutic interventions are interventions directed towards the well-being of the individual embryo involved, and non-therapeutic interventions are interventions that are not directed towards the benefit of the individual embryo but rather towards improving science, knowledge and technical application.</para></quote><para>The use of the term `therapeutic cloning' by any public servant who gave that advice to the minister is an absolute disgrace. It was clearly shown to be such by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. If that is the road that we are going along, we are actually undermining the basic principle which should govern research on humans. What emerged from the Nuremberg trials and the Helsinki agreements was that in all research on humans the interests of the individual subject must take precedence over the interests of science or society. Once we lose that principle, there is no end to the problems that we will face. This is the way in which some of those in the United Nations are going. It is of great concern to me that the National Health and Medical Research Council spoke on behalf of the government and now the government appears to be tied to that particular statement.

It is probably unfortunate that procedures in the Senate these days mean that petitions are pretty much waved through with just the tabling of a list rather than being read out as used to be the case. I simply want to draw the Senate's attention specifically to a petition tabled here from close to 22,000 people regarding the live animal trade, which the Senate has just been debating. It is a matter of great interest to people in the community. I am fairly sure that this is the largest petition tabled in the Senate so far this year. I also understand that, in the last couple of years, there have been sizeable petitions tabled on this issue, with pretty close to the largest number of signatures on a particular issue, not necessarily the top but they are certainly right up there. I think it is worth drawing the Senate's attention to the size and significance of this petition and also noting that a petition with a larger number of signatures, about 26,000, from citizens of the UK was presented to the Australian High Commissioner in London over the weekend as well. Given the level of concern in the community on this issue, I thought it appropriate to specifically draw the attention of all senators to this petition.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1></para></petition.group><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>15701</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>15701</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ridgeway</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on forestry plantations be extended to the last sitting day in 2003.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brandis</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the order of the Senate of 9 September 2003 authorising the Economics Legislation Committee to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on 13 October 2003, be varied to provide that, after consideration of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Bill 2003, the committee also take evidence on the provisions of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 2003.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brandis</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Economics Legislation Committee be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on Tuesday, 28 October 2003, from 4.30 pm, to take evidence for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2003.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, no later than the next day of sitting, the following documents:</para><para>	(a)	the advice provided by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) in August 2002, as outlined in paragraph (3) of question on notice no. 1750 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 15 September 2003, p. 14473), relating to the options for vaccination programs ahead of other ATAGI recommendations;</para><para>	(b)	the submissions received by the National Health and Medical Research Council as part of its public consultation on the draft 8th Australian Immunisation Handbook;</para><para>	(c)	all documents relating to the government funding, its requirements of and the subsequent performance of the National Consortium for Education in Primary Medical Care Alternative Pathway Program since its inception, including any review documents;

notice, I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 612.</para></motion><para>I have moved this suspension of standing orders because the matter has urgency, is extremely germane to the current business of this country and is extremely important in the matter of the country having a right to believe that its leadership is dealing with it directly and honestly in, above all matters, the decision to use its armed services—in this case 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel—to invade another country. The Prime Minister has deceived Australia in this matter. In March this year the Prime Minister announced that Defence Force personnel from this country would be joining those sent by President Bush from the United States and Prime Minister Blair from the United Kingdom to invade Iraq. The Prime Minister did that on the basis—and I quote from his speech to the nation:</para><quote><para>We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale. </para></quote><para>We know that the Prime Minister was wrong in those matters, that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction and therefore was not able to create the death and destruction from weapons of mass destruction on the mammoth scale asserted by the Prime Minister, which of course led to a response of some considerable fear in this country. The Prime Minister then went on to make his second claim, that these weapons threatened Australians. He said:</para><quote><para>Iraq has long supported international terrorism ... International terrorism knows no borders ... Australia and Australians anywhere in the world are as much targets as any other Western country and its people. </para><para>Therefore the possession of chemical, biological, or even worse still, nuclear weapons by a terrorist network would be a direct undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people.</para></quote><para>It was under those circumstances of imminent, direct, undeniable and lethal threat to the Australian people that Prime Minister Howard asked our defence forces to take part in the invasion of Iraq. Now with the passage of history it has become abundantly clear that the Prime Minister was not just a bit wrong but totally wrong. Never before in the history of this nation has a leader sent the defence forces of this country to a war, much less the invasion of another country, on a deception, on a complete fabrication which did not relate to and was not germane to the truth of the circumstances in Iraq. This is a matter of enormous moment for this nation. This is a matter of extreme concern for all those who believe that, in a democracy, ultimately one has to depend on the honesty and truthfulness of the leader of the country relying on the available intelligence before putting even the potential for sacrifice of Australian lives at threat.</para><para>We know now that Australia was not threatened by Iraq. We know that Australian lives were put at risk unnecessarily. We know that this Prime Minister, even when faced with the truth of those matters, seems to be in denial. He seems incapable of coming to grips with the fact that he was central to this deception. He took upon himself the authority—through his word, which has been shown to be wrong—to send Australians into this invasion. It is, therefore, absolutely imperative that the Prime Minister be censured. It is important that this debate take place; that the Senate look at the record of the last six months and before that, and make a decision to support this censure motion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedural Motion</title><page.no>15710</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (3.54 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That general business notice of motion no. 612 may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today till determined.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Censure Motion</title><page.no>15710</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>15710</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes:</para><para>	(i)	the claims by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, in the lead up to the war with that country, have proven false, and</para><para>	(ii)	that the Prime Minister failed to adequately inform the Australian public on intelligence agency warnings that a war with Iraq would increase the likelihood of terrorist activity; and</para><para>	(b)	censures the Prime Minister for misleading the country in his determination to join the President of the United States of America, Mr G.W. Bush, in the war on Iraq.</para></motion><para>I have already outlined the deception engaged in by the Prime Minister in March this year when he sent Australian defence forces good and true to Iraq. I want to continue from there to look at the situation as it obtains now in the Prime Minister's mind. We have had six months and more in which the Prime Minister has said to the country, `Wait! The proof will come through'—but it has not. Most recently, the report of Dr Kay in the United States has, despite the best efforts of 1,200 weapons inspectors, revealed that no weapons of mass destruction have been found. As I have said, what is particularly unbecoming to Prime Minister Howard in this matter is his inability to come to grips with the fact that he was a pivotal part of a mass deception on the most important decision that a Prime Minister can make. He has changed his ground to cover that deception. In other words, he knows about it. On 24 September on the <inline font-style="italic">World T</inline><inline font-style="italic">oday</inline> ABC radio program, Prime Minister Howard said:</para><quote><para>Those who advocated another course have to accept—</para></quote><para>that is, those who opposed him—</para><motion><para>that if their advice had been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Iraq with all of the torture and the human rights abuses that is involved in that. You can't have it both ways, because if America and her allies had not acted then Iraq would still be run by Saddam Hussein.</para></motion><para>This is Prime Minister Howard taking a shot at those people—the majority of Australians—who, in the run-up to the war, opposed his impending action to go to war. At this point, six months later, he is indicating that the outcome justifies the war because Saddam Hussein has been removed. Yet, when we go back to the National Press Club on 14 March this year, it is a different story. Michelle Grattan from <inline font-style="italic">The Age</inline> asked:</para><quote><para>Mr Howard, if as you advocate, countries in the Security Council got behind the resolution and a miracle happened and Iraq said yes it would say the game was up and disarmed, but Saddam Hussein was still there, would this be enough for peace given the strong case you have made today for regime change in the name of the Iraqi people?</para></quote><para>Here is the Prime Minister's reply in March:</para><quote><para>Well I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that.</para></quote><para>Here we have our Prime Minister now accusing those who cavil, criticise and accuse him of misleading this nation of in some way having failed to see that the invasion was to justify the removal of Saddam Hussein. But, by his own words, that is patently not the case. The Prime Minister has moved ground because he knows he was wrong when he led this nation into the invasion on the basis of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of terrorism. There is in this—in the Prime Minister's own mind—a degree of mischief, a degree of manipulation of and a degree of misrepresentation to the people of this country who opposed what he did. Not only was this Prime Minister misleading the country in March but also he is now abusing the country in September and October.</para><para>If you went back to the Prime Minister's earlier asseveration that weapons of mass destruction were in Iraq, that Iraq was part of the web of terrorism and, what is more, that the Australian people were threatened like all the other Western democracies, you might find that now that has been disproved. In May this year the Prime Minister was still saying, `Wait,' but he has given up on that now. The Prime Minister might say, if he were a man of integrity: `Well, I got it wrong. I took selectively from intelligence reports from this country, from Britain, from the US and from elsewhere, and I got it wrong.' The Prime Minister might say, `I made an enormous mistake.' He might excuse himself on the basis of the selective intelligence that was used at the time, but he might restore faith in his word by doing so. But not this Prime Minister. On last Friday's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program, reporter Nick Grimm said:</para><quote><para>Regardless, John Howard says he has no regrets about sending Australia to war.</para></quote><para>The quote from Mr Howard:</para><quote><para>We had clear intelligence assessments that Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction capability. That ... was the basis of the judgement we made at the time we joined the coalition and I don't retreat from that one iota.</para></quote><para>The problem with the Prime Minister is that he does not retreat one iota from what he said in March. He was wrong, but he does not retreat. He was patently misleading the nation, but he does not change his position one iota. He made the greatest political mistake in recent Australian history, which was to commit our defence forces to an invasion of another country on false pretences, but he does not retreat from that one iota. This Prime Minister deserves to be censured because of that attitude to this country, to its defence forces and to the people of this country who have a different point of view and who were right when the Prime Minister was wrong when they turned out in their hundreds of thousands to oppose his trajectory into war at the behest of the White House. That is the mark of a leader who does not deserve to have the faith of a parliament or the faith of the people. He should be censured.</para><para>Was the Prime Minister deceived? I contend that he was not. I contend that, like President Bush and like Prime Minister Blair, this Prime Minister selectively took information which supported the political trajectory of the day—the White House's post-September 11 determination to invade Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein. I still contend that oil was at the centre of that impulsion. I still contend that gaining economic ascendency in the Middle East is entirely central to the need of not just the United States but the rich world to stay rich while the rest of the world stays poor in the coming decades. Whatever turns out to be the truth—and it appears very much that the United States is determined to maintain control over the second biggest oil deposits in the world—we can go back to the year before the war and to material uncovered and released in the United States by John Pilger. John Pilger recently uncovered video footage of Secretary of State Colin Powell saying in Cairo on 24 February 2001:</para><quote><para>He (Saddam Hussein) has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbours.</para></quote><para>That is the US Secretary of State saying in 2001 that Saddam Hussein was disabled. Pilger goes on to say that two months later Condoleezza Rice reportedly said:</para><quote><para>We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.</para></quote><para>The intelligence situation which began before the White House manipulated domestic and then world opinion as best it could towards the invasion of Iraq was a recognition that Saddam Hussein had been disabled post the first Iraq war in 1991. What is more, after 1998 when the UN weapons inspectors had found nothing and were expelled, there was no reason to change that assessment. So, by 2001, that assessment stood. There is a lot of conjecture now about defectors from Saddam Hussein giving spin. Supporters of Mr Chalabi—who now enjoys American patronage in the Iraq people's council—came back saying that chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction were here, there and somewhere else. That spin from those politically motivated people seems to be the core of the fabrication of the weapons of mass destruction story that led to this war, to the deaths of hundreds of allied service people and to the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis this year.</para><para>I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that before the invasion both the CIA and ASIO warned that terrorism could increase as the result of an invasion of Iraq, and they have been found to be right. It is patently clear that in the intelligence agencies in the US, in the United Kingdom and here in Australia there were those who had reservations, to say the least, who had a countermanding point of view about Saddam Hussein's potential in weapons of mass destruction, but they were sidelined. We in the rich and powerful Western world, where we have a responsibility commensurate with that richness and that power, are in danger of allowing political spin to override factual gathering of intelligence information in the service of those who happen to be in elected office at any given time. This is an extraordinarily dangerous thing in a world in which we have one hyperpower and a number of acolytes.</para><para>I do note that President Bush will be coming to this parliament if a bill is passed by the Senate in the coming three weeks. No doubt it will be to return to the Prime Minister of Australia John Major—I am sorry, John Howard; that mistake was made by the US State Department last week—some of the support in his hour of need that John Howard gave to President Bush—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—It is more appropriate for you to call him Prime Minister or Mr Howard.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—That he gave to President Bush in the earlier part of this year. We have here a Prime Minister who is practised in the art of deception. This is the `children overboard' Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who has not learnt from the Gulf of Tonkin and the deception by the United States President on that occasion against his own people to justify the invasion of North Vietnam. He has not learnt from the `babies in the incubator' fabrication in the United States which helped to justify the invasion of Kuwait 12 years ago. But he has become part of that trajectory which is so dangerous to the world. It must be stated that if in the democratic world—and President Bush has particular responsibility here—we cannot have utmost probity, utmost honesty and utmost forbearance against the intrusion of political spin into the decisions which lead to war between nations then we are on a perilous course.</para></talk.start></continue><para>President Bush will come in two weeks time to be feted by the Prime Minister, at great expense to the Australian people, in this parliament—a privilege not afforded to many other heads of state who do not meet the Australian Prime Minister's political predilections. The question should be: should not President Bush, if he is coming to this parliament, engage in a debate with the members of this parliament? I would like to ask President Bush about how he became so deceived that he misled his own people—some hundreds of them to their deaths—by fabricated words coming from his own mouth about Saddam Hussein, weapons of mass destruction and the threat of terrorism coming from Saddam Hussein.</para><para>Has not this President, supported by our Prime Minister, in one year, converted Iraq from being one of the least threatening countries to other countries in the world into one of the most dangerous countries as far as the potential for the export of weapons and terrorism to the rest of the world? Has that not been the outcome of President Bush's and Prime Minister Howard's activities? Will this President care to engage in a debate with the representatives of the people of Australia in their parliament or are we simply going to be treated by this Prime Minister to a President giving an address with the rest of the parliament mummified in their seats and unable to respond? Because that is what the Prime Minister plans. Presidents and prime ministers will come and go, but never will this Prime Minister take from the record his deception of Australia, aided and abetted by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, against the wisdom of most other countries in the world, including France, Germany and China, in invading Iraq at the start of this year. </para><para>There are still a good many Australians in Iraq, and there will continue to be Australians working for the benefit of humanity in that country. But the circumstances in which they work are fraught and were made much more dangerous by the decision of the Prime Minister to include this country in that invasion at the start of this year. This Prime Minister's behaviour, his deceit and then his failure once he recognised that he had got it wrong to be able to accept and say that he had been wrong is the mark of a politician rather than a statesman. It is the mark of a forelock tugger to the White House rather than a leader of the independent nation of Australia. </para><para>It is time this nation was led by a person who held Australia foremost. It is time this nation made decisions in foreign affairs and in military matters according to the needs of this nation, but we will not get that from this Prime Minister. I have no doubt that the government will defend the actions of the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that some blame will be placed on members of the Public Service and of the intelligence agencies. I have no doubt that Senator Hill in his speech to follow will try to defend the indefensible.

It was disappointing. It lacked his usual flair and he even seemed to lack enthusiasm. He struggled to fill in 20 minutes, and I should say at the outset that I am not even going to try. This, of course, is a stunt. The history of this motion is that notice was given on 18 September. There was an issue during the last sitting, which of course is now a fortnight ago, in relation to a report of the British joint intelligence community and whether it gave warning to its masters in Britain of potential terrorism consequences related to an invasion of Iraq. That issue was debated in this parliament and, as Senator Brown knows, the Prime Minister was questioned at some length. He provided his answers, and little has been heard of the issue in the last fortnight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Brown comes in here today and says, `Well, what is today's stunt?' He goes through the old notices of motion on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> and he finds this one, which he gave on 18 September, and tries to create some urgency from it, claiming that something has occurred that justifies him weeks later coming in and trying to censure the Prime Minister. It is legitimate to have a debate on these issues. I do not quarrel with that. The issues are important, but the process that Senator Brown has adopted today is nothing more than a stunt and should be treated as such. Within the notice of motion that he gave a long time ago in this place, Senator Brown said that the government failed to adequately inform the Australian public of any risks that might be associated with being a party to an invasion of Iraq. I simply remind the Senate what the foreign minister, Mr Downer, said on 10 February in the other place when talking about the specific risks:</para><quote><para>There would also be heightened potential for terrorist activity and civil unrest in the event of conflict in Iraq.</para></quote><para>There it is: the foreign minister of this country clearly and unambiguously stating that there is a risk and the public should be aware of it. The Prime Minister himself, on 24 March, said in the parliament:</para><quote><para>... threat levels against Australian interests in a number of countries overseas—especially in the Middle East—have been raised because of the war in Iraq.</para></quote><para>There was no attempt to hide the fact that during a time of conflict there are increased risks associated with that conflict. In circumstances where we believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, there were particular threats associated with the potential use of weapons of mass destruction. We made that clear to the Australian public. It was important that it be made clear and that was the reason that both the foreign minister and the Prime Minister did so. That is the clear answer to the allegation that Senator Brown made in his notice of motion on 18 September. The Prime Minister did inform the Australian people of the risk. Whether or not Senator Brown thinks that was done adequately is interesting but it is certainly not a reasonable basis for a censure.</para><para>In relation to the broader question of the justification for the action against Iraq, it is interesting to look at the findings of the Iraq survey group, which, as we all know, recently put down an interim report. If Senator Brown wanted to make something a little more current, he might have chosen to debate that report. Then, at least, we would have had a debate that was contemporary. Australia decided, in Australia's national interest, to join a coalition of the willing in a military action against Iraq in order to enforce various United Nations Security Council resolutions. The ISG interim report in relation to that matter was interesting in that the ISG found many material breaches of United Nations sanctions. They included evidence of dozens of continuing undeclared Iraqi WMD related research and development activities, many pursued separately, so easily denied but reconstructed quickly when UN sanctions eased. They found deep involvement by Iraqi intelligence services of undeclared networks of laboratories suitable for chemical and biological weapons research; evidence of an extensive targeted campaign to conceal, disperse or destroy evidence of these WMD related programs both before, during and after Operation Iraqi Freedom; indications that Saddam Hussein was firmly committed to acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities; and evidence that Iraq was committed to developing proscribed missiles and other WMD capable delivery systems, including new evidence of programs never declared to or discovered by the United Nations.</para><para>What we and others believed at that time was that there was a risk in allowing Saddam Hussein to continue with programs and fail to meet obligations that had been put on him by the international community. This is the case of a person who not only had weapons of mass destruction but had actually used them against his own people, in the case of chemical weapons, and used them against his neighbours. This is an instance of a regime where for 12 years the international community, through peaceful means, tried to give itself the confidence that he was no longer a threat but which failed to receive the cooperation from Saddam Hussein that was necessary to satisfy itself that the threat no longer existed. It was with great reluctance that a number of countries said they would no longer be prepared to accept that threat. It was with reluctance because obviously nobody wants to go to war. It was with reluctance also because it was a responsibility that the Security Council should have taken up itself. It was the Security Council's failure to ensure the resolutions it passed for 12 years were enforced that left a number of countries, including Australia, with the view that in order to properly act in the security interests of their own people they had no alternative but to take this action. In our view, on the basis of his continuing failure to accord with the obligations placed upon him by the international community and the intelligence that was available to us at the time, it was the correct decision to take in the interests of the safety and security of the Australian people. We took that decision, and we still believe that it was correctly based.</para><para>When you come back to the motion that was moved today, this is an attempted censure by Senator Brown on the Prime Minister. He says that the Prime Minister should be censured because the claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have proven false. The Iraqi survey group has only put down an interim report after three months. It says that it is premature to reach such a conclusion. It does, however, point to a whole range of failures of Saddam Hussein to meet the obligations that had been required of him by the Security Council and sets out a whole range of ways in which Saddam Hussein's behaviour was clearly threatening to the international community.</para><para>Senator Brown secondly says that the Prime Minister should be censured because he did not explain the risks to the Australian people of going into such an action. As I have said and indicated, not only he but also the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly explained those risks. On that basis I would respectfully put to you, Mr Deputy President, that there is certainly no basis to censure the Prime Minister. If there is a basis for anything, it is to applaud the fact that we have a Prime Minister who has the courage to take difficult decisions that, in all the circumstances that exist at the time, justify an action as necessary to protect Australia and Australian interests. The government will certainly oppose this motion for the stunt that it is. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>15716</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say this has been a very lacklustre censure debate. It is very disappointing that the Leader of the Government in the Senate could only speak for 10 minutes in defence of Mr Howard. Some would say that it is a valiant effort for anyone to manage to stitch together 10 minutes in relation to this. I was a little disappointed also, I think, in Senator Brown's contribution to the debate. But it is an important issue—a very important issue—because we are debating a censure of the Prime Minister for misleading the Australian people about the reasons for going to war with Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>No evidence to date has been produced that can justify the Prime Minister's claims before the war that Iraq possessed stockpiles of completed biological and chemical weapons, yet the Prime Minister used these claims to justify why Australia needed to go to war with Iraq. This is what Mr Howard told the ABC back in September last year about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction:</para><quote><para>There is no doubt on the evidence, on the intelligence material available to us, that not only does Iraq possess chemical and biological weapons, but Iraq also has not abandoned her nuclear aspirations.</para></quote><para>Furthermore, Mr Howard told parliament on 4 February 2003:</para><quote><para>The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.</para><para>We share the view of many that, unless checked, Iraq could, even without outside help, develop nuclear weapons in about five years.</para></quote><para>These days, however, Mr Howard merely refers to weapons programs. Mr Howard told Melbourne radio a few weeks ago:</para><quote><para>I certainly believe there will be evidence found that they had programs.</para></quote><para>They are Mr Howard's words. That is the spin—not weapons of mass destruction but weapons of mass destruction programs. Bit by bit we are beginning to see the truth emerging, and Mr Howard has misled the public on the reasons for going to war with Iraq. The opposition has consistently called for clarity from the government over its claims that Iraq possesses completed stockpiles of WMD. So far, we have received none. Instead, what we have seen is just another dodge from the Prime Minister. As the months go by information is beginning to emerge that perhaps Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>Just last week, the Iraq survey group presented its interim report to US Congress. It was yet another torpedo into John Howard's credibility on the Iraq war. The Iraq survey group, comprising 1,200 weapons inspectors, spent four months trying to confirm the claim that as of March 2003 Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of completed chemical and biological weapons. They had access to an increasing number of former regime officials and scientists to assist their task. Yet last week the head of the survey group, David Kay, informed the US Congress that they had found no evidence of stockpiles of completed chemical and biological weapons in Iraq. As the survey group report indicated:</para><quote><para>We have not yet found stocks of weapons, but we are not yet at the point where we can say definitively either that such weapon stocks do not exist or that they existed before the war, and our only task is to find where they have gone.</para></quote><para>This report comes after the US House Intelligence Committee told the CIA director, George Tenet, last week that the intelligence on Iraq before the war was largely outdated, circumstantial and fragmentary and contained too many uncertainties to conclude Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>It has also been revealed recently that the claim made by Mr Howard and his government prior to the war that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear capability by trying to import uranium from Africa was false. Mr Howard told parliament on 4 February this year:</para><quote><para>Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons ...</para></quote><para>As evidence of this, he said:</para><quote><para>... uranium has been sought from Africa ...</para></quote><para>He also claimed in parliament:</para><quote><para>Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program ...</para></quote><para>These claims were made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, despite the fact that the Office of National Assessments, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Defence Intelligence Organisation knew back in January of this year that claims about Iraq's nuclear weapons program were lacking in credibility. We have discovered that Mr Howard's claims that attacking Iraq was necessary to reduce the threat of terrorism and to reduce the risk of weapons of mass destruction finding their way into the hands of terrorists were also false. These claims were all made despite intelligence indicating the contrary was true.</para><para>The UK parliament Intelligence and Security Committee report in September revealed that the Joint Intelligence Committee in February this year made a very interesting assessment. I would like to quote it to the Senate:</para><quote><para>... there was no intelligence that Iraq had provided chemical or biological materials to al-Qaeda.</para></quote><para>Or of Iraqi intentions to conduct—and I quote: </para><quote><para>... chemical or biological terror attacks using Iraqi intelligence officials or their agents.</para><para>However, it judged that in the event of imminent regime collapse there would be a risk of transfer of such material, whether or not as a deliberate Iraqi regime policy.</para><para>The JIC assessed that al-Qaeda and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq.</para></quote><para>The Joint Intelligence Committee also assessed that any collapse of the Iraqi regime would increase the risk of chemical and biological warfare technology or agents finding their way into the hands of terrorists not necessarily al-Qaeda. Despite that sort of advice, the Prime Minister said the opposite was the case on at least 15 occasions before the war in Iraq. Mr Howard argued that a military attack on Iraq required Australian participation in order to reduce or eliminate the risk of chemical and biological weapons finding their way into the hands of terrorists. As Mr Howard told parliament on 4 February this year:</para><quote><para>The ultimate nightmare for us all must be that weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of terrorists. The more the world leaves unchecked either the possession of such weapons by rogue states or the spread of those weapons, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will acquire and use them.</para></quote><para>Then, in his address to the nation on 20 March, Mr Howard said:</para><quote><para>We believe that so far from our action in Iraq increasing the terrorist threat it will, by stopping the spread of chemical and biological weapons, make it less likely that a devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against Australia.</para></quote><para>The announcement by David Kay last week that to date the Iraq survey group had not yet found stocks of weapons massively undermines the Prime Minister's credibility and position on this issue. Again and again we find that Mr Howard is loose with the truth on national security. These days, Mr Howard says to us, `The Iraq survey group needs more time. Give the Iraq survey group more time.' But, when the Labor Party and this Senate chamber argued before the war with Iraq—back in February—that Hans Blix and the United Nations weapons inspectors should be given more time, we were told that that was a sign of weakness. What does Mr Howard do now? He says, `Oh, give the Iraq survey group more time.' That is absolute hypocrisy now that the boot is on the other foot.</para><para>After the war, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Labor called on Mr Howard to recommission the UN weapons inspectors in order to accelerate the weapons inspection process, given that there were already 300 trained UN weapons inspectors with Iraqi field experience. The government declined. On 10 April, after the fall of Baghdad, Mr Howard had the following exchange with a journalist:</para><quote><para>JOURNALIST:</para><para>Prime Minister, one of the objectives was to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Where are they and when will they be found?</para><para>PRIME MINISTER: </para><para>Well I have said all along that we wouldn't expect to get hard evidence in relation to chemical and biological weapons until well after the hostilities have ceased. There aren't signs along the road to Baghdad saying WMD five kilometres from here. They've been obviously passed around and hidden, and some of them may have been taken out of Iraq ...</para><para>JOURNALIST: </para><para>Do you think they have already fallen into the hands of terrorists, Prime Minister? </para><para>PRIME MINISTER: </para><para>I don't know ...</para></quote><para>That was in April this year. It is worth remembering. It was all a little too candid on the part of Mr Howard. There was foreknowledge there that the war could have caused the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>How long will it take for Mr Howard to front up to the Australian parliament and the Australian people and come clean? He really ought to admit that he has misled the nation in relation to the reasons for taking Australia into the war with Iraq. He cannot hide behind the usual shabby tactic that this government employs—`plausible deniability', as it is now called. He cannot hide behind that tactic when it comes to the Iraq war. To go to war was his decision—Mr Howard's decision. In fact, he said several times publicly that it was the most serious decision that a Prime Minister could make. At a press conference back in March this year, he waxed lyrical when he announced the commitment of troops. I will never forget it. This is what he said:</para><quote><para>Well, I realise very much it's an extremely serious decision ... If anybody thinks I've done this lightly or in some kind of cavalier fashion out of nostalgia for some kind of historical comparison, forget it, it's nothing of the kind ... I intend to explain it as best I can and to argue it as best I can to the Australian people and to point out as best I can to them in all the ways that I can the reason why the Government has taken this decision and why it is in the long-term interest of our nation.</para></quote><para>They were Mr Howard's words on 18 March this year. To make this decision to commit Australia to this war, Mr Howard would have been fully informed of the situation by overseas and Australian intelligence agencies. He would have been aware of the increased risks of terrorism. He would have been aware that weapons of mass destruction could have spread because of the war. The bottom line is that you do not announce your country is going to war—you do not announce that you are committing Australian Defence Force personnel to a war zone—using what are increasingly looking like false pretexts. That is not on. You have to be sure. You have to be sure that what you are doing is right and that it is being done for the right reasons.</para><para>I say that Mr Howard was not sure. He was very loose with the truth. He misled the Australian parliament and the Australian people. I believe that such behaviour does warrant censure by the Australian Senate. The opposition will support an appropriate censure motion today. I move an amendment to the censure motion in Senator Brown's name that stands before the chair:</para><quote><para>Omit subparagraph (a)(i) and paragraph (b), substitute:</para></quote><para>(i)	that no evidence has been produced to date by the Prime Minister to justify his claims that as at March 2003, Iraq possessed stockpiles of completed biological and chemical weapons that justified going to war;</para><para>(b)	censures the Prime Minister for misleading the Australian Parliament and the Australian people in his justification for taking this country to war with Iraq.</para><para>I have had that amendment circulated in the chamber. I commend the amendment to the Senate. I believe it very much strengthens the censure motion before the chair and it warrants the support of the Australian Senate. I commend the approach of the opposition to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>15719</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to lend the support of the Democrats to this censure motion and to the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner. There would be few Australians who would not agree that we have been lied to over the pre-emptive attack on Iraq. I will not even call it a war because it was hardly that. It was Australia joining the United States and the UK on the world stage in attacking another country.</para></talk.start><para>We were told that this attack on Iraq was absolutely essential. Already, there have been a number of quotes drawn on in this debate of what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in the lead-up to this attack on Iraq. It is quite possible, of course, that our Prime Minister and our Minister for Foreign Affairs were also lied to. I accept that this is a strong possibility. That makes it no less irresponsible of this government to have taken us to this pre-emptive attack on another country. Obviously, so keen were they to join the United States on the world stage and to strut their stuff that I, quite frankly, believe the government did not care. They were willing to suspend rationale. The obvious evidence that was available to everyone in this country was put aside. The government chose to go into this attack with its eyes open to some extent but also hiding behind a lot of suggestions that the information was within the jurisdiction of the US administration but, of course, we could not be told about it precisely.</para><para>I will go to some of the quotes that we heard from those who took us into this attack. In May this year, the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>Well Australia supported military action against Iraq for a number of reasons, particularly the possession of weapons of mass destruction. I'm sure evidence of that will be found, it will take time.</para></quote><para>This is like a leap of faith that we are all expected to join the Prime Minister in taking. For some reason we believe they are there. We do not know why we believe this, but we believe they are there and we are sure they will be found. In September last year, Mr Downer said:</para><quote><para>Since 1998 and the departure of the UN inspectors, there has been an accumulation of intelligence information from a range of human and technical sources pointing to Saddam Hussein having continued or stepped up his weapons of mass destruction programs.</para></quote><para>Again, there was absolutely no evidence and now we know that not to be the case. In September last year, Mr Downer also said:</para><quote><para>The point is that I think that the central point here is, I think that this document produced by the British Labour Government puts beyond any question, the fact that Saddam Hussein does have a chemical and biological weapons capability.</para></quote><para>How silly does Mr Downer look having said back in September, `puts beyond any question'? I do not think there is any doubt that that lie was to reassure Australians that Saddam Hussein was a threat. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are frowning at me. You obviously do not like me calling that a lie but I cannot see anything that can suggest that it was not a lie. Mr Downer answered this question from Barrie Cassidy:</para><quote><para>Minister, you mentioned the weapons of mass destruction, but how long does the Coalition need to search for these weapons of mass destruction without success before it can be assumed that they don't exist?</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

I mean, after all, Saddam Hussein, we all know, used weapons of mass destruction on a number of occasions, including against his own people. Nobody has really doubted that such capabilities exist but nobody also has had any illusions it will take a lot of time to try to find these capabilities.</para></quote><para>It is fairly clear to those who listened to this debate that if you had to admit that it was going to take a long time to try to find weapons of mass destruction capabilities then you did not know where they were. The intelligence did not stretch to us knowing precisely where they were. It is a strange kind of suggestion for the government to make: they know that they are there but they do not know where they are and they do not know how to find them—but we have the intelligence, of course, that tells us otherwise.</para><para>The Democrats have put some hundreds of questions to the government on this very subject over the last few months. Some of them have been answered; most of them have been avoided or evaded in terms of a response from the government. Nonetheless, we have done this because, since the public were not being told the truth here and were not being given the evidence that the government claimed it had, we felt it was important that those questions should be put. Some of those questions are yet to be answered. I will go through some of them which I put on notice on 22 April. I said:</para><quote><para>With reference to a claim made by the Prime Minister before the war that only the threat of force by the United States of America (US) allowed the United Nations Monitorings Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) weapons inspectors back into Iraq—</para></quote><para>the Prime Minister said that it was only the threat of force that put them back—</para><quote><para>and given that it was the threat of force by Washington which pulled the weapons inspectors out of Iraq in March 2003 before they could complete their work—</para></quote><para>which had been conveniently glossed over by this government and in the debate at the time—</para><quote><para>does the Prime Minister now concede that the threat of force failed again to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister has never conceded this. I asked:</para><quote><para>What is the government's response to the claim of the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, Dr Blix, that the US was guilty of `fabricating' evidence against Iraq to justify the war, and his belief that the discovery of weapons of mass destruction had been replaced by the main objective of the US of toppling Saddam Hussein?</para></quote><para>Again, that was not answered. I further asked:</para><quote><para>With reference to claims made by the Prime Minister before the war that there was no doubt that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that this was the primary reason for Australia's participation in the `coalition of the willing', what is the Prime Minister's position now that, even after the collapse of the regime in Baghdad, no weapons of mass destruction have been found despite United States Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's claim to know where they are?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister said to us that regime change—and we have all heard a lot in this chamber about the Saddam Hussein regime—was only a secondary concern for Australia. So the primary concern, supposedly weapons of mass destruction, turned out not to be the primary justification for war after all. The Prime Minister claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein could not be contained or deterred. I asked:</para><quote><para>... what is the government's analysis of why they were not used in the regime's terminal hours against the invading US, United Kingdom and Australian forces?</para></quote><para>If Saddam Hussein had such weapons—and it seems clear that he did not—why would he not use them in response to what was a pretty decisive attack on Baghdad and other parts of Iraq? I asked whether the Prime Minister now regretted saying before the war that Saddam Hussein could stay on in power provided he got rid of his weapons of mass destruction. Again there was no answer to this question. </para><para>The Prime Minister has changed his position many times on this issue to justify taking this country into a war zone and taking part in an attack on a country which killed thousands of civilians. The Prime Minister started by saying that if Saddam Hussein would just comply with weapons inspections and get rid of his weapons of mass destruction then he could stay on. Then suddenly we were convinced that any 45 minutes from now there could be an attack on any other country and that biological, chemical and nuclear weapons might be used. Then we moved to the position which ultimately we went to the war on: we needed to get rid of this regime because of the way they treated their own citizens.</para><para>Just in the last 24 hours or so, questions have been raised about the evidence which has been found—that is, the test tube of botulinum which was presented by Washington and London as evidence of Saddam Hussein's development and concealment of weapons of mass destruction. This test tube was found in an Iraqi scientist's home refrigerator where it has been for 10 years. That information came out just yesterday. David Kay, the expert appointed by the CIA to lead the hunt for weapons, told a congressional committee last week that the vial of botulinum had been hidden in the scientist's home and could be used to covertly surge production of deadly weapons. Since that time the discovery of the vial has been at the heart of the debate over prewar claims that Iraq had an arsenal of banned weapons. </para><para>This was cited in justifications of the invasion by President Bush and by Britain's Foreign Secretary, who described this toxin as 15,000 times more toxic than the nerve Agent VX. Mr Straw claimed, after the report came out, that it presented further conclusive and incontrovertible evidence that Saddam had been in breach of the UN resolutions, how dangerous and deceitful the regime was, and that the military action was both justified and essential to remove the dangers. Now we know that the scientist had been asked to hide the botulinum in his refrigerator at home in 1993. So it is hardly likely that this was the basis of a huge capability of Iraq to produce this biological substance.</para><para>Since the war we have had the situation where enormous amounts of money have had to be poured in to fix up the mess that has been left behind in Iraq. The White House has ordered a major reorganisation of American efforts to quell violence in Iraq and Afghanistan and to speed up the reconstruction of both countries, according to senior administration officials. This is news as of yesterday. The new effort includes the creation of a so-called Iraq stabilisation group, $US20 billion being required by the Bush administration for reconstruction and $US67 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are seeing here a legacy of unrest and violence, and a destroyed country that has recently been described by a US army physicist as a toxic wasteland. There is so much depleted uranium and there are so many chemical materials in Iraq—not from weapons of mass destruction but because of the damage which has been done to various chemical facilities in industry—that this is not a safe place for anyone to live.</para><para>I think we have been misled, both in this place and more publicly. While all of this has been going on, we have also seen the United States step up its own weapons of mass destruction. On 7 August US government scientists and Pentagon officials gathered at Nebraska Air Force Base to discuss the development of a modernised arsenal of small, specialised nuclear weapons. According to the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> of 3 August 2003:</para><quote><para>The Pentagon believes that more than 70 nations, big and small, now have some 1,400 underground command posts and sites for ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.</para></quote><para>It further says that it wants to:</para><quote><para>... develop a class of relatively small nuclear weapons ... that could pierce rock and reinforced concrete and turn strongholds into radioactive dust.</para><para>“With an effective earth penetrator, many buried targets could be attacked,” the administration said in its Nuclear Posture Review, which it sent to Congress last year.</para></quote><para>Back in April the United States produced a weapons grade plutonium pit, the core of a fission bomb, for the first time in 14 years. According to the Los Alamos National Laboratory:</para><quote><para>... the move restores the nation's ability to make nuclear weapons and was needed so the Energy Department could replace pits found unsafe or destroyed through regular check-ups.</para></quote><para>So, on the one hand, we have joined the United States in chasing some non-existent weapons of mass destruction and, in the meantime, the United States has pursued its own nuclear agenda with great gusto and at great cost. I think that it is very likely that we are going to see some of those nuclear weapons tested in the United States and, by all accounts, some of those bunker-busters will need to be atmospheric. According to reports that I have read, it is completely unfeasible to test them underground.</para><para>We are now back in the realm of nuclear development, facing what I think is the very frightening prospect of nuclear weapons proliferation around the world—because it will not just stop with America. America is certainly a superpower and has a great deal more resources than any other country, and this is a very serious situation we are currently facing with America being reluctant to contain its own development of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. We are going to see a backlash in both the Middle East and around the rest of the world.</para><para>All in all, the attack on Iraq has been a gross failure. It has failed to stop terrorism; it has failed to stop the proliferation of weapons. It has destroyed a country and there is no end in sight to the unrest and the mess that has been left behind there. The United States would like the United Nations to come in and help clean up that mess but I sincerely hope that the United States are not going to be relieved of the responsibility that they have towards that country. I think Australia should accept some of that responsibility as well because we have joined the United States on the basis of something which has not been proved and which cannot clearly be proved. I think it is a sorry part of Australia's history and it is a great pity that our government was not prepared to listen to its parliament and was not prepared to bring to this place the decision to go to war, because it is quite clear that it would have been defeated.</para><para>Many of us on this side of the chamber have spoken at length about why this was an ill-conceived war and why we would be left with the kind of mess that we currently are left with. The Democrats are pleased to support this censure motion. I think that, if we have not seen good sense come out of the government over this issue—that is, if we have not seen honesty or clear answers provided to the many questions that have been put about why we went with the US to this attack—it has not been for want of trying in this place. I think the government should take far more heed in the future of the kind of debate that the Senate has typically had over this kind of action.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15723</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the censure motion and the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I think that this is a most important debate because it goes to the most serious decision a government can make. The Australian government committed 2,000 young Australians to war and put the lives of those 2,000 Australians at risk. It now appears that the decision was taken on the basis of a very misleading argument and that the rationale for invading Iraq without UN sanction was largely not supported by evidence. In fact, there is now evidence that the claims made about Iraq were, as it has been claimed, `sexed up' in order to support the government's commitment to the USA to go to war in Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>This is the most serious thing that the parliament could possibly debate. It is the most serious decision the government could take and I think the lack of interest by the government in justifying its stance on or debating these issues is an indictment of it. The government has now fallen back to the position where it tries to justify the war with an argument that simply goes, `We won. Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator and he has been deposed. What is the problem?' I think there is a problem. I have no argument that Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator and I for one am happy that he has gone. But the arguments that were used to justify the war were not those the government is now giving. We do not invade every country where we find an evil dictator in charge. If we did, we would be very busy.</para><para>We had a government decision to go to Iraq with a very small coalition of the USA and the UK because of the claims of intelligence reports concerning the threat posed by the weapons of mass destruction program run by Saddam Hussein. It was not that he had some remnants of a chemical or biological warfare program but that the weapons he possessed posed a threat to international security and his neighbours. It was seen as a real threat that required the most serious possible response by the coalition forces—that is, the invasion of Iraq. The argument ran that the UN sanctions had failed, that the monitoring of and the international pressure on Iraq had failed and that the most extreme response possible was necessary—the full-scale military invasion of Iraq.</para><para>We think that it is fundamentally important that such a significant decision be founded on proper, sober assessment of Australia's national security interests. There is increasing evidence that that was not the case. What we increasingly see is a change in the government's rationale for the justification of the war on Iraq and a huge shift in the government's language about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>, Karen Middleton got it dead right when she noted that, according to the government, Iraq definitely had an active weapons of mass destruction program, then they probably had them and then they only had programs to try to buy them. This is degenerating into farce. The government keep shifting the goalposts, changing the argument and wanting to walk away from their original justifications, because the evidence now does not support the claims it made.</para><para>These are not minor points of political argument; these are fundamentally important questions about the efficacy of our intelligence services, whether or not intelligence efforts were politicised, whether or not the most serious decision the government can make—that is, to send Australians to war—was made on a sound basis and whether or not the Australian public were misled and the arguments for the war on Iraq manufactured. What we say in the censure motion today is that the Australian public were misled and that, for political purposes, the government manipulated the intelligence and the arguments that they placed before the Australian public in order to support a decision that they had taken months in advance of the formal announcement of a war against Iraq.</para><para>It is highly disturbing that the government have taken that decision, because 2,000 Australian lives were put at risk. There are still some 800 Australians serving in the gulf region whose lives are at risk. Many Australians take the view, now that the war is over, that somehow the risk does not remain for Australians. That is not the case. There are still some 800 Australians whose lives are very much at risk and, while it is a credit to the ADF that we have not lost any Australian lives, no-one from the ADF or the government would fail to accept that they remain at serious risk. While much is down to good management and the professional skills of the ADF, there is also an element of good luck because, as we see nightly on the news reports, American and British troops are being killed on a daily basis. It is still a highly unstable situation and our Australian troops are still at risk, as are those inspectors involved in the inspection program.</para><para>We now have a very clear situation where the government have misled the Australian public about their rationale for being involved in the war. The government must be held to account and be called upon to justify that decision. It is disgraceful that the government did not, as a first item of business today, table the Iraq survey group report released by David Kay last week. Here we have a government that said, `We went to war because of the weapons of mass destruction contained in Iraq.' When troops entered Iraq and no weapons of mass destruction were discovered, the government told us that it was a matter of finding the evidence because it had been concealed and it would take some time before the expert group, the weapons inspectors, could uncover it. Last week we had the first formal report from that group, and it did not support the government's claims. Any reading of the publicly available information that David Kay produced makes clear that it did not support the government's claims.</para><para>A lot of detail is still to be released, and one of the disappointing things about the Kay report is that all we get is a transcript of evidence he gave to a US congressional hearing. The federal government, which committed 2,000 Australian troops who risked their lives at war, did not come into this parliament and say, `This is the formal report gained by the Iraq survey group that goes to the heart of the reasons for our involvement in Iraq.' Why? Because they are embarrassed. They realise now that their claims for the justification of our involvement in Iraq have not stood up. I admit that further evidence may be gathered and that this is an ongoing process, but clearly the Kay report is a critical report that throws damning light on the arguments about our involvement in Iraq.</para><para>Today Senator Hill made only passing reference to that report. He was forced to because of this censure motion. There was no coming into this parliament to table the report, provide an explanation and allow the parliament to debate it. It took a censure motion for us to get a proper parliamentary debate about the most serious examination yet of whether the rationale for war on Iraq was justified. That is disgraceful in itself. There should have been a tabling of the full report. We, of course, have not seen the unclassified report of the Iraq survey group, released in the US last week, but what we do know is quite telling.</para><para>This report has been compiled by the 1,200 weapons inspectors, including 14 Australians, who have been there for the last three or four months examining the evidence to establish whether or not Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. The head of that survey group, Mr David Kay, has now informed the US Congress that no evidence of stockpiles of completed chemical and biological weapons have been found—a very different picture from that presented to us before the invasion of Iraq. This all comes on top of claims, which we have now proved to be false, made prior to the war. John Howard's claims that, just prior to the war, Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear capability by trying to import uranium from Niger in Africa have now proven to be false. John Howard made a false claim prior to the war that attacking Iraq was necessary to reduce the threat of terrorism when in February this year he was already in possession of British intelligence which said exactly the reverse. The Prime Minister also made a false claim prior to the war that attacking Iraq would reduce the risk of weapons of mass destruction finding their way into the hands of terrorists when British intelligence, again in February, had warned the Howard government of exactly the reverse.</para><para>The announcement by David Kay last week that to date the Iraq survey group had not yet found stocks of weapons is the fourth major blow in as many months to the Prime Minister's claims that justified military involvement in Iraq. The Prime Minister now uses the excuse, `We need more time.' It is interesting that that was an unacceptable response when we on this side of the house argued that in fact Hans Blix and the UN inspectors ought to be given more time. That was then seen as a sign of weakness. Now it is seen as absolutely necessary, as the government scrambles for some evidence to support the claims it made in justifying war on Iraq. There is no doubt in my mind that it will not be able to prove the exaggerated claims made prior to the war. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was an evil man with a history of involvement in despicable behaviour against his people and neighbouring countries and that he had resorted to the use of chemicals in the past. But what is now clear is that a lot of the claims made in support of the rush to war on Iraq cannot be justified.</para><para>The Kay report found that multiple sources have told the Iraq survey group that Iraq did not have a large ongoing centrally controlled chemical weapons program after 1991. According to the report, information found to date suggests that Iraq's large-scale capability to develop, produce and fill new chemical weapons munitions was reduced, if not entirely destroyed, during previous US-led operations in Iraq in 1991 and 1998. These are terribly telling findings. The Iraq survey group also uncovered information relating to Iraq's chemical weapons programs that could not confirm that Iraq ever planned to use its weapons during Operation Iraqi Freedom. These are very important findings that undermine some of the most serious claims made to support the war on Iraq. This is a report that should have been tabled in this parliament, that the government should have brought before us for the parliament to debate, because it fundamentally undermines many of the claims made to justify war on Iraq. David Kay's team has also found that it has not been able to uncover any evidence that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program since Operation Desert Fox in 1998.</para><para>What all this adds up to is a clear indication that the claims made about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's WMD programs have been seriously exaggerated. What we have to examine and what we have to understand is whether or not that was because of deliberately misleading claims made on behalf of coalition governments, whether it was as a result of sexed up intelligence reports or whether it was just a complete failure of intelligence. Certainly it seems the evidence is leaning towards the politicisation of intelligence, the manufacturing of claims to support a political decision and an effort on behalf of a number of governments to justify their position on Iraq by making exaggerated claims about Iraq's WMDs. This is not a question about whether or not you think Iraq under Saddam Hussein should have been left as it is or whether Saddam Hussein was a good or bad person. Clearly the view of the whole international community and any thinking human being is that he was a dictator with evil intent and had a terrible record of oppression against his people.</para><para>What we have is a decision by the Australian government—a legally taken decision—to commit 2,000 Australians to war, to put their lives at risk. This parliament has an obligation to examine and explore the justifications given for that. It is not good enough for the current government to say, `We won. No Australians died. Don't worry about it. It's all okay.' It is not good enough. What we now know is that the Australian public do not believe that the war was justified. They know that they have been deliberately misled on this issue. In a recent poll over two-thirds of poll respondents—68 per cent of Australians—said that they believe that the Prime Minister misled the nation about the reasons for going to war on Iraq. Sixty-eight per cent of Australians believe that they were misled by their elected government as to the reasons for going to war on Iraq. I think that is a terrible indictment of this government and a very serious issue for the body politic in this country. We have been lucky in the sense that no Australians have lost their lives. The debate probably has not been as sharp in Australia as in other countries, because we have not been mourning the loss of ADF personnel. I think all Australians hope that that continues, because we still have many Australians at very serious risk deployed in the gulf.</para><para>Not only do we now have the evidence that Australians were misled on the reasons for the justification for going to war on Iraq but also 68 per cent of Australians actually believe they were misled by their government about why we should be there. That is, as I say, a terrible indictment of this government, and it will cost us dearly. While some people in the government are keen to move the goalposts and change the argument, and think such arguments are niceties they do not have to bother with, we now have Australians who are very cynical about what they are told about national security matters—Australians who believe they were deliberately misled.</para><para>We know, for instance, that they and ADF personnel are very concerned about the politicisation of defence—about what occurred in the `children overboard' affair. We know that they are very concerned that the ADF has been politicised under this government and we know that the Australian public have come to the view that they have been misled about the most serious decision a government can take: the decision to send Australians to war. That will undermine our national security interests in the longer term, because Australians will be much more cynical about what they are told about their national security interests. While we struggle in this place to get bipartisan support for Australia's interests in national security issues, this sort of thing seriously undermines that effort.</para><para>I think it is a very important issue that we should come to terms with. I think it is important that the government be censured over this, because it is a sign that the parliament is reflecting the will of the Australian people and their view that they have been grievously misled, that they are not happy about that, and that it is an important matter and not one to be dismissed by saying that there was nothing lost in the sense of Australian lives. Thousands of lives have been lost—Iraqis and coalition forces. The justification for the war has proved to be one that was highly misleading. It is important that we debate the Kay Iraq survey report because it is important that the truth comes out.</para><para>I think the work being done on the Joint Statutory Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD is very important for us getting an understanding of whether those intelligence reports were sexed up and whether we have developed a situation where either intelligence agencies are telling the government what they want to hear or, somewhere in the process, intelligence reports are being manipulated to provide support for political decisions already taken. If that is true, it seriously undermines our national security interests. The issue has clearly undermined Australians' belief in the political processes and it has undermined their confidence in the government telling the truth about the most serious decision a government can take.</para><para>I think it is very important that we censure the government and make it clear that it is not acceptable to mislead the Australian public about a decision to go to war. I think it is important that this parliament continues to pursue the truth—as the US and British parliaments are—about why we were committed to a war in Iraq, because the outcome is not the only issue. The process and the rationale for going to war must be explored and understood. If people were misled—as I think is becoming increasingly obvious—those that misled must be exposed and held to account, because nothing could be more damaging to the Australian body politic than a decision to go to war by misleading the Australian public.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15728</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would just like to say a few words with regard to the motion that we are debating this afternoon. If one thing is clear, it is that this country was led to believe that we were joining forces with the US and Britain to embark upon war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction. I do not think there is one Australian who believes anything other than that. For a government to try and change that story is very sad and very unfortunate. We were led to believe that somehow Saddam Hussein had developed huge stockpiles of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction—that, in fact, are probably to be found in every Iraqi's backyard—and that it was in our national interest and in the interest of national public safety that we participated with the US and the UK.</para></talk.start><para>I find that interesting. It is interesting to ask why countries like Canada, Germany, France and New Zealand couldn't come to the same conclusion about their national interests and their national security. If this was about what it seems it was about—that is, the removal of Saddam Hussein, which I would not necessarily disagree with—that is what we should have been told. The government says, `There has been no smoking gun found yet. It may take some time.' I accept that it may take some time, but bear in mind that over 12 years we had a series of investigations by UN inspectors. Obviously the Iraqis were unhelpful in that respect and there was the potential for weapons to exist.</para><para>I think it was highlighted by Senator Faulkner that the Prime Minister's approach to this now is to target programs. If we were about ensuring that countries did not have such programs, we would be a very busy country indeed. In fact, we would probably have to triple the size of the defence forces just so that we could participate in the removal of programs from countries that have, or may be working on, programs for weapons of mass destruction or chemical weapons.</para><para>Based on our national interest and based on our national security, I ask the government: how has this outcome benefited the national interest of this country and, indeed, our national security? How has what we embarked upon delivered that? Evidence would seem to suggest, even to the people in the street, that our national security is in a worse state as a result of our participation. It is costing the taxpayers of this country millions of dollars more because of it, and it will be an ongoing cost. You can understand, from the point of view of the security of the world and the security of this country, the action that was taken back in 1991. But every country participated in that action. The same claims existed at that time with regard to Iraq's potential to have weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, some of them were destroyed. I think I heard Senator Brown mention statements made by Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Powell back in 2001 about how the United States have the capacity to keep arms away from Saddam Hussein and his capacity to develop them.</para><para>What changed in such a short space of time? If we were about removing this despot then we should have just said that and we should have got on with the job. The public should have been told that this was what it was about. I would not have disagreed with that approach. It would have been an honest approach. All of the evidence to date suggests that this government knew that there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction and that this government knew that there was a real potential to put this country's security in greater jeopardy as a result of actions it took that led us to war in Iraq. That is a very significant thing and a very important thing for the Australian public, because a government taking a decision that may ultimately make their lives less safe is one that this parliament should debate to uncover all of the evidence.</para><para>If the government has taken a decision based on whatever objective it had at the time—whether it was a favour for the United States President or whatever, who knows—at the end of the day the truth should come out. It is simply not good enough for a government to say, `We started off with weapons of mass destruction but then we freed the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein.' If that was the objective, that should have been the stated objective. I go back to my question: how has our participation in what has happened in Iraq assisted the national interest of this country or improved our national security and the safety of the people of this country? It would seem to me that it has not, and the evidence suggests that it has not, and we are going to be paying dearly for that action for a long time to come. I just hope that we will not pay for it with more Australian lives as result of terrorist attacks that come about exclusively because of our participation in Iraq for what would seem to be very questionable reasons.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>15729</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to support the Australian Greens' motion that we censure the Prime Minister, I think it is important for us to recognise the significance of what we are doing. This is a Prime Minister who has sent this country to a war on the basis of lies. We have the majority of the Australian population also recognising that the Prime Minister misled them in his case for Australia joining just two other countries to be part of a war that has caused tremendous devastation in Iraq. The Prime Minister did this on the basis of lies, and the Australian population now recognises the lies he told this parliament and the people and which he participated in at a global level, and they recognise the suffering this has caused. There are other world leaders—and others have spoken about them—the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who also participated in this global lie and who also sent their troops, men and women, to be a part of the slaughter of innocent people in Iraq and who took part in causing the devastation that now exists in Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>When we look to those other countries, the United Kingdom and the United States, we see leaders who are under tremendous scrutiny because of the people and the parliaments in those countries who are ensuring that their leaders are publicly accountable for the decisions they have made and for the actions they have taken in sending their troops off to war. Many people have commented to me while I have been travelling around the country about the way in which our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is not under that same level of scrutiny as the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the President of the United States, George Bush. This debate today is an opportunity for the Senate to send the strongest message it can by supporting this censure motion against the Prime Minister and by recognising the significance of what this Prime Minister has done. </para><para>We have heard the Prime Minister and we have also heard George Bush and Tony Blair speak about how they believe they have brought freedom, liberation and democracy to the people of Iraq. These are world leaders who have put themselves out, believing that they are shining beacons of democracy and yet, in making the decision they have made, they have gone against the will of the majority of the people in their countries. The Australian people continue to stand opposed to the decision that John Howard took. We see 51 per cent of the Australian population saying that, when they think about the war on Iraq and its outcome, they do not believe the war was justified. Yet we see these world leaders taking Australia and their respective countries into this illegal and immoral war in Iraq against the will of the population in each country. Therefore, it is extremely important that the Senate has the opportunity through this censure motion today to remind the Prime Minister of the largest demonstrations we have ever seen in this country. People came together saying, `You do not speak for me. You do not speak in my name when you send men and women off to Iraq to be involved in this illegal and immoral war.' </para><para>It is important to recognise the voices of those millions of people who came out onto the streets in Australia, not just in our capital cities but also in small regional centres across the country, and their words of caution were right. It is important to recognise that the advice the Prime Minister heard at the time from ASIO and the advice the President of the United States heard at the time from the CIA to say, `If you engage in this war on Iraq, you will create more terrorism,' was right, and that that is what we have seen. Heed the millions of people in this country and around the world who say, `Let us deal with this issue differently. Let us not jump first to a military solution but let us deal with the causes behind the situation, not only in Iraq but also in the war on terrorism, by committing ourselves to a program of reducing the inequality around the world that leads to this sense of frustration that we have seen and continue to see in Iraq.'</para><para>We have seen a Prime Minister in this country spend somewhere in the order of $1 billion on a war on the people of Iraq. This is money that could have contributed to rebuilding the infrastructure within Iraq that was destroyed by Western allies through the bombing of no-fly zones in the period during which the Western world continued to have sanctions against Iraq. We have seen a billion dollars being spent on the destruction of the country of Iraq when it could have been spent rebuilding that infrastructure, providing the capacity to ensure an ongoing democracy in Iraq. It is extremely important that in the parliament today the Senate heed the voice of those millions of people here in Australia and around the world who said that this is not the path we want to be taken down. We recognise that we need to deal with these issues of global terrorism at the root causes rather than jump to a military solution. </para><para>We continue to see the Howard government jump to a military solution on a range of things. We continue to see the Australian government commit to greater defence spending, buying us greater insecurity in our region. We had the instance where the Australian government signed up last year to the purchase of new aircraft to replace FA18s and F111s. They signed a blank cheque to one of the largest arms manufacturers in the world in order that Australia purchase higher weaponry and more advanced military equipment. This does not bring security to our region. When Australia decides to continually upgrade our military technology what is the response of countries in our region? What is the response of countries that feel threatened by Australia's increasing military technology? They decide to go out and spend more of their money—money that they could spend on health and education and welfare in their own country—on buying themselves greater technology, greater armaments and greater military equipment, and Australia also moves into this arms race within our region.</para><para>Why don't we see a Prime Minister making decisions to commit to improving public education in a country like Indonesia? Why don't we see a Prime Minister spending money on ensuring that Pacific nations in our region have the capacity to develop strong and environmentally sustainable economies? These are the sorts of things that would bring security to our region. These are the sorts of projects that a Prime Minister and a government committed to building our relations with our neighbours and building our security in our region would undertake. These are the sorts of things that the $1 billion should have been spent on instead of a war in Iraq and instead of buying insecurity in our region. For this reason it is vitally important that the Australian Prime Minister be censured for taking a decision against the view of the majority of Australians and against the view of the Australian Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15731</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In February of this year the Senate debated the issue of war in Iraq and I made it perfectly clear then that the decision to go to war is one of the most momentous of all decisions that a government could make. As I indicated then, we should not be motivated by extraneous factors but we should have a look at the whole proposal of going to war on the basis of the principles of a just war. </para></talk.start><para>I outlined those principles at the time. First, there must be a just cause. Second, the decision to go to war must be taken by a legal authority. Third, it must be for the right reason. Fourth, there must be a reasonable chance for success. Fifth, there must be proportionality and, sixth, every other reasonable method must have been used to try to obtain the eventual end, which is peace. On the basis of those principles I came to a decision even then that the war was not justified. Where was the just cause? The cause suggested was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and the whole apparatus surrounding that and that these weapons could be released within a very short time.</para><para>It appears from the evidence thus far that that was not the case, but even at the time it was not a threat to the security of this country. It could be said, of course—and it was often said, quite justifiably—that Saddam Hussein was a dictator and wreaked havoc amongst his own people. That is a matter of great concern, but on the issue of the basic reason for choosing to go to war—that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction—the proof was not in, and it was not in even after the UN inspectors had gone in and looked at the situation. I do not want to recap and go through the rest of the five principles and outline them here again. I would, if anybody is interested, refer to my speech on 4 February on this particular matter.</para><para>I am concerned, obviously, that there has been a breakdown of systems which should be there to reveal the truth—particularly the truth or otherwise of the weapons of mass destruction claim. I would just say about every other means being used to obtain the eventual end of a just peace that we did not give to the United Nations the opportunity—at least the room that they needed to move—to ensure an outcome of that nature; in other words, to determine whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction. The decision was made to go to war without exhausting all of those reasonable other means that needed to be used to obtain that end.</para><para>What concerns me about this motion is that it proposes to censure the Prime Minister and is suggesting—not the motion, but some of the comments as to the motion—that he acted in bad faith. Censuring an individual, even if it is the Prime Minister, on the basis that he acted in bad faith is a proposition I could not bring myself to support. Certainly I could support severe criticism of the actions of the Prime Minister and so on, but I would be loath to support any censure motion based, as it were, on the bad faith of the Prime Minister or any other person. I could support a condemnation and so on of the failure of the system to reveal the truth until everything was over—with the truth then showing that there is as yet no proof at all of this claim for weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>In short, I will not delay the Senate, as we have got a huge amount of work to do. I am concerned, of course, that it appears—unless something comes out of the box somewhere around the place—that the government's decision to go to war was based on a false premise. For that we should be highly critical—not only of one man but of the government. But, I repeat: I am not prepared to agree to a censure motion which presupposes bad faith.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>15732</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I draw Senator Harradine's attention to the amendments that have been proposed by the opposition, which the Greens will be accepting.

This Prime Minister has not been censured by either house of parliament in his 7½ years in office. It is a very serious matter for either chamber to censure a Prime Minister and cannot be taken lightly, but the Prime Minister stands charged with having been misled, or misleading the people of Australia, in the reasons for taking this country into the invasion of another country, putting 2,000 Defence Force personnel at risk in that process and putting Australians both inside Iraq and right around the world at continuing risk as a result of having made that mistake.</para><para>There will be an ongoing debate as to whether the Prime Minister himself was acting on false evidence or whether he had simply succumbed to the temptation to be selective in the evidence that was given to him and turned a blind eye to that evidence which showed and indicated that Iraq was not a holder of weapons of mass destruction, certainly not weapons of mass destruction in a way which threatened Australia, as the Prime Minister averred when he made his statement to the nation in March this year. I would reiterate that after 1991, through the United Nations, Iraq's ostensible weapons of mass destruction were destroyed. In 1995 Saddam Hussein's son-in-law Kamal defected to Jordan. He there gave information to the intelligence services that, as the minister in charge, he had ordered the destruction of the remaining weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that there was no intention to reconstruct them. That man, as you will remember, was assassinated by Saddam Hussein when he was lured later back into Iraq.</para><para>In 1998, the United Nations weapons inspectors scouring Iraq had found no weapons of mass destruction. In 2001 the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Colin Powell, said in an interview in Egypt that Saddam Hussein had not regained the ability to be the threat that he had been before the Gulf War. In 2003 the United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq had failed to uncover weapons of mass destruction. There was a consistent trajectory over the decade repeatedly by those people who were on the ground in Iraq reporting back to responsible authorities that weapons of mass destruction neither had been stockpiled nor were being reproduced in Iraq. We know in the event that those reports were correct. On top of that came this enormous impulsion following September 11 by some in the United States administration—and it was a small component but very powerful—to invade Iraq as a response, and a misguided response, to the September 11 attack. That led to the invasion of Iraq. It no doubt influenced the Prime Minister to send Australians to take part in that invasion.</para><para>I note that the opposition's amendment does remove the component of the Greens' original motion which says that the Prime Minister had misled the country in his determination to join the President of the United States of America, Mr G. W. Bush, in the war on Iraq. I will accept that, but I still stand by the original motion. I do not think that anybody in this place would assert that had President Bush not been leading the move to invade Iraq and attack Baghdad, Australia would have undertaken such a venture. Of course it would not. Of course the Prime Minister was being led in the matter by the intention of the United States, very determinedly, looking for some allies for domestic purposes to help justify this unjustified invasion of Iraq on the grounds of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the Prime Minister had a blinker on—I am being kind about this—to the consistent evidence over the decade about the absence of a capability of Iraq to deal anymore in chemical or biological weapons. Despite that, the Prime Minister, on 4 February this year, said that his government `knows Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons'. How could he know that when there were no such weapons in Iraq? </para><para>I note that the Prime Minister went on to argue about the possibility of Iraq developing nuclear weapons which would, inter alia, threaten Australia, despite the fact that on 7 March, Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, said to the United Nations:</para><quote><para>We have ... found no evidence or plausible indications of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq.</para></quote><para>The consequences of the decision by the Prime Minister, which was not based on fact but at best based on assumption, of leading Australians to the invasion of Iraq are immense, both for the need in a democracy for the populace to have faith and to have belief that governments are acting on good advice from their intelligence agencies. I note here—and this is a very important matter—that there is a feeling, from at least some sections of the intelligence community in this country, that we ought to be very careful when getting involved in conflicts beyond our region when we are totally dependent upon intelligence coming from other countries which cannot be corroborated or checked by our own intelligence agents. One argument the Greens were using, and which I used time and again, in arguing against the war earlier this year was that Australia should be maintaining its defence forces for the defence of its own region, partly because we have excellent intelligence on matters of defence and the movements of governments in our own region.</para><para>We finally come to the argument put forward by Senator Hill, who in 10 minutes failed to defend the Prime Minister and then left the chamber. He said that, as far as he was concerned, the government and he stood by the misinformation upon which the government prosecuted its argument for war earlier this year: `We still believe it was correctly based, that decision.' What an incredible incapability to come to grips with reality we have heard from the Minister for Defence. All the information shows that the government made a decision based on mistaken evidence that was before it. That is the kindest way we can put it. That is the way Senator Harradine has been arguing. Yet the Prime Minister said he would not change the decision and does not believe that the decision was wrong—he would not alter it one iota. The Minister for Defence said today that as far as he is concerned the Prime Minister, the government and he still believe that the decision was rightly based. Manifestly, it was not correctly based. It was wrongly based. It was a huge failure of information and it was a mammoth political mistake by Prime Minister Howard. One would be able to accept that a little more if at this stage the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence were able to accept that they were wrong in March. Whatever the reason for that, wherever the information on which they based their decision came from, nevertheless the decision was wrong.</para><para>The decision to attack Iraq on the basis that its weapons of mass destruction threatened Australia is now known to have been wrong. It was wrongly based. Yet our Prime Minister and our Minister for Defence, eyes wide open, can say in this parliament that they would not change that decision. What an extraordinary failure of self-analysis by leaders of our country. We can all make mistakes on the basis of the information we have. We are all tempted to ignore information when it comes to pursuing a political point of view. But never must we be more careful in not allowing ourselves to be influenced by political trajectory than when we are asking our defence forces to invade another country. Then, having done so on false information, never should we be in the position where we cannot accept that, because that is to say that, deceived once, one is open to being deceived again or to deceiving again, misleading again. We must expect better of our national leaders than that.</para><para>Senator Nettle and I will vote for the amendment that the opposition has moved to this motion. We moved the motion to censure the Prime Minister with great forethought and with great misgivings about the affairs of a nation which can be led to a war on wrong information, compounded by wrong decision making by the leader of that nation, without reference to the parliament in terms of a deliberation by the parliament. But this censure is deserved. Prime Minister Howard deserves to be censured for having led the defence forces of this country to invade another country with all the risk and cost involved on a mistaken assessment of the facts. He was wrong then. He ought to be able to say that he was wrong in that decision, that it was based on wrong information, but he cannot and therefore he is wrong now. The Prime Minister should be censured.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—The question is that Senator Faulkner's amendment to Senator Brown's motion be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The question now is that Senator Brown's motion, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

In this way, that amount should not be included in the assessable income of the individual resident for whom it is transferred.</inline></para><para>Supported in principle. The Government will consult with the superannuation industry and interested parties to finalise the detail of the recommended change and to ensure there are no unintended consequences of such a change.</para><para>Under the Government's approach, the section 27CAA amount of a transfer (i.e. the growth in overseas superannuation since the individual became a resident) will not be included in the individual's assessable income at the time of transfer. Instead, the fund will treat the amount as a taxable contribution, with the amount included in the fund's assessable income and subject to tax in that manner (at the usual 15% rate). Benefit tax on the 27CAA amount will apply in the normal manner when the benefit is ultimately paid out (i.e. it will not receive any special treatment and thus can be expected to form part of the post June 1983 component). The other part of the transfer will remain unchanged as an undeducted contribution. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the tax law be amended to average the income assessed under section 27CAA along the lines of the averaging that applied to net capital gains derived</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> by individuals on or before 21 </inline><inline font-weight="bold">September 1999.

In the context of the Government's proposal that the 27CAA amount be taxed at a flat 15% rate as part of a fund's assessable income and thus be paid by the fund (see recommendation 2), there is no need for averaging.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">If Recommendation 2 is accepted by the Government, the Committee recommends that a superannuation fund be permitted to release so much of the superannuation entitlement as is needed to meet the section 27CAA tax liability when that tax is levied, similar to some superannuation contributions surcharge arrangements.</inline></para><para>Not supported. It is unnecessary to make specific provision for the fund to release an amount to meet the section 27CAA liability if the section 27CAA amount is instead to be subject to tax in the fund as a taxable contribution (as the Government is proposing—refer Recommendation 2).

Persons may seek to travel to Australia through our normal visa processes, or they may attempt unauthorised entry without identity documents—the latter, in many cases, having destroyed the documents to avoid accurate identification.</para><para>Identity and document fraud facilitates the movement of terrorists and transnational crime to Australia. There are risks to government if these fraud issues are not confronted upfront, in that various levels of government and private sector administrative and financial systems rely upon the identities established by DIMIA to confer various benefits and entitlements. </para><para>Strong border security and enhanced proof of identity requirements are therefore critical to Australia's national security, and to the integrity of its services and programs.</para><para>This bill is part of a whole of government approach to tackle the growing incidence of identity fraud worldwide. It seeks to strike a balance between the need for robust identification testing measures in an immigration context, and the protection of individual rights. </para><para>The bill amends the Migration Act to provide a framework for the collection of personal identifiers such as photographs, signatures and fingerprints from certain non-citizens at key points in the immigration process. The measures proposed in this bill are important and necessary developments in migration law.</para><para>The Migration Act already enables the collection of some personal identifiers from non-citizens in certain circumstances.</para><para>For example:</para><para>	Photographs and signatures are required in order to make a valid visa application for some classes of visa; </para><para>	Prescribed identity documents are required to be provided on entry to Australia in order to obtain immigration clearance; and</para><para>	An authorised officer can photograph or measure an immigration detainee for identification purposes.</para><para>However, the Act as it stands does not define a personal identifier, the circumstances in which a personal identifier may be required, or how it is to be provided. Nor does it contain safeguards for retention and disclosure.</para><para>This bill will implement a more comprehensive and transparent legislative framework for requiring certain non-citizens to provide personal identifiers such as photographs and signatures.</para><para>The bill will clarify and enhance the government's ability to accurately identify, and authenticate the identity of, non-citizens at key points in the immigration process in a way that is consistent with the current requirements of the act for proof of identity. </para><para>At the same time, it will provide protection for non-citizens who are required to provide their personal identifiers.</para><para>The bill will set out the types of personal identifiers that are able to be collected from certain non-citizens:</para><para>	fingerprints and handprints; </para><para>	photographs or other images of the face and shoulders;</para><para>	measurements of height and weight;</para><para>	audio or video recordings;</para><para>	signatures; </para><para>	iris scans; and</para><para>	other identifiers as prescribed in the regulations.</para><para>Allowing new types of personal identifiers to be prescribed in the regulations will permit the adoption of new technologies in a rapidly developing environment. It will also allow the government to respond to new risks or concerns as they arise.</para><para>However, the bill specifically excludes the use of intimate test procedures. Consequently, the regulations cannot prescribe a new type of personal identifier if it involves an intimate test procedure. This will exclude, for example, the taking of blood tests or saliva samples. </para><para>Broadly, the new provisions will provide a flexible and effective structure. They will enable the application of future technological advances to the accurate identification of persons seeking to enter Australia. They will also facilitate quick and unobtrusive entry processes at Australian borders.</para><para>Under the bill, the following non-citizens may be required by regulation to provide specified types of personal identifiers:</para><para>	immigration detainees;</para><para>	visa applicants and persons to be granted visas;</para><para>	non-citizens who enter and depart Australia, or travel on an overseas vessel from port to port in Australia; </para><para>	non-citizens in questioning detention; and</para><para>	persons in Australia who are known or reasonably suspected to be non-citizens.</para><para>The amendments will, where appropriate and necessary, require certain non-citizens to provide specified types of personal identifiers. The types of personal identifiers and the circumstances in which they must be provided will be set out in the regulations.</para><para>It is anticipated that the regulations prescribing the situations in which non-citizens must provide personal identifiers, and the types of identifiers required, will largely mirror the current situations where proof of identity is required. However, the bill will allow expansion of these requirements in line with future technological developments.</para><para>For example, it is envisaged that photographs and signatures will continue to be required in relation to most visa applications, including applications for visitor visas and most permanent visas. In these cases, a non-citizen will be able to provide these personal identifiers to an officer of the department by attaching their photo, signing the visa application and submitting it to the department. In the case of protection visa applications, it is likely that fingerprints, photographs and signatures will be required.</para><para>There will be some visa applications for which it is unlikely that any personal identifiers will be prescribed—for example, electronic travel authority visas.</para><para>The bill will provide a range of safeguards to non-citizens who are required to provide their personal identifiers.</para><para>First, a non-citizen in immigration detention will always be offered the opportunity to have an independent person present during the conduct of an identification test. As long as an independent person is readily available and willing to attend within a reasonable time, then the test must be carried out in the presence of an independent person. </para><para>In addition, if requested by the non-citizen in immigration detention, the test must be conducted by an authorised officer of the same sex as the non-citizen.</para><para>If a non-citizen in immigration detention who is required to provide their personal identifier refuses to do so, and all reasonable measures to carry out the test without the use of force have been exhausted, reasonable force may be used to collect the personal identifier.</para><para>Reasonable force will only be used as a measure of last resort and only if authorised by a senior authorising officer. It cannot be used on a minor or an incapable person.</para><para>If reasonable force is to be used to obtain the personal identifier from an immigration detainee, an independent person must be present at the test. </para><para>All identification tests will be conducted in circumstances that afford reasonable privacy to the non-citizen. Identifying information will be treated in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988.</para><para>There are special provisions for minors and incapable persons. For example, minors aged less than fifteen and incapable persons can only be required to provide photographs of their face and shoulders, and measurements of their height and weight. They cannot be required to provide any other type of personal identifier. </para><para>Further, in certain circumstances, minors and incapable persons who are not in immigration detention cannot be tested without the consent of their parent or guardian, or an independent person. No minor or incapable person can be tested unless their parent or guardian, or an independent person, is present.</para><para>Reasonable force cannot be used on a minor or an incapable person to obtain their personal identifiers.</para><para>Importantly, the bill will protect the privacy of non-citizens by placing limits on the access and disclosure of identifying information provided under the Act.</para><para>It will be an offence to access identifying information without authorisation. Specified persons will be authorised to access the identifying information for certain purposes—for example, to determine whether a person has previously applied for protection in an overseas country. </para><para>Another authorised purpose for access will be decision-making under the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. A person who applies for Australian citizenship by grant of certificate will be asked to provide their personal identifier(s). Those identifiers will be cross-matched with information held by the department. This will reduce the incidence of identity fraud-related activities in citizenship processing.</para><para>It will be an offence to disclose identifying information unless it is a permitted disclosure. For example, it would be permitted to disclose identifying information for the purposes of data-matching in order to identify, or authenticate the identity of, a non-citizen.</para><para>Another example of a permitted disclosure includes disclosure to a foreign country, or to law enforcement agencies and border control bodies of a foreign country, to inform their government of the identity of a person being removed or deported from Australia. A further example of a permitted disclosure is disclosure to an international organisation such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</para><para>In addition, this bill contains provisions to ensure that identifying information will not be disclosed in certain circumstances. </para><para>For example, identifying information will not be disclosed to a foreign country if a person has made a protection visa application in relation to that country. </para><para>However, this prohibition on disclosure will not apply if the person requests, or agrees, to return to the foreign country. It will also not apply if the person's application for a protection visa is refused, and has been finally determined.</para><para>Generally, identifying information will be destroyed once it is no longer required to be kept under the Archives Act 1983. </para><para>However, there will be some circumstances where an individual's identifying information will be kept indefinitely. </para><para>One of these circumstances is where the minister is satisfied that the non-citizen is a threat to the security of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory, and issues a certificate to that effect.</para><para>In summary, the proposals contained in this bill are important and necessary initiatives. They will enhance Australia's ability to combat identity fraud and improve the integrity of migration processes. </para><para>Other countries have already responded to the growing incidence of fraud in the immigration context by enhancing their identification and client registration powers. Problems with fraudulent documentation and the need to track histories of identities in client processing has led many countries to introduce identification testing measures similar to those proposed in this bill.</para><para>It is crucial that Australia has the opportunity and ability to participate internationally in combating immigration fraud using current and evolving technologies. In this international environment, Australia cannot afford to be seen as a `soft target' by terrorists, people smugglers, forum shoppers and other non-citizens of concern.</para><para>It is for these reasons that I ask all parties to support this bill.</para><para>I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1855">STATISTICS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</inline></para><para>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has a long tradition and history. The statistics it produces inform discussion and debate within government and the wider community. Indeed, information produced by the ABS is fundamental to the democratic process. </para><para>The ABS enjoys the trust and confidence of the people and businesses who provide information about themselves and their activities. It is this information that allows us to make decisions about the economy. And decisions about the services that people need to sustain and enhance their well-being. </para><para>The ABS appreciates and acknowledges the ongoing contribution of businesses and the public who assist with its censuses and surveys. </para><para>Fundamental to the trust of the community in the ABS is the knowledge that the ABS will protect their data and keep it confidential. This protection is underpinned by a secrecy provision in the Census and Statistics Act 1905. Every ABS officer is required to give an undertaking of fidelity and secrecy when they join the Bureau. This is a lifelong commitment that goes beyond their tenure at the ABS. The Bureau's reputation for the protection of data is untarnished. </para><para>I now turn honourable senators' attention to the substance of this bill before Parliament—the Statistics Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. Its main purpose is to rectify a number of technical deficiencies in statistics legislation. These arose as an unintended consequence of previous amendments to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975.</para><para>Deficiencies arising from amendments in 1987 and 1999 have placed in doubt whether all current and former ABS staff are covered by the secrecy provisions of the Census and Statistics Act 1905. This bill seeks to rectify this. It also seeks to validate practices of the ABS since the deficiencies arose. This will put beyond doubt the protection of ABS data absolutely, as Parliament has intended.</para><para>The ABS has been described by the former head of the United Nations Statistics Division as the “world's best international statistical citizen”. As a consequence, from time to time other agencies who are interested to learn from the ABS seek the opportunity for their staff to work with the ABS for a period of time. Similarly, the ABS occasionally has the opportunity to benefit from the particular expertise of staff of other agencies and international organisations. This bill also makes provision for the ABS to second officers for these purposes.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15743</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bill:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15743</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><para>Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003 (Act No. 84, 2003)</para><para>Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 (Act No. 85, 2003)</para><para>Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2003 (Act No. 86, 2003)</para><para>Higher Education Legislation Amendment Act 2003 (Act No. 87, 2003)</para><para>Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003 (Act No. 88, 2003)</para><para>Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Act 2003 (Act No. 89, 2003)</para><para>Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Act 2003 (Act No. 90, 2003)</para><para>Quarantine Amendment (Health) Act 2003 (Act No. 91, 2003).</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15744</page.no><id.no>S394</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Legal and Constitutional      Legislation Committee</title><page.no>15744</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator EGGLESTON (Western Australia) (6.16 p.m.)—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present the report of the committee on the proposed government amendments to the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings, and documents presented to the committee.</para><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15744</page.no><id.no>R1443</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>15744</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 11 September.</para><para>Senator COONAN (New South Wales—Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (6.17 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the committee does not insist on the Senate amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—Can I record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>the vote for the noes of the Australian Democrats.

The 1964 act provided that certain criminal laws applying in the Jervis Bay territory apply to Australian citizens and residents serving overseas under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations. This bill would amend the 1964 act to ensure that these same laws also apply to Australian non-military personnel working under a variety of agreements, and in a variety of roles, in any jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>As the opposition does not oppose this bill, I will not take up a significant portion of time tonight—not that we have it available in any event—but it is necessary to make a number of brief statements about the bill and to raise a couple of issues that we will pursue later in the committee stage. The amendments contained in this bill intend to extend the operation of the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 to cover two categories of Australian non-military personnel working outside the Commonwealth of Australia. It is not necessary for the bill to cover military personnel because members of the Australian Defence Force are already covered by the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 that establishes a regime of extraterritoriality along the same lines as the jurisdictional regime outlined in these amendments.</para><para>The first category of personnel covered by the proposed amendments is personnel working under agreements where multilateral or bilateral agreements, signed by Australia and the relevant host state, specifically grant immunity for criminal offences to Australian personnel operating in these jurisdictions. These amendments are uncontroversial in that regard and are supported by the opposition. The opposition recognises these amendments are necessary to ensure that Australian personnel operating with immunity overseas are, nonetheless, held responsible for criminal acts committed while they are covered by immunity agreements. The opposition, as I have said, supports these amendments because such an extension of jurisdiction is necessary to close the jurisdictional gap that currently exists for Australian non-military personnel operating with immunity.</para><para>Although the overwhelming majority of Australian personnel who undertake roles associated with the Commonwealth government overseas do so professionally and also with the highest regard for the laws and customs of the nations in which they operate, it is an issue—unfortunate as it may be but inevitable in some instances—that a very small minority break local laws while serving under an immunity agreement. As such, it is necessary for Australian courts to have the ability to apply Australian criminal jurisdiction over individuals accused of offences covered by immunity agreements.</para><para>This extension was expressly recommended by a unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, handed down in 1999. This report recommended that the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 `be amended to extend its jurisdiction to Australian civilians serving overseas in situations not covered by the agreement of the United Nations'. Just as the opposition supported this recommendation in 1999 we continue to support amendments to the 1964 act that close the jurisdictional gap and ensure that no Australians are above the law. Rather than a condemnation of the great service of Australians who have represented this country in dangerous and challenging roles, the opposition believes that these amendments affirm the integrity of the vast majority of fine Australians who have represented Australia overseas by holding them to the vigorous test of the rule of law. This is a test which they have passed with flying colours and which, in many cases, they have been instrumental in upholding and strengthening in the nations in which they have served.</para><para>The second category of personnel covered by the amendments contained in this bill are Australian non-military personnel who are serving in overseas jurisdictions under agreements that do not specifically grant immunity or who operate in countries without any agreement involving the host nation and Australia. In these circumstances the Attorney-General has the power to declare an agreement under which Australians are serving, or a country in which Australians are serving, a declared agreement or a declared country. This prescription by regulation, at the discretion of the Attorney-General, automatically activates the jurisdictional provisions of this act. Once again, this amendment implements a recommendation of the unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade handed down in 1999, which recommended `replacing “under agreement between the United Nations and the Government of that country” with, “a prescribed arrangement”'. The opposition supported the recommendation handed down by the joint committee then and continues to support an amendment that implements this recommendation now.</para><para>The use of the principle of extraterritoriality in criminal law matters is not without precedent in either Australian law or the laws of other nations, and the opposition believes that this instance is one of the occasions when the utilisation of this novel jurisdictional strategy is not only legitimate but, in the circumstances, demanded by the principles of justice. Australian law already utilises this principle of extraterritoriality in the prosecution and punishment of child sex offenders who commit offences outside the criminal jurisdiction of Australia. The requirements of justice in the case of offenders who commit sexual offences against children in countries where they are effectively above the law demands that the principle of jurisdiction be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate their prosecution when they return to Australia. The factual contingencies contemplated by this bill also demand such an interpretation of the principle of jurisdiction. However, in this case the principle of extraterritoriality needs to be applied offensively in the pursuit of Australian non-military personnel guilty of committing offences in countries where they enjoy immunity and defensively in the protection of Australian non-military personnel who are the subject of hostile or mala fide prosecutions.</para><para>The opposition also cites the recent moves by the American legislature to implement a similar regime regarding its own civilians posted overseas in connection with the United States Department of Defense as evidence of the growing trend among nations concerned with protecting the rule of law to implement legislation to ensure that no-one escapes liability for unlawful acts by falling through the jurisdictional gaps opened up by the increasing overseas posting of non-military personnel. In particular, the opposition draws the Senate's attention to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000, enacted by the United States Congress on 22 November 2000. This act was designed to extend federal criminal jurisdiction over civi-lians who are accompanying the armed forces and who commit serious offences overseas when a host country does not exercise criminal jurisdiction.</para><para>For the reasons that I have already cited, the amendments proposed by the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003 are supported by the opposition. There has not been a committee stage in this bill. There was an issue raised by Senator Brown earlier today because he was curious about why we did not go through that stage, and I think I have clearly explained that this matter was dealt with by a joint standing committee as far back as 1999. It has taken a little while for these matters to come forward but they are embodied in these amendments now. The difference is that they apply to non-military personnel. </para><para>If I understood Senator Brown correctly when he raised this matter today, he was talking about military personnel, and I think it was necessary to draw the senator's attention to whom the amendment to this bill will cover and the operation in relation to which it will be utilised. Of course, the committee matter was dealt with by the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 1999, when it made a unanimous report. It was supported by the opposition and therefore this bill is non-controversial in nature and has gained the support of Labor. I will conclude on that note.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15747</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1878">Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> seeks to ensure that Australian citizens working overseas under an agreement between Australia and an international organisation, or between Australia and another country, are subject to Australian criminal law rather than the criminal law of the country in which they were working. As the briefing provided by the government notes, the bill responds to recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade regarding a possible jurisdictional gap for Australian non-military personnel serving overseas.</para></talk.start><para>In its present form, the Crimes (Overseas) Act provides for the application of Australian criminal law to Australian civilians working in a foreign country as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force. It requires there to be an immunity agreement between the UN and the government of a foreign country. In recent years, and particularly in recent months, we have seen Australia's foreign policy develop in such a way that it is now not unusual for non-military personnel to be deployed to other countries under arrangements that do not involve the United Nations. The example cited by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade was the Bougainville peace monitoring group, which operated under an agreement between Papua New Guinea and a range of other countries, including Australia. That agreement expressly provided that members of the peace monitoring group were immune from the laws of Papua New Guinea and subject to the laws of their own country in relation to any offence that they might commit.</para><para>This bill extends the scope of the Crimes (Overseas) Act to four additional categories of Australians, depending on the arrangements under which they are working in a foreign country. Firstly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country who have been granted diplomatic and consular immunities or who have been granted immunity due to their relationship with an international organisation. This extension of Australian criminal law is clearly necessary in order to fill a jurisdictional gap. If a person working under these arrangements were to commit a crime, there is a risk that that person could not be prosecuted either under the law of the foreign country or in Australia. The passage of this bill will rectify that situation. </para><para>Secondly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country under an arrangement or agreement between Australia and another country or between Australia and the United Nations where that person is not subject to criminal proceedings as a result of the agreement. Thirdly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country under an agreement or arrangement between Australia and another country or between Australia and the United Nations which is a declared arrangement or agreement. The government may make regulations providing that a particular agreement or arrange-ment is declared an agreement or arrangement for the purposes of this particular legislation. </para><para>The fourth category of persons to whom this bill applies is very broad. This category covers any Australian working overseas, not necessarily on behalf of the Commonwealth but simply on terms determined by the Commonwealth or pursuant to commitments or directions given by the Commonwealth. Such Australians will be subject to Australian criminal law if the country in which they are working is a declared foreign country. Again, the government may make regulations providing that a particular country is a declared foreign country. These third and fourth categories are wide ranging and will enable Australian law to be applied to public servants such as AusAID staff working overseas as well as to private consultants and the employees of private companies who perform contractual work for the Commonwealth. They essentially enable the Australian government to unilaterally declare a particular agreement or a particular country for the purposes of this legislation, whether or not there is any agreement with the foreign government which provides immunity for Australians.</para><para>Unlike the first and second categories, which contain express provisions addressing the issue of double jeopardy, these additional categories do not appear to address that issue and it is unclear to the Democrats why that should be the case. This double jeopardy rule is an important safeguard which protects individuals against the cost, anxiety and uncertainty associated with repeated criminal trials, let alone multiple convictions and sentences for the same offence. The basis for the rule also extends to broader considerations relating to the integrity of the criminal process, as it is vitally important for the community to be able to have confidence in the final outcome of a criminal trial. It is imperative that Australians who might be prosecuted for an offence in a foreign country do not face the prospect of being prosecuted for the same offence under Australian law. The Democrats will be moving amendments to put that beyond any doubt.</para><para>Our other concern in relation to the bill is the proposed retrospective commencement of schedule 1 from 1 July 2003. On 26 June 2003, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs issued a joint media release in which they announced the legislative changes contained within this bill. The release referred specifically to Australians deployed to Iraq and stated that, in relation to Iraq, the act would commence from 1 July this year.</para><para>As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee noted in its Alert Digest No. 11 of this year, the explanatory memorandum does not provide any reason to justify the retrospective commencement of the schedule. The only obvious point of reference is the joint press release of 26 June, but it remains unclear why the government chose 1 July as this commencement date. The Democrats agree with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that this appears to be yet another example of `legislation by press release', which has become a frequent practice of the government in recent times. The Democrats strongly oppose this practice as it seeks to usurp the democratic process by assuming that the parliament will vote a particular way before legislation has been introduced. This is an example of the government's arrogance and the Democrats take this opportunity to make it very clear to the government that it cannot and must not make pre-emptive assumptions about how the parliament will vote on any given piece of legislation.</para><para>While there have been some occasions when the Democrats have been prepared to support retrospective provisions, these have been limited to circumstances in which there is an overwhelming, imperative justification for retrospectivity and provided that there is no significant retrospective alteration to the rights and liberties of individuals. This bill does not meet those requirements. The government has failed to provide any compelling reason for the retrospective commencement of the schedule and, in this case, the bill does involve a very serious retrospective alteration to the rights and liberties of individuals. What we are talking about here is criminal liability—in other words, liability to be sentenced to imprisonment. This is not something which, as a legislature, we can tinker with retrospectively. I find it incredible that the government expects us to consider this seriously in the absence of any genuine and compelling reason for retrospectivity. The government ought not to pre-empt the decisions of the parliament as the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice purported to do on 26 June. Ministers should refrain from making announcements which ultimately depend entirely on the decision of the parliament as a whole, otherwise the veracity of their media releases needs to be questioned.</para><para>The support of the Democrats for any retrospective legislation can never be assumed. In fact, the government should assume that we will oppose such legislation unless it can provide a compelling reason in support of retrospectivity. In this case, it has failed to do so and, unless the minister is able to provide any additional information during the committee stage, we Democrats will move amendments to remove the retrospective operation of this legislation.</para><para>Although we oppose the retrospective commencement of the bill, we Democrats are generally supportive of the thrust of the bill itself. As I understand it, the primary motivation behind the bill is to protect the rights of Australians working in countries whose criminal law does not provide the same level of protection as that afforded to an accused person under Australia criminal law. Australia's criminal law does incorporate a range of important protections—the independence of the courts, the right to silence, the presumption of innocence and the right to legal representation—although it should be noted that a number of these rights have suffered blows as a result of the government's antiterrorism measures. It is also important to remember that, if convicted of an offence under Australian law, individuals do not face the prospect of the death penalty as punishment for their crime.</para><para>In my view, it is completely hypocritical for the government to grant these protections to some Australians in foreign jurisdictions but not to others. I think, in particular, of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, who remain locked up by the US military in Guantanamo Bay. The government has ignored the consistent calls from the Australian Democrats to bring Mr Hicks and Mr Habib home to Australia and either charge them and try them under Australian law or release them. The US's treatment of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib flies in the face of the most basic concepts of justice that Australians take for granted, even after the passage of the ASIO legislation.</para><para>Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are among 600 others, including a number of children, who have been held at Guantanamo Bay for over 18 months without charge. They have been stripped of their rights under international and domestic law, with the US refusing to recognise them as prisoners of war or charge them with offences under US law. They are housed in tiny wire cages which are exposed to the elements on all sides. For the first few months of their detention, they were released just once a week for a one-minute shower. This was eventually increased to a five-minute shower and 10 minutes of exercise once a week. From the outset, it was alleged that some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay had no involvement whatsoever with terrorism. This was confirmed earlier this year when more than 40 of them were released without charge, including two elderly farmers who were taken into custody because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</para><para>A few months ago, the US announced that Mr Hicks would be among the first of those to be tried before a secret military tribunal. Despite that announcement, Mr Hicks has still not been charged with any offence, and there is no indication as to a likely time frame for the commencement of his trial. If and when any trial does ensue, the rules governing the proceedings will be the very antithesis of those that apply in criminal proceedings under Australian law. Apart from being completely secretive, the entire proceedings will be subject to presidential direction. They will have been set in motion as a result of a directive from the President and, if the President disagrees with the ultimate finding of the tribunal, he can simply reverse it. All the while, the government passively watches on, allowing Australian citizens to be treated in a way that would no doubt provide grounds for repatriation if they were being held in certain other countries.</para><para>It was only as a result of increasing community pressure and outrage that the Minister for Justice and Customs was eventually despatched to the United States to discuss this with the US authorities. Although some concessions were won, they were very minor. The government proudly announced that it had secured an assurance from the US that the death penalty would not be applied to Mr Hicks. However, when questioned further, it reluctantly conceded that no such assurance was secured in relation to Mr Habib.</para><para>I take this opportunity to again make the point that the government should seek to protect the rights of all Australians who are alleged to have committed crimes, not just those covered by the scope of this legislation. If Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are guilty of acts of terrorism then of course they must be brought to justice and punished accordingly. But, at this stage, they are merely alleged to have committed acts of terrorism, and it appears that the US is struggling to bring together enough evidence with which to prosecute them. It is imperative that the allegations against these men are tested and proven beyond reasonable doubt in a fair and independent trial according to law.</para><para>Finally—and I understand Senator Stott Despoja will speak to this further—it is important for the government not to simply confine its efforts to protecting the rights of Australians but to be a vigilant defender of the rights of all human beings. Unfortunately, the government's track record on human rights in recent years has left a lot to be desired and, although his record on the rights of asylum seekers does not bode well, I hope that the new Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, might demonstrate greater concern for the protection of human rights than did his predecessor.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15750</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking in this debate on the <inline ref="R1878">Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, Senator Greig has raised the question of Mr Habib and Mr Hicks, a matter I was personally involved in. I point out to the Senate that the President of the United States had indicated that Mr Hicks was eligible for trial. Mr Habib was not in that category. In fact, his status is yet to be determined. Discussions about what might transpire or how he might be dealt with were therefore somewhat premature. In relation to Mr Hicks, the situation was quite different, because we were looking at a situation where he had been determined to be eligible for trial. A number of concessions were obtained and the undertaking by the United States not to impose the death penalty was a major one. But the reason it was obtained for Mr Hicks was that he was eligible to stand trial. Mr Habib was not in that category. Therefore, the same level of negotiation could not take place in relation to Mr Habib as could take place in relation to Mr Hicks.</para></talk.start><para>The government stand by our record in relation to that. We obtained a good many agreements and undertakings in relation to how Mr Hicks would be dealt with in the event of a trial. One of the agreements—or concessions, if you like—obtained was that if any other country might obtain a benefit which was greater than that which we obtained for Mr Hicks then Mr Hicks would enjoy the same benefit. So if the United Kingdom, for instance, obtained some benefit for one of its citizens which Mr Hicks did not enjoy then the United States agreed that he would have that benefit. We thought that was a very good catch-all concession. Negotiations have been continuing between Washington and officials here in Canberra, and the matter is being progressed, as of course the United Kingdom is progressing its discussions with the United States. That really does not concern the bill, but Senator Greig raised that issue and I thought I should just clarify those issues.</para><para>The government believes that this bill will protect Australian civilian personnel who are deployed overseas in a number of circumstances. This includes operations which are currently being conducted in Iraq and the Solomon Islands. I saw first-hand recently, with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, the great work that is being done by our personnel in the Solomon Islands and also the reaction of the people of the Solomon Islands. They greatly appreciated the efforts that were being made. It was obvious that the decision that we took was the right one.</para><para>Without this amendment, Australian civilians may be at risk of becoming subject to the local criminal justice system of the country to which they have been deployed in certain situations. In many cases, the local criminal justice system may be unstable or in a state of collapse, making prosecution of deployed Australian civilians by local courts undesirable. For some overseas operations, the Australian government has been able to negotiate immunity for deployed Australian civilian personnel. In cases where Australian civilian personnel are immune from prosecution in a foreign country it is important that Australia has the ability to exercise jurisdiction over crimes which may have been committed during that deployment. If Australia is unable to exercise its own jurisdiction, Australia may face pressure to waive immunity and to allow the overseas courts to prosecute. If Australia does not waive immunity, a jurisdictional gap exists. The amendment bill resolves this jurisdictional gap and ensures that Australia is able to prosecute Australian personnel who are accused of offences while on overseas deployment.</para><para>In other cases, Australia may be unable to negotiate immunity for Australian civilians serving overseas but may be able to ensure that Australian jurisdiction will take priority over the jurisdiction of the local courts in that country. In these cases, it is important that Australia has the capacity to exercise jurisdiction over Australian civilian personnel who are deployed on overseas operations by the Australian government. If Australia is unable to exercise jurisdiction, Australian civilian personnel deployed overseas in such circumstances will be subject to prosecution in the local courts. This amendment will become particularly relevant in the future as Australia is faced increasingly with calls to send civilian experts, including policing experts, to overseas deployments. Of course we are seeing that in relation to New Guinea.</para><para>Australian Defence Force personnel are already protected by a similar provision in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. The Australian Defence Force has long understood the importance of protecting ADF personnel through provisions like this, and it is now appropriate that Australian civilians who perform humanitarian, security and law enforcement duties should be similarly protected. The amendment bill will ensure that the Australian civilian personnel who are working with diplomatic, consular and similar immunities in foreign countries can be brought to justice in Australia. This will address the jurisdictional gap that such personnel are currently subject to. It is in Australia's interests to protect Australian civilian personnel deployed overseas by the Commonwealth. This bill ensures that protection.</para><para>There has been some comment as to why this took so long. A range of issues have been involved. Firstly, the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was handed down in 1999. Of course extensive consultation had to take place, and in 2000 the government responded to that report. Policy approval was given in January 2001, and of course the bill had to remain in abeyance while the Intelligence Services Act 2001 was dealt with.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.51 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>15752</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>15752</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government document was tabled:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Crimes Act 1914</inline>—Report on controlled operations for 2002-03.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>15752</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics Act—Proposal No. 13 of 2003.</para><para>Broadcasting Services Act—Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice No. 1 of 1994 (Amendment No. 1 of 2003).</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—</para><para>Civil Aviation Safety Regulations—Airworthiness Directives—Part—</para><para>105, dated 28 August;

The Full Court confirmed that the arrangements employed in this particular mass marketed scheme were not tax effective. The Court allowed Ms Vincent's appeal in the 1995 year only because the ATO did not disallow the deductions claimed within the four year period provided by the tax law. This aspect of the decision has only limited application.</para><para>(10)	Appendix B to the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney-General sets out directions on the Commonwealth's obligation to act as a model litigant. </para><para>The obligation to act as a model litigant does not require the Commissioner to defer the making of a settlement with a taxpayer until another taxpayer's matter is heard by a court. A legitimate characteristic of a settlement is to bring a particular matter to finality, avoiding the need to await the outcome of separate court proceedings. A taxpayer was free to reject the Commissioner's offer of settlement and to pursue their case through the courts. A feature of accepting an offer is to forgo the ability to rely on any future decision of a court in relation to any other taxpayer. Settling matters is an entirely legitimate and common way of avoiding litigation. The Commonwealth routinely attempts to settle matters in appropriate circumstances and, in doing so, acts consistently with its model litigant obligations. Moreover, where there are many cases of a particular kind it is common, as was the case here, to make a generic settlement offer. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gippsland Electorate: Programs and Grants</title><page.no>15758</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1119)</subtitle><id.no>1119</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15758</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, upon notice, on 17 January 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What programs and/or grants administered by the department provide assistance to the people living in the federal electorate of Gippsland.</para><para>(2)	When did the delivery of these programs and/or grants commence.</para><para>(3)	What funding was provided through these programs and/or grants for the people of Gippsland in each of the following financial years: (a) 1999-2000;

Telstra call these inaccessible leaks (IALs). </para><para>Telstra has indicated that, in these cases, the leak location has to be detected using test equipment and the repair can be effected in one of two ways. The first is to dig down on the conduit run and expose the cable sheath at the point of the leak for repair. The second is to install in the conduit run a new section of cable between the man-holes either side of the leak. This generally means installing between 200 and 500 metres of new cable. As part of the cable maintenance program the IAL's have been identified and a program of works to undertake these repairs is under way. This program will continue as Telstra continue its maintenance upgrade work. </para><para>Telstra has indicated that to effect the repair, a number of steps need to occur including testing to locate the leak; analysis to determine whether digging down on the conduit run or cable replacement is the most effective option; and organising the resources including the material and people. </para><para>(8)	Telstra has advised that of the 20 IALs completed under the CPAS accelerated work program in NSW to 11 June 2003, 6 were repaired by replacement of cable length. The remaining 14 IALs were repaired by either “digging down” to the cable at the site of the damage and undertaking repairs, or replacement/repair of a pillar tail.</para><para>(9)	Telstra has indicated that the AMS system within Tasmania has been used to monitor the status of the compressors within exchanges.

According to Telstra, in those areas where rural direct buried cables are installed, extra protection measures are also installed to mitigate the effect of lightning which may strike: nearby structures, ground, Telstra cables, or power lines. The extra protection measures have included separate `guard wires' to intercept lightning and surge diversion devices. This is in addition to employing construction practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of damage due to local lightning strikes. </para><quote><para>Telstra has advised that a recent comprehensive investigation has reviewed national and international standards, literature and theory and has involved the undertaking of field testing to review current practices and develop a more robust standard. According to Telstra, this has been concluded and is now being implemented for all proposed new rural cables. </para><para>Urban cable networks are not protected in any special way, claim Telstra, as the cable types and their characteristics are considered quite adequate for the environments where there is significant local shielding (other services) to mitigate lightning effects. Furthermore, the cables are installed in a PVC / PE conduit, which increases the resistance to lightning voltages.</para></quote><para>(2)	In response to a recent study, Telstra is implementing standards and latest technologies on metallic cables. These involve a combination of guard wires (a stainless steel or copper wire laid above the cable) and/or over voltage surge diversion/voltage equalisation devices jointed into the cables at regular intervals. In areas of extreme risk or with a history of unacceptable levels of damage, Telstra can either employ galvanised iron pipes to protect the cable, or install optical fibre cables, which are mostly unaffected by lightning.</para><para>(3)	As reported by Telstra, lightning damage depends upon:</para><quote><para>- the energy of the strike;</para><para>- where and how the surge gets onto the cable;</para><para>- how close the lightning strikes are to the cable (it is almost impossible to prevent damage in the event of direct strike);</para><para>- the location (the Bureau of Meteorology provides details on the number of times thunderstorms historically occur across all areas of Australia);</para><para>- the shielding provided by the local environment; and</para><para>- the topology and the type of soil (its resistance to lightning current). </para><para>The damage itself can range from pinholes in the cable sheath (which may eventually cause a fault with moisture ingress), `popped' connectors (more so on older types) joining wires, or a few damaged conductors to complete destruction of cable joints, terminations and/or cable lengths, as well as damage to equipment connected to the cable pairs, such as customer CPE. Services generally cease working altogether but, if not, can suffer noise due to damage.</para></quote><para>(4)	According to Telstra, the nature of lightning damage is that cables are often damaged at multiple locations. When lightning strikes the ground, it seeks to dissipate the high voltage to earth - this occurs through the easiest path possible and a cable with copper conductors can offer such a path. The voltage travels along the cable looking for a path to earth; where this happens, there is cable damage or damage to customer equipment. </para><quote><para>For example, when lightning strikes and goes to ground into a cable, initial damage is caused on entry. The voltage then travels along the cable and if it comes to a standard joint, it damages that, then travels further. If it comes to a cable change of direction, it puts a hole in the side of the cable, and continues. If it comes to customer premises where a standard termination unit is on the side of the house, it causes more damage at this point and finally the surge damages customer equipment. </para><para>Telstra's cable and other network infrastructure is designed to withstand a range of environmental conditions and in high risk and known lightning areas, additional protective measures are taken. Where the environmental forces are extraordinary and Telstra's network is damaged, Telstra focuses on repairing the network and restoring services as quickly as possible.</para><para>Telstra has advised that, in relation to the MSD that occurred in Tasmania in March 2003, areas impacted had a large increase in reported faults and completed repairs in the days immediately following the storms. Telstra has stated that these increases ranged between 30 and 125% during the exemption period. On the day after the storm, before the exemption was declared, one area had an increase of over 200% in fault reports. Pictures, of which Telstra has on file from the lightning tracker web site, show that this was a particularly intense event and covered the south west coast of Victoria as well as north west and central areas of Tasmania.</para></quote><para>(5)	A public notice was published in HOBART MERCURY on 28 March 2003. This was booked with the publisher on 26 March in line with the requirements of the CSG Standard and Telstra License conditions. </para><para>(6)	CSG provisions were adhered to for this case.</para><para>(7)	No compensation was paid pursuant to CSGs during the exemption period.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Pay Phones</title><page.no>15787</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1543)</subtitle><id.no>1543</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15787</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 18 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(a) What is the process for clearing cash out of pay phones; and (b) how does Telstra know when a phone is ready to be cleared.</para><para>(2)	Is it the case that when a coin box in a public phone is full that this means the telephone cannot be operated by someone attempting to use it with coins. </para><para>(3)	When a `coin box full' message is received at a Telstra call centre from a pay phone, how quickly does Telstra send out someone to clear this box.</para><para>(4)	Who clears phone boxes. </para><para>(5)	Is there any difference in the timeframe or process for doing this in metropolitan areas or regional areas; if so, can details be provided. </para><para>(6)	What does Telstra say about reports that Telstra does not act on this information until the third `coin box full' message is received.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15787</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question, according to information given by Telstra, is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This answer is based on advice from Telstra and is substantively the same as the Telstra response to Question on Notice 141 from the Budget Estimates Hearings in May 2003.</para></quote><para>(1)	(a) Telstra has advised that coin collection is scheduled and performed by coin collection contractors.

Australia enjoys some of the cheapest electricity prices in the world for those customers connected to the electricity grid. This has the effect of making PV systems less cost-competitive in grid-connected applications than in those countries which have higher electricity prices.</para><para>(2)	Australia's position has not declined precipitately. According to the International Energy Agency in 2002 some 12% of the global PV capacity installed in non-grid-connected applications was installed in Australia, ranking Australia third. The Australian Government's support for PV has led to grid-connected PV systems achieving a significant market share in Australia in recent years. Even with Australia's cheap electricity prices, Australia ranked fifth overall in terms of PV capacity installed in 2002. This compared to ranking sixth in 1993.</para><para>(3)	(3)	A combination of factors is contributing to the uptake of PV in Japan and Germany. International Energy Agency statistics for 2002 show that the average retail price of electricity for households in Germany and Japan was two or more times as expensive as in Australia. The importance of electricity prices on the rate of uptake of PV is demonstrated in Japan where the Government rebate under their Residential PV System Dissemination Program is 100,000 Yen plus sales tax per kilowatt of PV installed which is less than half as generous under current exchange rates as the rebate offered to households under the Australian Government's Photovoltaic Rebate Program.</para><para>(4)	According to the International Energy Agency PV cell production in Australia doubled during 2002 and production capacity trebled. These figures represented some 4% of the global PV cell production and production capacity. The positive environment for PV in Australia created by Australian Government support for the renewable energy industry has encouraged other potential PV cell manufacturers to consider constructing factories in Australia, further increasing production of PV cells in Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Consitutional References Committee: Australian Republic Inquiry</title><page.no>15805</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1773)</subtitle><id.no>1773</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15805</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, upon notice, on 13 August 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the committee's inquiry into an Australian republic:</para></quote><para>(1)	How long is the inquiry expected to take.</para><para>(2)	What is the proposed budget for the inquiry.</para><para>(3)	Will costs be audited.</para><para>(4)	Will all submissions be made public other than those taken in-camera.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15805</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	This inquiry was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee by the Senate, the question being agreed to without objection.

The re-engagement of a former staff member, especially if the work performed is identical or similar to the duties carried out when the person was an employee, could place in jeopardy the bona fides of the tax concession applied to the redundancy payout.

Inability to do so could result in a nexus being drawn to create an employee/employer relationship, which, in turn, could jeopardise the bona fide nature of the redundancy, and possibly generate a requirement from the ATO to the ABC for all payments made to that contractor to be assessed as P.A.Y.G. (Pay As You Go).
