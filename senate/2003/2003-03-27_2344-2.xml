These regulations arose from a debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. During this debate a number of senators raised concerns that Australian embryos could be exported and used for research that could be considered unethicalâand now, of course, illegalâin Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In response to these concerns, the Minister for Health and Ageing indicated that the government would not support the amendments relating to the export of embryos put forward by Senators Boswell and Harradine. The minister informed the Senate on 13 November that the Prime Minister and Minister Ellison were proposing that the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 be amended to provide for a 12-month prohibition on exporting excess ART embryos and that this prohibition be reviewed after 12 months. The regulation was gazetted on 27 February and tabled on 3 March. It states:</para><quote><para>7(1) The exportation from Australia of a human embryo is prohibited absolutely.</para><para>7(2) This regulation ceases to have effect at the end of the day 12 months after it commences.</para></quote><para>These regulations are far broader. They go beyond the scope previously indicated by the minister in that debate. These regulations would have prevented women from taking their embryos offshore if they wanted to continue ART treatment elsewhere. It is worth noting that the broad-ranging consequences of these regulations would even have included women who were pregnant being prohibited from travelling overseas.</para><para>The regulatory impact statement that accompanies these regulations makes it clear that the regulations capture women who take their embryos offshore in order to continue IVF treatment. The number of women affected is not known. It is probably smallâ around 20 to 100 women in Australiaâbut that is not the point. Rather, the issue is that the regulations do not reflect the undertakings that were given by the minister in this place during the debate and arguably breach the COAG agreement that took place. It is worth noting that Senator Harradine's amendment on prohibiting the export of embryos, which was negatived by this chamber following Minister Patterson's undertaking to change the customs regulation, did exempt from the prohibition the export of a woman's embryos for her own ART treatment or for adoption.</para><para>Some people in this place may be aware that there was a degree of urgency to resolving the issue of the scope of these regulations, because one woman is due to leave Australia tomorrow with her ART-created embryos as part of a commercial surrogacy arrangement in the United States. Over the course of the week, both the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Justice and Customs worked on drafting new regulations that attempted to address the concerns that we had with the disallowance. Indeed, I understand that a new regulation has been drafted and went to the Governor-General this morning. </para><para>The Democrats deferred debate on this matter on Tuesday and again on Wednesday to accommodate this process. We wanted to be helpful and we wanted an outcome, not a disallowance for the sake of it. I am disturbed that over the course of this debateâ and particularly in discussions that occurred between this woman and staffâthe motives of the Australian Democrats have been impugned and attacked in the most underhanded manner. It is unacceptable that staff would pressure this particular woman with quite dishonest statements about the consequences for her of the disallowance.</para><para>I make it very clear that the Democrats will withdraw this notice today. This agenda, unfortunately, has become about commercial surrogacy. If that is the debate then let us bring on legislationâlet us not do it through delegated powers. This is a fine case study on the dangers of such powers. Australian women will be deeply disturbed to hear that the new regulation means that all women who want to take their embryos offshore now require ministerial approval. We will examine those new regulations. I have no doubt that there is going to be a debate when the Senate returns. But, over the next six weeks, I look forward to discussing the contents of the new regulations with senators from all parties so that, when we return, we can deal with those regulations in the manner that is required.</para><para>Pursuant to standing order 78(1), I give notice of my intention, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, to withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion

followsâ</inline></para><para>The Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval for Australian Involvement in Overseas conflict) Bill is introduced jointly in the names of myself as the Leader of the Australian Democrats and Defence spokesperson, and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, the Democrats' Foreign Affairs spokesperson.</para><para>The purpose of this Bill is to place the responsibility for the decision to send Australian troops overseas with both Houses of Federal Parliament subject to exceptions covering the movement of personnel in the normal course of their peacetime activities and the need to take swift action in an emergency. </para><para>In an emergency, the Governor-General may require defence force personnel to serve outside Australia's territorial limits, provided the Government then obtains parliamentary approval within two days. </para><para>The Bill excludes overseas service by members of the defence force pursuant to their temporary attachment as provided by section 116B of the Defence Act; as part of an Australian diplomatic or consular mission; on an Australian vessel or aircraft not engaged in hostilities or in operations during which hostilities are likely to occur; for the purpose of their education or training; and for purposes related to the procurement of equipment or stores. </para><para>I know that, over current events, many Australians have been shocked to discover that the Prime Minister has the power to send our troops to a conflict without the support of the United Nations, the Australian Parliament or the Australian people. But presently, the Prime Minister, under the guise of cabinet decision, and the authority of the Defence Act, has exactly that power.</para><para>Neither the Cabinet not the Prime Minister are mentioned in the Commonwealth Constitution, but the executive power of the Commonwealth is generally understood to include what are called the prerogative (common law) powers of the Crown. These powers include declaring war, making peace and deciding about the disposition of troops. The Defence Act now regulates much of the exercise of the royal prerogatives in relation to defence.</para><para>So despite what it says in section 68 of Australia's ConstitutionââThe command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representativeââthe Governor-General Peter Hollingsworth did not sign anything to authorise the current war on Iraq. </para><para>If there is a formal declaration of war the Governor-General makes a proclamation but it should be noted that Australia has not made a formal proclamation of war since 1939. Since then there has been the Korean war, the Malayan emergency, the Vietnam war, the 1991 Gulf War and the current war on Iraq, as well as numerous other smaller conflicts where Australian troops were involved.</para><para>For some time now, by convention, the view is that the Governor-General's role is a `titular' one. Therefore the decision to go to war is a decision by cabinet under the Defence Act.</para><para>At the time of the 1991 Gulf War the cabinet of the then Prime Minister Robert Hawke made the decision, forces were committed, authorised and, then, the Prime Minister formally notified the Opposition leader and Governor-General, of the Government's action. Under public pressure and political pressure from the Australian Democrats, the issue was subsequently taken to a recalled Parliament for debate. It is this precedent that Prime Minister Howard has pointed to many times in past months.</para><para>Of course there is an important difference between 1991 and 2003, in that in 1991 the majority of the Parliament, though not the Democrats, supported the decision to commit Australian troops to the Gulf war. This was not the case in 2003. Last week the Senate clearly voted against the decision to commit Australian troops to war in Iraq.</para><para>The Howard Government has been the first Government in our history, to go to war without majority Parliamentary support. </para><para>It is time to take the decision to commit troops to overseas conflict, out of the hands of the Prime Minister and a subservient cabinet, and place it with the Parliament.</para><para>The Democrats first proposed in 1981 that the Australian parliament's consent be needed to commit troops to overseas conflict, through seeking to move amendments to the Defence Act. Subsequently Senators Colin Mason and Don Chipp sought to achieve the same result through a Private Senator's Bill.</para><para>The example they pointed to then, was the Vietnam war, which Senator Mason described as: âOne of the most divisive issues that has ever oppressed our historyâ. During that decade of war from 1962 to 1971 almost 500 members of the Australian forces were killed and many thousands injured. But it was the fact that a large section of the Australian community opposed the war, that made it much more difficult for those veterans to begin healing. </para><para>Indeed the costs of that war and all 20th century wars continue to this day, in physical and psychological damage, in the broken lives and broken families of too many veterans. </para><para>That is why it is so important that we repeatedly make the point that we support the troops presently involved in the war on Iraq, and we must support them when they return. We must let them talk and we must listen, and we must always remember that they have shown a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for this nation. It is not fair to ask them to also determine Government policy.</para><para>I support of this Bill, the example we point to today is that of the current war on Iraq. And it is a much more pronounced example of the Executive, and in effect the Prime Minister, making a decision to commit troops to overseas conflict, without the support of the Parliament or of the people of Australia.</para><para>It is the Democrats belief that this war is unwise, immoral and illegal under international law. Even if we were to believe the Government's case that this war is legal, it would set a precedent that makes it easier and therefore more likely for Governments to go to war.</para><para>The fact that the Government is pursing a doctrine of pre-emptive strike makes this Bill all the more important.</para><para>In March last year the PMâwhile in Londonâ reportedly stated his belief that the Australian public would support extending our involvement in the war on terrorism to other theatres such as Iraq. </para><para>The Democrats first questioned the Minister for Defence that monthâ12 months agoâabout Australia's potential involvement in a war on Iraq. We called, as long ago as May and June of last year, for full Parliamentary debates on this issue and for there to be a conscience vote on any deployment or involvement of Australian troops. We have since then asked many questions and moved many motions, some of which got ALP support, someâfor example our motion in August to refer the matter to the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee for inquiryâthat the ALP would not support. </para><para>It took till 17 September 2002 until the Foreign Affairs Minister put a statement on Iraq to the Parliament for debate and it was not until 4 February this year that the Prime Minister stepped forward and made a statement to the Parliament. </para><para>That statement did not make the case for the extreme action of committing Australia to war. </para><para>By the time the Prime Minister made his statement to the Parliament in February, he had already offered up the use of Pine Gap and Australian facilities and ports to US warships. Then he offered up our troops.</para><para>He effectively handed over the decision of whether Australia would go to war to someone that no Australian voted forâUS President George Bush.</para><para>All the time the Government continued to deny that they had committed us to war. Despite the fact they had already drawn up the Budgetâ which they refuse to disclose, admitting only that the deploymentânot the warâbut the deployment alone would cost âsome hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The Treasurer now claims that the entire war will cost âseveral hundred million dollarsâ. I will be surprised if it in fact costs under one billion dollars.</para><para>It is clear the Prime Minister failed to convince the Australian people of the case for this war, despite a 12 month campaignârun largely on talkback and current affairs shows instead of the Parliamentâto convince the Australian people that this is a just war, a necessary war or a war that Australia should be involved in. </para><para>But I ask Senators to consider not just this conflict, but ask `where next?' The Government's Defence White paper update released recently, reflected the new reality, that this Government is willing, even eager, to play a military combat role, that is politically outside of United Nations' multilateral efforts and geographically, far beyond our own Asia Pacific region where there are many significant security issues. </para><para>Inevitably this will be at some cost to our focus on our own region. The fact is our military and other security resources are limited and we have to make choices as to how and where they are deployed. </para><para>It took a long time before the Australian Government finally intervened in the humanitarian disaster of East Timor but it was astonishingly quick to decide it would assist in regime change in Iraq.</para><para>The Executive should not be able to involve Australian troops in an overseas conflict if they have not been able to successfully make their case at least to the Parliament. What the Democrats are seeking is for the Parliament, as the voice of the people, to have some control over the situation. </para><para>This initiative, as it does in other countries, will lead to a more reasoned basis for sending defence force personnel overseas, and ensure it occurs only where it has majority support outside the Cabinet. </para><para>Certainly the Prime Minister did belatedly put the matter of war against Iraq before the Parliament, but we did not have the power to stop it.

It was part of a package of measures designed to promote ethical standards in public life. </para><para>This bill deals with truth in political advertising. Its effect is to require political advertising to meet similar standards of probity and honesty as commercial advertising must meet under the Trade Practices Act. The bill prohibits political advertising that is inaccurate and misleading to a material extent.</para><para>There is no plausible justification for permitting political advertising to make statements of fact that are demonstrably false. Such advertising has long been outlawed in South Australia. The Commonwealth should follow suit.</para><para>The law as it stands permits some people and some political parties to seek to rise to power on the strength of political advertising that can be totally fraudulent. This lax attitude to truthfulness fosters a culture within some political circles that regards deception as simply part of the political game, rather than the serious attack on the integrity of the political system that it is.</para><para>The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee conducted an extensive inquiry into this bill, along with three other bills that addressed similar issues of probity in public affairs and public confidence in the institutions of government. </para><para>I have always considered the referral of private senators' bills to Senate Committees an important step not only in reviewing the legislation, but also in refining it. I thank the Committee for its excellent work on this legislation. I have taken the committee report, along with the oral and written submissions, and used them as the basis for a revised version of this bill. </para><para>The revised bill retains the character and purpose of its predecessor, but takes into account the comments and contributions of a number of people over the past three years. </para><para>The key changes are as follows. </para><para>Firstly, proposed subsection 329(7) has been amended to refer to a statement of fact that is `inaccurate and misleading to a material extent' rather than `inaccurate or misleading to a material extent'. Part of the purpose of this is to harmonise this provision with section 113 of the South Australian Electoral Act, which refers to statements of fact which are `inaccurate and misleading to a material extent'. </para><para>Furthermore, this change allays concerns that material that is inaccurate but not misleading in the relevant sense might fall within the scope of the prohibition. </para><para>The penalties have been amended with reference to the general rule set out in the Crimes Act 1914 that maximum penalties for corporations should be five times the penalty for an individual, and that the penalty should be expressed in penalty units rather than dollar amounts. The new penalties of 2000 and 10 000 penalty units for individuals and corporations are the same as the penalties that apply to a number of the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions in the Trade Practices Act. It should be noted that these are maximum penalties. </para><para>In accordance with the committee recommendation, the term `advertiser' has been defined in the legislation. This responds to concerns raised over provisions that give the Electoral Commissioner power to request, and the Federal Court the power to order, an advertiser to publish a retraction in a specified manner and form.</para><para>It is now clear in the legislation that an advertiser does not include a person who took no part in determining the content of the electoral advertisement.</para><para>One of the broader issues that was raised during committee process was the appropriateness of regulating political discussion. The Constitution contains an implied guarantee of freedom of political communication, and the bill is in no way intended to detract from that guarantee. </para><para>It is also important to recognise that dishonest political advertising can detract from, rather than advance, democratic standards. A submission from the Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance at</para><para>Griffith University made the point as follows:</para><para>âFalse or misleading electoral advertisements, timed during the crucial 4 or 5 weeks of an election campaign, may persuade voters to vote in ways they otherwise would not and which they are likely to regret if and when they discover the true facts-such strategies threaten the integrity of the heart of the democratic processâvoters are not choosing between the policies on offer but between misrepresentations of those policies. It also threatens trust in government by the electorate.â</para><para>The revised bill includes a provision indicating that the bill does not apply to the extent (if any) that would infringe any doctrine of implied freedom of political communication. This provision, in combination with the clear focus of the legislation on the regulation of dishonest advertising, strikes an appropriate balance between the complementary objectives of promoting the integrity of our political system and ensuring public debate is robust and free. </para><para>The bill generated some debate over the proposed role of the Australian Electoral Commissioner. </para><para>The bill proposes to give the Commissioner the task of evaluating campaigns for misleading and inaccurate content. The Commissioner may request withdrawal of an advertisement and, if necessary, may refer the matter to the Federal Court. The approach is similar to the approach taken under equivalent South Australian legislation. </para><para>The AEC objects to this proposal, essentially because it does not wish to be involved in what it refers to as a `political bunfight' over the truth of electoral advertisements. </para><para>The unfortunate fact is that if Australian politics is to be properly regulated we need a regulator. No election campaign is entirely without controversy or complaint. The AEC presently does a very good job of managing the many difficulties faced by an independent electoral regulator. I have no doubt that AEC officers would discharge their proposed duties under this legislation with a similar standard of independence and professionalism. </para><para>Finally, a few drafting issues have been addressed. The redundant section 329A concerning headings to electoral advertisements has been deleted and the drafting error in paragraph 329(5A)(b) of the original bill has been rectified. </para><para>The Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee recommended that this bill, in its original form, not proceed. I have sought to address many of the issues identified by the Committee in the redrafting process.</para><para>As the bill retains its fundamental character, there are many who will still oppose its enactment. </para><para>Nonetheless, I and the Australian Democrats remain of the view that this measure is important to improve standards in political advertising. When I first introduced the legislation I commented that: </para><para>âPublic comment and debate consistently reveals a striking level of distrust of Australian politicians. It is a grave matter indeed when people lose faith in their leaders and representatives. When politicians are widely viewed as dishonest and untrustworthy, the perceived legitimacy of the entire political system is compromised. It is not enough for Australian politicians to protest their own integrity. Systemic distrust and electoral cynicism born of experience must be met with legislative solutions. The time has come for Australian politicians to require political honesty to be made a matter of law.â</para><para>Since making these comments, we have seen an incredibly divisive federal election campaign. Even now, many members of the public feel that they were betrayed and misled during the election campaign. I refer of course to the `children overboard' affair. </para><para>These issues are not going to disappear. I remind the Senate that when the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce was introduced through the Trade Practices Act, it received very similar criticisms that have been directed at this legislation. Those provisions are now seen as an important consumer protection measure that has significantly advanced commercial standards in this country.  </para><para>Ultimately, citizens in a democracy are entitled to expect honesty from their leaders. Experience teaches that when the competitive interests of political parties are at stake, only force of law will ensure that reasonable standards of truthfulness are upheld. This bill is an important step forward in setting and enforcing those standards. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted;

It was 30 years to the day that he was savagely beaten and drowned in the River Torrens. This case was surrounded in controversy and to this day has never been solved. His death did however, became a catalyst for significant change in South Australia when, in 1975, it became the first state of Australia to decriminalise homosexuality.</para><para>Much has changed for the better in the three decades since that time. Many key reforms have occurred, affording protection to the most marginalised and vulnerable in our community from the vicious and evil hatred that too often surrounds us. But we have a long way to go.</para><para>I believe this bill is an important document, and assists in that progress. It is important because it will improve the experience of a significant proportion of our community for whom the effects of homophobic hate, contempt and ridicule are all too well known, directly or indirectly, and if not known, then for many certainly feared.</para><para>Homophobia is perhaps best described as âsexual racismâ.</para><para>Arguably all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members of the Australian community live with the day-to-day direct experience of homophobia. Occurring at multiple levels within our community, that homophobia is deeply entrenched in the Australian psyche and impacts heavily not just for those who are the direct recipients, but also for any of those community members who limit, alter or monitor their cultural, social or intellectual environment in order to avoid being targeted by homophobic attacks. The experience of homophobia ultimately has profound ramifications for the whole community.</para><para>In those jurisdictions where Anti-Discrimination legislation exists, protection in areas of employment, provision of goods and services, and group membership has been a hard-won fight for equality and justice. These various pieces of legislation have worked hand in hand with changing community attitudes that no longer deems discrimination on the basis of sexuality as acceptable.</para><para>Where these pieces of legislation fall short though, is in providing protection from the effects of actions, public statements and publications whose aim or outcome achieves little more than fuelling hate, contempt and ridicule against gay and lesbian people. Sadly the by-product of these irresponsible acts can be violence, harassment, intimidation and property damageacts perpetrated by those who believe that a community that fails to actively condemn public vilification in the first place, also legitimises and tacitly supports their actions.</para><para>For lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people themselves, the impacts of this belief are multiple. For some, particularly those who are young and/or struggling with identity issues, vilification in the public arena adds to the weight of their experience, resulting in higher risk of early school leaving, homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, poor self-image, depression, self-harm and suicide. For others, hate crimes resulting in trauma, injuries, and occasionally death, have been the end result. Australian research consistently shows lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as being over-represented in areas of compromised health and well-being that are directly attributable to the homophobia they experience. </para><para>Once enacted, this bill will operate in a number of ways to reduce the effects of homophobia I've just mentioned. It will become unlawful to incite hateful, damaging and occasionally lethal attitudes within the community on the basis of sexuality and gender identity. For lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and communities who continue to be targeted by acts, statements and or publications fuelled by hate, there will be legal recourse and protection under the law.</para><para>Perhaps more importantly though, the legislation will send a clear message to the entire community that those in positions of authority, our law-makers and community leaders, those upon whom we rely to protect and defend our fundamental human rights, abhor and reject the notion that one group is able to wield its position to subjugate, discredit, and denigrate another on no other basis than how it is that they identify and who it is they choose to love.</para><para>This bill will not, as some will undoubtedly argue, stifle free speech, discussion or debate. Neither is it intended that it would do so. Public debate, I would argue, has yielded many positive changes for homosexual people in this country. Where legal reforms have made a necessary and worthwhile contribution to the realisation of lesbian and gay human rights, it has been through the public debate surrounding these reforms that true attitudinal change has occurred.</para><para>It is through this changing of attitudes, changing of hearts and minds, that the biggest shifts have occurred for sexual minorities. That is not to say that those debates have always been easy for either supporters or opponents of reform, or that they have necessarily always been appropriate or well informed, but they <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> occurred within contexts that have proved to ultimately be fruitful for the advancement of understanding, tolerance, inclusivity and community wholeness. What the Sexuality Anti-Vilification Bill seeks to prevent are those gratuitous and destructive forces that serve no useful purpose other than to denigrate, incite and inflame, and to prey on misinformation, fear, myth and stereotype.</para><para>I first signalled my intention to present the Sexuality Anti-Vilification Bill in March 2002. At that time of course, my intention was in direct response to the now infamous events surrounding Senator Heffernan's extraordinary and unfounded attacks on the integrity not just of his main target Justice Michael Kirby, but as I argued at the time, on the whole of the gay community.</para><para>Here was a very public attack on a successful, openly identified gay man that stood to significantly smear his public standing and jeopardise his career. Although as we now know, Senator Heffernan's claims were later discredited and Justice Kirby's name was cleared if not somewhat stained, I think the Senator failed to realise that the result of his actions had rippled across an entire and marginalised community.</para><para>The incident left the gay and lesbian community with the overwhelming and regularly reinforced notion that if you are a high profile and powerful community member who is open about your sexuality, then you are fair game for character attacks based upon hearsay, conjecture and damaging use of myths and stereotypes.</para><para>Time and again, all kinds of statements based on inaccurate stereotypes have been used as justification for discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, so much so that last year a report was launched by the Australian Institute of Criminology that investigated anti-homosexual homicides in NSW over the preceding two decades. The report, <inline font-style="italic">Hatred, Murder and Male Honour</inline> came to some startling conclusions that many within gay and lesbian communities had known anecdotally for some time.</para><para>What the report found was that attacks on gay men in NSW between 1980 and 2000 followed a particular pattern in which attacks were often perpetrated against men assumed or known to be gay, often in open spaces, by packs of teenage or young adult males in their 20's, accompanied by homophobic verbal abuse, and of particularly intense ferocityâmultiple injuries sustained by ongoing kicking, punching and assault with a variety of weapons. In many instances, these attacks were pre-meditated where young men had travelled distances to âpoofter-bashâ, and in other instances occurred over a period of some time in which victims who struggled to get away were mercilessly pursued to their deaths.</para><para>Of particular concern was the finding that for many of the young men involved in these bashings, there was a lack of understanding about the seriousness of their crime, and in some instances boasts about their accomplishments. The report highlighted a clear link between these young men's understanding of their own community-affirmed, idealised masculinity as compared to the less than ideal, âenemy statusâ of the assumed homosexual they were attacking. </para><para>For many of these young men, community attitudes to homosexuality led them to believe they were actually doing society a service in viciously attacking their victimsânot necessarily with the view to killing them, but certainly with the aim of denigrating, degrading, silencing and closeting them to public visibility.</para><para>And the effect is profound. In 1995, the NSW Police Service <inline font-style="italic">Out of the Blue</inline> report found that 90% of gay men and lesbians, compared with 56% of the general NSW population were `concerned' that they or their friends would be assaulted.</para><para>According to the Anti-Violence Project, an organisation charged with monitoring reports of hate crime and educating the community, the fear may still be there, but in recent years the community has increasingly come to live with a level of violence in its life. And not surprisingly, when research conducted in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania has consistently shown that around 80% of survey respondents had experienced verbal abuse and harassment in the preceding 12-month period.</para><para>Ironically it has often been in those environments where the case for protection against discrimination and vilification is being stated, that the most stunning examples of flagrant abuse of position have been witnessed.</para><para>Currently only Tasmania and NSW have Sexuality Anti-Vilification legislation, with my home state of Western Australia and Queensland indicating an expression of interest in similar legislation. In each of those states there have been many examples in which public officials, community organisations and members of parliament have made public statements that have been grossly offensive to lesbian and gay communities, and none more hate-filled and vitriolic than in those debates advocating protection from discrimination and vilification.</para><para>In Western Australia there were unprecedented levels of public vilification aimed at the lesbian and gay community in the lead-up to, and during debate, that eventually resulted in the removal of a number of anti-gay provisions in WA law. One of the key areas in which change was being advocated, was in relation to age of consentâset at that time at 16 years of age for heterosexual and lesbian sex and at 21 for gay sex.</para><para>I lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Board in response to billboard and full-page newspaper advertisements placed by an anti-gay group, in which the lobby group implied that law reform would make boys vulnerable to sexual abuse. The ASB found in favour of my complaint stating that in its view, the anti-gay group was in breach of the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) self-regulatory Code of Ethics, by publicly vilifying homosexual people by implying an association between homosexuality and paedophilia. In a first for the Board, the lobby group refused to withdraw the advertisements, and continued to publish the material until the laws were changed. </para><para>This incident provides a useful example of the type of activity that would be outlawed by the Sexuality Anti-Vilification Act. The absence of appropriate safeguards allowed the printing of material that served little useful purpose to the law reform debate in WA, yet promoted fear, anxiety and hate within the broad community, and fear of crime, anxiety, insult and hurt to members of the homosexual community, their friends, supporters and families.</para><para>At present we do not know how many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Australians are subject to acts either directly or indirectly, that would be covered by anti-vilification legislation. Widely regarded as standard, we could safely assume that in cases such as those just mentioned, perhaps 10% of the population is affected indirectly. What we do know is that anecdotal evidence and research conducted in several Australian states shows very high incidence of verbal abuse and physical threats, in the case of verbal abuse, consistently as high as 80% of respondents. We also know that fear of crime within our homosexual communities is high.</para><para>Limited access to hard data has often been used to justify inaction on the development of appropriate anti-vilification responses, and has similarly been used to hold up action on various pieces of state-based anti-discrimination legislation before that.</para><para>The argument has often been that we are possibly talking about such small numbers of people that it is really not necessary or valid to be promoting âspecial rightsâ for such insignificant numbers. Of course the counter argument has always been that there is no request here for special rights, just fundamental ones we all ought to take for granted, and that regardless of numbers, all Australians have the right to equal protection under the law.</para><para>In NSW the hate crime problem is seen as so significant that Opposition Leader John Brogden last year called for a 25% compulsory increase in sentences for hate crimes including those based on sexuality, and was serious enough that the NSW Police announced a coronial inquest into a series of gay murders and disappearances in the late 1980's. </para><para>In fact, the NSW Police Department was the first, and is still one of the few state police departments to keep statistics on hate crime motivated by homophobia. The limited collection of statistical information in other jurisdictions has severely limited our capacity to adequately measure the incidence of these crimes. Historically, this difficulty has been further compounded by the fact that many crimes go unreported because gay and lesbian victims of crime have often feared police would not take their complaint seriously, or that they risked being subjected to further experiences of institutional homophobia. Others have feared their circumstances may actually be made worse by reporting the crime.</para><para>Significant steps have been taken in all states to respond to these issues. Most states now have officers trained in gay and lesbian community issues who are available as specialist liaison officers. Many more states are working to improve information-gathering processes to ensure that crime causal factors are recorded, of which homophobia is but one indicator.</para><para>I would argue that these developments simple reinforce the need for comprehensive anti-vilification legislation. Such legislation will assist the police in the work they have already undertaken within our gay and lesbian communities, and assist to engender a greater level of trust in those gay and lesbian victims of harassment, abuse, and physical and property crimes, who have remained unconvinced about the legal system's capacity to adequately respond to their experience.</para><para>Running counter to the argument about very small numbers of affected people, there is the dual concern that perhaps we are talking about enormous numbers of people and the implications for free speech are just too large and too serious as to justify action. As I mentioned previously, the intended outcome of anti-vilification legislation has never been to limit free speech, exchange of ideas, or public debate.</para><para>In Tasmania and NSW, the only two Australian jurisdictions to have enacted anti-vilification legislation, limits to free speech have not arisen as an actual outcome of that legislation either. From another tack, I would challenge anyone to successfully argue that racial debate has been stifled federally due to the existence of the Commonwealth Racial Hatred Act.</para><para>In Tasmania, a complaint was brought before the Anti-Discrimination Commission by local community members and activists claiming that printed information being distributed in Launceston mailboxes was offensive to, and incited hatred against, Jewish people and homosexuals. In that particular case, a determination was made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission later enforced by the Federal Court. In this example, a case that began with the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commission ended up being dealt with at a Commonwealth level under the Racial Hatred Act. In almost five years since it was proclaimed, there have been no successful vilification cases brought before the Tasmanian Anti-discrimination Commission.</para><para>It is a similar story in NSW where only one successful case has been brought before the Commission there, and even in that case the victory was only a partial one. The complainant was unable to establish that the homophobic abuse his neighbour shouted at him, or the human faeces smeared at his door, constituted homosexual vilification, because the acts were not seen to incite ordinary people to feel hatred on the grounds of his sexuality. It was only because that same neighbour also saw fit to scrawl a penis on the complainant's front door, accompanied by the words âfag lives here, faggots should dieâ, that the complaint was upheld.</para><para>These examples highlight the limited impact that the existence of anti-vilification provisions has had in these two states in terms of challenges to free speech, and further, the second case in particular, highlights the significant extent to which harassment needs to extend before a case of vilification can be upheld.</para><para>What the Sexuality Anti-Vilification legislation will prevent is <inline font-style="italic">any public act that incites hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person.... on the basis of that person's sexuality</inline> and will also cover threats of harm to person or property.</para><para>It will specifically exempt anything said or done reasonably and in good faith:</para><para>Â·	In the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work,</para><para>Â·	In the course of any public statement, publication, discussion, or debate for academic, artistic, or scientific purpose, or any other purpose on the public interest, or</para><para>Â·	In the fair and accurate reporting of any event or matter of public interest.</para><para>Sadly, I am also all too often reminded that in many respects very little has changed. Hate crimes against the homosexual community continue to occur, spurred on by public officials and community organisations that shamefully and irresponsibly peddle spurious and damaging stereotype, myth and innuendo. The end result being an entire community coerced into living in fear and suspicion of difference. It is for these reasons, and at this time in particular, that I implore all members of this chamber to support the introduction and passage of the Sexuality Anti-Vilification Bill, to assist in bringing to an end the promotion of community division and the needless pain, suffering and derision experienced by those in our gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86X</name.id><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT: LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS PLANT</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>10330</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator NETTLE (New South Wales) (9.46 a.m.)âby leaveâI move the motion as amended:</para><para>That the Senateâ</para><quote><para>	(a)	notes that the Liquefied Natural Gas Plant proposed to be built by Phillips Oil Company Australia at Wickham Point in Darwin Harbour would increase the Northern Territory's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent and increase Australia's overall greenhouse gas emissions by 1 per cent;</para><para>	(b)	notes that Phillips ADD Petroleum was not required to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment under the <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</inline> supposedly as a result of changes to the plant related to it receiving only methane from the Bayu Undan field;</para><para>	(c)	notes that the initial process did not include the now required continuous dredging of the migrating alluvial sand bars of Charles Point Patches or its potential impact on the dugong population;</para><para>	(d)	urges the Government to consider whether there are grounds for reconsideration of the controlled action decision under Part 7 of the <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</inline>; and</para><para>	(e)	notes that at a huge cost to the environment, only 120 permanent jobs will be created by this project, the liquefied natural gas from which will be fully exported.</para></quote><para>Question negatived.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PALESTINE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>10330</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (9.47 a.m.)âThis motion relates to the establishment of an independent andâto use the words used overnight by British Prime Minister Tony Blairâviable state of Palestine.

The PBAC must give consideration to the effectiveness and cost of drugs and medicinal preparations and their comparison with alternative therapies, including non-drug therapies.</para><para>The PBAC currently consists of a Chairperson and eleven other members. Eight members must be selected from the following groups: consumers, health economists, practising community pharmacists, general practitioners, clinical pharmacologists, and specialistsâwith at least one member selected from each of these groups. Members from these groups must be appointed from nominations made from bodies prescribed by the Regulations. The Minister appoints the remaining members based on qualifications and/or experience in a field relevant to the functions of the PBAC that would enable them to contribute meaningfully to its deliberations.</para><para>These amendments provide for the PBAC membership to be increased by up to four persons, in an order to cope more effectively with the current situation, whereby the minority of medical specialists on the Committee have experienced a substantially increased workload. The membership will consist of a Chairperson, with not less than eleven and not more than fifteen other members. In order to retain the current ratio of the number of members nominated by external organisations to the number of members appointed by the Minister, these amendments also provide that not less than two-thirds of the total number of members be selected from nominations by the prescribed organisations.</para><para>The Bill also makes a number of other minor amendments in relation to the PBS.</para><para>(a)	Under normal PBS supply arrangements, most medicines are supplied by community pharmacies on the prescription of a medical practitioner. However, section 100 of the National Health Act 1953 has for many years provided an important mechanism to enable special distribution arrangements for medicines where, in particular circumstances, the normal PBS supply arrangements are not convenient or efficient. The amendments in this Bill will make it clear that special supply arrangements can be used for the funding of particular medicines that are not available through the normal operation of the PBS.</para><para>(b)	A pharmacist must obtain approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits from particular premises, and thus must obtain a new approval before relocating to other premises. Occasionally a pharmacist relocates without applying for approval, and cannot be paid for any pharmaceutical benefits supplied from those unapproved premises.</para><para>(c)	In these circumstances the pharmacist has been asked to apply for approval at the relocated pharmacy and, if the application is approved, the pharmacist has then requested and received an act of grace payment and/or waiver of recovery for 90% of the value of the benefits supplied from the unapproved pharmacy. These amendments will give the pharmacist an entitlement to receive the 90% payment or waiver once the relocation is approved.</para><para>(d)	Amendments in this Bill will allow an agent to make and sign an application for a PBS safety net concession or entitlement card, or for an additional or replacement card on behalf of an applicant where a person who has qualified for the card is unable to sign the application.</para><para>(e)	This Bill also provides that determinations of forms, strengths and brands of PBS medicines and their maximum quantities and repeats will apply to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by hospitals in the same way as they do to pharmaceutical benefits supplied by pharmacies. This has become necessary due to the introduction of arrangements with some States for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by public hospitals to out-patients, day-admitted patients and admitted patients on discharge.</para><para>(f)	The Bill will also make clear that the decision-maker (be it the Secretary, or the Minister) has the discretion whether or not to cancel an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Simplified Claiming</inline></para><para>Where a service is provided as part of a Medical Purchaser Provider Agreement (MPPA) the National Health Act 1953 requires that the provider of medical services forward all accounts to the Health Fund.

The Health Fund is prohibited from extending coverage to any gap that may exist, and the member is left with an unexpected out-of-pocket expense. The Bill removes this anomaly</para><para>The proposal is in line with the HIC's electronic commerce strategic direction and the Commonwealth Government's On-Line strategy, and will include stringent confidentiality and privacy requirements. The new arrangements will facilitate the checking of a patients Medicare and Health Fund Benefits eligibility prior to service provision and consequently will greatly assist and enhance the provision of informed financial consent from the consumer to providers of medical services.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Specialist Recognition</inline></para><para>This Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) to restore specialist recognition status, for the purpose of ensuring access to Medicare benefits at the specialist rebate level, correcting an unintended consequence of earlier legislation. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Overseas Doctors</inline></para><para>An unintended consequence of the Health Legislation Amendment (Medical Practitioners' Qualifications and Other Measures) Act 2001 allowed all overseas trained doctors to receive Medicare benefits for assistance at operations in areas that are not districts of workforce shortage.</para><para>This proposed amendment to section 19AB of the Act clarifies the intent of Government policy regarding maldistribution in the Australian medical workforce and the resulting difficulties experienced by some rural communities in accessing general practitioner services. Overseas trained doctors who are undertaking a bona fide training program and have an occupational trainee visa will continue to be able to claim Medicare benefits when they assist at operations as part of their training program. This will allow the Government to continue to facilitate the exchange of medical knowledge between Australia and other countries.

The Acts were made to ensure that successful claimants for compensation cannot double dip by obtaining dual payments for their medical expenses. When plaintiffs go to court to recover damages for personal injuries, the legislation requires that they repay to the Commonwealth the cost of any Medicare and residential care benefits received because of the injury for which they have also been compensated as part of the compensation settlement or payment.  </para><para>The proposed amendments arose from a ruling by the Federal Court exempting payments for compensation that are not fixed or ascertainable at the time of a judgement or settlement. The Bill will eliminate any doubt as to the amount of compensation being fixed, either at the time of the judgement or settlement or at a later time period where it is ascertainable or fixed after the judgement or settlement. The bill has no retrospective effect and does not effect judgements or settlements that are made before the commencement of these amendments.</para><para>This Bill ensures that the payment of moneys rightfully owed to the Commonwealth are fully enforceable, and thereby end the ability to double dip by claiming Medicare and also retaining the compensation part of the settlement for the same medical or residential care expenses. </para><para>Secondly, the Bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973, in relation to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register.</para><para>The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register is a national database maintained by the Health Insurance Commission, which contains information on the immunisation status of children under the age of seven, in Australia. Using the Register, the Health Insurance Commission is able to report on immunisations given to children, and to assist health professionals by identifying areas of low immunisation coverage in the event of disease outbreak.</para><para>The amendments will expand the Register, so that it also includes previous foreign immunisation encounters of children where these are notified to the Health Insurance Commission by recognised immunisation providers or prescribed bodies. This expansion will mean that the Register contains a complete immunisation record for more children, and national immunisation coverage rates will be able to be reported more accurately. The change will also assist those parents claiming the Commonwealth's Child Care Benefit, where their children have been immunised overseas.</para><para>This expansion of the Register is supported by the National Immunisation Committee and the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register Management Committee.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FORMAL MOTIONS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>10334</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10334</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI have previously raised my concern about the number and breadth of notices of motion that are put forward and then sought not to be debated but to be put formally to the chamber.

I think Senator Harradine raises a good point. I have to say that I was particularly disturbed to have to vote on the motion in relation to Palestine, which the chamber just divided upon. I think the Labor Party's policy in the previous parliament, as I recall, of refusing to give formality for those foreign affairs type motions was an honourable attempt to try to send a message, particularly to the minor parties, that seeking to encapsulate in a one-line statement the range of important influences on foreign policy issues in particular is not a very diligent or appropriate way to send a message to the world about the Australian parliament's foreign policy positions. </para></talk.start><para>I certainly hope that the Greens will not go out and play cheap politics with this morning's motion in relation to Palestine, although I expect to be disappointed. I hope that the people around Australia and the world who genuinely hope for a sustainable peace in that area of the Middle East will not see thisâand the Senate voted it down todayâas anything more than a stunt from a party that is renowned for pulling stunts.</para><para>I think Senator Harradine is making the same point: there are complicated issues that just are not suitable for debate in a straight up and down one-line motion, which is the sort of thing you see at a party conference or at the local branch. We are a parliament of a nation and we have a responsibility to be a little more diligent about how we deal with issues. That is the trouble with the formality process: if you do refuse formality, as I am sure Senator Harradine will be tempted to do, then you have a suspension of the standing orders, and quite often that debate does not occur at a time in the weekly sittings when you want to spend the entire morning debating a suspension of standing orders. That too is a waste of time. There must be a better way. The best way is to use commonsense when it comes to how you progress these sorts of policy issues. Seeking to progress them through the formal motion process is clearly not a desirable way, and the government has sympathy for that view.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>10335</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI concur with the comments of both Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Harradine in relation to formality. The Labor Party tooâeven though we have substantially more resources than Senator Harradine hasâhas found itself in a very difficult situation with respect to the Palestine motion. A lot of that is because the business end of the Senate, for want of a better term, is first up on a Thursday. The Labor Party's platform position reflects support for the establishment of an independent state of Palestine. Had we had more time, we would have been able to negotiate with Senator Brownâand I am not blaming Senator Brown for this, by the wayâa position that accurately reflected our public platform position. I think that is a situation that has come about, given that we have considerably more resources than Senator Harradine and the other senators on the cross-benches have, because of the business end being on a Thursday morning.</para></talk.start><para>So I want to make it clear that the Labor Party's platform position on this issue is there for all to see.

I commend to the Senateâand I do not often do thisâa very short speech that I made on 27 May 1998. It was a speech about how the Senate ought to deal with foreign policy motions in this place and about what the concerns are. I accept that the concerns are broaderâthey are not only with foreign policy motionsâand I am personally not aware of the content of the motion Senator Harradine has drawn attention to. But we do have to understand that the whole process of giving a notice of motion, seeking formality for that motion and having such a motion put to the Senate is a very blunt instrument.</para></talk.start><para>It leaves the Senate with a double hurdle. Firstly, a decision has to be made to grant formality for such a motion and, as has been pointed out by Senator Ian Campbell, there are consequences if formality is not granted. Secondly, the Senate has an opportunity to vote in favour of or against such a motion. That is why it is such a blunt instrument: there is no capacity to amend or debate. The word `debate' has been used a lot here. This is not a mechanism for a debate; it is a mechanism to have a vote. I am sure all senators accept that. They are some of the weaknesses in this system. On the other side of the ledger, there are also strengths, with the capacity for the Senate to express a point of view on matters that are important to our responsibilities in this chamber and of concern in public life in this country.</para><para>In the last parliament, the opposition tried valiantly in relation to foreign policy motions, and it did not get broad support in the chamber. It is fair to say that many senators would not have agreed with the substance or the spirit of what the opposition was trying to do. We tried very hard to make the point that we would consistently not give formality to foreign policy motions and not accept that foreign policy motions should be decided in this chamber without debate. But for that to work it would have to be accepted more broadly and not just be a point of view adopted by the opposition. We took the view at that time that each and every foreign policy motion could be declared not formal. Then, if a suspension of standing orders were moved, the importance and significance of foreign policy motions could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but it is a blunt instrument.</para><para>Sometimes these things can work, however. Yesterday, when there was a range of views in this chamber amongst non-government senators about war in Iraq, we were able to negotiate a form of words acceptable to a broad range of senators, not just opposition and Greens senators but also Democrats and other Independent senators. It is possible to achieve, but it requires effort, because so often voting on these things can be misunderstood.</para><para>We tried very hard to have a new procedure in this place. I thought our approach was correct. But you have to be consistent, and you cannot treat these things opportunistically. The truth of the matter is that it did not work, because, even though we laid down a practice that we thought would enhance the standard of debate and consideration on these matters, it was misunderstood and, at times, misrepresented. I am not going to place the political party that I belong to in that position, even though I know that dealing with these formal notices of motion by voting yes or no, in favour or against, is such a blunt instrument.</para><para>On a motion such as the one Senator Mackay addressed about a Palestinian state, all political parties have longstanding and carefully-considered positions. Obviously, they are not in agreement. There are different views around this chamber. I accept Senator Brown's point that it would be useful to be able to put those views in a proper and fulsome debate; it would be useful to have. The trouble is that a one-line motion places us all in a terribly difficult position. All senators in this chamber are placed in a difficult position if that is the way debate is to progress on these sorts of matters. </para><para>There is a crucial issue which all senators need to take into account. Once these motions are passed, the President of the Senate is required to inform governments of other countries to which they are directed about their content. There is not an understanding of the distinction between a decision of executive government and a decision of one chamber of the Australian parliament. That has always been a problem, and it remains a significant problem. We feel that, because of that important distinction, we should have a different way of approaching this matter. I would be perfectly happy if the Manager of Government Business, Senator Harradine, Senator Brown, the Australian Democrats and others wanted us to task the Senate Procedure Committee with having another look at this matter, because the opposition have tried very hard to ensure that we do not find ourselves in the sort of situation that occurred this morning. We do not want to see misunderstanding, and we certainly do not want to see any misrepresentation about these matters.</para><para>We worked very hard in the last parliament to try and overcome this, and I admit failure. It just was not possible because of the nature of motions that were being put. If you adopt a position like thisâlet us say it is a motherhood motionâwhere does a political party stand if it says, `We do not grant formality to such a motion?' It is not easy, it is a difficult task, and I accept that there needs to be a mechanism for this chamber to express its view on a breadth and range of issues. I think the opposition have tried to take this matter very seriously for a long period. We have understood the difficulties from both the perspective of being in government and now, as we find ourselves, in opposition.</para><para>There are serious issues that need to be addressed. This is an area where we can improve the way the Senate works, and I think this morning's motion is an example where a full debateâwhich Senator Brown wants to have, and I accept that and agree with himâ would be much better than a one-line resolution. A capacity to amend a motion, be it from government, opposition or the cross-benches, should be, when you are determining a position, a right of senators and political parties in this chamber. That is not offered through this mechanism, through this process, so it does have these inherent weaknesses on one hand while also having great strength when there is an opportunity for the Senate to express a strong view, particularly when it is broadly held around the chamber.</para><para>I accept the complexity of the issue. I put on record the fact that the opposition have tried seriously to address this matter. We are happy to work with all senatorsâ government, minor party and Independent senatorsâto try and see if we can improve these procedures and processes so that there is better understanding, both in the chamber and, most particularly, outside the chamber, about the way the Senate works in this regard. I make that offer to all senators because it is an inherent weakness and we have never effectively grappled with it, though I do say the opposition have tried to do so.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âI look forward to getting messages from party leaders in the future.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10337</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâSenator Harradine directed some assertions towards me and I take the opportunity to respond. Senator Harradine made the point in relation to my notice of motion No. 433âwhich relates to a domestic issue, not an international one; it is not about foreign affairsâthat it ought to be dealt with in an area of broader debate. He goaded me and asked me why that was not being done, and said that we should be doing it through other opportunities in the Senate. I make the point that we do, and we have. I can recall at least three occasions when we have dealt with comprehensive debate on this issue, including either an urgency motion or an MPI about a year ago when Senator Harradine spoke. We smaller parties take every opportunity, without apology, to raise issues that are important to us and which we feel neither of the major parties do deal with or will deal with. Those opportunities are very limited. </para></talk.start><para>There was also an opportunity only recently when Senator Harradine was able to express his concern about the Marriage Amendment Bill and when the Australian Democrats moved an amendment to allow for same sex marriages. We had a full and comprehensive debate on that but, unless I am mistaken, Senator Harradine did not contribute to that debate or to the amendment from the Democrats. So the opportunities are there, but the opportunities for the smaller parties are very limited.</para><para>I would make this final point. I draw the Senate's attention to the ACT assembly which, on one day every week, deals only with private members' businessâone day a week. That is an extraordinary opportunity for non-government members to debate their issues, raise their concerns and deal with them. We have a situation in our parliament which is false, it is fake. It is structured to stifle, censor and prevent issues being raised by Independent senators and minor parties. It is a false hope and a fake aspiration. I would ask Senator Faulkner to consider this. If he is genuinely serious about opportunities to debate issues, sometimes contentious issues, in a more in-depth way than they are being debated currently, then we need systemic change and we need a structure in this place to allow significant time to deal with non-government business. Perhaps the starting point for that could be one day a fortnight to deal with non-government business.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10338</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interests Committee</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator DENMAN (Tasmania) (10.21 a.m.)âI present the annual report for 2002 of the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests.</para><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Publications Committee</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator COLBECK (Tasmania) (10.21 a.m.)âI present the sixth report of the Publications Committee.</para><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>10338</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>10338</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, Senator Tierney, I present additional information received by the committee relating to hearings on the additional estimates for 2002-03.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10338</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Document</title><page.no>10338</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>10338</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present a document presented to the committee on its inquiry into the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bill.

I have had very many people ask me in recent weeks and months how it could be that the Prime Minister could deploy 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel to Iraq without the permission and vote of the parliament. People in Australia have noted that the President of the United States was required to get a vote through both houses of the congress, which happened late last year, and that while the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, was not required to do so, he did so, and put the vote to the parliament in the UK. But that did not happen in Australia. In this country, the Prime Minister used the silence of the Constitution on the matter to take unto himself the authority to deploy troops to the theatre of warâor potential warâeven before the United Nations had made a determination on the matter.</para><para>This draws into very serious question the point of having a parliament at all as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. I have heard some correspondentsâsome opinion makers who should know betterâsay that the Prime Minister was elected to do such things. It needs to be pointed out that in this country the Prime Minister is not elected. Parliamentarians are elected, and within the party which wins the majority in the House of Representatives there is then a vote as to who will be the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is not mentioned in the Constitution and nor is the executive as such. But in this situation we have rule by the executiveâand that really means by the Prime Minister's officeâand not by the parliament. This is a very important matter. The Constitution says that the defence forces of this country can be used to defend the Commonwealth and/or one of the states if they need to be defended and, of course, we would all agree with that. It is silent on the matter of Australian Defence Force personnel being used for the invasion of another country which does not present an ostensible threat, immediate or direct, to us.</para><para>From that comes the question of the legality of what the Prime Minister has done on this occasion. Whilst there is a vigorous debate on this matter, there is no doubt that the preponderance of international legal opinion and domestic legal opinion is that it is unlawful for Australia to be involved in the war in Iraq. This is an illegal war. I refer to an article in Monday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> by a barrister, Chris Maxwell, and Professor Hilary Charlesworth, who is the Director of the Centre of International and Public Law at the Australian National University in Canberra. It begins with these words: </para><quote><para>The start of hostilities against Iraq must not be allowed to distract attention from the illegality of the war. This action, which is sought to be justified as enforcement of Iraq's international obligations, is itself a fundamental violation of international law. </para><para>To the question `Has the Security Council authorised this war?', there can only be one answer: of course not. The coalition of the willing refrained from seeking the Security Council's specific authorisation in the past few weeks precisely because they knew it would be refused. Their decision not to put a further resolution after 1441 was candidly explained to the world: a resolution authorising war would not have commanded even a majority of votes on the council.</para></quote><para>And later the authors say:</para><quote><para>As for the 1990 and 1991 resolutionsâ</para></quote><para>which have been referred to by the Prime Ministerâ</para><quote><para>the coalition is effectively saying: `We much prefer what the Security Council said about the first Gulf War and we'll pretend that it applies to unforeseen events 13 years later.' This is as ludicrous as if the US President had learnt that the necessary resolution authorising this war was not going to pass both houses of Congress, but had pressed ahead undaunted, calling on congressional resolutions endorsing the 1991 war.</para><para>So we must be more vigilant than ever, lest the members of the coalition be as careless with international law in their conduct of the war as they have shown themselves to be in launching it.</para></quote><para>I refer to an article in the current <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on Wednesday, yesterday, by George Monbiot called, `One rule for them.' It is referring to the controversy about the request of the United States to ensure the Geneva convention is used by the Iraqi authorities in dealing with prisoners of war. Mr Monbiot comments:</para><quote><para>Rumsfeldâ</para></quote><para>the Secretary of Defenseâ</para><quote><para>had better watch his back. For this enthusiastic convert to the cause of legal warfare is, as head of the US Defense Department, responsible for a series crimes sufficient, were he ever to be tried, to put him away for the rest of his natural life.</para><para>His prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, on Cuba, where 641 men are held, breaches no fewer than 15 articles of the third convention. The US Government broke the first of these (article 13) as soon as the prisoners arrived, by displaying them, just as the Iraqis have done, on television. In this case, however, they were not encouraged to address the cameras. They were kneeling on the ground, hands tied behind their backs, wearing blacked-out goggles and earmuffs. In breach of article 18, they had been stripped of their own clothes and deprived of their possessions. They were then interned in a penitentiary (against article 22), where they were denied proper mess facilities (26), canteens (28), religious premises (34), opportunities for physical exercise (38), access to the text of the convention (41), freedom to write to their families (70 and 71) and parcels of food and books (72).</para><para>They were not `released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities' (118), because, the US authorities say, their interrogation might, one day, reveal interesting information about al-Qaeda. Article 17 rules that captives are obliged to give only their name, rank, number and date of birth. No âcoercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whateverâ.</para></quote><para>Mr Monbiot goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The US Government claims these men are not subject to the Geneva Convention, as they are not `prisoners of war', but `unlawful combatants'. The same claim could be made, with rather more justice, by the Iraqis holding the US soldiers who illegally invaded their country.</para></quote><para>And so on. These are matters of huge importance to this nation. We are involved at the behest of Prime Minister Howard. There has been no reference to the people, no reference to a vote, no weight of reference to this parliament. The Prime Minister has usurped the process of this democracy to involve us in an illegal war and we need, as the Senate, to be able to review that process. We need not only to review the legalityâor indeed the illegalityâof the Prime Minister's actions but to put in place, if we can, measures which will restore the authority of this parliament and make it clear that this parliament represents the people, not the Prime Minister. There should be a mechanism in this parliament, as there is in the American parliament, to ensure that we do not deploy troops to hostilities overseas without the authority of the elected representatives following a proper debate about what that means for this nation and where this nation's interest lies and what the consequences of such action should be. </para><para>Finally, I point to the opinion of Mr Brian Walters SC from Melbourne, whose opinion is under the heading, `The decision of the Australian government to join in an attack on Iraq.' The gravity of the situation is in his opening remarks. He says:</para><quote><para>At the end of the Second World War, the victorious powers conducted war crimes trials at Nuremberg.

There may be legal consequences, and they may be of great seriousness for the individuals involved, including very lengthy terms of imprisonment (up to 30 years).</para></quote><para>Further on, Mr Walters says:</para><quote><para>The legal advice released by the Australian government is dated mid March 03â</para></quote><para>that is the advice Mr Howard used to defend his positionâ</para><quote><para>over two months after Australian forces left for the Gulf. </para></quote><para>Note this:</para><quote><para>The advice is not from the Solicitor-General, the law officer who normally provides independent advice to the government.</para></quote><para>Concluding his opinion, Mr Walters has this to say:</para><quote><para>After the Second World War, criticism was made of the Nuremberg trials that they constituted `victor's justice'. However, that situation has now been changed. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over war crimes and crimes against humanity and genocide. Moreover, on 27 June 2002, the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the <inline font-style="italic">International Criminal Court Act 2002 </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendment) Act 2002 </inline>in order to facilitate the implementation of that court. These statutes incorporate war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide into Australian domestic law.</para><para>The crime of aggression is recognised under the Rome Statute which establishes the International Criminal Court. The jurisdiction for this crime will not vest until 1 July 2009, in order to permit further clarification of the definition of the crime and the conditions under which the jurisdiction may be exercised. This probably amounts to a mere procedural delay, (although the point remains arguable). In other words, an act of aggression committed now may be prosecuted in the ICC once the jurisdiction vests. The present leaders of the Australian government accordingly run the risk of prosecution for the crime of aggression at a future timeâwhatever the outcome of the war.</para><para>Further, if reports that the attacking forces propose to adopt `shock and awe' tactics to coerce the civilian population to surrender are true, then those responsible for such tactics would commit war crimes and crimes against humanity whatever the legal justification for the war. Such crimes may be prosecuted forthwith. Such tactics, which are directed to the civilian population, are plainly proscribed and criminal. Proof of such charges will depend on the evidence available. However, public statements already made suggest an intention to commit war crimes as part of the prosecution of this attack on Iraq.</para><para>For sixty years the world has worked to develop a system of international law which involves collective decision-making before going to war. The system is not perfect, but is a great improvement on all that has gone before. Before the first US bombs have dropped on Iraq, Turkey is in the process of moving into the Kurdish section of Iraq. Turkey said, echoing the words of the US, that it could not leave the question of its self-defence to the UN.</para><para>If the US, with the help of the UK and Australia, discards the international rule book, this is precisely the kind of international pattern they can expect to develop.</para></quote><para>Mr Walters concludes:</para><quote><para>The action of the Australian government in joining in this illegal war is a grave act which will have serious and irretrievable consequences. In my opinion, it constitutes the commission of a crime.</para></quote><para>These are serious and grave matters of international law. If we in Western democracies do not uphold international law, who will? There is an argument that international law needs to move on and be developed; that then is our responsibility. But to break international lawâand arguably the most important law for the keeping of international order, the United Nations Charter itselfâ should not be countenanced. Yet, on the face of it, that is what has happened under the authority not of this parliament but of this Prime Minister. </para><para>The question of whether Australia's involvement is legal or illegal needs investigation. It is hugely important. It is going to be debated around the world not just for years but for decades to come. There are possibly very serious ramifications. It is not good enough to say, `The United States is a hyperpower, therefore it can do what it wants. Therefore, might is right.' With the United States and Great Britain, we constitute some six per cent of the world's population. The other 94 per cent is going to levy great influence on what happens as a result of this war, which, according to the preponderance of news reports, through sheer firepower, will end the regime in Iraq. But the legality of that process is under serious question.</para><para>The Senate committee system has evolved to ensure the interests of this nation are served by getting the best advice possible from the community and from the greatest expertise possible on matters of importance to this nation. What could be more important than whether or not we are legally involved in this war in Iraq and whether or not what is happening in Iraq is legal. The question is: ought a Prime Minister of this country, in an office which is not elected, be able to usurp the role of this parliament in determining the great issues of the day? Are we not drifting away from democracy towards dictatorship itself when the executive becomes the arbiter of whether and under what circumstances this country goes to war and parliament is left with nothing to do but to talk about it?</para><para>The Senate has a very heavy responsibility here. This move by the Greens to refer this matter to the proper and relevant committee is enormously important. We do not know how long this war will proceed. What we do know is that the ramifications of it are going to echo for many years to come. It is proper, it is impelling and it is absolutely important that we determine the legalities of this matter as soon as possible and that we also look at re-empowering the parliament, reasserting the constitutional implication that this parliament should make these decisions.</para><para>I for one am not prepared to allow that to be stolen through the night, stolen through this moment in time by Prime Minister Howard. This is a democracy. The Senate should uphold above all the democratic powers and rights of this parliament and not leave them for the executive to steal from this parliament. Whatever senators may think, these are matters of enormous importance both to the moment and to the values that we judge this parliament as having in a democracy. They are crucial, they are critical, and there must be a reassessment. The Senate is the right place to do it. I commend this motion and hope it will draw support from the government and the opposition, as well as the other parties and the Independents in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>10343</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will speak in favour of the motion moved by Senator Brown. I will not repeat all the arguments that have just been made, but certainly the Democrats concur with the broad thrust of the comments that Senator Brown made in support of the motion. The one thing I would suggest with this motion, which has been amended from when it was first movedâand significantly enhanced, in my viewâis that it could have a longer reporting date. The matters that it seeks to consider are very significant and really do need the sort of extensive consideration that a longer inquiry would provide.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to remind ourselves how critical the issue of international law is. Quite frankly, it is getting to a stage in the global community where the level and nature and consistency of breaches, in varying degrees of severity, by a large number of nations make one wonder whether or not all the conventions, treaties and approaches that have been developed over so many years are starting to fade into irrelevance due to the widespread ignoring of them whenever it is convenient for many governments in many cases. </para><para>There are implications for international law of the action that has been taken by the government, whether or not it is illegal. If it is illegalâand the Democrats believe it isâ it has major implications; if it is legal, I think that has major implications, because it is a dramatic broadening of the interpretation of the relevant international law, which in my view significantly weakens the intent and aim of it. It is an important issue that should be explored. It is not just a matter of getting competing lawyers coming in with opinions as to whether it is legal or illegal. It is a matter of looking at what the flow-on consequences are in either respect. That issue has not been given any real attention to date.</para><para>The other aspect is to do with the parliament approving deployment of troops. The Democrats have long argued that it should be the parliament that approves deployment of troops in overseas conflicts. Obviously, if there is an attack on Australia, there needs to be the ability of the government of the day to deploy defence personnel immediately.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âYou are arguing for pre-emption there.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âIf we are attacked, we probably should allow our defence forces to respond reasonably quickly! You can have provisions for emergencies and all those sorts of things, but the general principle is that the deployment and involvement of Australian troops in a conflict should, except in very extenuating circumstances, be a decision made by the entire parliament rather than a small number of people in a cabinet room in secret, given that that sort of decision is so significant. That is a view that the Democrats have had for many years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Indeed, I am sure all senators would know, given how closely they follow the proceedings in this place, that the Democrats introduced legislation this morning again to amend the Defence Actâlegislation that we believe would address the issue which is, in part, being proposed through reference to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. It was in 1981, through former Democrat senator Colin Mason, that the Democrats first moved amendments to defence legislation in the Senate to enable this outcome to occur. The first time the Democrats introduced private member legislation to amend the Defence Act to this end was in 1985. It was reintroduced in, I think, 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996âobviously each time without success in terms of getting support from other parties in the Senate. It is an issue the Democrats have held a longstanding view about. Obviously the current situation makes it very germane to reconsider whether or not this should be the approach taken in deployment of troopsâthat parliamentary approval should be a requirement.</para><para>I think many people, certainly in the Australian community, believe that that is appropriate and necessary. I suggest it is in the interest of our defence forces as well. It is difficultâand it needs to be acknowledged in the current conflictâfor defence personnel to go into combat knowing that a large proportion, in this case a majority, of the Australian community believe that they should not be doing this. It has been pleasing in this current conflict that there have been universal statementsâcertainly from the parliamentary side of thingsâfrom all positions and viewpoints that we should support our troops regardless of whether or not we agree with the Prime Minister's decision. That is very important and very welcome from the Democrats' point of view. But it needs to be acknowledged that it does make it more difficult for troops to go into conflict knowing that the majority of their nation's people believe that they should not be there. I do not think that should be ignored. Again, that is a justification for requiring parliamentary approval, so at least they know that they have a majority of the parliament supporting the decision to deploy them. In the case of the current conflict in Iraq, that is not the reality. This Senate has clearly said that we did not support the Prime Minister's decision to deploy and that we believed that the troops should be withdrawn and returned home.</para><para>If those Democrat amendments or the legislation that we have put up over a period of 20 years had been agreed to at any time in that period, Australia would not currently be fighting in the war in Iraq. In a sense, it is a missed opportunity that the parliament has not done that in the last 20 years. It makes it more appropriate and more relevant than ever that we consider this matter through a committee inquiry to try to buildâfrom the Democrats' point of viewâstronger support for going down that path, or at least put forward and develop a stronger rationale for why it is not appropriate, for those who have an alternative view. I might be verballing him, but I am fairly sure that I have seen former Labor shadow foreign affairs spokesperson Laurie Brereton suggest that perhaps we need parliamentary approval of troop deployment. I am sure he will very quickly let me know if I am misquoting him, but that is the impression I have from comments I have read in the last week or two. The current situation obviously means that parliamentary approval for troop deployment needs to be revisited and given closer attention because it is no longer academic; it is a very real and current issue. </para><para>I suspect that all of us hereâcertainly those in parties opposed to the deployment of troopsâhave been getting lots of requests for the Senate to do anything to stop this, to do anything to force the government to go to an election. Many people have suggested that the Senate should block supply or do other fairly extreme things, such as refuse to pass any legislation and generally hold up all business. I can understand why people feel that way. The level of opposition to and anxiety about what the government has done leads people to look for any option to stop the deployment of troops, but they are options that are not appropriate to the current situation. The appropriate approach would be to empower the parliament in the first place to prevent the deployment of troops, rather than to find every other mechanism possible for the parliament to express its strong disagreement and displeasure with what the government is doing. It is important to emphasise that, from the point of view of the Democrats, blocking supply would be an incredibly counterproductive measure.</para><para>As most senators would know, the Democrats were, in part, formed by concern about the activities of 1975. From our very inception we have said that, while we need a Senate where there is strong oversight and checking of what the government is doingâ and a dynamic chamber that initiates policiesâwe would not try to bring the whole system of government to a halt. Blocking supply does not automatically generate an election; it is still only in the hands of the Prime Minister to do that. Blocking supply would mean that pensioners would not get paid and all those areas of expenditure that assist people in so many ways would be prevented. It would also mean, as we all know, a massive negative impact on our entire economy and flow-on negative impacts to the whole community. While a very small number of Australians may think that is a price worth paying, the Democrats certainly do not. We think it is counterproductive in many ways. We understand the frustration that leads people to make these callsâthat is, because there is no direct power for the parliament to stop inappropriate deployment of troops. The simpler and much easier solution would be for that power to be given.</para><para>The Democrats' position on this issue is quite clear. We have a history over more than 20 years in relation to amending this particular aspect of the Defence Act. We believe this issue should be put forward to a committee to enable all the different arguments to be considered in a more open way and to try to advance the debate around this. We recognise the frustration in the Australian community when a Prime Minister can go off to a cabinet meeting behind closed doors and commit a serious act which has major ramifications. Whatever your view of the rightness or wrongness of this decision, there is no doubt that it has major ramifications. The parliament, the body directly elected by the people, had no say in the decision to deploy troops. This issue needs to be explored in more detail. That is why a Senate committee examination of it is appropriate and that is why the Democrats support this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10345</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Labor opposition, I indicate that we will be opposing the motion on a number of grounds: one that goes to process and some that go partially to substance. This motion seeks to canvass a range of issues which I think will be serious matters of debate in the Australian community over the next couple of years. The parliament will debate these issues in a range of forms, such as important public policy debatesâthe Democrats have indicated that they have introduced a bill this morning. So there are going to be a number of mechanisms for this debate. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, on the issue of processâand I will be brief because I know that, today being the last day of sitting, there is a huge legislative load to get throughâwe think there needs to be a better process for determining what work the committees ought to take up. We have always held the view that there should be proper consultation about the reference of inquiries to committees, some understanding of their workload priorities and also some talk around the chamber about how we can best progress issues of concern. That has not really occurred on this occasion. I was asked for a decision last night on behalf of the Labor Party. I consulted quickly with my colleagues and we have decided not to support this particular reference in this form. However, I am happy to work with other senators on what sort of committee inquiry may be appropriate and may assist the public debate with some of these issues. Concerning the legality or otherwise of the coalition military action in Iraq, there is very serious doubt about the legality of acting outside of the UN Charter. That is certainly the view that Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has put. I know that is supported by a range of very highly regarded international law experts and is certainly the legal advice that the opposition received. There will, of course, be a huge debate about that. With all due respect to the lawyers in the Senate, you pay your money and you get the opinion you pay for. No doubt there will be a range of opinions on that question.</para><para>The Labor Party have consistently argued that any action should be taken under the auspices of the UN Security Council and we remain committed to that. We are most concerned that the action taken in Iraq undermines international law and the role of the UN and establishes a creed which says `might is right', where anyone who decides that they want to launch a pre-emptive strike because of what they say is well-placed fear may do so. The government has been unable to answer questions on what that means for the Pakistan-India conflict or the tensions between North and South Korea. I think those sorts of examples highlight the dilemma that the government and the coalition forces have got us into by their rejection of the UN processes. Now we have no guidance as to what might be seen as legitimate military action; we only have the assertion that a well-placed fear is sufficient for making a pre-emptive strike. I do not think that is a basis for action in international law and I do not think it is a basis for ensuring the peace and security of the world. But, clearly, that is an issue we are going to debate.</para><para>It may well be that it is appropriate for a committee to look at some of those issues at some stage, but I think we will find that any report will be a combination of the various legal opinions that are around. I am not sure how that will actually advance the debate, but that is certainly going to occur. I also think, to be honest, that the focus at the moment is very much on humanitarian concerns as an outcome of the conflict in Iraq. Some of these issues will play out around the world over the coming months as we try and deal with those consequences. I am not sure that there is the urgency suggested by this reference for a report by 15 May or that those issues are going to be solved. The post-Iraq world order is going to be a huge issue for this parliament and everyone else to grapple with. I am not sure whether asking a committee to sort it out by 15 May is a reasonable or rational task. But, as I said, I have some sympathy for the need for us as a parliament to grapple with those issues.</para><para>In terms of the other references, which go to the question of parliamentary approval for military action by Australian forces, the Labor Party have taken the view, and continue to take the view, that that is a decision for the elected government. It is not a question for decision by the parliament. It is unclear how one would actually see the parliament resolving that issue. We certainly encouraged a proper debate and we encouraged the Prime Minister to allow the parliament to debate the issues. But we accept that, under our constitutional arrangements, the elected government of the day has the responsibility for this task. I am not convinced of the merit of changing that, because I do not quite understand how it would work. The classic example was that the motion on the attitude to war that was carried by the Senate was very different from the one that was carried by the House of Representatives. It is not clear how that conflict or disagreement would be resolved. It is not clear how one would form `a view of the parliament'. </para><para>As the motion indicates, huge constitutional issues would have to be resolved if there were to be a change. Labor is not indicating support for any change, but there are huge constitutional issues that would require the support of the Australian people. None of this is going to happen quickly, even if the advocates of it are successful in arguing for those changes. I think it is an issue that people may want to pursue, but the Labor Party remains committed to the idea that the commitment of military forces is a government decision, for some of the reasons that Senator Bartlett outlinedâthere is a need for someone to be able to act rather than await parliamentary approval, and clarity is needed about where the authority lies.</para><para>I have indicated that the opposition will be opposing the motion, but we remain open to approaches about what references the Legal and Constitutional Committee might take up on some of the issues arising from the conflict. As I said, I think some of this is a bit too early. I know that it is useful as a vehicle for people to express their opposition to the war, and I appreciate that. But the Labor Party remains unconvinced about supporting this motion at the moment. Certainly, during the break, if the Greens or Democrats want to discuss with us what useful work the committee might do on any of the legal issues relating to the commitment of troops, we would be happy to look at that. But, as I said, we have a different opinion about parliamentary approval. We support the fact that decisions to take military action are for the elected government. We are not convinced of the argument that that ought to be changed, although we do support the role of the parliament in debating those issues and giving voice to the quite divergent views in the Australian community on these important issues. I think that the parliamentary debates, while delayed, were useful in giving voice to those other opinions. I indicate formally that the Labor Party will be voting against the motion to refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10347</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will be very brief. It is interesting to have had that debate, by leave, about the discussion of foreign policy motions. If you think back over this fortnight of sittings, we have, quite appropriately, spent an enormous amount of time discussing foreign policy issues. We will not be supporting the reference of this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Senator Evans has made some points that I would agree with, even though we disagree on some of the policy issues.</para></talk.start><para>I would just make one point, however, because I think it should be made. I do not want to debate the detail of the issues that Senator Brown is seeking to refer, but I do think the government should restate, at the very least, the fact that we have received formal advice that the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq is absolutely unequivocal. This advice is consistent with the advice provided to the United States, the United Kingdom and the Dutch and Danish governments as well as with views expressed by the prime ministers of Italy and Japan. The authority derives from Security Council resolutions Nos 678, 687 and 1441, all of which were passed under the relevant charter of the United Nationsâspecifically, I refer to chapter 7âand the government is strongly advised in those terms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>10347</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat a remarkable thing for the government and the opposition to get together to block this motion to simply refer to a Senate committeeâand the appropriate oneâthese grave questions of the legality of Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq and the right of the executive to usurp this parliament's power in determining when the defence forces of this country will or will not be deployed.

Let's have the people, the legal experts and the constitutional experts brought in and let's at least see if, in the future, the people want to have a say in this democracy in whether their defence forces go to war.' And the Labor Party joins the government and says, `No, leave it to Prime Minister Howard.' It is an insult to this parliament, it is an insult to democracy and it is an insult to the Australian people that the big parties think the executive, which is accepting or usurping a silence in the Constitution, should take to itself this power. There is no such written power in the Constitution, and both the opposition and the government know that. Here we say, `Let's have a look at this. Let's fix this up in this democracy. Let's at least get to the American basis where both houses of congress are required to give their assent before troops are deployed.' And the opposition joins the government and says, `No, leave it to Mr Howard.' That is not good enough. </para></talk.start><para>The great question of the legality of this war arisesâand it is Mr Crean, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, who has said that this war is illegalâand the opposition say, `But let's not look at it through the Senate committee system.' What is their position? Do they believe it is illegal or don't they? Do they want to have that debated and opened up to public debate? Is that not importantâwhether we are involved in a war legally or illegally? That is one of the most momentous questions this country could ever face, yet the opposition join the government and say, `Let's not get together the best advice in the country and determine this matter.' What a failure by both the opposition and the government to face up to the responsibilities of defending democracy, defending the lawânot least international lawâand defending the United Nations, which can be the only arbiter of international rule of law.

If that is going to be the case, you might as well abolish the committee system. What an extraordinary derogation of the obligation of an opposition to ensure that the law is upheld and democracy is upheld. What a failure! And what a failure by the government to undertake its responsibility to uphold this democracy of Australia and the rule of international law.

I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee embarked upon its inquiry into defence materiel matters in the light of a long history of failed or troubled acquisition projects and at a time of significant structural reform within defence that included the creation of the Defence Materiel Organisation.</para><para>The committee's approach to its inquiry into the acquisition and management of materiel was influenced by several considerations: the expenditure on defence materiel was a major component of the defence budget, and project delay or failure had already led to considerable waste of public money; the DMO was barely 18 months into its reform program when the inquiry commenced; and the Australian National Audit Office had, in recent years, undertaken several audits related to defence acquisition and had foreshadowed an investigation of DMO's management of major projects to commence in late 2003.</para><para>As a consequence, the committee decided to take a snapshot of the progress of the DMO's reform agenda and assess that progress against both the spirit and the implementation of the schedule of reforms. The committee also decided that it would try to determine a series of benchmarks against which future progress could be measured. These benchmarks would provide the pegs upon which the committee could hang its ongoing scrutiny of the DMO's performance.</para><para>In the event, these benchmarks emerged out of the evidence provided by DMO officials at public hearings and from the various manuals and guides that document the procedures for the development and procurement of a weapons system and its logistical support. The committee specifies, at various points throughout this report, the particular events and time frames that it will be monitoring to ensure that the DMO actually achieves the goals that its officials have declared to the committee. The committee will also be scrutinising closely DMO's compliance with its own documented procedures, especially for managing the capability systems life cycle.</para><para>I now refer to the findings. The committee is satisfied that the reform agenda set out in the 1998 `Team Australia' defence and industry strategic policy statement, the 2000 defence white paper, constitutes an appropriate and workable mechanism for overcoming a legacy of failed or delayed major projects and for achieving capability for the Australian Defence Force. The committee is broadly confident that the organisational, structural and process reforms being implemented by the DMO are providing the disciplined basis necessary to deliver project outcomes on time and within budget. As I said, in order to decide whether that confidence is truly justified, the committee will monitor closely the operations of the DMO and the progress of acquisition projects that are currently under way or scheduled to commence between now and 2005.</para><para>The committee recognises that cultural change is fundamental to the translation of new policies and procedures into effective day-to-day project management and to the nurturing of mutually rewarding partnerships within industry. The blue skies of optimism remain somewhat clouded by a lack of trust and a degree of cynicism on the part of both Defence and industry. This will continue to impede progress unless issues of cultural change are tackled head on. There is a serious obligation upon the leadership of both Defence and industry to attend closely to the ways in which their people engage with each other, and to the building of shared values, goals and expectations.</para><para>The committee remains concerned that some of the people reforms being sought by the DMO are proving difficult to implement. These include overcoming skill shortages in project management, contracting and software engineering; the difficulty of arranging industry exchanges and experience for DMO personnel; and ensuring appropriate levels of accountability, judgment and expertise at the middle management level. The retention of highly skilled specialists in a remuneration environment which lacks congruence with the corresponding private employment market will remain a vexing issue.</para><para>The dispersed system program offices seem to be proving effective in achieving efficiencies and better communications between the DMO and its customers. There is also an improvement in the stability of key personnel, thereby partially addressing one of industry's frequent complaints about staff turnover in Defence. Some questions remain in the committee's mind about the location of some of the SPOs in terms of convenient interfaces between relevant industry partners. Broadly speaking, however, the establishment of the SPOs and the increased personal accountability of SPO directors for the projects managed by their office have already started producing productivity and morale dividends. The committee will continue to monitor the success of the SPO reforms.</para><para>I am conscious that other members of the committee may wish to address this report. I now seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in order to provide that opportunity.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>Â·	We heard some strong representations to the effect that a corporatised DMO would enhance its capacity to work with Australia's defence industries. But the Committee finds that such a proposal is not in the best interests of key relationships between the DMO, the three Services and other relevant sections of the Defence organisation. In the Committee's view, Australia's strategic capability interests can be met, and Australian industry properly integrated into these, as long as the present reform agenda is diligently implemented.</para><para>Â·	The Committee was impressed with the intellectual and technological capacity of many of the Defence industry's Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). It is important that SMEs have the opportunity to participate in all acquisition and logistics projects. For major projects, such participation rests largely in the hands of the prime contractors. The Committee exhorts Tier 1 companies to engage Australian SMEs wherever possible consistent with their capacity and competitiveness. The Committee remains concerned that the research and development activity of Australian SMEs remains largely under-developed.</para><para>Â·	The Committee regards the `scorecard' approach to assessing relationships between the DMO and industry as an effective feedback mechanism. The system has not yet reached anywhere near its full potential, but the Committee is confident that it will enhance the transparency of projects at the boardroom level in companies, and will promote frank and mature dialogue between project partners concerning problems which may arise. </para><para>Â·	The Committee was concerned by the intensity of criticism of the DMO voiced by some industry witnessesâand also occasionally from within Defence itselfâand the frequent reluctance of industry to place its views on the public record. In part, the criticism went to the gaps between the rhetoric and the reality associated with the reform agenda. It also went to the manner in which the DMO dealt with criticism and complaints levelled at it. While the Committee makes no findings in respect of specific complaints or criticisms brought to its attention, it is important that the DMO establishes a comprehensive, consistent and transparent mechanism for handling complaintsâand one which does not unduly interfere with the progress of tenders. The Committee regards a case management approach as the most likely to produce satisfactory outcomes all round.</para><para>Â·	The Committee considers the question of Unsolicited Proposals from industry to be one requiring particular attention from Defence. There appears to be a gap between policy and practice that is denying Defence the benefit of the innovation and ferment that is characteristic of many Australian firms operating at the `knowledge edge'. To sustain that ferment and innovation, companies require early feedback on proposals that they submit to Defence. Time is not only money, but also affects competitive advantage. The Committee believes that the efficient handling of Unsolicited Proposals would not only deliver a significant boost to ADF capability, but would encourage firms to even greater heights of innovation, and would assist these firms to consolidate their place in the global defence supply chain.</para><para>Â·	The Committee is satisfied that the DMO has made substantial efforts to enhance project management and to develop a sound project reporting system. The Committee remains concerned that while the internal reporting of projects, including to cabinet level, may have been enhanced, projects still remain largely invisible to the parliament and the public. Significant improvements are required in both the quantity and quality of information made publicly available. And so one of our major recommendations is that the Auditor General produce an annual report to the parliament on the status of major Defence projects. We've suggested a model for this report that has been operating extremely well in the UK.</para><para>Â·	The Committee is encouraged by DMO's progress in making tender processes more efficientâin particular through the use of contract templates. Some work still needs to be done to ensure that all DMO staff incorporate the revised practices and values into their negotiating behaviour. As well, the Committee sees room for greater transparency in the contract process, including the publication of as much detail as possible about winning bids.</para><para>Â·	Systematic test and evaluation is an area that requires greater attention and resources in order to provide the level and sophistication of feedback necessary to ensure the integrity, functionality and safety of the materiel entering into service. The Committee notes the review of test and evaluation policy being undertaken by Defence, and will be looking for an outcome that embeds test and evaluation firmly into all phases of the capability development cycle, while ensuring that T&amp;E is carried out with the requisite independence and rigour. </para><para>Â·	The Committee has made a number of recommendations dealing with the things I've just mentioned.. The Committee will persist with a high degree of scrutiny of the DMO's operations and of the acquisition projects for which DMO is responsible. Some recommendations are geared explicitly to the direct enhancement of the Committee's capacity to carry out such a task. </para><para>Â·	The forthcoming audit of major projects by the ANAO will also assist the Committee in this work. The Committee will seek a formal reference from the Senate to examine and report upon the effectiveness of the DMO over the period to the end of 2005. In the meantime, the Committee may meet with relevant parties to explore particular aspects of the matters addressed in this Report. Should this activity produce material that the Committee regards as relevant to Defence acquisition reform, the Committee will table a supplementary report to that effect.</para><para>The Committee is grateful for the cooperation of Defence officials and senior members of the Defence Materiel Organisation in providing a range of important background documents for the Committee's examination, and in assisting the Committee to undertake visits and inspections of Defence and industry facilities in most states of Australia. The Committee also thanks the many people from industry who gave freely of their time and knowledge to help the Committee gain insights into the contribution of some remarkable companies to the defence capability of Australia. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âI thank the Senate.

This was my first committee as a new senator. I will not put words into Senator Marshall's mouth, but for me it was like jumping in at the very deep end.</para></talk.start><para>The Defence Materiel Organisation is an agency of some 8,500 people administering approximately $25 billion of defence acquisition capability platforms every year. The committee worked very hard and had approximately a dozen public hearing days, with several other days of informal interviews and inspections of defence facilities and interviews of SPOs at various places around our country. Indeed, it is a litmus test and template for ongoing scrutiny by the parliament of what is a very important, complex and substantial asset provider in terms of defence capability. The job of the DMO is to supply, maintain and manage ships, planes, personnel, scientific hardware, software for submarines for JORNâthe Jindalee Operational Radar Networkâand other capability platforms. It is not a small task; it is enormously complex and one which engages Australian industry.</para><para>We visited a number of software manufacturers and program producers throughout Australia, particularly in Western Australia. We went to Rosebank Engineering in Victoria. It was a most enlightening and encouraging experience to see the innovation and energy disclosed by a small engineering firm in maintaining our F111s. We visited a number of defence prime contractorsâTenix, ADI and Austalâand had significant interaction with a number of Australian defence industry suppliers.</para><para>In keeping these remarks brief may I say that the secretariat, as with all secretariats I have experienced in my brief time as a senator, worked with energy and diligence to produce a very satisfactory report. I commend it to senators.

I think this is an important reportâI should not sound surprised, because many reports are important. But this is a significant report that should not simply pass by with a few nodding comments. It is unfortunate, in my view, that many times very significant work is done by the Senate, often cooperatively across party lines, and it is not given the recognition or attention it deserves.</para></talk.start><para>I was a substitute member on this committee inquiry. Unfortunately, a few other things happened towards the end of last year that meant I did not have as much time as I would have liked to focus on it, but I have been following the progress of the inquiry and the content of the report. I join with other senators in commending it not just to the Senate but to the public, and to those who are interested in these important issues.</para><para>There is an old Army saying: `Your rifle was made by the company that put in the lowest bid.' It is not a reassuring thought when your life might depend on your rifle that those sorts of factors can be overdominant in decisions about the quality of equipment. I think this report in some ways suggests that things were made by the company that put in the highest bid and that sometimes they still did not make them very well in the past. Those sorts of issues do need to be acknowledged. There is a long history in Defence of failed and troubled projects, leading to considerable waste of public money.</para><para>The committee highlighted that improvements are under way and that we need to have a better examination of those sorts of things. The committee acknowledged the noticeable improvements and progress on major projects, as reported to government. But, from the Democrats point of view, there is still poor visibility for parliaments and for the public. We do need more accountability, such as through an annual report on acquisition projects by the Auditor-General. </para><para>There are issues to do with the broader operations of Defence acquisitions and Defence materiel that were examined in detail. I do hope the government takes those issues on board and examines them. In the interests of time, and because we are so cooperative towards the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I will pull my remarks short there. But in no way should that be viewed as a reflection on the importance of this report. For that reason, if there are no other speakers, I think this matter should stay on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.

Before Paul Anderson, John Prescott got $11 million from BHP; Tom Park, from Southcorp, received $10 million; John Fletcher, from Brambles, received $8 million; David Higgins, from Lend Lease, received $6.7 million; and Keith Lambert got $4.4 million from Southcorp, when he was barely there.</para><para>These are payments for failure.

The BHP-Billiton merger was a disgrace. It was an absolute scam: $5 billion of Australian shareholders' value was given to the international shareholders to pull off this little merger. That is what happened there, Senator Campbell, and you should know better. Australia's shareholders are down the tube by $5 billion because the company did not want to go into an accounting valuation required by the takeover provisions of the British stock market. So they deliberately undervalued the assets of the Australian shareholders and overvalued the assets of the Billiton shareholders, just to get away with not triggering the accounting provisions of the British accounting laws.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is what that was about: $5 billion was lost. So do not sit there, Senator Campbell, and try to defend that transaction. It was well known that 15 per cent of Australian institutions were interested in voting down this merger because it was bad for Australian shareholders; it was bad for these fund managers' members whose money they were in charge of. So do not sit there and try to be smug about that one, Senator Campbell. It was a shocker. </para><para>At the same time as Australian shareholders are having to pay out these excessive amounts of money to directors of companies that have failed and lost valueâor, in the case of BHP, given value awayâwe have this government voting down amendments.

Today is a second chance for the Prime Minister, John Howard, and Peter Costello to think about, reflect on and support these amendments. The provision in schedule 1 that we are talking about today spells out what information companies need to disclose about their executive remuneration policy. We want to see improvements to section 300A. We want to see a more robust provision. We want shareholders to be given the full picture.

If shareholders are going to be asked to vote for these big packages and payments, they have to see a graph in front of them at the annual general meeting that shows the performance pay of the executives and the share price. If one is going up and the other is coming down, shareholders are going to get a pretty clear picture. That is what this government has voted down once already.</para><para>We want to know what the methods used to assess the performance conditions are. Last night, the government, through Senator Campbell, said that our amendments would mean that disclosure would not occur for up to 12 months after the event. That is simply wrong. Senator Campbell has missed the point of Labor's amendments. He is actually trying to misrepresent Labor's position. The government have been dragged, screaming and kicking, to a position where they want to provide a peephole after the contract is signed. Labor wants to give shareholders a chance to vote on the policies beforehand. It wants to give shareholders a chance to say: `Here are the criteria you can negotiate with these executives on. No more sweetheart deals behind closed doors, no more golden handshakes or golden hellos; these are the criteria you have to negotiate before the contract is signed.'

Labor will support your amendment on real-time disclosure because we do not have a problem with that. But you should understand that that is not good enough. It is not good enough just to give the peephole. You have to give your shareholders power so they can deal with it. That is what is at stake here. Our amendments require the principles and policies behind executive remuneration to be disclosed, not just the nuts and bolts of the employment contract after it has been signed. Our amendments give shareholders the power to voice their concern on the company's executive remuneration policy. They get a say. Our amendments force companies to disclose their approach to issues such as whether options granted to executives are subject to performance. Labor's approach is a much broader strategy. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The approach by the Howard government is a simple matter of disclosing the contract upon signature. As I said, Labor supports that in principle. However, our view is that the conservative government's approach would be enhanced if it adopted our amendments, which are significantly broader. There is an opportunity for the government to pick up these amendments and say, `Yes, we want the real-time disclosure'âthe peephole after the factâ`but we also believe that shareholders should be entitled to have their say.' Our approaches are not incompatible, and I hope the government accepts the opportunity today to support the Labor amendments which it has previously rejected.</para><para>Proposed section 300A(1)(f) aims to ensure that persons carrying out responsibilities like those of a director or one of the top five named officers are subject to section 300A, even though they may not be called directors or executives.

We are concerned that directors and executives are deliberately subverting the law. This is the fault of the self-regulation model of the government. The government say, `We don't want to interfere in this area. We believe that the business community is honest and ethical.' Yet, at the first chance they get to avoid the laws, they will get a smart lawyer in to say, `Look, if you rename yourself as a consultant, or we say you are working for this company, which is a subsidiary, rather than this company over here, you don't have to disclose.' This is what happened in the Cuffe situation; it is a prime example. This amendment is a way to stop that. Our proposed section 300A(5) makes it clear beyond doubt that directors working for subsidiaries cannot avoid section 300A. How can the government not support this?</para><para>During the Senate committee hearing on this bill, Professor Baxt, an eminent lawyer from the AICD, discussed the possibility that directors working for subsidiaries of the main corporate entity would not be subject to the provisions of the bill. So not only in the area of remuneration but in this area the government is specifically trying to deal with what Professor Baxt, an eminent lawyer, said on behalf of the company directors union: `It is flawed; it won't work. You need to capture these people as well.' We accept that advice, and this amendment is designed to close that loophole.</para><para>The intention of schedule 1, item (3), is to catch the profits made on the exercise of options. I heard the government's assertion, through Senator Ian Campbell, that the Corporations Act provides that the court may make a range of orders in relation to the property that a person must repay to a company; but that is simply not good enough. The fact that the court can order that a person pay to the company an amount that represents the benefits that the person received as a result of the transaction leaves the issue open for deliberation. Labor are saying that we want to make it clear, and beyond doubt, that profits from the exercise of options are caught by the bill and will be paid back in the relevant circumstances. </para><para>To recap, what can happen is that options can be granted at, say, $1 each and then can be sold six months down the track at, say, $10, but only the $1 value of the option is absolutely caught in the government's proposal. We are saying that we want the $10 caught. We do not want to see a court given a choice on this matter. We want all of that value brought back to the shareholders in the circumstances of a collapsed company. We do not want Jodee Rich or Brad Keeling, having been granted options and having sold them six months later for 10 times their original value, able to get away with having to pay back only the face value at which they were granted, rather than the amount for which they sold them. That is what this amendment is about.</para><para>We have other amendments which seek to give the court further considerations when determining the reasonableness of a payment to a director. Senator Campbell has criticised Labor's amendments as increasing uncertainty. We do not agree. This is the stock standard response from lawyers when parliament seeks to provide guidance to the court. We are not saying that these are the only matters the court can consider, but we are saying that these ones should certainly be part of a judge's consideration. You have to look at the circumstances in which a judge has to consider what has been reasonable. If you sat down with a judge and read down the list that I have already read outâChris Cuffe got $33 million, Steve Jones got $30 million, Brian Gilbertson got $24 million, Smedley got $20 million, Anderson got $19 millionâ the judge is going to say, `That is the benchmark. That is what goes on in this community. That is the community standard in these areas.' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>10356</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Temporary Chairman, we might be interested in a short response by the parliamentary secretary to some of the queries and claims that Senator Conroy has just raised.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>10356</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I was saying, if a judge is sitting there simply having to put a `what is reasonable' test on these sorts of payouts, a smart lawyer, on behalf of whoever is going to be caught in this legislation, will say: `This is what the community standard is. This is reasonable. It is perfectly reasonable.' What we are seeking to do is ensure that the parliament is also reported as saying, `The unreasonableness cannot be defined in legislation and can only be determined by a judge, given the individual circumstances in each case.' This is a furphy. We want the parliament to give some direction. We want to provide the courts with a clear indication of the issues that they must consider when determining whether a transaction is unreasonable. The amendments that we have moved today give some opportunity, some guidance, to a court. They do not, as has been suggested by the government, make it harder, more difficult, for a judge to make a finding in this case. They give some direction; they give some direction that is reasonable.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to speak on a couple of final matters and I appreciate that we are already running behind because of some earlier antics. Labor's view, as I have said before, is that self-regulation has been a green light to corporate greed. Self-regulation has failed to produce outcomes that benefit the investor or the employee. That is why we need a more robust approach. That is why we have moved amendments last night and todayâto try and capture more within the law. Labor's amendments fall into two categories: compulsory voting by trustees of super funds, and compulsory disclosure by fund managers. These amendments promote shareholder activism.</para><para>We are pleased, from the indications from Senator Campbell, that the government are supportive of some of the principles here. I think Senator Campbell made some worthwhile comments last night. He said that he was immediately attracted to many of Labor's requirements for super funds and fund managers. He said that it was very worth while to require funds to declare whether they vote or do not vote, and how they vote. Given Senator Campbell's endorsement of Labor's proposals, we suggest that the government, through Senator Campbell, put some action behind his words and support Labor's amendments. </para><para>We only have to go back to 1998 when Labor and the Democrats combined to force the disclosure of executive remuneration. The government cannot hide behind the arguments they have usedâthat there were going to be kidnappings if shareholders were told how much they were actually paying their individual CEOs; the sky was going to fall in; kids were going to be kidnapped; they would have to increase their security at home. Don't worry about the fact that it is done in the US. Don't worry that it is mandatory to put the contract on the Net. They all managed to survive that but, in Australia, the sky was going to fall in. Back then, Senator Campbell and the government opposed those amendments. In the end, they were forced, by weight of numbers in the Senate, to not oppose them. While Senator Campbell's words are good, here is his chance to put some action behind the words.</para><para>Our amendments will attempt to ensure that Australia catches up with the UK and the US. In the UK, Vodafone executives voted themselves huge packages of options and huge salary increases at the same time as the Vodafone share price was `tanking', as it was going through the floor. And what happened? Shareholders got together, using their power, using their superannuation votes, and 15 per cent of shareholdersâjust 15 per centâwere able to get organised and say, `Enough is enough. This has got to stop.' The Vodafone management got the message. They instituted a complete review of their executive remuneration procedures. So shareholders can take a stand if they work together. There is the Vodafone example in the UK and there are many examples in the USâwhere they are forced to vote in relation to pension plansâof shareholder activism delivering good results, and Australia has been behind.</para><para>Our amendments want to introduce a penalty of $10,000 per breach for super funds if they fail to vote. Contrary to Senator Campbell's assertions, Labor's proposals have been public since last year. It has not been a last-minute ambush in the Senate, as Senator Campbell has described it extensively. I know he gets lots of phone calls from people saying, `How could you do this to us?' He has got the press release ready which says `Labor and the Democrats ambush us yet again in the Senate'. You can see the press release nowâ`Irresponsible Labor and Democrats: last-minute ambush!' It does not matter that our policy has been out there for two years, that I have consulted on it for two years or that we put out a press release back in December saying we were going to do this and it is now three or four months laterâthe `ambush' press release is already written.</para><para>We also want to ensure, through schedule 1, item (3), that this bill applies both to directors and to the top five named executives. As it stands at the moment, the bill is quite narrow, and I think Senator Wong may want to make a contribution on this, if she has not already. If the bill claws back unreasonable payments made to directors, why shouldn't it also claw back unreasonable payments to the top five executives in a company? What is good for the goose is good for the gander in this instance. Labor is of the view that the top five named executives should also be held to account to shareholders. This particular issue, which we are addressing with this amendment to schedule 1, item (3), was raised in the Senate hearing. It was brought up, so it is not like it was a surprise. When we move this amendment, I hope that the government can see its way to supporting it.</para><para>This is a package of measures that is intended to stamp down on corporate excess. It is to empower shareholders so that shareholders have a chance to take on their boards, which have comprehensively failed in the last five years. What has happened in this country, because of government inaction, is that we have seen boards get their snouts in the trough and we have seen executives get their snouts in the trough, and shareholders have been comprehensively done over. It has not been good enough. The government's response now is not good enough; it does not go far enough. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendments and I urge the government to accept that these are reasonable amendments, accept them and let the bill pass through.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>10358</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak briefly on the opposition's amendment to schedule, 1 item (3) on sheet 2896, which aims to bring within the ambit of this bill the top five paid executives who are not directors of the company.

In terms of employees, there are accrued entitlements, which they may have accrued over a long period. I spoke briefly last night of the Ansett workers. There were people who had long-service leave, redundancy pay and other service related entitlements that they thought they had and could count on for the future but who were left with only a small proportion of their entitlements being paid.</para><para>The context of this bill is to try and ensure, in the context of corporate insolvency, that you try and increase the appropriate pools of moneys from which a liquidator can draw to meet these debts. It seems to me very strange that the government would not accept this amendment to deal with executives when it is clear that the same issues that apply to unreasonable director related transactions also apply to top executives who may receive an unreasonable amount of money prior to a company going into liquidation. I would be interested to hear from Senator Campbell why it is that the government oppose this amendment in particular.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10358</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am going to speak now, and perhaps not again, just to cover our views on all these amendments. Essentially, we have three views. Firstly, the amendments do not go far enough. As both major parties know, it is our opinion, for instance, that all institutions above a certain size and capability should vote their shares in terms of what we would describe as a duty of care, never mind a broader community responsibility. The second point I would make is that we are extremely angry, despite the way in which I express it, about the way in which a number of corporations and company executives and directors have been behaving in this area. Our own anger is magnified substantially within the community. We think these issues need to be addressed. </para></talk.start><para>That leads to the third view we have, and that is that we fear there will be no legislation on the broader scale as proposed by the government through CLERP 9 in time for financial year end reporting. As we view it, if the government wants proper parliamentary scrutiny of CLERP 9, that proposal would need to be referred to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services now, today, this week, so that the committee could formally receive that referral for consideration and report by, say, May or early June so that we could properly consider the matter in June. The fact is that the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has not got that reference, and there is no chance of getting that reference before perhaps much later in the year. Therefore, we have to take the opportunity to address the broader scale of issues raised by the opposition and ourselves, and we have to take it now so that companies immediately, or certainly from 1 July 2003, start to operate under a much tougher disclosure regime.</para><para>I will confess that, given the relatively short time frame in which we have received the amendmentsâwhich I do not condemn the opposition forâand given the nature of our resources, we have not dotted every `i' and crossed every `t', and we are not equipped to do that. But we think that by and large on our reading of them they add substantially to disclosure and would be a considerable advance on where we are. Unless we are provoked to speak later I think that will be sufficient for today. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>âThe question is that opposition amendments (3) and (4) on sheet 2893 be agreed.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Senator CONROY (Victoria) (12.02 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><quote><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (after line 23), after subparagraph (a)(iii), insert:</para></quote><para>	(iiia)	a profit or benefit accrued to a person listed under subparagraph (b) as a result of the exercise of options over shares granted by the company;

Senator Wong did ask an entirely reasonable question about not accepting the amendment which expands it to executives. That is a particular policy idea that does deserve consideration. As I explained at length last nightâprobably at far too great a lengthâthere is a problem with section 300A as it was put into the Senate last time because it was drafted literally on this floor, where even I was unsure about how you should define emoluments or remuneration. We are still fixing that up now. There is a draft bill out for exposure at the moment, which I can give you a copy of and which addresses those issues. I am not using this as an excuseâit is something that can be addressed and probably should be addressed. For example, there is no definition of executive or executive officer. I am not saying this is an excuse not to do it but it is something that should be looked at in a diligent way. There is no definition of executive in the law at the moment and yet the amendment says that.</para></talk.start><para>There are also issues of coverage of senior executivesâfor example, how do you define senior executive? When you are going back four years, for example, how do you pick the top five? There is a range of issues. I am not doing this in a Sir Humphrey Appleby sort of way, saying, `Legal, technical, administrative difficulties,' but these are things which I think we can all respect. Last night I reread Labor's policy in relation to disclosure of remuneration. It draws attention to the fact that Labor wants to reform 300A to make it more effective and more enforceable. We are in absolute unanimity there. </para><para>In relation to extending the repayment of directors' bonuses, if the government do agree with the policyâand we have not reviewed it yet; the committee has reported and made a recommendation but we have not had a chance to review that, and I do not pre-empt that because there are a range of things we want to look atâyou would want to ensure that the drafting sought to achieve the outcome you want to achieve. We simply cannot do that. That is why I say these sorts of amendments should be subject to the diligent processes that the rest of the law reform proposals are. I am not saying that we are opposed in principle at this stage but, even if we were attracted to the proposition, we believe there are some potential problems with the amendment. I will not add anything else.

This is yet another piece of ideology masquerading as policy. This bill is substantially identical to the bill which lapsed at the last election in 2001. The <inline ref="R1242">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2001</inline> was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and received, might I say, a tepid response, even from government senators. The picture which emerged from the evidence given to the committee was that the bill was more likely to damage Australia's creative industries than to deliver any tangible benefits to businesses and consumers.</para></talk.start><para>At the election, Labor gave a commitment to the Australian people to oppose the bill and to pursue the extension of a very successful `use it or lose it' policy in relation to software products; books, including electronic books; periodicals, including electronic periodicals; and print music. We are fortified in our decision to oppose the <inline ref="R1509">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002</inline> by the Howard government's comprehensive failure to date to address any of the concerns raised about the previous bill, even those voiced by its own senators. Under scrutiny, the evidence relied upon by the government to justify extending its misguided regime of parallel importation looks particularly shaky indeed. To see how it comes up short, one need only read the government senators' report on the 2001 bill. For instance, in relation to the 2000 report of the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committeeâthe Ergas committee reportâgovernment senators indicated their view was that the committee's capacity to consider the detailed implications of parallel importation was, in fact, limited by the committee's terms of reference. The senators sensibly observed:</para><quote><para>It could be argued there is a substantial difference between the market for some books and the substantial profit that may be derived from those owning copyright in other, more popular, products.</para></quote><para>In other words, the committee was unable to properly consider the nature of different product markets, which undermined the force of its economic arguments. The main body of evidence relied upon by the government is the price data published by the ACCC, most recently in 2001, which purported to show that the price of books and software was higher in Australia than in the US and the UK. Unfortunately, this was also doubted by government senators, noting the failure of the ACCC to take into account factors such as freight costs, conversion costs and discounts. The senators said:</para><quote><para>The absence of consideration of these factors does not weaken the ACCC's case, because it is difficult to determine the original cost in the United States or the United Kingdom, and therefore whether the apparently excessive prices are the result of a number of factors which may have little to do with parallel importation.</para></quote><para>Presented with other evidence which contradicted that of the ACCC, government senators concluded by saying that they had major reservations about the ACCC's evidence and recommended that the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts fund an independent body such as the Australian Copyright Council to ensure that comparable data is collected on all industries affected by the government's proposed changes.</para><para>In a sure sign that it does not care whether the facts support its ideological position, the government has completely ignored this recommendation of its own senators. As a result, the government is effectively asking the parliament to take its word for it: firstly, that a real international price differential exists in relation to software, books, periodicals and sheet music, and, secondly, that parallel importation is the solution to the supposed problem. This was acknowledged by government senators in their report when they said: </para><quote><para>Evidence provided by the music industry demonstrated that there are no consistently lower prices available for top selling CDs, and no evidence was provided to demonstrate that consumers of items other than popular music obtained any benefits at all from parallel importation.</para></quote><para>They also went on to say:</para><quote><para>A number of outcomes appear to be promised by this legislation, but the extent to which such expectations may be realised is unclear.</para></quote><para>This wafer-thin and unconvincing case put by the government must be weighed against the potential impact of the bill on Australia's creative industries. By any standard, the Howard government's record on innovation, research and development and industry policy is abysmal. So it comes as no surprise that the government has paid scant regard to these issues in the context of this bill.</para><para>We turn to jobs and investment as a key part of this bill. A multitude of groups have expressed concern about the potential of this bill to impact adversely on jobs and investment in Australia. In the category of video games, it is worth remembering that the video game industry directly employs around 1,000 people locally, of whom 600 are in game development, across approximately 30 companies, and 400 are in sales, marketing and distribution. This does not include those indirectly employed in retail. The Game Developers Association of Australia has expressed concern that the imposition of a regime of parallel importation will jeopardise the growth of this promising local industry. The association has drawn attention to the need to simplify the regulatory framework to encourage greater local investment in their industry. But instead of working with industry to free it from unnecessary regulatory burdens, the Howard government arrogantly persists with its ideological push for more parallel importation.</para><para>Likewise, authors and publishers have drawn attention to a range of adverse consequences the bill could well have for Australian writing and publishing. The Australian Society of Authors has pointed out that the proportion of total book sales in Australia represented by Australian originated books has risen from 10 per cent in the mid-1970s to more than 60 per cent in the late 1990s, evidencing the tremendous growth of Australian literary culture and the publishing industry. Yet one foreseeable consequence of the bill would be to allow overseas additions of Australian authors' books, including remaindered editions, to be sold on the Australian market. Australian authors would receive, as a consequence, reduced royalties on non-remaindered overseas editions and, of course, no royalties on remaindered ones. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that parallel importation would undermine the incentive to promote Australian authors overseas and seek out overseas rights sales. Surely the coalition does not want to see fewer Peter Careys and Kate Grenvilles.</para><para>Another problem identified by both the business software and video game industries is piracy, particularly, organised piracy. It is commonsense that, the more importation channels there are, the more opportunities exist to smuggle counterfeit goods into Australia, yet it is a subject about which the Howard government has had almost nothing constructive to say. The tone was set last year in June when the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, held forth in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>about `the myth of an Australian piracy problem'. The minister had obviously forgotten the conclusions of the unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which were:</para><quote><para>Infringement of copyright on a commercial basis, including piracy and bootlegging, is a significant and costly burden to many Australian industries that rely on creative endeavour.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>Although there are few documented cases in which organised crime has been linked to copyright infringement, there is sufficient evidence from industry to support such a finding.</para><para>Infringement of copyright is likely to increase in the future. </para></quote><para>The minister can be forgiven for forgetting these matters; after all, the report was released 2Â¼ years ago and it has still not prompted a response from the government. There has been no response to date in relation to that. The government's head was shown to be well and truly in the sand when, in September last year, New South Wales Police announced they had seized 20,000 videos and CDs believed to be part of an international piracy syndicate. Seemingly in a panic, the Attorney-General issued a press release a fortnight later hailing the prosecution of a man who pleaded guilty in Penrith Local Court to selling pirate DVDs at Penrith markets and agreed to forfeit a mammoth 237 pirate DVDs and pay a fine of $5,000. The Attorney-General seems to regard this as some kind of watershed in the fight against piracy. To the opposition, this somewhat desperate fanfare revealed how much work the Howard government has ahead to grasp the dimensions of the problem. I should acknowledge that the government did establish late last year a government-industry consultative group on IP enforcement and that, on our most recent information, the Australian Federal Police have designated an office to take specific responsibility for IP crime intelligence collection. I am sure the minister can advise the Senate in this debate about how successful that program has been.</para><para>Again, these limited measures only serve to highlight the low priority the government continues to accord to Australian antipiracy capabilities. When asked, for example, about the government's failure to respond to the standing committee's report on copyright enforcement, the Attorney-General tends to caution against knee-jerk reactions. Of course, no-one would advocate a knee-jerk reaction, but what we have had from the Attorney-General is in fact no reaction at all. Perhaps we should be pointing the finger at the minister for communicationsâafter all, the Attorney-General's Department dobbed him in at Senate estimates last November as the source of the delay. Perhaps we could ask him to take the foot off the brake. The standing committee made a number of recommendations of relevance to the concern expressed by industries affected by this bill, such as, firstly:</para><quote><para>... the documentation required to be completed by commercial importers when importing a product into Australia, include a declaration to the effect that, had the product been made in Australia, the making of the product would not constitute an infringement of copyright ...	</para></quote><para>The committee also recommended that the Copyright Act be amended to provide greater deterrence and to facilitate easier prosecution of copyright infringement, and it recommended that the Minister for Justice and Customs, in conjunction with the Commissioner of the AFP, establish a task force within the AFP, involving representatives from state police forces, Customs, the Attorney-General's Department and industry policing bodies for the enforcement of intellectual property rights, with the performance outcomes of the task force to be contained in the respective annual report.</para><para>The opposition accept that none of the issues considered by the committee is straightforward and the government is right to strike a careful balance between the rights of copyright owners and the rights of consumers. But at a time when Australia needs to be projecting itself to the world as an innovative, knowledge based economy which takes the protection of intellectual property rights seriously, the Howard government, by its delay, is in fact sending the opposite message. As I understand it, the government has today proposed a handful of amendments relating to piracy, ostensibly to secure the Democrats' support for the parallel importation of software. In the limited time available, I now want to turn to that issue.</para><para>Those amendments do not allay the fears the opposition have about the bill itself; hence we will be maintaining our opposition to this bill and honouring our commitment made at the last election. Indeed, amendment (4) puzzles usâand I will say a bit about this during the committee stageâbecause it appears to weaken the existing evidentiary presumption relating to sound recordings; namely, that a label or mark is sufficient evidence of copyright. It replaces this with the statement that such a label or mark is merely prima facie evidence. How this makes the task of a plaintiff easier is at least a little unclear to me. Perhaps the minister might like to take the opportunity during the committee stage to provide a more accurate picture of that position. </para><para>I turn to what has been termed `use it or lose it'. In contrast to the Howard government's relentless pursuit of ideology, the opposition have proposed a practical and sensible extension of the use it or lose it regime to these categories of products. Under Labor's use it or lose it regime, which has operated successfully since 1991, a person other than the copyright owner, licensee or agent is permitted to import: firstly, non-pirated copies of a book first published overseas if the book was not published in Australia within 30 days of first overseas publication; secondly, non-pirated copies of a book first published in Australia if an order for the book is not met by the copyright owner, their licensee or agent within 90 days of the order; thirdly, a single non-pirated copy of a book to fill a verifiable order from a consumer; and, fourthly, multiple non-pirated copies of a book to fill a verifiable order from a not-for-profit library. It is widely recognised that the use it or lose it regime has ensured that Australians have timely access to books on the market at competitive prices. If, by chance, the government comes to its senses and realises the superiority of the use it or lose it scheme compared to its approachâ which can only be categorised as unbridled parallel importationâthen the opposition are ready and willing to cooperate. If the Democrats want to embrace it as well, the Labor Party will work with the Democrats to ensure that the legislation can have an effect other than what the Democrats have proposed. I must say that it is disappointing to find that the Democrats have decided to abandon our local producers and our local authors and have stood by the government in this instance with a handful of weak amendments.</para><para>In conclusion, the bill cannot be supported. It would extend an already flawed regime of regulation to more of Australia's creative industries with little or no tangible benefit to Australian businesses and consumers. It really does beggar belief that the Democrats have altered their position so significantly to side with the government in this respect. I will listen to Senator Aden Ridgeway's contribution to see if he can explain this to the Senate and to the people of Australia, particularly those who stand to lose most by his cooperation. As I have said, it is extremely disappointing that, when there is so much to be done by government to foster and develop Australia's innovative knowledge based industries, the Howard government has run out of puff and ideas and fallen back on tired, ideological and flawed proposals such as this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10364</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1509">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002</inline>. I welcome the opportunity to provide some explanation as to the Democrats' position. The first thing that needs to be said for the record is that there is no change in position. We have been very clear on our positionâgoing back to the 1998 bill and the need then to deal with the question of parallel importation as it related to CDsâand we have the same position this time. We have always focused on our creative industries in this country, particularly in terms of the issues of copyright and how to deal with the ever-growing problem of piracy. As has already been stated, the bill seeks to remove restrictions on the parallel importation of books, magazines, sheet music, software, interactive computer games and enhanced CDs. It does not affect the importation of software for private use and it exempts films in celluloid or video form.</para></talk.start><para>The stated intention is to create greater market competition for these products by removing import monopolies. Thus it is assumed that consumers will have access to a greater range of products and, at the same time, cheaper prices. As senators will be aware, the bill was considered by a Senate inquiry in May 2001. The Democrats opposed the bill then and we oppose it as printed now. However, over the past 18 months we have had ongoing discussions with the government which have resulted in an agreement whereby the government will introduce a more robust antipiracy and copyright enforcement regime. We will not oppose relaxing the restrictions on the parallel importation of software products subject to the provisions affecting the book and publishing industries being defeated. </para><para>The key elements in the anti-piracy and copyright enforcement regimes include the new presumptions of ownership and subsistence of copyright to ease the burden of proof in criminal and civil matters, additional damages for flagrant infringement, copyright jurisdiction for the Federal Magistrates Service, increased monetary penalties and advertising offences. I will save detailed discussion on these elements until the committee stage. However, there are undoubtedly clear benefits for copyright owners. The package, in my view, represents a very long overdue incremental improvement on existing anti-piracy and copyright enforcement provisions in this country. There are several reasons why we have adopted this approach to the bill, including the serious threat to copyright industries by piracy itself, the need to provide protection to the book industry in this countryâour authors, publishers, the creative industry and those who contribute to national cultural identityâand our opposition to the misuse of market power by import monopolies.</para><para>Firstly, I want to emphasise that, with these amendments, this bill is now fundamentally about piracy. That is our prime focus and that is the key area that will produce net community benefits. I think that piracy is something people need to understand. It is essentially, at the end of the day, theft. In this country, I understand that up to 27 per cent of many of the products that are floating around are indeed the result of piracy and are the result of the lack of enforcement in our protection regimes for those that do hold copyright. It does pose a real and increasing threat to the viability of the copyright industries. I do not believe that we can afford to be complacent about piracy. It is no myth. There is substantial evidence that copyright pirates are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The case last year that Senator Ludwig referred to of the dumping of fake CDs in the Australian marketplace, particularly with HMV Records throughout the country, is one well-known example. But I think we have to acknowledge that this area is increasingly sophisticated, well-organised and well-resourced. There are shonky operators at inner-city markets, but they are, in my view, a small part of a much more serious threat.</para><para>I am well aware that an argument against the legislation is that it will lead to greater levels of piracy. However, the correlation between piracy and parallel importation is weak. That conclusion was also reached by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on piracy, <inline font-style="italic">Cracking down on copycats</inline>. In New Zealand, for example, where there are no restrictions on parallel importation, software piracy fell from 34 per cent in 1997 to 28 per cent in the 2000. That was according to the business software association's own data. However, whilst the parallel importation provisions are substantially about trade and not about copyright, we do not deny that there is a risk that pirates may seek to exploit the relaxing of parallel importation restrictions by marketing illegal copies. The Democrats' insistence on enhancing anti-piracy is essentially related to our well-developed interest in innovation, research and development. There is a real issue about policy coherence. I think we have to ask the question: what is the point of expecting universities, the CSIRO and industry to develop and commercialise intellectual property if we do not adequately protect it?</para><para>Secondly, the Democrats have had a longstanding commitment to the development of the arts and creative industries. We opposed removing restrictions to parallel importation for CDs in 1998, as I have already said, and we will oppose the provisions in this bill that remove restrictions to the parallel importation of books. We believe that removing the existing restrictions to parallel importation of books may have significant negative consequences for our future cultural heritage. The Australian book printing and publishing industries are diverse, competitive and increasingly export oriented. Further relaxation of restrictions on parallel importation of books does open up the possibility of significant dumping of books written by our highest profile authors. This may seriously jeopardise the viability of our printing and publishing industries and further undermine the already precarious position of authors in this country. The Democrats find it totally unacceptable that shallow market arguments should take precedence over our authors' ability to articulate our own stories to us and to the rest of the world. Australia's authors and publishers are significant cultural producers and are vital in order to develop, question, challenge and authenticate those things that are unique to our cultural identity. </para><para>Thirdly, as my colleague Senator Murray has stated on many occasions, the Democrats will continue to oppose the oppressive, unnecessarily restrictive and predatory monopolistic or cartel-like market behaviour which can result from the abuse of protection afforded by copyright law. We do accept the theoretical point, advanced notably by Professor Allan Fels, that parallel importation permits the prospect of international price discrimination by multinational firms. Copyright industries, particularly in software and interactive games, are substantially dominated by multinationalsâthat point does need to be noted. We do need to be careful of making rash overgeneralisations, though. The practice of some multinationals in adopting marketing zones may reflect factors well outside their controlâsuch as, for example, different television specifications, as is the case with interactive computer games. Nevertheless, apart from the compelling reasons to protect our cultural industries, including music, books and film, we believe that minimising the potential for abuse of market power by limiting import monopolies is, indeed, sound policy.</para><para>However, the Democrats are sceptical of the central rationale for the billâthat removal of restrictions on parallel importation will result in cheaper prices for consumers. This argument is plausible if, in fact, Australian consumers pay significantly higher prices than consumers in the United States, the United Kingdom or any other market. Then there would be an incentive for large retailers, for instance, to leverage local distributors by accessing cheaper licensed products. But we have to ask the question: are Australians paying higher prices? The principal source of evidence that has been put forward to support the government's position is the ACCC's comparative analysis of book and software prices. This information purportedly shows that, over the past 13 years or so, Australian consumers typically pay more for books and software than their counterparts in the UK and the USA.</para><para>However, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee looked at this particular issue concerning the bill back in May 2001, the committee received telling evidence that demonstrated serious flaws in the ACCC's methodology. All of the senators on the committee, the government senators included, were underwhelmed by the ACCC's approach. By way of contrast, the committee received pretty solid evidence from representatives of the book publishing and business software industry suggesting that Australian consumers pay competitive prices. </para><para>However, the price myth persists. In an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 25 February this year, for example, it was asserted that we are still paying over 15 per cent more for bestsellers than US readers and a great deal more for specialised texts. This claim is at odds with the most recent comparative pricing survey, undertaken by the ACCC in June 2002, which found that the average price of all bestsellers in Australia exceeded the price in the US by minus 0.7 per cent and exceeded the price in the United Kingdom by minus 13.7 per cent. In other words, `exceeded' by a `minus' means that the ACCC found that the average price for all bestsellers was cheaper in Australia than in either the United States or the United Kingdom.</para><para>I will examine book prices in greater detail when we get to the committee stage of the bill, but I want to highlight that one of the significant anomalies in the ACCC's approach in their 2000 report was that they found an unfavourable comparison regarding reference books. We need to keep in mindâ and this is something the committee was well aware ofâthat their survey is not representative. The comparisons are from an original list of 19 medical texts selected in 1988 and I understand most of the 19 books surveyed are no longer published in Australia. You have to be sceptical about the validity of using such an outdated list of academic books as the basis for comparative pricing. Indeed, I am rather relieved that the medical texts have moved on since then. </para><para>In addition to being sceptical about some of the pricing claims that have been made, we believe that the enthusiasm for removing the restrictions on parallel importation does not take sufficient account of the costs and the risks of importation, the dynamics of the relations between wholesalers and retailers, joint marketing campaigns, and the quick and responsive service and back-up support for being able to service copyright products. These are critical features that retailers value which are unlikely to be matched for products that are parallel imported. That is not to say the relationship is always benign: there is unequal power between small retailers and suppliers. Accordingly, we are not convinced that these provisions will make that much of a difference.</para><para>It is also worth noting that the opposition favours relaxing restrictions on parallel importation. In 1991, it introduced its `use it or lose it' policy for the parallel importation of books and, during the 2001 election campaign, the opposition also promised to extend the `use it or lose it' regime with its 30- and 90-day rules to software products, electronic games and so forth. Whilst there may be some difference between the government and the opposition as to the extent that they wish to relax restrictions, the rhetoric of political debate cannot mask the underlying consensus that import monopolies can, in principle, have detrimental economic and consumer effects.</para><para>The opposition's approach to relaxing restrictions on parallel importation of books is now well established. However, I am less convinced of this approach as it relates to software products. In theory it will put pressure on copyright owners and distributors to ensure prompt releases and competitive prices. However, it is the practice in digital industriesâtaking in software and CDsâto release any new products simultaneously around the world, so there is no advantage. The idea of doing that is to minimise the capacity of pirates to capitalise on different release dates. It is also not clear how effective the 30-day rule would be in such circumstances. Moreover, there may typically be a delay of approximately two months before an Australian release of an interactive computer game configured to United States specifications due to the time required to recode games to meet Australian TV specifications. So it is not simply a case of saying that we can import one product to another place, plug it in and it is going to work. That is simply nonsense.</para><para>Schedule 1 of the bill affects a number of sectors, including software, interactive computer games, enhanced CDs and film. Given the time constraints, I will confine my comments today to some issues relating to interactive games and film. The interactive computer games industry is growing at a rapid rate and becoming a significant employer of highly skilled developers. Indeed, Australian developers are very highly regarded around the world. The value of the sector is significant, with revenues of well over $500 millionâcomparable to film. Moreover, interactive games have broader economic effects, notably by being a significant driver in broadband uptake. It is also important to understand that a central feature of the interactive games sector is the overwhelming dominance of multinationals. While Sony, Nintendo and others are increasingly recognising the skill and creative flair of Australian developers, it is these companies that own the copyright, not Australian developers. Indeed, I understand that the copyright for the two best known Australian games, V8 Racing and AFL, is owned offshore. To a very large extent, we are therefore not talking about Australian copyright when we consider the possible effects of relaxing restrictions on parallel importation.</para><para>There are some real issues that need to be addressed to encourage investment in local industries and industry development. There is not just the parallel importation issue. The real issues go to venture capital and the smoothing of support for research and development, including the R&amp;D Start and tax concession programs. The Democrats have always taken a very strong interest in developing a good investment climate for our creative industries. A clearer articulation of that was seen in Senator Stott Despoja's successful efforts to enhance the research and development tax concession package that the government had brought forward as part of Backing Australia's Ability. </para><para>As is outlined in our dissenting report to the inquiry on the <inline ref="R1341">Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001</inline>, the Democrats believe the criteria for being able to determine eligible research and development remain too grounded in the applied engineering area of the manufacturing sector. More fine-grain criteria relevant to research and development in the creative industries are also required to underpin industry development and supplement the broad-brush approach of the existing definitions. I should also note that it has been claimed that these provisions undermine the classification system, as parallel imported games will not meet Australia's stringent classification criteria. However, all computer games for sale, hire or public exhibition in Australia must be classified by the Commonwealth classification board. Regardless of whether the products are produced in Australia or overseas, the classification requirement remains the same: parallel imported products will still need to meet the classification criteria.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>10368</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate my speech in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1509">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002</inline>, as circulated in the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>One Nation fiercely opposes the Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002.

The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 include provisions enabling the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to give effect to commitments made under international wine trading agreements. My home state of Western Australia is an important supplier of wine not only to the Australian domestic market but also for export purposes. These amendments include a change to the administrative arrangements for the protection of wine names. </para></talk.start><para>During the second reading debate in the other place the minister said that the changes will enable obligations entered into under international wine trading agreements to be regulated, including obligations under the Australian-EU wine agreement. Mr Truss foreshadowed the demise of descriptions for Australian wine, including champagne, brandy and moselle, and indicated that the amendments will allow these terms to be retired. Another change is the extension of the prosecution period for export breaches under the act from one to seven years. The opposition is assured by the government that the wine industry has been appropriately consulted on this issue through the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation legislation review committee. The ALP therefore believes that the amendments are valid and will be supported.</para><para>The amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 provides that where orders made under the act make reference to food standards they are to be read as references to current standards. In so doing, the amendment ensures that orders do not need to be amended whenever standards change by addressing the contrary intention requirement of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</para><para>The amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992 include a clarification of the activities that can be carried out for which payments can be made from the National Residue Survey Reserve. This key amendment will allow the National Residue Survey to test all food, feed and fibre production inputs, thus extending the reach of the NRS. A minor amendment will bring the act into line with other Commonwealth legislation with respect to the protection of privacy.</para><para>The amendment to the Quarantine Act 1908 clarifies offence provisions to provide greater certainty in relation to offences against the act. Contingent amendments are also proposed in relation to the application of amendments to Christmas Island. This is a sensible provision that recognises that the provisions in this bill are likely to commence before the provisions in the <inline ref="R1563">Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, a bill that extends the application of the Quarantine Act to Christmas Island. Finally, in the suite of amendments to various pieces of legislation, the simple amendment to the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Act 2002 corrects a misdescribed provision in that act.</para><para>However, like so much of our agricultural endeavours in this country, all production is at risk from that great curse in non-metropolitan areas of Australia: salinity. Where is the urgency from this government on the issue of salinity? We in Western Australia are very conscious of the problem. The problem is so important that whenever we have the opportunity to consider agriculture we must consider salinity at the same time. It is estimated that over a million acres of Australia become saline with each passing year. In fact, based on advice provided by scientists in Western Australia, it is likely that over 30 per cent of agricultural land in my home state will be saline within the coming decades. This affects all of us.</para><para>Salinity is the one issue that we need to act on all the time. The real problem with salinity is that there is not a simple answer to it. Different areas have different circumstances, and simplistic solutions have no place in a serious discussion of the problem. The member for O'Connor, for example, proposes just such a simplistic solution in Western Australia. The solution he proposes is the engineering one: all we need to do is to drain the watertableâdig a channel, if you likeâand the land will be returned to productive uses. Anyone who has been to the wheat belt in Western Australia knows that draining the watertable is not the best solution to land that is as flat as a tack. </para><para>Recently, I visited an important research site in Tammin. This site is located on land that has been saline for over 50 yearsâland that has not been productive for a longer period than many of us have been alive. Land that does not lend itself to an engineering solution requires a different approach. This project is important on a number of fronts. Firstly, the family farming the land took the initial approach of planting saltbush. Saltbush, as the name suggests, is a salt-tolerant plant. The farmers took the initial step. The CSIRO was then approached to assist the farmers to make saltbush a productive concern. The main benefit of saltbush is that it allows sheep to graze on it over the autumn months when other pastures are in short supply. The issues to do with grazing sheep on saltbush are the loss of condition of the sheep and the reduction in the cost of saltbush so that it becomes productive as a pasture crop for the farmer.</para><para>The really pleasing nature of this project for sustainable grazing on saline land is the cooperation of the farmers and the CSIRO together with the multidisciplinary approach of the CSIRO, which I must say has been led very admirably by a team of women scientists. The scientists involved in the project include livestock specialists, hydrologists, botanists and others looking at the totality of the solution, not just single elements. This means that the result of this project will consider all factors involved in salinity. Anyone who has been to Tammin knows that it is hot, dry and not the most pleasant place in the world to work. The dedication of these scientists to assist Australian farmers to find a solution to the issue of salinity cannot be applauded loudly enough.</para><para>Salinity is a problem that we all must be concerned about all the time. Salinity is not going away quickly or cheaply. Strong science and intensive research are the answer. We should reject the single, simplistic solution to this issue, as salinity does not have a magic bullet answer. Only then can we address this plague on our productive land. The efforts of our farmers and scientists to solve this problem must be highlighted, and at no stage should we accept reduced funding for the CSIRO and other projects working on salinity. If we do nothing, we risk a disaster for our agriculture that is almost impossible to contemplate.</para><para>In recognition of the administrative nature of the bill, I have decided to keep my remarks fairly brief.

Certainly, to the best of my knowledge, we are putting at least $740 million into that national action plan. The government takes salinity very seriously.

The National Residue Survey Administration Act currently prohibits the release of information collected under a survey conducted using funds from the reserve if it identifies a particular person. The only exception to this general prohibition is that this information can be provided to the Commonwealth, state and territory authorities that are responsible for the regulation of pesticide or other residues in food related products. The relevant amendments to the act in this bill will authorise the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to release information collected under a survey conducted using funds from the reserve that identifies a particular person to any person the secretary deems to be appropriate. Currently, no restriction on the secretary's powers in this regard is proposed. </para><para>The Democrats are somewhat concerned about these provisions because we think they could allow information to be released for inappropriate purposes. The intention of the government, as far as we can determine, in seeking this amendment to the act, is to ensure that information concerning contaminants and chemical residues could be provided to producers and manufacturers so as to enable them to manage product and contamination issues. However, if the power to authorise the release of information is not constrained, there is the potential for incriminating information to be released to inappropriate people such as commercial competitors.</para><para>The amendment which we are moving proposes to put some restrictions on the ability of the secretary to release the information to an appropriate person and tie it back to the purposes of enabling the person to monitor, regulate or manage agricultural or veterinary chemical residues and contaminations, inapplicable products or the environment.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>10373</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator TROETH (VictoriaâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (1.03 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMES LEGISLATION ENHANCEMENT BILL 2002 [2003]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10373</page.no><id.no>S373</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10373</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 December 2002, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10373</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>10373</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to the <inline ref="S373">Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2002 [2003]</inline>.

The items contained in the bill include amendments claimed to simplify existing legislative provisions, achieve consistency between similar provisions and payment types and address some unintended consequences of earlier amendments. I do not intend to discuss in great detail the individual elements of the omnibus bill, as they are many and varied. I do, however, want to discuss a few key areas that are of particular significance.</para></talk.start><para>First, I believe it is appropriate to note that the government has removed an item that would have resulted in a negative impact on some families who are receiving rent assistance. On examination of the bill, Labor noted that the items in schedule 1 which related to the payment of rent assistance would have resulted in a fairly significant number of families being worse off. The government advised that 2,000 to 3,000 families would be affected. In order to preserve the non-controversial status of the bill, the government decided to remove those parts. That is welcome. However, the supplementary explanatory material from the government seems to suggest that these measures will be pursued through other portfolio legislation. I urge the government to reconsider its approach. Reasons for this may be found in the shadow minister's contribution in the House of Representatives. I would urge the government to examine his comments again.</para><para>Since the debate in the House, Labor has discovered other controversial parts in the bill, relating in particular to youth allowance debts. Labor has examined closely the youth allowance debt recovery provisions in the bill. They are items 18 and 67 of schedule 1 and related items 98, 100 and 112. These amendments seek to introduce debt recovery provisions for youth allowance recipients who are paid on the basis of their parents' estimated taxable income. An oversight in the Youth Allowance Consolidation Act 2000 means that there is currently no compliance mechanism in place to reconcile estimated parental income with actual parental income. The opposition's concern is not with compliance mechanisms per se but with the way in which they will operate. In particular, the provisions in this bill will see actual income effectively averaged across the YA payment period.</para><para>The proposed section 56O then stipulates that a person's rate of YA is to be recalculated on the basis of the actual income. The problem with this mechanism is that it will operate in a similar way to family tax benefit reconciliations. We all know what a shambles the family tax benefit is, with one in three families being slugged with debts even though many played by the rules. The mechanism is an underhanded way to claw back benefits to which families believed they were entitled. Specifically, the retrospective effects of averaging actual income will result in debts being raised for portions of the YA payment period when parental income was below the average. Whilst the government has argued that such an approach should apply to a so-called tax benefit, the opposition is wary of its application to income support payments. It is easy to envisage a YA recipient being exposed to a significant debt if their parents are unemployed for a part of the year coinciding with the original estimate but then go on to find employment. As I mentioned, Labor is not opposed to youth allowance parental income reconciliations, but it wants a mechanism that is fair. </para><para>Accordingly, Labor proposed to the government two possible solutions to ensure no retrospective debts could be raised. Firstly, provisions could allow for a fixed percentage variation in parental income before an overpayment is calculated and debt raised. Currently, section 1067G-F6 of the act allows for a 25 per cent variation before a base tax year parental income is abandoned, the current tax year is adopted and benefit recalculations are triggered. Such a buffer could also be used for income estimates, with no debt able to be raised if parental income variation were less than the 25 per cent threshold. A mechanism similar to this operated within the old family allowance, although it did have in place a buffer of 10 per cent. Alternatively, Labor said provisions could be drafted to recalculate YA benefits only from the point in time when parental income exceeded the estimate. Whilst this would be more labour intensive, as information would need to be gathered about precisely when parental income increased, the recalculation of benefits would truly reflect the means available to a family at any particular point in time.</para><para>Labor have put these amendments to the government, but they determined that drafting such amendments could not be achieved in time to consider this bill a non-controversial item. Accordingly, they simply agreed to drop the contentious provisions from this bill. The amendments to achieve this have been circulated in my name. In the longer term, we urge the government to work with Labor to achieve a lasting solution to this problem. The Democrats have also circulated amendments to ensure foster parents have access to child-care benefits, and Labor will be supporting those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10379</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will reserve my comments for the committee stage.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10379</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1694">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> contains a number of non-budget measures that will assist in more effective and efficient administration of the social security law and family assistance law. There are technical amendments, as have been described, minor amendments and also some minor policy changes. In addition, the bill repeals the First Home Owners Act 1983, which is now redundant, given that no new applications have been permitted under that act since 1991.</para></talk.start><para>I am aware that two sets of amendments are being moved in relation to the bill. The first set concerns several items in the bill which relate to the recalculation of the rate of youth allowance and the recovery of ensuing debts. The opposition has made some suggestions in relation to these items. Rather than delay the passage of the bill, the government has decided to accede to the opposition's amendments which will remove those items from the bill. Further consideration will be given to those items by the government. The second set of amendments relates to the payment of child-care benefit for care provided to foster children after 1 July 2000. The government has been committed to the passage of legislation to validate such payments. The amendments moved by the Democrats give effect to that commitment, and the government is happy to agree to their passage. I thank all senators for their contributions to the bill and commend it to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10380</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><para>Senator MARK BISHOP (Western Australia) (1.14 p.m.)âThe opposition opposes items 18, 67, 98, 100 and 112 of schedule 1 in the following terms:</para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 18, page 8 (line 29) to page 9 (line 32), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para> (2)	Schedule 1, item 67, page 22 (line 15) to page 23 (line 1), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para> (3)	Schedule 1, item 98, page 32 (line 3 to 6), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para> (4)	Schedule 1, item 100, page 32 (line 11) to page 33 (line 7), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para> (5)	Schedule 1, item 112, page 35 (lines 14 to 19), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that items 18, 67, 98, 100 and 112 of schedule 1 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>10380</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâDemocrat amendments (1), (2), (3) and (4) on sheet 2903 have been circulated in the name of my colleague Senator Cherry, but should rightfully be moved in my name.

At that time, the government committed to foster parents that it would rectify this matter and provide retrospective benefits for the period from which they became ineligible. However, this is the first opportunity that a bill has come before the Senate in which we could do thatâin which it could be rectified. Foster carers play a very valuable role in our community. They are the very real quiet achievers who nurture children at a time when there are family difficulties, thereby providing these children with an important buffer against childhood stress. They reaffirm the children's and the community's faith that there is goodness in other people.

In summary, it provides for a number of issues. It restores indexation arrangements for grandfathered child allowance, removes a loophole in the commutation of income streams, allows unclaimed credits to accrue towards the pension bonus, amends the formula for the calculation of the pension bonus, removes an unfair provision preventing back payment of partner service pensions and brings the VEA into line with respect to the treatment of lump sum payments within the means test. I do not intend to make any further comments at this stage, because all these matters are technical. It is an omnibus bill and the opposition supports the bill. For those who wish to see further development of the reasons the opposition supports this bill, I refer them to the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Wednesday, 26 March 2003 and the comments made by Mr Edwards, the opposition representative for veterans' affairs in that place, at page 13367. </para></talk.start><para>However, it is opportune to bring to the Senate's attention the report of the Gulf War Veterans Health Study, which the government was shamed into releasing last Tuesday. This is a very important report for a number of reasons. Firstly, of course, we have Australians deployed in the same area at present and exposed more fully to risks similar to those in 1991. Secondly, the report is a highly competent assessment of the health risks and exposure of military engagement in the gulf, with many direct lessons for the way in which the health of serving personnel should be maintained now and in the future. </para><para>For those interested in understanding the nature of war for the individual Australian, and the complexity of the system needed to support them, this report is compelling reading. For the record, Australia sent 1,873 ADF personnel to the gulf in 1991â90 per cent from the Navyâfollowing the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. On return, many of these veterans, as they then became, began to complain about their health. Their concerns and the debate which then commenced followed the experiences of veterans in the United States, who were also reporting a range of illnesses, which have become known as the Gulf War syndrome.</para><para>The facts speak for themselves. I refer specifically to the answer to my question on notice No. 743, which shows that 164 Gulf War veterans are currently in receipt of payment of compensation for injury and illness caused by war, 19 of whom are T&amp;PIâthat is, they are so affected that they are unable to work more than eight hours per week. For the record, the breakdown of injuries is 28 per cent spine and limb; 25 per cent ear, nose and throat; 20 per cent psychiatric; 10 per cent skin; eight per cent gastrointestinal; and 10 per cent miscellaneous including eyesight. These are disturbing figures: firstly, because they underline the human and financial cost of war downstream from those who serve; and, secondly, they prompt the question about the adequacy of the preparation of defence personnel prior to, during and post deployment. Senators will be aware of some of the media coverage of this issue, and of the parallels drawn by veterans between their service and their illness. This, of course, is perfectly understandable and it is not uncommon. There has never been any question about the stress of war service physically and mentally, and this is built into the compensation system to the extent that service pension is available five years in advance of the age pension and the benefits of the doubt underpinning the scheme makes great allowance for it.</para><para>It is also worth noting, as I have previously, that many areas of service in the past have prompted their own controversy about cause and effect. Here I specifically refer to the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam and the effect of atomic testing in the 1950s, both of which were examined by royal commissions. In neither case was the debate or the concern of veterans settled to their satisfaction. So it is with Gulf War veterans. This study has, for some inexplicable reason, been delayed for over two years and has been with the minister for several months, but at least we have it. I must say it is difficult to see what the government has been attempting to hide. It is technically a very thorough report, and it does answer in great detail many of the fears that veterans have raised about their healthâ for the time being, anyway.</para><para>I will not summarise all the findings, but essentially the report fails to find any evidence to support veterans' fears. In comparison to the similar example of their peers, there is little difference in their health, except for only two things. First, they have a significant elevation in psychological problems; and, second, they have a poorer perception of their own wellness, which the report is not able substantiate in fact. There are, however, some qualifications, the main one being that further surveys will be needed in time to track the sample groupâparticularly with respect to mental disorders. I would like to quote one disturbing observation: </para><quote><para>Increased symptom reporting, increased medical condition reporting and poorer perception of health may be early indicators of more serious health outcomes occurring in the future.</para></quote><para>This is a warning to all of us, and from that we might infer that this issue will not be settled by this report. The report, however, is very valuable for one key reason: it goes into very thorough detail on the Australian deployment to the gulf in 1991, setting out a detailed record of the service given, including evidence from ships' logs. It also analyses much of the research undertaken in the UK and the USA, noting the substantial differences in service, the key one being that very few Australians were exposed to land based threats.</para><para>Putting aside the detail of that methodology, which is important scientifically for studies of its kind, the report is also a very important model and precedent. It is, in fact, a great pity that we did not have any equivalent for any other military deployment. I suggest that we ought to in every case. That includes East Timor and the current deployment to Iraq. One of the key shortcomings of veterans' health, which in history seem endemic, is the lack of records and data on not just the nature of the deployment but the circumstances, risks and exposures to health hazards. This report catalogues that information in great detail. It also records in statistical detail the entire range of health issues complained of, and a comparison is made with physical examinations, psychological assessments and blood tests of the sample group. As a result, there exists a very useful database for future use by the ADF medical corps. Hopefully, advantage will be taken of it.</para><para>There are, however, some disturbing matters identified by the report, the most outstanding of which would seem to be the lack of awareness of personnel as to their own medical status with respect to preventive medicine in particular. The belief, held by more than 10 per cent of those who self-reported, that they were vaccinated against anthrax, for example, would appear to be completely incorrectâeither that, or the Department of Defence, in denying that anyone was so vaccinated, as reported by the minister, is not being truthful. In this area, the official denial would not be unusual but, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that assertion must be accepted. No doubt veterans will remain suspicious. The history of access to records, as we have seen with respect to atomic testing, is a case in point. The recommendations of this report are worth mentioning as well. The first recommendation is:</para><quote><para>There should be wide promotion of the study findings to the veteran and service communities, the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs, the Repatriation Commission, ADF Medical Officers, the broader Australian community and the scientific community.</para></quote><para>I agree completely with that recommendation. This is a fundamentally important report for all the reasons I have given. The system of health care for personnel deployed to action overseas has to be improved. It may well be that significant improvements have already been undertaken, but it is abundantly clear that the individuals and their families may well not see it in this respect. Veterans as a group have been very trusting and have accepted at face value the guarantees given by government that they will be cared for. Sadly, as we know, it is not always the case. We need look no further for evidence than the gold card debacle and cuts to home care around Australia, which show no sign of abating.</para><para>I jump to recommendation 4. There is further evidence of the shortcomings in that there is clearly no adequate record at any level of what personnel have been exposed to, let alone what preventive measures have been undertaken. The vast gulf between perception of which vaccinations have been administered and the official position is a stark illustration. Self-report of illness and recall of treatment is obviously highly unreliableâas are official records, it also seems. We can also hope that it is not true of the current Iraq deployment, though the minister continues to hide behind the security excuse as to what actually has been done. We can also only hope that individuals' trust of the system is well founded, that in fact they do know what preventive medicine they have been given, that it is approved and that it is given in the correct dosage and time frame. It would seem from this report that, unfortunately, the responsibility for taking preventive medicine is up to the individual; but we know liability, of course, rests with the system. </para><para>Perhaps the most far-reaching recommendation of this report concerns the psychological impact of military service, and much time is spent on this issue in light of the very high representation of mental health disorders in compensation claims. This is not a new phenomenon, and there is a very serious history of how we in our society regard mental stress and the disorders which flow. It has been suggested that perhaps people should snap out of it and get on with their lives. But we do know that for many it is a very debilitating condition, manageable at times but nevertheless far reaching in its effects. Once described as burnout, battle fatigue or indeed lack of moral fibre in a past generation, the incidence of PTSD is now of huge proportions.</para><para>I simply add this in the context that, of the 50,000 veterans from Vietnam, currently 13,000 are T&amp;PI and 90 per cent of those have psychological conditions such that they are prevented from working. At the current rate of claims acceptance, it is possible that this number will climb to 50 per cent of the entire contingent within the next 10 years. Likewise, with the 1991 gulf deployment, we already have 19 T&amp;PIs, with a similar number from East Timor, mostly with psychological disorders. This report is very useful in getting some understanding of the causesâ although, of course, it is also interesting to speculate on the differing societal attitudes to this issue over time, even within the current community as a whole. It is a complex issue, but this report is helpful in understanding the dimensions of the issue and its causes.</para><para>In conclusion, this report is also important for the base it establishes for future research into military health management and the future care of serving personnel and veterans. The recommendations about building on the research model and the database set-up are quite critical. Further studies on the same population over time are vital if we are to be able to improve our understanding of these issues. We simply have to get beyond the mind-set that soldiers are only useful whilst they are fit and that, thereafter, they can be discharged into society without any continuing responsibility by the military. Throwing money at the problem may salve the conscience and be efficient, but it avoids proper resolution of the issue. Therefore I commend this very thorough report for its contribution to a very important issue, especially at this time when our thoughts are with those engaged in conflicts. We all know that caring for our troops can be made an awful lot better, and I hope this report and its recommendations will be seriously heeded, especially by the defence establishment. The condition of our future veterans is in their hands. The opposition supports the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>10384</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats also support the<inline ref=""> Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2002</inline>. In many ways it is obviously appropriate, although unfortunate, that we are debating this legislation at a time when a new generation of veterans is currently being created in Iraq. Once again, I express the Democrats' wishes for their wellbeing. The bill has various amendments contained within it, some of which are positive improvements, seeking to align provisions of the veterans legislation with social security law. There is nothing amongst those amendments that we are opposed to. I do think, though, that it should be pointed out once again that the major anomaly between social security law and veterans law is the way that veterans' disability compensation payments are being assessed as income in the social security means test.</para></talk.start><para>This is an issue that the government promised to look into before they were first elected. They have done a report, which was not released, but they have repeatedly refused to address this anomaly. Everybody knows that it exists. I believe the anticipated cost to address it is around $20 million per annum. It is a key issue that is repeatedly raised by veterans organisations, and has been for many years. We are talking about trying to address anomalies between veterans legislation and the Social Security Act. This is a key issue that has been causing immense frustrationâand injustice, I might addâfor a number of veterans for many years. The Democrats have previously moved amendments to this effect that were passed by the Senate but then rejected by the government. From memory, Senator Mark Bishop may once have done the same thing as well. So there is a clear recognition from the opposition parties in this chamber that that change should be made. It is appropriate and it is well overdue. Once again, the Democrats urge the government to act on that in the upcoming budget. </para><para>In mid-February this year the Clarke review into veterans entitlements was released, and one of its recommendations was that disability compensation payments should not be assessed as income in any means test. We hope that the government will respond positively to the review and to that recommendation by addressing it in this year's budget. This year, more than many others, is a time when we need to demonstrate support for our veterans. I would also like to comment briefly on the 1991 health study done on the Gulf War, which was finally released this week. It took a lot of pressure from the Democrats, the Labor Party and others for the minister to stop sitting on the report and actually make it public. The report examines the health impacts on the last generation of veterans in the 1991 conflict. Of course, it was released after the current generation was sent off to fight another war. I noted the minister's press release when it was released, which basically started off with a statement saying that there was no such thing as Gulf War syndrome. I think that was an unfortunate focus for her to have on the report. I also think it was not necessarily accurate per se. There are certainly still many veterans in the US and the UK who had different experiences during the Gulf War that they believe directly resulted in their current disabilities.</para><para>In some ways the report rediscovers, if you like, something that I think Senator Bishop had a couple of terms forâthe one I have heard used a number of times is burnt out digger syndrome. It is appropriate to acknowledge that the overall impact of something as traumatic and enormous as fighting in a battle can have major individual consequences for those Australians we have put into that situation. I think that many times in the past, and still sometimes today, attitudes towards mental illness, towards depression and towards psychological disorders are not as favourable as they should be. People with physical illnesses that are easy to see are still much more likely to have their conditions acknowledged than people with psychological illnesses or depression are. Whilst it is changing in our society these days, it is well worth making this point and emphasising the very real impact that illnesses like depression or other post-traumatic stress type disorders can have on people's lives and, of course, on the family and friends surrounding them.</para><para>We do support the recommendations contained in that Gulf War health study, though. We urge the government to act upon them, particularly the recommendation regarding measures to reduce adverse psychological impacts of military service or deployment related activities. That is about better psychological preparation before a war starts. The report notes that one of the difficulties for the study was `the paucity of accessible, well-documented exposure data from the time of the Gulf War', including information on immunisations and preventative medications.</para><para>We all know the debacle that occurred recently over the anthrax vaccinations for the troops that are now in the gulf. The Democrats certainly hope any future vaccinations of defence personnel are better handled than they were in that case, where a number of personnel had to be taken off ships when they refused vaccinations. Troops should always have the option of refusing vaccinations before they depart, and it was not fair on individuals or good for general morale that this particular incident occurred.<inline ref=""></inline>I know that over recent years the government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs have been making improvements in this area, which the Democrats welcome, but there are clearly more gains and more improvements to be made. We urge the government to act on those via the recommendations in the Gulf War health study.</para><para>In conclusion, the Democrats support the components of the bill. We again urge the government to act on the recommendations of their study and to act also on the recommendations of the Clarke review in relation to the ongoing and very unjust anomaly relating to the treatment of veterans' disability compensation payments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10386</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1695">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2002</inline> is further evidence of this government's continued commitment to improving the delivery of the compensation and assistance available to veterans and their dependants through the repatriation system.

This government wants to allow the parallel importation of computer software, books, periodicals and sheet music. As the shadow minister for information technology, my contribution to this debate relates to the impact this bill will have on software and digital content production in Australia. The coalition's argument is that parallel importation restrictions are leading to higher prices for software in Australia. This argument that Australians pay higher prices than other countries for software has not been substantiated. Further, even if it were the case, evidence suggests that lifting parallel importation restrictions would not lower prices for consumers, particularly in relation to new products. Therefore this legislation attempts to address a non-existent problem and, in doing so, creates a range of negative effects on Australia's software and digital content industries. </para></talk.start><para>At this point I would like to say that I am disappointed to hear that the Australian Democrats, who claim to support the Australian creative content industries, have decided to support the government on parallel importation of software. They have done so for what I understand to be a deal involving a raft of ad hoc antipiracy provisions. Labor believes that this bill will not benefit consumers and will have a negative impact on the software and digital content sector. </para><para>Initial feedback from the software industry indicates that the changes proposed by the Democrats do not come close to meeting the antipiracy measures they say are necessary to address the increased risk of pirated software being distributed in Australia if this bill were to pass. But more to the point is the fact that this government is sending contradictory messages to the software and digital content industries about copyright protection. If passed, this bill will not help consumers and it will have a negative impact on a growing industry. It also contributes to the muddled and opportunist approach adopted by the coalition government in relation to intellectual property issues.</para><para>Let us first consider whether there will be a benefit to consumers. The government has asserted that Australian consumers are paying higher prices for computer software and games. This unproven assertion is based upon an ACCC report released in 1999. This report was discussed at length in a Senate inquiry into parallel importation. Of particular relevance are the conclusions drawn by the government representatives on that committee. They said:</para><quote><para>The committee has some major reservations about this evidence. Those opposing the changes were able to provide considerably more detail about the cost of products across a broader spectrum of items than was the ACCC.</para></quote><para>Other criticisms of the ACCC's methodology raised in the inquiry and noted by the government senators included the fact that the ACCC did not take into account factors such as freight costs, conversion costs and discounts. Committee members observed that the survey was restricted and that its weightings were `unusual'.</para><para>In response to the ACCC report, the software industry produced its own evidence which showed that the alleged huge price differences did not in fact exist. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Business Software Alliance of Australia demonstrated that PC software prices in Australia are on average 22 per cent less than similar products in the United Kingdom, slightly less than those in New Zealand and only marginally more than those available in the US. Looking at computer games, an important and growing subsector of the digital content sector, an Access Economics study referred to by the Australian Visual Software Distributors Association demonstrated that 97 per cent of all computer game sales in 1998 showed that prices in the UK were 32 per cent higher than Australian prices and that US prices were only seven per cent cheaper. More recent evidence tendered by the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia on 2 August 2002 indicates that these comparisons relating to computer games still hold true.</para><para>So it is fairly clearâand even the government senators involved in the inquiry into parallel importation seemed to be swayed by this evidenceâthat this big bogeyman of higher software prices in Australia is nothing more than a fantasy to which the coalition has subscribed. So the answer to the first questionâwhether we are currently paying too muchâis an emphatic no. So, if there is no problem to begin with, the next question that must be asked is: will parallel importation reduce prices? The answer to this question is: probably not. There is no evidence to suggest that it will and plenty of evidence to say that it probably will not. Once again I quote the report of the Senate inquiry:</para><quote><para>Evidence provided by the music industry demonstrated that there are no consistently lower prices available for top selling CDs, and no evidence was provided to demonstrate that consumers of items other than popular music obtained any benefits at all from parallel importation.</para></quote><para>I remind the Senate that these were government senators making these observations. This inconsistency within the government only gets worse. In the case of software, it makes sense that prices will not be reduced, certainly at the top end of the market. Given that Australia's prices are relatively low, the industry points out that it would not be a commercially viable proposition to import the latest software at even lower prices into Australia. Of course, the viability may well be there if the software is pirated or if the software is dumped in Australia from undersold product or remainder stock from foreign markets. The software equivalents to `back-catalogue' CDs are older versions, not just old products. In other words, the only effect will be unmarketable leftovers of older versions of software products. This would include older products that may not work on newer operating systems or are no longer provided with technical support by vendors, a crucial element of software on sale, and Australian software firms will bear the blame and loss of reputation because of this impact. Indeed, I noted a story in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in which the PC Internet Professionals Association was quoted as saying: </para><quote><para>... you might get warehouses with thousands of educational games that are end of model run outs from America ...</para></quote><para>Meanwhile, the worthwhile softwareâthe new products and the latest versions keeping up with the latest hardwareâwill be unchanged. So the legislation put before us is basically pointless in this regard: it offers an ineffectual solution for a non-existent problem.</para><para>However, it is not so ephemeral on Australia's software and digital content industry. There is a fear that the effect of this bill will be quite negative. Australia's software and digital content industryâin particular our computer games industryâis a young, vibrant and competitive sector, one that has the potential to increase Australia's proportion of the massive global computer games market. We should be encouraging this. Unfortunately, the reality is that this government has barely thrown a bone to the sector. All of the hard work in encouraging this industry to take root in Australia has been done, in fact, by the state governments. I acknowledge in particular the work of the Victorian Labor government in promoting and supporting the computer games industry sector. I note that as recently as December last year the minister for information technology was waxing lyrical about the computer games industry, saying that the government supported it. On that point, I can see no tangible policies that give effect to that sentiment. </para><para>According to the Games Development Association of Australia, to give some of the credentials of this emerging and growing sector, the interactive computer games industry exported an estimated $60 million worth of products in 2001 and approximately $100 million worth of exports in 2002. It employs around 650 full-time artists, designers and producers in approximately 40 companies. Industry estimates predict that employment within the Australian games industry could reach 1,500 within five years as Australian developers win more of the estimated $20 billion spent globally each year on computer games.</para><para>This is the second piece of legislation that affects the computer games industry directly. The first related to classification, and this is another issue that has been raised by the industry in relation to this bill. Australia is one of the few countries that mandates a classification regime for computer games. To avoid being refused classification and/or banned in Australia, there are several games that have been modified to meet the appropriate classification levels. However, these modifications are on the CD or DVD itself, and often the packaged product looks exactly the same. So, under parallel importation, software could come into Australia as inappropriately classified or even as a version which would otherwise be prohibited, and consumersâ parents, children and whoeverâwill be none the wiser. When this happens, who will be blamed? It will be the software and computer games companies. They may be vulnerable to breaches of the classification regime, despite the fact that the legislation, if this bill is passed, will dictate that they are denied control to manage the classification of their games in the Australian market.</para><para>Now we come to the issue of intellectual property and copyright. The software and games industry have argued that parallel importation will increase the risk of importation of pirated material and that the pirated imports will undermine their market share. It is a fair point and we would expect the industry to say that. However, this raises the very big, vexed and controversial question of the copyright policies pursued particularly by global software and games companies, who are renowned for quite mercilessly pursuing stricter and stricter regimes to protect their market share around the worldâoften, it is argued, at the expense of diversity of products in the market or, as in the unproven view of the ACCC, at the expense of downward pressure on price. So without excusing the behaviour of these companies, I cannot blame the software development and digital content industry here in Australia for being concerned about their future. </para><para>The government has been inconsistent and even contradictory in its approach to intellectual property, and I think these confused messages are adding to the concern being expressed by many subsectors of the ICT sector, particularly the software and digital content producers. On the one hand, the government has given the industry every reason to believe that it is full on, strong and cares about protection of copyright in the software and digital copyright industries. For example, if you read the recent report of the Broadband Advisory Group, which the minister chaired, the government said on page 36, section 6.2:</para><quote><para>Market and technical uncertainties surrounding the management of digital rights are inhibiting content owners from making rich content available to broadband networks.</para></quote><para>The government is acknowledging the important role of digital rights and copyright protection for small business ventures in trying to put policies in place to stimulate a nascent industry. This is in fact the very issue that the Australian software and games sector has used as an argument against this bill. The government is contradicting its own view through the pursuance of this bill in the chamber. To further demonstrate the inconsistent approach by the government, the next section of the report advocates, in fact, a looser regime for the management of public sector IP. The government has a different view about how to manage IP having regard to whether it is the public or the private sector. In section 6.3 of the same report under the section titled `Access to Government Intellectual Property', it states:</para><quote><para>A more flexible approach for Government produced content designed for broadband platforms could provide greater incentives for repurposing the content for other users. For example, the Commonwealth would generally assert ownership of copyright on works that it funded, such as a piece of online education material. A more flexible approach may enable the developers of this material to repurpose it for overseas markets in addition to its original intent.</para></quote><para>These are all very worthy sentiments contained in this report and they are aimed at inspiring the local software and digital content industries. But, again, my point is that the government is contradicting itself and sending out multiple messages to the sector about IP. Depending on who the coalition are talking to, sometimes they identify IP and strong IP protection as an absolutely necessary element to push forward industry development and sometimesâlike we are seeing with this billâthey completely disregard those concerns and put forward a proposition of parallel importation that moves in the opposite direction. The industry has argued that that will have the direct effect of stifling growth and expansion of the industry. It is no wonder that people are confused.</para><para>Another twist is that the government has not even bothered to address recommendations made in the <inline font-style="italic">Cracking down on copycats</inline> reportâand of course that does not include some of the amendments that we are discussing today. But as my colleague Senator Ludwig said earlier, this response is certainly very weak. The lack of response by the government to those overarching recommendations about piracy apparently is because it has been stalled in the office of the very same minister who is saying all of these great things about how tight IP control should beâthat minister being Senator Alston. You can see we have a minister who must be just about writhing on the floor after endless policy twists in relation to IP.</para><para>The coalition does not know how to be consistent, because I do not believe they have thought it through. We are witnessing a government that is happy to legislate on the run, reacting to issues around IP, as they arise, with little clue about leadership, consistency and direction. It seems that it is the view of the latest interestâwhoever was making representations to the minister most recentlyâthat is presented in the government's legislative agenda or indeed its latest report. It is all over the place and I think that is very unfortunate. I hate to think what is going to happen with the Framework for the Future document, which I spoke about in this chamber the other evening, and what it is going to say about IP management. I will be looking for consistencyâor, indeed, a continuation of this government's record of inconsistency, which is I am sure what will be expressed. </para><para>It is clear to me that the local software and digital content industry is as good as any in the world, but I am concerned that this policy confusion will scare off investors who are happy to shop around jurisdictions for a country they perceive to be the most favourable in policy terms for domiciling games and other software production. My concern is that these investors will view Australia as a country that, at best, has inconsistent policies on IP management of software and digital content and, at worst, does not do anything to support the growth of software development.</para><para>This bill places a black mark on Australia's credentials as a place for investment by investors who make games and other software development possible. You can add to that the Luddite image of the minister responsible and his disparaging attitude over time to the games industry as a driver of broadband, and some negligence, I think, in promoting broadband, which is a key element in the promotion of the software and digital content sectors. Who can forget his notorious comments that the only reason people want broadband is because they want to play games on it, citing South Korea as an example, and asking why Australia should bother installing and investing in broadband networks. I believe Australia's software industry has a huge future but, at this stage, it should not be left on the hillside to fend for itself, like a Spartan baby. For these reasons, I am sorry that the Democrats have decided to support this aspect of the bill. Clearly, it will offer no legitimate benefit to consumers and it will create a great deal of IP uncertainty around a tremendous Australian industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10390</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to have my speech in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1509">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002 </inline>incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>I rise today to speak to the Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill. In doing so I wish to raise with the Senate a number of serious concerns I have with this piece of legislation.</para><para>The particular Bill in front of us today represents nothing more than this government's blind obsession with fulfilling its ideological agenda. </para><para>The first example of this is an obvious one and that is a desire to deregulate any and every industry it can. The second is to remove any protection afforded to Australian intellectual culture and to the country's artists who enrich it. </para><para>For most Australians, culture means so much more than cricket and football. Australians are large consumers of intellectual and artistic works and most believe them to be worthy of Government protection. </para><para>In light of this, the question has to be askedâ</para><para>Why is the Government pursuing this legislation? </para><para>Is there evidence to suggest that competition in the industries the bill targets is either poor or non-existent and in need of a decent shake-up? </para><para>Well, this is precisely the viewpoint the Government would like to have us believe, and it is intent on trying to prove it, no matter how distorted facts and figures need to be to do so. </para><para>The Bill before the Senate proposes to amend the Copyright Act of 1968 to enable the legal parallel importation and subsequent commercial distribution of books; computer software products, including interactive computer games; periodical publications (such as journals and magazines); and sheet music.</para><para>Legal parallel importation was first introduced in to Australia in 1991 by the passage of the Keating Labor Government's Copyright Amendment Bill 1990. </para><para>The intention of the Bill was to allow the commercial importation, without infringement of an owner's copyright, of non-pirate copies of books first published overseas, non-pirate copies of books published in Australia or overseas where they could not be supplied within 90 days of an order being placed and non-pirate copies of books intended for private use.  </para><para>In addition, the Bill provided that the copyright in a foreign book would be retained if the book was published in Australia within 30 days of its first publication abroad.</para><para>The result of the subsequent law saw the ensured availability of a wide range of titles and a competitive industry, but at the same time a protected Australian industry and also protected Australian jobs. </para><para>The Keating Government's Copyright amendment ensured that Australians would have access to a global media market, but at the same time, the provisions of the bill protected and encouraged Australian businesses to provide Australians access to it. </para><para>Under the current regime, local businesses have 30 or 90 days (in most circumstances) to provide Australian consumers with access to a particular title before that opportunity is granted to foreign interests. </para><para>In 1998, the current federal government amended the Copyright Act so as to allow for the legal parallel importation and sale of legitimate copies of sound recordings, namely CDs, with no 30 or 90-day rules attached.</para><para>In considering the current proposal before us today, which aims to extend a similar regime across a number of other industries, it is important that we look at the outcomes experienced by both consumers and the Australian industry involved following the 1998 decision and subsequent law. </para><para>Unfortunately, the first thing to note in this regard, is that no official government-sponsored inquiry of any depth or substance has been held in to the Australian sound recording industry to analyse the changes made by the 1998 decision. </para><para>An inquiry of this sort would have been of great benefit when considering this amendment and unfortunately without it we are left with no basis to compare the alleged benefits supposedly inevitable with the passage of this bill with any actual outcomes experienced so far.</para><para>Without a proper inquiry and evidence, we are left with only hearsay on which to base our judgements. </para><para>To this end, and with little tested evidence, widespread opinion would have it that parallel importation of CDs has not led to substantially lower prices for consumers as promised or greater variety. </para><para>Rather the practice is widely recognised to have led to a massive increase in piracy and therefore to an attack on the legitimate entitlements of the Australian music industry.</para><para>Moreover, it has led to diminished investment in Australian music artistry.</para><para>Piracy is a practice that undermines the global media industry. Its effects are certainly not limited to the music industry. In deed, it is probably the number one issue affecting publishing and multimedia distribution industries of all sorts around the world as well as affecting the rights and incomes of artists and copyright owners.</para><para>Piracy is costing and undermining publishers, it is costing and undermining the work of authors and artists, it costs jobs and it is also costing consumers heavily. </para><para>Invariably, costs associated with a company's loss of income to piracy are recouped through industrial downsizing, a curb on innovation and also through consumers being charged higher prices for outputs at the checkout. </para><para>Piracy is âcompetitionsâ biggest enemy and the enemy of lower priced goods for consumers. </para><para>Numerous machines with the ability to recreate music and computer software products to perfection or close-to have been commercially available at reasonably low cost to the consumer for some time. With the ever-improving nature of the technology, these machines will become easier and cheaper to buy and use, they will be technologically better equipped, and will therefore become a problem of greater and greater magnitude in to the future. </para><para>The ease with which imitation outputs have been being produced and will continue to be created and distributed throughout society is remarkable. Costs to the industries usurped by pirated material are enormous. </para><para>A 1999 study by the Business Software Association of Australia revealed that Australian distributors and retailers lose $269 million per year through piracy alone and that a drop in piracy to the US level would mean the creation of 7,000 additional jobs and add $1 billion to the Australian economy.</para><para>A lack of policing of multimedia industries is certainly another factor contributing to the rise of piracy. It is an area of policing that the Government needs to improve upon, regardless of the outcome of this particular bill, in order to protect the integrity of copyright law and all laws governing production and distribution and to also protect the rights of those in our community that endeavour to make a living out of cultural production.</para><para>In 2001, the Senate referred this particular Bill to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. </para><para>I must note that I have some serious concerns with the manner in which the Senate Inquiry around this Bill was undertaken.</para><para>Three public hearings were held in Melbourne and Sydney and many of the individuals and organisations that appeared before the committee noted that they had to keep their comments brief because of the tight time they had been allotted before the Committee. </para><para>Contrast this with the previous inquiry into parallel importation for music CDs that was referred to the Committee on 2nd December 1997 for an inquiry and report by 1st April 1998. This inquiry into only the music industry, held seven public hearings in three cities, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.</para><para>It is far from satisfactory that such an important inquiry into such sizeable changes of these important and convoluted industries could be conducted so quickly. </para><para>It is totally inadequate to expect members of the Senate to vote to make such significant changes to these industries with such little consideration. </para><para>It's granted that these changes have been mooted for some time now, but with a lack of real critical analysis of it is simply unreasonable to vote to implement them with a slim hope that benefits could follow.</para><para>In it's report to the Senate, the Government controlled Committee noted that there was possibly too much dependence on the ACCC for data.</para><para>But of serious concern is the fact that the ACCC's data was challenged by other submissions and organisations involved with the committee and found to be flawed. </para><para>Sample data was either very old, too narrow, averaged over too long a period of time or gathered from unreliable sources, as just some of the concerns.</para><para>In light of this it is of even more concern that the Government itself has been so heavily reliant upon the data provided by the ACCC as the basis to its argument for the need for this legislative change. This reliance is demonstrated quite clearly by the use of the ACCC's evidence in the Explanatory Memorandum to justify acceptance or rejection of various options.</para><para>Doubling up on this flawed data is also another problem noted by the Committee, particularly with respect to it being used in the Explanatory Memorandum. </para><para>Reference is made, for example, to the fact thatâ</para><para>âThe Prices Surveillance Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have both recommended this course of action as the only means to ensure genuine competitionâ. </para><para>The Prices Surveillance Authority report referred to was undertaken in 1992. </para><para>It must be noted that the ACCC was formed in 1995 with the merger of the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission, which were both previously chaired by Professor Fels, who is now the Chairman of the ACCC. </para><para>The Government's Explanatory Memorandum attached to this bill suggests in no uncertain terms that the two bodies, with supposedly no connection or common thread have come to the very same conclusion. </para><para>This kind of misleading statement is something we have become accustomed to from this Government. </para><para>Trickery, it seems, is its forte. </para><para>While that might be, I find it a very sad state of affairs. </para><para>Apart from the Australian Consumers' Association, which was heavily dependent upon data from the ACCC to form its support for the bill before us today, the remaining organisation that indicated support for the proposed amendments was the National Machine Operators Association, who declared to the Senate Committee that it based its decision to support the current Bill almost solely on the research conducted by the ACCC as well. </para><para>The three organisations supporting the bill all substantially relied on out of date and potentially flawed ACCC data.</para><para>The Australian Visual Software Developers Association and the Business Software Association of Australia solidly dispute the ACCC's assertions made to the Senate Committee. </para><para>AVSDA provided evidence of an Access Economics report that showed that in 1998, prices for games software were 32% higher in the UK than in Australia and only 7% lower than in the US. </para><para>AVSDA also questioned the validity of the ACCC report that stated that computer games were, quote `on average 33 per cent higher than in the US', unquote, based on a comparison of 9 titles. The Access Economics report stated that the ACCC's comparison is âbadly flawed and should not be relied uponâ. </para><para>The BSAA commissioned its own software prices survey which tracked every advertised price of more than 60 leading software programs from nine vendors over a two month period from October 2000 to December 2000.  </para><para>The Pricing Survey found that business PC software prices in Australia are, on average, 22 per cent lower than the same products in the UK and 2 per cent lower than in New Zealand. </para><para>It found that Australian prices were 3.54 per cent higher than average prices in the USA, but this did not include USA State sales tax where this applies. </para><para>Although some differentials were found, these often related to programs where there were adaptations or modifications necessary to customise them for the Australian market, such as Computer Aided Design Software. </para><para>On average however, across a wide range of leading products, Australian software is priced lower than in comparable markets, and is on par with the USA, a market that does not have to bear export costs.</para><para>Mr John Stonier, the dissenting member of the Government's Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee, which submitted its final report on 30 September 2000, concluded:</para><para>âIt is not clear that parallel import provisions restrict the competitive process, or that the costs of such restrictions exceed the benefits. It is also not clear that there are alternative cost-effective means of achieving the same goals.</para><para>âThis conclusion is particularly true for the book industry in Australia. </para><para>âThere are over 250 publishers employing more than 4000 people. </para><para>âIn 1997-98 they sold more than 110 million books, of which 60 per cent were Australian and published nearly 7000 new Australian titles. </para><para>âSales exceeded $1000 million, of which more than $100 million were exported, mainly to the United States ($40 million), New Zealand ($25 million) and the United Kingdom ($17 million)â. </para><para>According to Mr Stonier, âthese figures are consistent with Australia having a thriving and competitive industry. They are also consistent with the view that parallel imports are not impeding or restraining the competitive processâ.</para><para>The Text Publishing Company submitted that the 30-day rule has created an impetus for publishers to price their books competitively relative to overseas prices because it allows for the constant, daily possibility of the market opening. </para><para>The Text Publishing Company asserted that the 30-day rule has caused the market to behave as though it were already open while at the same time providing traditional territorial copyright to Australian publishers. </para><para>Additionally, the Australian Publishers' Association also supports the current 30-day and 90-day legislation. </para><para>The organisation supported it at its introduction in 1991 because it reinforced territorial copyright, which it believes underpins investment in copyright material and investment in publishing in the country. </para><para>This was the intention of the Keating Government's 1990 Copyright amendment bill and it has delivered the intended results. It sought availability of titles and competition, but a protected competition that encouraged local investment rather than a dog-eat-dog industry where little benefits would be passed on to the wider community.</para><para>A number of organisations told the Committee that the removal of the current parallel importation restrictions would result in the decline of Australia's publishing printing industries. </para><para>The Printing Industries Association of Australia stated that in discussions it had had with major Australian book printers, it assessed, that with the passage of this Bill the Australian book production industry would lose in the order of $35 million and also the loss of around $13 million in the paper production industry. </para><para>The PIAA estimates that the impact of these losses would be largely felt in regional areas of Australia, most notably, in Maryborough in my state of Victoria, in Adelaide and in parts of Tasmania where paper is currently produced.</para><para>Australian publishing does not operate in a global market the way music does. </para><para>Australia is one of four major English language publishers alongside the UK, the US, and Canadaâall of whom protect territorial copyright. </para><para>The Australian Society of Authors put it to the Senate Committee that no other jurisdiction with a market of significance other than Australia intends to make the same changes contained in this bill in relation to parallel importing for their book industries. </para><para>International governments like those in the US and UK understand the need to nurture and protect their local cultural industries and as such they are committed to import restriction arrangements and they also show no sign of liberalising their own industries. </para><para>In light of the protection afforded to these industries by governments such as the US and UK, the Australian government's decision to open our industries up to international competition is simply unnecessary, is out of step, and shows complete disregard for the artists and businesses striving to make a living out of these industries in Australia. </para><para>We in the Labor Party are extremely concerned that there has been no consideration whatsoever of the impact the successful passage of this Bill would have on Australian authors, Australian cultural identity and the choices Australian consumers will have, if unrestricted parallel importation is introduced into the Australian book industry.</para><para>The Australian Society of Authors (ASA) argued that the Bill would lead to the dumping in Australia of surplus books from overseas and to lower or removed royalties from them to Australian authors. </para><para>The ASA said there would be little incentive for local publishers to promote Australian authors when their investment could be undermined by imports dumped from overseas. </para><para>The ASA stated that if territorial copyright was abolished then Australian authors would have no choice but to sell their property to publishers overseas and then have their work imported back into Australia.</para><para>The Australian Publishers' Association accepts that the price of some titles would reduce without parallel importation restrictions, however these would be notably imports of titles that are remainders, overstocks and overruns in overseas territories. It argued to the Senate Committee that this âadvantageâ to consumers does not outweigh the cost to the local industry.</para><para>In accordance with the inter-governmental Competition Principles Agreement, legislation that restricts competition should only be retained where it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the restriction to the community as a whole exceed the costs, and the objective of the legislation can only be achieved by restricting competition. </para><para>In my opinion, the multimedia industry is a prime example of the need to restrict total competition in order to gain better outcomes for the Australian community as a whole.</para><para>As former Senator Cooney noted in his additional comments to Labor's dissenting report from the Legal and Constitutional Committee, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is an institution essential to the welfare of the Nation. But its functions do not include the guardianship of the people's cultural, social or spiritual life. Parliament must ensure that in performing its vital task on their behalf the Commission does not prejudice their soul and spirit. Accordingly parliament should not pass this legislation in its present form.</para><para>At the end of the day, much of the evidence in support of the Bill provided to the Senate Committee was inconclusive. In fact much of the evidence was highly questionable at best, or at worst was a blatant distortion of reality. It certainly has failed to prove to me, the serious need for passing this legislation.</para><para>The four organisations and three submissions supporting the Bill's passage, among the 13 advocating the Bill's rejection, relied on flawed ACCC research to come to those conclusions. </para><para>The Government is intent on trying to prove that these industries are anti-competitive, however its evidence in support of this, when tested against real intellectual scrutiny and inquiry, simply don't add up.</para><para>What is needed to help drive down prices on consumers is a more focussed attempt to wipe out piracy. Government commitment to this end would lift a huge economic burden on businesses and would enable them to concentrate spending on innovation, investment and jobs and at the same time drive down already competitive prices on outputs.</para><para>This Bill is a poor attempt to deal with the printing, publishing and software industries and as such it should be rejected.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>10394</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>10394</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>10394</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence and Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Obviously, as I said yesterday, Australia will want to play a part in the reconstruction of Iraq, and Australia does have a good performance record in relation to a number of the sectors that will be in particular demand in the task of reconstructing Iraq. If I think particularly of the agricultural sector, dryland farming is an area of expertise of the Australian agricultural community and I am sure that Australia has significant expertise that could be brought to bear in that sector, to the benefit primarily of the Iraqi people and perhaps with some incidental benefit to the Australian suppliers.

Is the Howard government concerned about the precedent set by this substantial contract to a company closely and controversially linked to US Vice-President Cheney?

If under US law contracts that are paid for through US government aid have to be given to US companies, then, obviously, an Australian company is not going to have that opportunity. That does not mean that there will not be a whole range of other economic opportunities associated with the primary task of reconstructing and rebuilding Iraq. In relation to Halliburton, it is a highly-regarded international company and is highly respected.

Australian special forces continue their strategic reconnaissance operations deep within Iraq. Our FA18s continue to fly defensive counter air patrols without incident, although some missions were not conducted because of the appalling weather. The weather has also disrupted the activities of the Navy clearance divers, but we anticipate that the crucial port of Umm Qasr will be open to humanitarian supplies very soon. Our Navy is playing a critical role in ensuring the safety of the vessels that will shortly begin providing humanitarian relief, including 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat, to the Iraqi people. Our C130 and P3 reconnaissance aircraft and other force elements continue with their important tasks.</para></talk.start><para>Overall we remain satisfied with the progress of the coalition campaign. The government and our coalition partners have emphasised that we never expected the disarmament of Iraq to be accomplished easily or without cost. Unfortunately, poor weather, some friendly and civilian casualties and occasional tactical setbacks are part and parcel of war. Tragically, many of these seems to have resulted from Iraqi practices inconsistent with the laws of armed conflict, including location of military assets close to civilians, feigned surrenders and the use of paramilitary in civilian dress to attack Iraqi civilians and coalition forces. But, of course, such behaviour from this regime should come as no surprise. It does not, however, threaten the success of the campaign; it merely strengthens our resolve. </para><para>The outlook on the ground is positive. In the south, coalition forces continue to consolidate their hold in Umm Qasr and around the key city of Basra. The coalition have also made significant gains in stabilising the situation in the west and north. Humanitarian supplies are already flowing into Iraq. Coalition forces are nearing Baghdad, having moved over 300 kilometres in fewer than five days. The advice we have is that the poor weather has enabled our forces to consolidate their positions and communications and to make any necessary adjustments in preparation for the move against Baghdad. Republican Guard units outside Baghdad are under heavy and sustained air attack, despite the poor weather. According to the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Myers, coalition aircraft flew nearly 1,000 sorties over Iraq on 24 March, most of them against Republican Guard forces.</para><para>Our forces have encountered Iraqi soldiers who are deserting and only want to return home. When we have encountered such soldiers, we have allowed them to do so. Despite the heavy damage inflicted on the Iraqi military, we should be in no doubt that the campaign is entering a new, more difficult and dangerous phase.

That is obviously yet to be determined, although the Prime Minister has indicated, and I said in the Senate the day before yesterday, that we do not intend to be part of any broadscale defence operation by a peacekeeping force.

There is no doubt that advanced technologies have revolutionised military conflict, ever since the Gulf War in 1991. No-one welcomes military conflict at any time. However, in the case of the current action in Iraq, such conflict is necessary to ensure that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are eradicated.</para></talk.start><para>It is worth noting that a number of highly advanced Australian manufactured or developed technologies are playing a significant role in the current military conflict. These technologies demonstrate the capabilities and the efficiency of Australia's defence industries, as well as the close links between defence and information and communications technologies. For example, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline> is playing a key role in the conflict by engaging a number of enemy targets, including enemy bunkers, artillery positions and coastal defensive positions. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline> was manufactured in Australia by Transfield and Tenix. Its main armament is a forward-mounted five-inch gun that utilises ammunition manufactured by Australian Defence Industries and is controlled by combat system software developed by Saab Systems. Reports indicate that, using this system, all targets have been successfully engaged. The effectiveness of this weaponry system has earned the praise of British commandos.</para><para>The Nulka active missile decoy system is playing an important role in the gulf in ensuring the safety of Australia's service men and women. The Nulka is a world-leading missile defence system that is highly effective in decoying anti-ship missiles. The Nulka propulsive unit and its launchers and fire control systems were all manufactured by BAE Systems Australia, while ADI Mulwala assembled the units. The original Nulka system was developed by DSTO and that led to a co-development by the US and Australian industries, with BAE as the current Australian partner. As senators know, the safety of the deep port of Umm Qasr is crucial in ensuring access for the humanitarian effort to assist the Iraqi population. De-mining of the port is a potentially critical part of securing Umm Qasr, and Australia's troops have the capacity to assist in this work. This involves highly dangerous underwater diving. Part of the equipment that can be used in this work is a diver recall device, developed by ADI, that is used to communicate with submerged divers.</para><para>The CH-47 Chinook helicopters are also playing an important role in the gulf. Numerous Australian companies provided rapid and invaluable assistance in their preparation. Helitech of Brisbane and Craig Ballistics Industries on the Gold Coast developed and manufactured ballistic protectionâin layman's terms, bullet-proofingâfor the Chinooks. Hunter Aerospace in Townsville fitted and integrated key modifications to the Chinooks to ensure that they were fully adapted for operations in the Middle East. Tasman Engineering in Brisbane rapidly manufactured stands to allow the Chinooks to be deployed inside strategic lift aircraft. Australia's FA-18s, which are playing a crucial role in highly targeted bombing raids in Iraq, were originally assembled in Australia, and upgrades to them have been undertaken in Australia by Boeing.</para><para>Finally, I am sure that senators appreciate the massive logistics and supply effort involved in a campaign the size of the current action. Mincom, an Australian information technology company based in Brisbane, is recognised internationally as a world leader in this area, as well as in the area of mining software. Sixty per cent of Mincom's production is exported. In the current conflict, Mincom is providing the main transactional system for defence supply through its standard defence supply system, which is electronically taking care of our Defence Force supply needs. The vast majority of Australians hope and pray that the current military action is both swift and successful. Our thoughts are with our defence men and women who are in the gulf, and their families back in Australia. There is no doubt that their ultimate success will be, to a not insignificant extent, due to Australia's innovative and highly advanced defence technology industries. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>10398</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>10398</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence and the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Iraqi water engineers and staff of the ICRC have partially restarted Basra's main water pumping facility. The ICRC estimates that 50 per cent of the city's approximately 1.5 million inhabitants now have access to drinking water. The coalition forces have started to repair the water treatment plant near Basra. The pipeline, which provides 2.4 million litres of water per day to Umm Qasr, will be operational by 30 March.

In that light, it was interesting to note that when coalition forces entered an-Nasiriyah they found a hospital that had been used as a paramilitary headquarters staging and storage area. Interestingly, within the hospital were contained some 200 weapons, Iraqi military uniforms and a tank. That is of interest, but I want to particularly point out that in addition there were found within the hospital 3,000 chemical protective suits and nerve agent antidote injectors. That is further evidence, if Senator Bartlett needs itâmost of the world already accepts itâthat Saddam Hussein not only has the weapons of which Senator Bartlett speaks but has used them in the past and will be prepared to use them again.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10399</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question in relation to the use of weaponry in Iraq.

We would wish to see no deaths of coalition personnel doing such an important task as ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction.

In contrast with past conflicts, the extent to which civilian casualties have been avoided has been a remarkable and outstanding achievement.

A couple of days ago, I advised honourable senators of the security arrangements in place at major airports since November last year. I thank Senator Heffernan for raising this question again. It allows me to focus on the maritime areas, and I know Senator Heffernan, being a regional senator, will also be interested in how increased security measures will impact upon regional airports. I am advised that no intelligence has been received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia. Should any information become available to the government requiring a change to the threat levels, the public will be advised and appropriate additional security measures will be put in place.</para></talk.start><para>In the maritime area, we supported the December 2002 International Maritime Organisation's action to strengthen international maritime security arrangements, including the new IMO International Ship and Port Security Code, and we are moving to implement the new arrangements as a priority. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has taken the lead role on progressing the requirements of the IMO's ship and port facility security code to ensure that our maritime sector is well prepared for, and protected from, terrorist threats. This code will apply to approximately 300 facilities at about 70 ports in Australia and also to Australian flag ships involved in international trade as defined by the code. I am confident that Australia will be compliant with that code by the target date of 1 July 2004, if not before.</para><para>At the major ports in Australia we have a range of preventative security measures in place, such as access control, identity passes, closed-circuit TV, passenger and baggage screening for international cruise ships, and increased security patrols. Physical security measures at Australian ports are the responsibility of port owners. The majority of Australian ports, as honourable senators will know, are owned by state and territory governments, and many of them have been corporatised. There has been considerable liaison, consultation and cooperation between the states, the Commonwealth and the maritime industry over the last 14 months, and I anticipate that this will continue. The Australian Customs Service conducts immigration checks of incoming crews, screens containers for illicit drugs and guns, and also checks on quarantine matters and anything else that might be a threat to Australia's national security.

I presume Senator Murphy is referring to the Senate inquiry into Fairfax. As I recall, the stakes got quite high at one stage because the Labor Party refused to make a public servant available and Senator Kernot refused to join us in having him put in jail or at least incarcerated in this building. I think we concluded at that time that it would have been appropriate for the Treasurer, or at least the FIRB, in making a decision as to whether a takeover was in the national interest, to provide reasons. The government of the day of course rejected that proposal and it has not since been resurrected, to my knowledge.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In many ways, judgments on these issues depend on particular circumstances. If the Treasurer of the day is sufficiently forthcoming and the reasons are understood then people do not question the quality of the decision. If you take the Woodside decision, I think most people understood the basis on which that decision was arrived. If, however, you have someone like Mr Keatingâwho used to play politics with media issues for a living and introduced cross-media, with malice; we all know why Keating introduced the cross-media rule; it has been documented exhaustivelyâputting political considerations ahead of sensible policy issues, it is understandable that an opposition of the dayâand we are talking about 1994, I supposeâwould have felt that it was important that that Treasurer gave reasons. If you see it in that context, you will find that, since we have been in government, on the very few occasions when decisions in relation to foreign investment needed to be made and announced by the Treasurer, the circumstances that justified that decision have been well and truly understood and appreciated by the Australian community. Therefore, it has not been necessary to pursue that request to provide reasons.

Of course, there are plenty of forums in which these matters can be explored and it is perfectly open to Senator Murphy and many others to seek to pursue the climate in which those decisions are taken, but I do not think I have heard it raised in the last seven years as a matter that has required attention.

The Howard government has been very concerned about the longer term effects of bushfires and drought on regional Australia and that is why we have acted to try to minimise the damage caused. Earlier this month, the government announced a cash grants program of $3,000 through the Small Business Bushfire Relief Program for small businesses and farmers impacted by the recent bushfires, such as those in New South Wales, Victoria and here in the Australian Capital Territoryâwhich is of particular concern to Senator Humphries. The program is aimed at assisting small businesses, including farmers and tourism operators, who are most impacted by the recent bushfires. The assistance will be provided through grants of $3,000 to small businesses who are in most need of assistance, who can show that they have fewer than 20 full-time equivalent employees and who either incurred additional expenses or suffered a loss of income as a result of these bushfires. In addition, grants of $10,000 may be available for extreme cases.</para></talk.start><para>The grants can be used by small businesses to meet any additional expenses and/or lost income, such as retaining staff and meeting repayments for loans or leases on capital stock. Program funding of $2 million is available. Applications will be assessed and those businesses most affected will receive support. Any business that feels they may be eligible for this assistance should register their interest by ringing the AusIndustry hotline on 132846 as soon as possible as registrations close tomorrow. I urge all small businesses who have been affected to make that call as soon as possible. Small businesses are also, for the first time, able to apply for drought relief. The federal government's $500 million relief package includes support for regional small businesses significantly affected by the drought. In addition, special consideration will be given to regional tourism ventures affected by bushfires and drought for financial assistance through the federal government's $8 million Regional Tourism Program. </para><para>But that is not all the government is doing. The government has launched a new campaign called See Australia to help bush communities recover from drought and bushfires by encouraging the return of tourists and sending a message that these bush communities are once again open for business. The campaign includes a television advertisement featuring Ernie Dingo and, with the support of commercial television networks, the advertisement is running as a community service announcement. This campaign is to send a message that these tourist spots are open for business, particularly during Easter, and that many public areas were left relatively undamaged or are already recovering. If every Australian spent just $10 extra on one more night away on a See Australia short break each year, domestic tourism expenditure would increase by 20 per cent and boost the economy, particularly in regional Australia, by a staggering $10.27 billion per year.

I am happy to table that and incorporate into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>the breakdown, which I understand to be for the Queensland area. That might be of particular interest to the senator. I add that I have received advice on what the minister said in the chamber yesterday, which was that, if an organisation puts up a request for funding, we will look at it seriously. I would make it clear that he was not saying that he was opening a new program. This was simply a continuation of the open door policy, whereby an organisation which feels it is underfunded can come and make a case.

The question asked yesterday of Senator Vanstone related to:</para><quote><para>... the tragic abuse of women and children under the Iraqi regime of Saddam Husseinâ</para></quote><para>andâ</para><quote><para>... how this abuse has impacted on the views of the Australian Muslim and Iraqi communities in relation to the war.</para></quote><para>That was the question, as stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. The answer started out by addressing that question but quickly turned into a response which related to the Labor Party and, by way of interjection from the senator's side, continued to relate to the Labor Party. In your statement you have touched on a very important issue: human rights is a significant issue. As a member of the Labor Party, I am proud that my party has played a significant role in standing up for human rights internationally. I know that Senator Bartlett took a point of order yesterday and acknowledged that that is true of the Democrats and of the Greens and others in this chamber, and it is true of some members, too, of the Liberal Party. I have a political argument with the Liberal Party about their attitude to human rights, but that is for political debate. But I believeâand I said it perhaps less elegantly than I would have liked in my point of order yesterdayâthat to impugn our commitment to human rights is deeply offensive. While the phrase used by Senator Vanstone was: </para><quote><para>At least one Labor MP recognises the evil of the Hussein regimeâ</para></quote><para>after rehearsing some of the more horrendous abuses of human rights in that country, it leaves reasonably open to the impartial observer that other members of the Labor Party do not. I think that that is a totally inappropriate and totally inaccurate reflection on our motives.</para><para>The other thing about thisâthis is a point that I have raised before and I do not wish to push it now, but I make it as a comment in passing, by way of an observationâis that part of the problem here seems to me to be that the question asked by Senator Barnett was a fair enough question and the initial answer given by Senator Vanstone was a fair enough answer but it very quickly degenerated into party political abuse. The standing orders provide that in answering a question during question time a minister shall not debate it. What began to emerge was that, having made a substantial pointâand a point that I agree with Senator Vanstone about: torture and other evils are inflicted on Iraqi people by Saddam Husseinâthen turning it as a political argument is in fact to debate the question, and she is out of order in doing so.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âDo you now concede you got it wrong?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âI did not get it wrongâ through you, Mr President.

I am sure Senator Ian Campbell is tearing his hair out in frustration at this very moment, but I do think it is appropriate to speak briefly on your statement, given that I was the one that raised the point of order that your statement relates to. I do support your statement. I am certainly not one who gets particularly fussy about not showing some latitude in the interpretation of standing orders and what people are allowed to say. If anything, we have probably been a bit too strict in what we determine to be unparliamentary. I give as an example Senator Brown's ultimate expulsion from this place a week or two back for what I thought was a pretty mild remark that had been used many times before in this chamber. This is not dissenting from the ruling but just indicating that most times before nobody felt the need to take a point of order. So in the general sense of free debate I personally generally err on the side of letting things goâapart from the fact that drawing attention to critical remarks often gives them greater weight than just ignoring them.</para></talk.start><para>So I think it is pretty rare for me to take points of order. But I did so yesterday because it is a bit of a common and repeated practice by some, particularly ministers, to start to imply in their answers to those sorts of questions that the government senators are the only ones that actually care about these human rights abuses. That is a very strong implication that has been made repeatedly, and it was clearly there in Senator Vanstone's answer, which was a premeditated answer. I would point out that, in addition to the remark that the President has looked at, I do not know if subsequent comments were in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but certainly at one stage as part of saying that she was not impugning people's motives Senator Vanstone said `at least one but there could be more', which I think again very strongly implies, if not directly states, that it is not applicable to all members of the Labor Party. In one sense, I should not be worrying about whether or not members of the Labor Party are having their motives impugned, but these sorts of things are obviously meant to refer to everybody who takes a different view from the government on this war. </para><para>I also raised the point of order because I do thinkâas I have said once before in this chamber, and I think Senator Santoro said something similarâthat we need to be a bit careful in the debate about the war that we do not get too divisive. It is obviously an emotive topic and people have strong opinions. The Democrats, amongst others, have continued to urge people to express those opinions strongly, but we do need to be mindful, at least, of the tone of the criticisms and the potential long-term social divisiveness that can arise from it. Vietnam taught us something about the dangers of that as well. We do need to be, as much as possible, trying to conduct that debate in a way that will not enhance further social divisions. All of us err a bit on that from time to time, me included. It is almost an impossibility to be strongly critical of an action such as the one the government has taken in going to war without getting personal about it, because it is such a major decision.</para><para>Nonetheless, I think the content of the President's statement is important and I wanted to note it and speak to it in part to encourage the President to keep urging us to be mindful of these things. I am sure he has a difficult job trying to keep the Senate under control, particularly during question time. As I said, I am not one for being particularly fussy with comments et cetera most of the time, but I do think that in that sort of area, when it is an emotional and potentially divisive debate, I would tend to agree that it may be desirable for the President to be a bit stricter in applying that rule. For the record, the relevant standing order, standing order 193(3), states:</para><quote><para>A senator shall not use offensive words ... all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.</para></quote><para>The use of the term `highly disorderly' is an indication that it is not an appropriate thing to do. As I say, normally it would not bother me but I think in divisive debates on divisive issues it is probably important to be a bit more cautious. So the Democrats welcome the President's statement and we lend him our support in his ongoing task to try and continue to encourage us all to be mindful of such matters.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>10411</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Support for Families</title><page.no>10411</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>10411</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator McLucas today relating to funding for the Lifeline counselling services and assistance to Defence families.</para></motion><para>Senator Vanstone has two ways of answering questions from the opposition parties in this chamber. Her first approach is to bluster and hurl abuse and make inferences about the motives of members of other parties. We saw a classic example of that yesterday. It was Senator Vanstone's stellar performance in, on that occasion, taking a dorothy dix question from one of her own side and, as Senator Cook has so eloquently just pointed out, very quickly turning it into a tirade of abuse against the Labor Party. No matter what is said by other coalition ministers in trying to defend Senator Vanstone's actions, everyone knows what she was doing yesterday. It was, frankly, an absolutely disgraceful performance.</para><para>The other method that Senator Vanstone uses to answer a question is to actually not answer it at all but take it on notice and say, `Look, I don't really know much about this,' `It's not my area,' or `I haven't been briefed,' and `I'll get back to you.' We saw a classic illustration of the second method today. Senator Vanstone was asked a question by Senator McLucas regarding serious concerns raised by the Lifeline organisation in Townsville about the substantial increase in demand for counselling services placed upon that voluntary organisation. That increase in demand has occurred in Townsville, a town which has a substantial Army population. Obviously, there are a lot of families in that town who are very concerned about their loved ones who are on active duty in Iraq. </para><para>Senator VanstoneâI have to give her creditâimmediately answered that she was unaware of the situation and that she would look into it and discuss it with her colleague in the other place. That demonstrates that when it gets down to the actual policy work and the duties of a minister of this government representing another minister in another place, as well as looking after her own portfolio responsibilities, Senator Vanstone does not measure up to the mark. She should have known about this issue, because it was raised in the House of Representatives at question time yesterday. A question was asked in the House of Representatives yesterday regarding this very issue. Senator McLucas picked up on the question and answers provided in the other place and asked further questions of Senator Vanstone.</para><para>Furthermore, if Senator Vanstone has a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings in the House of Representatives yesterday, she will see that after question time the Prime Minister came back and put down an additional response to the answer given by, I think, Minister Anthony during question time. One has to seriously question whether this minister is even interested in these issues. Why didn't she know about this? Why did she have to say, `I don't know anything about it; I will come back to you'? Of course, right after question time the minister stood up and said, `I now have the answer or some information in response to your question.' It was provided as quickly as thatâby the end of question timeâwhich demonstrated that a brief was prepared somewhere in the government and it was very quickly supplied to Senator Vanstone. Frankly, Senator Vanstone, in most of her performances in this parliament, reminds me of Falstaff in <inline font-style="italic">Henry IV</inline>âbumbling around a battlefield and claiming credit for victories.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>âThere is a person talking in a glass house.

She is a woman who is in support of families and children. Senator Forshaw's allegations are totally untrue. They impugn the minister's character and her ability to do the job. They are absolutely outrageous allegations and they are unfounded to the nth degree. I asked that question of the minister yesterday. I asked about the abuse of women and children in Iraq and the impact that that had on the Muslim and Iraqi communities here in Australia. Her answer was comprehensive, carefully constructed and well thought through. She outlined the terrible abuses of women and children that were going on in Iraq. She also outlined the communities here in Australia that were concerned about abuses in Iraq: the Muslim and Iraqi communities. She referred to a particular Labor member of state parliament who was equally concerned and was standing up for those communities and wanting to express support for the people of Iraq. That is what we stand here to support.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister has shown courage and commitment not only to the people of Australia but also to the people of Iraq. That is why we are part of the coalition. The amount of effort that we have put into humanitarian aid for the Iraqi people is significant. I will mention some efforts that are being made. We welcome the UN Secretary-General's call for unity in the Security Council, particularly regarding resumption of the oil-for-food program. Our Navy divers in the Iraqi arena are making safe Umm Qasr port to enable aid deliveries. We expect two ships carrying Australian wheat to berth at Umm Qasr port this weekend. That will be a tremendous effort in humanitarian aid for the people of Iraq. Those two ships will also provide an Australian aid expert to Kuwait to work with the World Food Program and the US on logistics for the distribution of that wheat. That is an important initiative. Some humanitarian supplies from Kuwait have now arrived in Iraq and will be distributed shortly. A British ship carrying food, medicine, blankets and water is expected to arrive in the next few days. </para><para>In the context of the minister's response, several non-government organisations will be involvedâfor example, the Red Cross and that type of entityâand it is important to support them. The minister specifically supported the families of those involved in this war. The allegations are totally unfounded. Yes, it is important to support organisations that are trying to provide humanitarian support. The Australian government is making a fine effort in providing not only military support in terms of the 2,000 personnel who are involved in this war, and support for their families, but also humanitarian support for refugees. In this regard Australia's contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross is some $2 million, our contribution to UNICEF is some $2 million and our contribution to UNHCR is some $1.5 million. That will help to assist refugees and those who are displaced. They are not token gestures; they are an important contribution.

In your five minutes you rarely went at all to the substance of what we have been talking about in the last 24 hours. It came to pass during question time yesterday that 6 March this yearâsome three weeks agoâwas the very first time that Minister Vanstone had ever mentioned the plight of women in Iraq during her political career in this place. She had not previously spoken in the Senate about the plight of women in any other country nor through any form of press release. Not even in the minister's speech on Iraq, when we were giving our contributions in this placeâwe have had a chance to do that twice nowâdid she make any mention at all of the status of women in Iraq or the atrocities that have been committed against them by Saddam Hussein.</para><para>But, suddenly, because there is a need to tweak the humanitarian button of the community during a war that is going so horribly wrong for this government, in an attempt that is so inconsistent and so hypocritical she discovered before her very eyes the plight of women in Iraq.

We did not get a press release from the minister, who is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, when we heard that poor Amina Lawal was on trial for having a child out of wedlock and that the end result could be that she would be stoned to death. We had no press release from the minister during that period of time.</para><para>There was no press release, no comment at all, from this minister when we heard about the atrocities against women in Afghanistan or against the women in India who are doused with kerosene and burned to death because they are accused of infidelity. There has been silence from this woman, this minister, who is supposed to be representing women in this country. There has been absolute silence from Minister Vanstone when it comes to the plight of women internationally. But we have an aggressive attack on Iraq by this country, hand in hand with the UK and the US, and we are compassionate about the women in that country. Iraq does have atrocities committed against women but, in comparison to other countries, some of them actually pale into insignificance.</para><para>There are women around the world who are undergoing many more atrocities and many more times. In the US a woman is raped every six minutes; in Northern Africa 6,000 women and young children undergo genital mutilation every day; 15,000 women in China are sold into sexual slaveryâbut we have not heard a word from this woman in this parliament who is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. We heard nothing, zip, zilchâuntil we went to bomb Iraq and we suddenly want to press the button to show that we have some care and compassion for women in Iraq. </para><para>This is a woman who has spent time talking about the redevelopment of the Canberra Theatre, the need for a statue of the Queen's mother, postage allowance for senators and a post parliamentary career for Don Chipp. This is also a woman who has never mentioned in the last fortnight the seven Iraqi women we have detained on the island of Nauru. Tell us, Minister, about those seven Iraqi women whom we in this country have detained on Nauru. Where is your care and your compassion and your concern for those seven Iraqi women as opposed to the many thousands not only in Iraq but around the world whom you have chosen to ignore day after day for the whole 19 years of your political career in this chamber?

I recently engaged in a conversation with Senator Vanstone about the plight of women in the Northern Territory, particularly in Aboriginal communities. This attack is based on answers to questions:`19 years, and not a single question!' Whilst I have not had time to check the record for the last 19 years on this matter, I doubt very much that many questions have come from the other side concerning women in Iraq. I think the number would be very lowâthere may have been none at all. Senator Crossin is saying, `Because you didn't ask a question or bring it up in this place, you don't care about the status of women or the position of women in Iraq.' That is an absolutely outrageous position to come to based on that evidence.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The level of support that Senator Vanstone has given to defence personnel and their families is something that this government is very proud of. In her answer today, she talked about concerns for not only families in Australia associated with defence personnel but also women and families in Iraq. I am sure she is very proud to be a part of the coalition of the willing that is prepared to go to Iraq and change the lot of those women. We are not here to heckle about question time and 19 years of not asking something. The coalition of the willing has gone to Iraq to change the lot of women there. </para><para>We have been very careful about how we have gone about that task. We have gone about it in a way that is judicious and accurate. We are very careful not to disturb water supplies, because that would have an impact on families and the women who are responsible for those families. We have immediately moved to ensure that we are not only taking away a despot who has prevailed over so many years and caused horror to the women of Iraq but focusing the core of our behaviour and activities on a humanitarian effort that is going to change the lot of the families and the women who live in Iraq.</para><para>I noticed in the paper today that one of the tasks of Australian defence personnel is clearing the wharves of mines that have been laid there. That is the precursor to a massive humanitarian aid program that will take place in that area; the wheat ships will follow. I am very proud to be part of a government which is focused on the endgame. The endgame is all about providing a reasonable lifestyle and equitable opportunities for those women who live in Iraq at the momentâas we have done for women in many other parts of the world.</para><para>The government are very proud, for example, of the great work that we did in East Timor. I am sure my colleague Senator Crossin will remember the strong association between Darwin and East Timor. When we went to East Timor, we made the lot of women and families better. We provided water and infrastructure. I am very pleased to say that that has resulted in a great friendship between Australia and East Timorâa fantastic friendship. And I am quite sure that the sort of friendship between Australia and the new democratic nation of Iraq will see us well into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>10415</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to join the chorus of people responding to the answer made by Senator Vanstone in this place today. In her answer to Senator McLucas's question about support for military families, particularly for children in Townsville who are `feeling uneasy, concerned, fearful, confused and angry', the minister acknowledged that these fears and concerns exist. She acknowledged that families are being impacted and do need help and assistance. And why do these families in our community need help and assistance? Because they are terrified, and they have been brought into debate about this war in a most horrific and macabre `contest'.</para></talk.start><para>In this place, in the media and, indeed, all over the world, it seems that the way to justify the war is to list the horrors that have taken place in Iraq. The minister and her comrades on the frontbench, here and in the other place, have competed with each other to list the horrors of the Saddam Hussein regime. We know the horrors of that regime, and it does not help to list them, issue by issue, straight from the Amnesty International list and straight from the UNâthe same UN that called for us to take peaceful action and asked us to work together as an international community to avoid war and find peace. The UN statistics on the horrors of the Saddam Hussein regime can be trotted out by people in here to show what is happening in Iraq. Why? Because they want to justify a war.</para><para>So what are we doing to the families of Australia? I will not talk about the families of Iraq now; we know what is happening to the families of Iraq. I will talk about the families of Australia. Not only are they being bombarded by media coverage of a war but they are being divided, because anyone who shows any opposition to this war is being accused of being an apologist for Hussein. We are accused of protecting dictators and of being uncaring and unsympathetic. How do the families in Townsvilleâthe subjects of the original questionâfeel when any opposition to or concern about the war is portrayed as opposition to them? That is not the way to justify action.</para><para>If there is going to be a genuine concern, particularly by the minister who is responsible for family and community services, I would expect there would be an attempt to unify the community and to acknowledge the work of places such as Lifeline and, in particular in Townsville, the Defence Community Organisation. They are working on a daily basis with people waiting for their family members who have been sent overseas and people who are waiting for their family members to goâbecause it will not just be the current range of soldiers who will be fighting our wars; there will be another round. </para><para>People are being terrified by their government, and they are not being allowed to show those fears as, somehow, fear and concern are unpatriotic. We need to be strong. In this place, whilst we may feel differently about the issue of warâand Senator Bartlett referred to that earlierâthere should be respect for each other and our views. We should not be spitting insults across the chamber in an uncaring and unprofessional way. This is an area where we can learn and work together, and I do not feel that listing the horrors inflicted and being inflicted upon other people will necessarily gain us anything.</para><para>What we need is more support. The minister gave us some supplementary figures at the end of question time about what is happening now, but I did not hear about extra planned assistance for those organisations that are working on the ground now to provide help to people who are being traumatised by all sidesâby the media, by their comrades in the community and by their own families. What we need is a planned approach, a unified approachâone that works with the professionals already in the field and supplements their very paltry budgets and one that acknowledges the issues and gets on with the job that we all want them to do, which is to provide support for not only our military families but all people in our community.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>10416</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>10416</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today relating to military action against Iraq.</para></motion><para>I would like to follow on from the comments made by Senator Moore and Senator Crossin. I think their arguments were very compelling. The concerns they raised are very serious ones. As I stated earlier, when speaking to the motion that the Senate take note of the statement made by the President just after question time, it is a debate that we need to conduct, where possible, in a way that does not vilify or entrench divisions in the community. As I said then, I think we have all learnt something from the difficulties of the Vietnam War, and not just in terms of the way people were treated. People would recallâI do not recall, but I have been told and have readâthat such things happened and that it was not just the troops and their families and supporters being vilified but many of the people involved in street marches and those sorts of things. I recall reading of one statementâI think it was by Billy Snedden, who was a senior minister in the then Liberal governmentâthat said street marchers were `pack-raping democracy'.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âWas it Snedden?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator Moore</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âA better student of history than I, Senator Moore, confirms that that is correct. Obviously there are strong feelings and strong words that it is appropriate to say about crucial topics, but we need to try and speak in a way that does not vilify and that does not entrench and enhance social divisions that could continue well past the conflict that people are protesting about or supporting. That is something we all have to look out for. The approach that the government was taking, and the hypocrisy that Senator Crossin, in particular, was pointing to is very real and also very dangerous. We have seen with the debate in recent times, following on from the Pauline Hanson era, how dangerous words can beâwhat huge social impacts there can be from not just the beliefs people have but the way they express them. If they express things in a way that attacks or demeans particular groups in the community it can have a huge impact.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I mention another group that we need to be particularly conscious ofâapart from troops and their families and others involved in actionsâand that is our Muslim community. In recent months I have met a few times with members of various mosques and Muslim groups in Sydney and Brisbane. For a few years there has been a heightened degree of apprehension among them and a level of fear among some Muslim women. I have been told that in Sydney, for example, a small number of women and young women who dress in the traditional Muslim garb and, therefore, stand out, are afraid to go outside their door for fear of being attacked. There is obviously a risk with the current conflict, particularly if there is a flow-on of terrorist attacks et cetera, that antagonism towards the Muslim members of our community may also flare up. We must try not to pour petrol on the flames; it is a balancing act. </para><para>The Democrats, as much as anybody else, have been strongly condemnatory of the government. It is hard to be strongly condemnatory of what you think is an incredibly incorrect decision without it sounding personal. I guess that when Mr Howard says he wants people to take their anger out on him he is asking us to be personal. But it is also how you express it, and the actions surrounding it. On all sides, I think that is something people need to recognise. In recent times we have had a couple of demonstrations that received some media attentionâthey were very aggressive and actual violence occurred. That is dangerous and not helpful. It is counterproductive for the peace movement. In saying that, I should also point out that there have been thousands of actions around Australia, of all types, that have been peaceful and have been positive affirmations of peaceful options. Most of the time we are getting it right. We need to be careful and draw attention to the few times when we are getting it wrong.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>10417</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Building and Construction Industry: Royal Commission</title><page.no>10417</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10417</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a second statement on behalf of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, on the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, together with volumes 1 and 3 to 11 of the report.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10417</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the documents.</para></motion><para>I said yesterday in the Senate that Australians are tiring of conflict and that they do not want this, the second section of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, to be used as a further excuse for the Howard Liberal government to pursue a divisive industrial relations agenda. The report today will not allay anyone's fears that the primary purpose of the $60 million royal commission was to undermine the role of building industry unions, with the broader issues being treated as secondary matters. Any fair-minded observer would conclude that every opportunity has been taken to attack unions while corporate misbehaviour on a range of fronts has virtually escaped similar strident criticism. Most Australians would agree that, while certain individuals need to face the law and account for their conduct, any improprieties in the industry have not been as one-sided as the Howard Liberal government's inquiry suggests.</para><para>The centrepiece of today's recommendations is undoubtedly the suggested creation of an industry watchdog. Australians have good reason to fear, on the record of the Howard Liberal government, that it has in mind not a watchdog but an attack dog. Much of the Howard Liberal government's industrial relations rhetoric speaks of removing third party intervention from Australian workplaces. It is hard to think of a worse form of third party intervention than a coercive, aggressive regulator, programmed with this Liberal government's ideological values, intruding on the scene to inflame a dispute after it has been settled.</para><para>Australians are people of common sense. They know the building industry is a tough industry and that, from day to day, disputes arise on building sites about issues like unsafe areas, equipment and particularly unpaid moneys. Considerable anxiety exists in many Australian workplaces that existing terms and conditions of employment will be undermined by subcontracting arrangements, which are often contrived subcontracting arrangements. This is clearly a very real anxiety in the building industry, and the Liberal government is quite naive to ignore it. Fundamentally, Australians want a government to provide the means to settle industrial disputes so that work can continue, not impede their resolution and create yet more conflict. </para><para>The second main plank of the recommendations is new legislation to apply to the building and construction industry. Of course, industry specific legislation is not a new concept and nor, indeed, are many of Commissioner Cole's suggestions for what should go in it. Australians will be guided by their sense of fairness when evaluating these proposals. But there can be little doubt that Australians will see no fairness in singling out workers in one industry for a harsh and oppressive set of rules that go well beyond what applies to the rest of the work force.</para><para>Ironically, Commissioner Cole has made a number of recommendations that the Liberal government will not be comfortable with, such as creating an obligation to bargain in good faith. This should surely be a cornerstone of any fair enterprise bargaining system right across the board. Whenever Labor proposes obligations to bargain in good faith, the Howard Liberal government rejects them. It is no use spending $60 million on an inquiry if this government's ideological blinkers prevent it from recognising such a fundamental defect in its own industrial relations system.</para><para>Obviously stung by criticism that this $60 million royal commission failed to deal comprehensively with important issues facing the building industry, such as workplace safety, tax evasion, unpaid entitlementsâ including superannuationâphoenix companies and illegal labour, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has argued that today's instalment contains a rigorous analysis of these matters. However, by way of comparison, yesterday the minister announced to great fanfare 392 instances of unlawful conduct by individualsâit will be interesting to see how many of these 392 instances are in fact proven in a court of lawâand conveniently recounted them in graphic detail, almost all of which alleged breaches of the Howard Liberal government's 1996 industrial laws, and nine out of 10 of them were against workers and unionists.</para><para>Today, the minister tables volumes which acknowledge in comparative generality that workplace safety, tax evasion, unpaid entitlements, phoenix companies and illegal labour are problems in the industry. An objective reader will note that, aside from a few statistics, there are barely enough examples to fill more than a couple of pages. That is simply because these important matters were not the subject of detailed evidential hearing and inquiry by the commission. Indeed, I would argue that detailed evidentiary hearing on these matters was obstructed by the commission.</para><para>Australians are justified in asking why the government and the royal commission have gone to such lengths to apparently exempt individual corporations and businesses from inquiry into the many instances where these important laws have been broken. In the area of workplace safety, the commissioner made a number of recommendations that the federal government clean up its own act. But, beyond that, there is precious little besides recommendations that existing initiatives and further discussions be pursued. When it comes to tax evasion, the commissioner has suggested some tweaking of legislation but has essentially told federal and state tax authorities to do better. I suppose we could all do better, but for $60 millionâthe cost of this commissionâwe would expect better recommendations. As for phoenix companies, the commissioner has well and truly blown the lid on the Howard Liberal government's inaction in this area, observing:</para><quote><para>There appear to be no clear guidelines at the Commonwealth level as to which Commonwealth agencies are responsible for detecting and policing fraudulent phoenix company activity in the building and construction industry.</para></quote><para>Is it any wonder workers have considerable anxiety and occasionally have to resort to industrial action about who is going to pay their wages, let alone their entitlements? But even in this important area, which affects small business proprietors as much as employees, the commissioner has recommended minimal change and yet more discussions between the Liberal government and relevant agencies.</para><para>With regard to illegal labour, the minister defended the action of the department of immigration in investigating allegations of illegal labour in the building industry but overlooked the fact that the commissioner recommended that DIMIA, employers and unions work more closely in this area. The minister spoke with some pride of 65 warning notices being issued to employers. What he neglected to say was that his department has not prosecuted a single employer for the use of illegal immigrant labour in the building industry or any other industry, despite horrific accounts of exploitation. Where were the individual case studies, which are well known and on the public record, that could be used as examples of the outrageous exploitation of illegal immigrant labour in this industry? </para><para>It is fair to recognise that the commission highlighted the importance of encouraging a greater number of women to enter the industry through the provision of family-friendly work conditions, better access to child care and, importantly, consideration of maternity leave. On this point we agree with the commissioner and note that it is an area in which we have heard a lot of talk from the Howard Liberal government but seen little action.</para><para>More broadly, the commissioner touches on the complexities of the contracting arrangements that exist on virtually all major construction sites, observing, `The organisation of a major construction project is a matter of great complexity.' In these circumstances it is understandable that both contractors and unions seek some order and regularity in what otherwise would be an environment of chaos and conflict. Unless there is some degree of cross-site equity, sites can generate into a dog-eat-dog mentality. Indeed, the commission noted in respect of several sites that actual physical conflict was not uncommon in this industry.</para><para>The question becomes: how is that balance obtained between establishing fair and equitable conditions as against those which are unreasonable and unproductive? Again we return to the recommendations of the commissioner that there be established a regime of good faith bargaining enforceable by the Industrial Relations Commission. There is a fundamental inconsistency between the Liberal government's obvious preference for the creation of a building industry watchdogâor in our description `attack dog'âand its ideological obsession with tying the hands of the independent Industrial Relations Commission. There is much at stake here with respect to this important industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>10419</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to take note of the minister's statement. The Iraq war is exposing the problems of a media that wants results now, and wants instant and complete information and positions. Life is not like that. In a small way I am experiencing something of the same attitude from a few people concerning the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. The CFMEU has been recording the Cole commission's every second; the government has had months to absorb these reports. As workplace relations spokesperson for the Democrats I have taken a professional interest in Cole but only at a distance. People need to get real. Only today did the Senate get its first look at the 212 recommendations from the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. Only today has the foot-high, 23-volume report and many thousands of pages arrived at my office. As I said yesterday, we propose to take weeks and not days to review the report. You will get no quick responses or positions from us. Only once I have read the material and consulted appropriately will I provide a brief to my party room for us to take a view collectively.</para></talk.start><para>Because we will be in a balance of power position, as we always are on work place relations, and because our credo is to assess issues on their merits, we will not be rushing to judgment and we cannot be pressured to judgment. We do think there are problems in the industry at both the employer and employee level. It is our job to assess what those problems are, and what the solutions might be. We will be even-handed and fair in our assessment, as always. We want improved outcomes for that industry, for both employers and employees. And we will not be party to any ideological agenda.</para><para>I will reiterate two things I said yesterday. Like Premier Beattie and many others, the Australian Democrats are pleased that instances of alleged criminal behaviour will be investigated for potential prosecution. That is only proper. I also said the Australian Democrats will not support any attempts to deregister unions. That is an ineffective and impractical suggestion, and I am pleased to see that the minister has already poured cold water on it. </para><para>In tabling the recommendations this morning, Minister Abbott said:</para><quote><para>Where this industry is concerned, his essential conclusion is that the industrial commissions lack power, the courts lack speed, the police lack interest and the Employment Advocate lacks authority to tackle the semianarchy under which it operates.</para></quote><para>One thing in there which caught my attention was `the police lack interest'. If this is truly the case, shouldn't we first be looking at ways to enforce the current laws? New laws will take a long time to surface and will add to the complexity and cost of the current industrial relations system. Perhaps we should be looking at an immediate role for the Minister for Justice and Customs, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, perhaps the Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Industrial Relations Commission to identify strategies to enforce current laws. Or COAG should get involved. I doubt the police forces of Australia were ever told to be disinterested in the sorts of crimes mentioned in the report. Enforcement of existing law would be an excellent and immediate remedy.</para><para>The report talks about the creation of an Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC, within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We will look at that idea. But there is a philosophical problem that we have to outline and assess right up-front. The IRC have a long and very able tradition in the development and the practical application of industrial relations practices in this country. But they are primarily a conciliator and arbitratorâa tribunal. They are not a regulator. What the government is referring to here is the means by which you create a regulator. We will have to have a look at whether it is right and appropriate for the regulator to sit outside the umpireâwhich the Industrial Relations Commission areâor inside, or whether the new regulator should be dedicated to a particular industry. This is a difficult philosophical and policy decision as well as a practical decision to make.</para><para>The other issue concerning this is targeting. There are instances in law where you do need to target particular categories and groups of people. What is lacking in the commission's report at first glance, for instance, is a recommendation for whistleblower protection devices and whistleblower legislation. That would target people who could actually blow the whistle. That might be a useful area to go for. The question we have to examine is: does this problem need something like racketeering legislation so we can go after people in employer organisations or in employee organisations or in companies or in churches, perhaps, as the Americans have done with the paedophiles? Racketeering legislation is a way of getting at people within institutions on a general basis. There is an idea that is not covered in the report. There are a number of ways you can do targeting. We have to think carefully about that.</para><para>With regard to the Cole report's recommendation of creating an act of special application to the building and construction industry, the Australian Democrats are very wary about breaking up the workplace relations environment. It also goes against our view that there should be a unitaryâa singleâ industrial relations system for the whole of Australia. If you explode it into a number of different bodies, acts and institutions, you increase the difficulties with achieving that goal. I am aware that there have been, and still are, instances where industries have had specific legislation which may, to some extent, govern industrial issues. For example, the coal mining industry until 1994 was regulated by the Coal Industry Tribunalâ now absorbed into the Industrial Relations Commissionâand there has been the stevedoring, waterfront and seagoing industry legislation.</para><para>Another problem that emerges with a quick glance of the report is the issue of regionality. It seems to me that, based on the raw figures of unlawful conduct, the problems are most apparent in Western Australia and Victoria. You have to ask yourself: do you want to get legislation that applies to the whole country and to a whole industry if the problems are regional and local? Again, it is an issue that we will need to examine and think about. </para><para>The Cole commission has commented on pattern bargaining in the industry. The Senate has examined this issue at great length and presumably knows the mind of the Australian Democrats on this matterâdetails of which can be found in various committee reports and in my speeches on the second reading dealing with the matter. There is a matter of misstatement of the truth by the Cole commission. Page 27 of volume 1 of the final report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry says:</para><quote><para>There is nothing in the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth) </inline>which directly prohibits pattern bargaining and pattern agreements. Bills which have been introduced in an attempt to control pattern bargaining and pattern agreements have not been passed by Parliament.</para></quote><para>That is a strange statement. A press release dated 7 February 2003 from the Hon. Tony Abbott MP says:</para><quote><para>The Government's <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Act 2002 </inline>commences operation today ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>The Act amends the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996 </inline>to:</para><para>help the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) identify when to suspend or terminate a bargaining period ...</para><para>allow parties to apply for suspension or termination of bargaining periods ...</para><para>allow the AIRC to prevent the initiation of new bargaining period ...</para></quote><para>et cetera. There is a little bit of a misstatement there. If a recommendation results from a misunderstanding of where the law is at, you have to be careful about that as well.</para><para>In concluding, I say once again that we will wait and see what the response is. We will be particularly interested in what the legislative response is. When the time comes, we will assess the issue on its merits and, if necessary, negotiate an outcome with the various parties in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10421</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commend Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats for what could only be described as a constructive approach to the extensive findings. I do not think that Senator Murray or I could possibly pretend to have had the time to have devoured them in any sort of detail. As I see it, a part of my role in the ministryâas I have responsibility for the financial services sectorâis having responsibility for building Australia as a financial centre. I regard particularly the central business district construction industry as a vital part of that infrastructure for making Australia a great financial centre. I do not think that many people would draw that analogy but, having come out of the central city property industry and now having responsibility for making sure we have vibrant commercial centres in Australia, not just in Sydney, I have a close interest. I have followed the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry in a similar way, I suspect, to Senator Murrayâthat is, looking at it from the outside until two days ago, when the significant body of work produced by the royal commission landed on the tables of the two houses of our parliament.</para></talk.start><para>By way of contrast, the Labor Party has, unfortunately, gone into what could only be called denial. I will not try to score political points, because I think the approach taken by Senator Murray is the approach the whole parliament should take. It should try to take away the political game playing from around this issue and look at the serious problems that are addressed by the royal commission.</para><para>At the same time, the Econtech organisation has produced a report which reinforces a suspicion I had about the damage that can be done by a construction industry which, on the face of it, has some endemic corruption flowing through it and is involved in `racketeering', to use Senator Murray's term. It has the effect of ensuring that costs in Australia are much higher than they need be. If you look at the Econtech report, it reaches the conclusion that, with an efficient building industry, Australia could have a consumer price index that is one per cent lower, an annual economic welfare gain of $2.3 billion, a gross domestic product lift of 1.1 per cent, rises in labour productivity of 10 per cent and a productivity gap of 50 per cent between the construction industries in North America and Australia. Those figures are deeply alarming. </para><para>The potential of having a good building industry in Australia is phenomenal gains for everyone in Australia. We should have an efficient, internationally competitive nation which will attract the best and brightest from around the world. Let us extend the economic benefits of a good building industry toâand Senator Carr has reminded me of this by walking into this chamberâthe tertiary education sector. This is quite a serious point. If you think about it, if you want an efficient economy which maximises opportunities for people throughout the economyâand the people who miss out through inefficiency are, generally speaking, the lowest paid, those who struggle most to get into the work forceâyou need a building industry which creates some of the biggest infrastructure in the nation. The big central city buildings are the big-ticket items in a nation the size of Australia; in fact, in any sized nation. You cannot afford to have a 50 per cent productivity gap with the United States. It is absurd. We are competing head to head with the United States of America for jobs and for the best and brightest minds in the world, yet we are accepting a 50 per cent productivity gap between us and a nation which has great similarities in terms of demographics, geography, economy, federal system of government, and the aspirations of many of our people in many ways. We cannot accept that.</para><para>I reinforce the point that the approach that Senator Murray has just outlined is the sort of approach that the parliament needs to take. It is the approach that the government needs to take to looking at how we develop this. I note, reading a press release from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which has just come to hand, that Mr Hendy, the chief executive of that organisation, has taken a similar approach to Senator Murray's, saying that the recommendations should be examined urgently and on their merits.</para><para>I was making the analogy to the tertiary education sector. You cannot have a strong economy without an effective and efficient building industry. You want to ensure best use of the limited resources available to any sector. Let us choose the tertiary education system. You do not want the limited resources that are going into the tertiary education system in Australiaâthat Senator Kim Carr complains about virtually every dayâto be squandered on buildings that are far more expensive than they need to be. Let us take a hypothetical example: if you want to build a $5 million research centre on a campus somewhere in Australia, why would you want to pay $500,000 too much for it when you know that you could do so much better with that extra $500,000? The report says that the endemic corruption in this industry is ensuring that we are wasting those scarce resources on the rorts and the criminal activities and corruption that is dragging the whole of Australia down. It is very important that we take away the overblown political rhetoric from both sides of the debate. I am sorry if I fall into the trap of being overblown and political in my rhetoric about this, but we do need to think of the core importanceâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âOne death per week on a building site! What are you saying about that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âSenator Carr interjects on the issue of workplace safety. It is an absolutely pivotal issue, which in fact the royal commission looked at directly. One of the recommendations relates specifically to occupational health and safety, and the royal commission recommends the establishment of a commissioner of health and safety in the building and construction industry to monitor occupational health and safety at all projects on which the Commonwealth is the client. That would relate specifically to tertiary education institutionsâwhere you would have a direct interest, of course.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It also makes a recommendation which is equally important, which is to say, `Let's stop using occupational health and safety issues as trojan horses for other union issues and, often, political issues'âthey are used as tools for creating access and a range of other industrial issuesâ`because it diminishes the important focus on occupational health and safety.' If you have a bunch of union people running around using occupational health and safety as a trojan horse for political or other industrial agendas, of course you are diminishing the currency of those very issues. We should address those. We should try to put aside our natural political divisions over these issues, because they will drag down the whole of the country. </para><para>In Western Australiaâthe state that Senator Murray and I come fromâthe CFMEU is the worst in the nation. I agree with Senator Murray that there is clear blame on both sides of the argument here. You do not get what has occurred in the Western Australian building and construction industry unless the employers get into bed with the unions. There is no doubt that in Western Australia many of them have. They will explain to you: `We have no choice. We have to get the buildings done on time. If we don't get the sites working, the banks will close us down.' They are things that are addressed by the royal commission as well. But it does need a change of culture. It needs a change in behaviour by unions, it needs a change in behaviour by the construction firms themselves, and it needs a change in behaviour by the law enforcers. Clearly the royal commission has made some recommendations to the government which will need to be looked at very closely, because none of us can afford to allow the existing situation to continue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DAIRY INDUSTRY SERVICE REFORM BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10423</page.no><id.no>R1741</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (DAIRY) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1738</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>10423</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Senator Heffernan, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline> and a related bill, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>10423</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MASON (Queensland) (4.22 p.m.)âAs Chair of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, I present additional information received by the committee relating to the supplementary hearings on the budget estimates for 2002-03.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10423</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade: Joint</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>10423</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade <inline font-style="italic">Review of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence Annual Reports 2000-2001</inline>, as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>.

However, a majority of Member States opposed the concept on the grounds that it allowed an undue level of influence in peacekeeping operations by more affluent Member States which were able to provide the personnel. The system was therefore discontinued in 1999, thus increasing the need to provide greater resources to DPKO from assessed contributions. It is most unlikely that this scheme will be reinstituted in the future.

For example, evidence shows that women in feminised industries and low-income employment have less access to paid maternity leave. </para><para>It was for this reason that I introduced the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill last year. </para><para>The Bill is intended to operate as remedial legislation by addressing current inequities in the provision of paid maternity leave and combatting the systemic workplace discrimination which has long been the experience of working women. </para><para>In financial terms this discrimination means that women forgo of between $167,000 and $239,000 as a result of the birth of their first child alone, depending on their qualifications. </para><para>The Government should not only establish a national scheme of paid maternity leave to address this ongoing discrimination against women, but it should also proceed with the ratification of CEDAW. Its failure to do so, casts a dark cloud over its alleged commitment to human rights and equality.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>10435</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>10435</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>10435</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table report No. 24 of the Productivity Commission, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Economic regulation of Harbour Towage and Related Services</inline>, together with the government's response to the report.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10435</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>10435</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>10435</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the order for the consideration of government business for the remainder of today be as follows:</para></motion><para>No. 2	Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002</para><para>No. 4	Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002, consideration in committee of the whole of message no. 238 from the House of Representatives</para><para>Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</para><para>No. 6	Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002, consideration in committee of the whole of message no. 251 from the House of Representatives</para><para>No. 12	National Blood Authority Bill 2002</para><para>No. 3	Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 </para><para>No. 7	Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003</para><para>No. 8	Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</para><para>No. 9	Issues from the Advance to the Finance Minister as a final charge for the year ended 30 June 2002âconsideration in committee of the whole</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (PARALLEL IMPORTATION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10436</page.no><id.no>R1509</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10436</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>10436</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will continue my speech from earlier on todayâI believe that I have about three minutes to go. As with the music and book publishing sector, the Democrats have a longstanding interest in and commitment to the Australian film industry. As I mentioned earlier today, the <inline ref="R1509">Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002</inline> has no impact on video or celluloid. However, there are some issues relating to DVD format. While the bill explicitly exempts DVDs, the Screen Producers Association of Australia has raised a definitional issue concerning films made directly for the home DVD market. While we think the scope and policy intent is clear in the bill, we will be moving a minor amendment to clarify that part of the film industry as exempt from the parallel importation provisions.</para></talk.start><para>It is also important to remind ourselves that protecting intellectual property necessarily involves balancing and judging the merits of competing claims and interests. There is no ideal position, and changing technologies and different modes of creative endeavours generate their own complexities. Of course there are going to be claims from some distributors that the antipiracy package does not go far enough. However, the government has made it clear that it will not support criminalising corporate end user piracy or statutory damages. With that in mind, we have taken the position that we have. We believe that the antipiracy package is a positive step in the right direction, but, of course, more can be done. Accordingly, we will be moving an amendment to ensure that these provisions are reviewed in four years time to ascertain the effectiveness of these measures and whether additional measures are required.</para><para>To sum up, I think our negotiations have leveraged a good, solid outcome. In effect, the publishing industry in this country remains protected and there are stronger antipiracy and enforcement measures to protect copyright owners. It will also be cheaper and easier for copyright owners to pursue civil actions, and copyright owners have an incentive to ensure that prices for goods in Australia are internationally competitive. As you will have seen in some of the reporting today and over the past few weeks, there is the possibility that prices for software will decrease and a wider range of software will be made available to Australian consumers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>10436</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank all honourable senators for the contributions they have made to this debate, particularly Senator Aden Ridgeway and others who have made constructive contributions.

They have argued that Australia needs statutory penalties as exist in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Canada. </para></talk.start><para>I think a number of issues flow from thatâthe first of which is the inadequacy of the penalties. If it is the case that penalties are inadequate then the very important question is why copyright owners are failing to convince judges of their case. Without any reference to any specific cases, it may be that the level of penalties simply reflects general community perceptions of piracy of intellectual propertyâthat is, that the theft of copyrighted goods is not accorded the same status or understanding as the theft of material possessions. This does have important long-term consequences, given the rapid growth and economic significance of copyright industries, notably in the arts and creative industries and other content providers in the knowledge economy. Clearly there is a fundamental role for the government, producers and owners of copyright material to educate the community as to the value and importance of intellectual property.</para><para>The second issue is the types of penalties. As I have mentioned, lawyers and owners have argued that Australia does need a statutory regime specifically with minimum statutory penalties that are reflective of the value of each infringing good. During our discussions with the government on the elements that go into the antipiracy package and copyright enforcement package, we discussed in some detail the pros and cons of statutory penalties. The government have clearly indicated to us that they oppose statutory penalties and prefer a system of additional penalties. I do not propose to comment on the government's position. I think it is really up to them to outline their own reasoning. But I do want to place on the record that, while the Democrats are obviously sympathetic to the concerns that underpin the call for statutory penalties, we are opposed in principle to systems that overly constrain judicial discretion.</para><para>Item 1 of amendment (2) allows the courts to take account of deterrence and the behaviour of the defendant after the infringement or being informed that their actions infringe copyright. In view of that, I think it is clear that we need to send a signal that infringement needs to be considered against a broader backdrop than simply the infringed goods at hand. In that sense it sends a pretty unambiguous signal that should be considered by all parties to copyright enforcement. Item 2 of amendment (2) also introduces new presumptions of subsistence and ownership of copyright. In our view, the policy intent is quite clear. It aims to provide for quicker and cheaper remedies when subsistence and ownership are put at issue.</para><para>I will not go on too much further, other than to say that we also support that part in relation to the jurisdiction for copyright infringements being conferred on the Federal Magistrates Service. I think that is important. Having said that, I think it is also appropriate to note that the Federal Magistrates Service is well aware of the issue of expertise and, I understand, intends to establish a specialist panel and the training of magistrates on copyright law. I think the outcome of the Magistrates Service's attention to these matters will be particularly important in determining the degree to which copyright owners will be able to seek remedies in the Federal Magistrates Court.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10441</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrats amendment (1) on sheet 2875:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (lines 24 and 25), omit paragraph (a) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">feature film</inline>, substitute:</para></quote><para>	(a)	is produced wholly or principally:</para><para>	(i)	for exhibition to the public in cinemas or by way of television broadcasting; or</para><para>	(ii)	for sale or rental to the public where it is reasonable to assume that the viewing of the film (without electronic interactive involvement with the film) would be the primary object of any such sale or rental; and </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10442</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government supports this amendment which clarifies existing provisions in the bill in relation to the definition of a feature film.

These words have been included in order to take account of the fact that whilst DVD films, for example, sometimes include interactive elements, the primary reason for acquisition or rental of the DVD is to view the film, not to experience the electronic interactive elements. This is in contrast to a computer or video game where the primary purpose of acquisition or rental is to interact with the visual material or to play a game. The reference to interactive involvement being electronic ensures that films packaged with instructions for the viewer to use in undertaking some kind of activity in addition to watching, such as is the case with exercise videos, can be included within the definition of feature films.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>10442</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I noted earlier in my second reading contribution, the bill has no impact on videos or celluloid.

The amendment essentially seeks to remove the schedule that would remove restrictions on parallel importations of books in the printing industries. I do not want to reiterate my concerns about the ACCC data on books; I have referred to most of those concerns in my second reading contribution earlier today. The Australian Publishers Association has argued that the ACCC greatly underestimated the price differential for an important reason: it does not actually compare the prices of a significant number of bestsellers available in a given period. This is because many new releases are made available in large trade paperback form in Australia, while overseas they are initially released in hardback form only. The ACCC excludes all of these from its calculations.</para><para>The Australian Publishers Association has pointed out that the availability of trade paperbacks means that Australians have immediate access to a cheaper format. If these books were included in the ACCC survey then they believe, and so do we, that the evidence would be quite clear that Australian consumers would have access to new releases at even cheaper prices than the ACCC had found. Without going into all the detail on the pricing, the Democrats have a long-standing commitment to the development and protection of Australian culture and cultural production. Hence, that is the reason we have taken the position that we have. We were opposed to removing restrictions on parallel importation for CDs in 1998, and we made our opposition to these provisions a necessary condition of our agreement to the other matters contained in the bill. I thank the government for their cooperation in this respect as well.</para><para>We believe that removing the existing restrictions to parallel importation of books may allow dumping of remaindered copies and lower royalties for authors. This seriously jeopardises the viability of our printing and publishing industries and further undermines the already precarious position of authors in this country. The Democrats again have rejected the shallow market arguments which should not take precedence over our authors' ability to articulate our own stories to us and the rest of the world. I have heard the comments from the opposition. I would certainly urge all senators to support the book industry by voting against this schedule as printed. </para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>10443</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 2875:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	Government amendment (2), at the end of Schedule 4, add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">15  Review of operation of this Schedule</inline></para></quote><para>(1)	The Minister must cause a review of the operation of the amendments made by this Schedule to be carried out as soon as practicable after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of this Schedule.</para><para>(2)	The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the report is completed.</para><para>This amendment requires the minister to review the provisions of the enforcement schedule after four years and to table that review.

Labor's position on welfare reform and the <inline ref="R1550">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline> in particular has been clear. We support wholeheartedly the proposition that our system of social security confers both rights and responsibilities on Australians. The ground on which there has been almost constant disagreement between Labor and the Howard government has been the balance between the rights and responsibilities of social security recipients. Since coming to office, the Howard government has dramatically increased the responsibilities placed on Australians who do not have a job or who are incapacitated or sick and on families. At the same time, critical labour market programs and support services have been savagely withdrawn. </para></talk.start><para>Nothing better illustrates the lack of balance in our welfare system today than the system of breaches and penalties that apply to people on social security. It is now beyond argument that our system of breaching is flawed and unfair. St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, Hanover Welfare Services, the National Welfare Rights Network, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ACOSS, not to mention the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the independent Pearce review into penalties, have all drawn attention to the large increase in people being breached, often unfairly, and the negative impact it has had on their wellbeing and their continuing efforts to find work. There were 113,000 breaches raised against income support recipients in 1996-97, a figure that grew to almost 400,000 in the year 2000-01. Last year, close to 300,000 people were breached.</para><para>It has been noted that the current regime is a contributing factor in homelessness and crime. It has impacted disproportionately on young people, and perhaps the most telling statistic is the fact that over a quarter of a million breach penalties were meted out last financial year alone. For those who do appeal, around 43 per cent had their breach overturned. This is clear evidence of a system of arbitrary penalties that have in many cases been misapplied. The impact of these penalties varies, but for most it has meant a loss of income of at least $800 over six months, regardless of their actions to remedy the actions that caused the breach. As St Vincent de Paul has noted, the penalty for failing to lodge a tax return is just $110. There is clearly a need for change.</para><para>The government recognised this to an extent and initiated some administrative changes that came into effect on 1 July last year. It has argued that it would like to see these changes go through before it contemplates any substantial reform of the penalty regime. This is just not good enough for us. Labor took a decision when this bill was introduced to draw a line in the sand on breaching. We took a stand to redress the growing one-sidedness of our social security system. We did this not because we are soft on compliance but because the current regime is hurting the chances of our unemployed to get work. It is indeed counterproductive.</para><para>Labor pushed for and obtained a Senate references inquiry on this legislation to ensure that the various changes proposed under the Australians working together bill were considered in the context of the broader social security regime. We have never tried to stand in the way of this bill. Rather, our aim has been to ensure that any new responsibilities to be placed on new groups of recipients, mainly parents and mature age unemployed, were reasonable and that the current penalties and breach rules applying to the many unemployed were reformedâthat is, made fair.</para><para>Our amendments, which give effect to the recommendations of the Pearce review, reflect our commitments. We will not have a fair system until Pearce is implemented. Today the government and the Australian Democrats are scuttling those amendments. I want to register my disappointment with the Australian Democrats. They voted with us to create the Senate inquiry which brought the Pearce recommendations into consideration. Today they have abandoned those recommendations. The amendments that the government and Democrats will support today do not restore the balance that is needed. They will no doubt argue that they have done this deal to save the working credit. What they have to live with is the fact that this initiative is being paid for by the breaches that will still be levied unfairly against unemployed people who are trying to play by the rules. Let me say that Labor will remain a strident critic of the current breaching regime. The government and the Australian Democrats may think their cosy deal is good enough, but we do not and we will continue to force the case until Professor Pearce's recommendations become a reality.</para><para>Turning now to Working Credit, Labor supports real welfare reform. During the eighties and nineties, through the disability reform strategy, Bettina Cass's thoroughgoing social security review and, later, through Working Nation, Labor modernised our social security system. Labor remains committed to reforms that assist people back into work and, most of all, to the investments that underpin that transition. Despite the government's constant hyperbole about sweeping reforms since Senator Newman's Press Club address in 1999, they have achieved little of substance. This bill restores only a small portion of the welfare to work initiatives that have been lost over the life of this government. </para><para>While Labor wholeheartedly supports Working Credit and remains committed to its introduction, it is a scheme that existed beforeâintroduced by Labor in the mid-1980sâand was criticised and abolished by the government in 1997. Now they expect accolades for reintroducing the scheme. We say that the Howard government have removed the balance from our welfare system. They have torn a hole in our safety net, and they have removed the ladders that once enabled people to get back to work. Without the Pearce recommendations on breaching, this bill goes nowhere near restoring fairness to the system. The government have perpetrated this unfairness and the Democrats have aided and abetted them. This deal will be remembered alongside the GST deal as one of the Australian Democrats' low points. They have thumbed their noses at Australia's many unemployed people; they have thumbed their noses at charities and community groups. Having taken a very strong and principled stand prior to Christmas, they have now abandoned that for very little indeed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>10445</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Greens opposed the <inline ref="R1550">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline> when it came before the Senate last year. We supported splitting the bill to ensure that the Senate could approve the worthwhile measuresâthat is, Working Credit, the language, literacy and numeracy supplement and the personal support program. We also supported amendments put forward by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats to reduce the harsh measures in this bill, but we opposed the extension of a punitive breaching regime to more vulnerable Australians. Of course, the government did not support splitting the bill, which makes us question just how serious it is in implementing the measures that advantage people receiving income support.</para></talk.start><para>If the government believes these measures are worth while, then why tie them to measures about which the Senate would have serious concerns? The government deliberately set up a situation to put pressure on the Senate to pass its objectionable measures in order to save worthwhile measures. We believe that this is nothing short of legislative blackmail. The government wants the Senate to play one group of disadvantaged people off against another. It wants the poor to pay for the poor. We are being asked to sanction a punitive penalty regime that punishes individuals because they do not have paid work by extending it to new groups in the communityâthat is, older unemployed people and sole parents. This penalty regime causes hardship, misery and homelessness. It exacerbates poverty and disadvantage. No parliament should sanction legislation that delivers such outcomes or allow itself to be manipulated in such a way.</para><para>Government figures obtained by the National Welfare Rights Network and released this week show that unemployed people have been fined an average of $700 each, or a total of $1 billion, since 1996. That is $1 billion taken from income support for people who struggle to meet their basic living expenses. The government is engaging in the business of scapegoating. It is punishing those without paid work, denigrating them as job snobs or dole bludgers and claiming that they are a burden on the community and the public purse. At the same time, the government has made no substantial investment in job generation, training and reskilling. Work for the Dole is no substitute for proper training. The privatised job placement and training programâJob Networkâhas failed to deliver acceptable outcomes. And the government has not demonstrated any commitment to addressing the structural impediments to finding paid work, such as affordable child care, publicly funded education and training, decent wage rates, reasonable hours of work, reliable and affordable public transport, paid parental leave and the creation of work in places where people live rather than expecting them to travel long distances daily at great expense or to move, possibly with a family, to some other place. </para><para>A decade of economic growth has failed to deliver a substantial fall in long-term unemployment in this country. It is time the government realised that the market alone cannot address this social and economic imperative. At the very least, the government needs to make the substantial investment recommended in the McClure report on welfare reform, which it commissioned before it began to consider extending the obligations of people who rely on income support. It needs to shift its approach from punishment to constructive support and assistance. That the Australian Democrats have failed to stand firm against passing this bill disappoints us. The Democrat amendments moved last year would have delivered significant improvements. Why accept less now? Why give in to this legislative blackmail?</para><para>Some community groups have told us that the paltry changes the government has accepted will improve circumstances for many disadvantaged Australians, and so they ought to be supported in exchange for passing the bill. We cannot accept this argument. With or without a reduction in the harshness of some aspects of the breaching regime, this bill, on balance, is regressive and we will have no part in allowing it to become law. The resignation of some community groups to the paucity of decent government policy in this area is disappointing. These are the groups upon which millions of disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians rely to advocate on their behalf. We understand the difficult position in which this government has placed these groups, but letting the government get away with this unacceptable and unethical trade-off will only embolden it to attempt worse next time.</para><para>We urge the Australian Democrats to reconsider their decision to support this bill and, instead, remain committed to securing the minimum changes to penalties that this government should implementâthat is, the Pearce recommendations. The Senate can demand better, and it should demand better, than the government has been prepared to accept. The Senate should stand up to this government and leave it in no doubt that it has gone too far in its drive to vilify the poor and, in doing so, divide the nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>10446</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1550">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline> is obviously a very difficult one for all senators. The difficulty is that the Australians Working Together package, as presented by the government, had a range of measures that were very positiveâunambiguously positiveâfor unemployed people, such as the Working Credit scheme and the numeracy and literacy allowances, and some which were, on balance, difficult in that they imposed new obligations on certain categories of job seekers, such as mature age workers and parents with teenage children. This has been a difficult bill for the Senate right through because of the difficulty of balancing those two groups.</para></talk.start><para>The key issue, as Senator Bishop pointed out, for the opposition parties when we considered this bill last year was that we were deeply concerned about imposing new obligations on new categories of job seekers and bringing them within the breaching regime without some significant reform of that regime. Certainly pressure has been put on the government as a result of the work over the last two years by ACOSS, the Pearce inquiry and the Commonwealth Ombudsman on breaching to deliver some significant reform of the breaching regime.</para><para>We need to acknowledge in this debate the progress that has been made, and that was a point the Minister for Family and Community Services made repeatedly in the debate last year. Since the administrative reforms she introduced last April, the breaching rates are down about 52 per cent on last year's figure. That is a significant figure. I am sure the minister can correct me, but I think that is about 100,000 fewer breaches a year as a result of the administrative arrangements introduced last year. We need to acknowledge that the Labor Party, in their negotiations with the government last October and November, made some significant advances by changing the factors that have to be taken into account before a person is breached.  </para><para>In the amendments that the House has agreed to there is a series of changes to the Social Security Act which will introduce a significant new set of criteria that the secretary must take into account before breaching somebody. They pertain very much to the personal circumstances of the individual before breaching can occur. When these changes flow into the system, as a result of amendments agreed to by the Labor Party last year, they will have a significant effect.</para><para>We went back to the government and said that if we continued to insist on the amendments we moved last year this bill would fall over. The minister had made that clear and that was a clear message from the government. It becomes a hard call, as all parties in this place know, when you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you have to decide which particular rock you are going to run for. In this case, we felt that if we could get some significant further reform of the breaching regime and a continuing process beyond that to put pressure on achieving further change to the breaching regime then we would be prepared to look at the bill again. I am pleased to say that the minister has come back with what I regard, and what the welfare sector regards, as significant changes to the breaching regime which I will be moving as amendments later in this debate. </para><para>The changes relate to a reduction in the penalty period on the first breach if a person complies. I accept that there are exceptions to that. The Welfare Rights Network estimates that the penalty periods will be reduced for about 80,000 people a year. They will see their penalty periods reduced from the current 13 and 26 weeks to about eight weeks. The advice to the Democrats, which I am happy to pass on to the opposition parties, from ACOSS, Jobs Australia and the Welfare Rights Network is to pass this bill with these amendments. They want this bill passed with these amendments because, as a package of amendments, and with the administrative arrangements which I am happy to explain to the chamber, the bill is a net positive gain for welfare reform. It is a net positive gain because it is the first significant time in five years that we have seen the penalties reduced, it builds on the administrative changes the minister put in place last April with further administrative changes and it includes the amendments the Labor Party negotiated last year which contain very significant changes to the criteria to which the minister has already agreed. In addition to that, it puts further pressure on Centrelink and the department to deliver further improvements in the administration of breaches in the course of the next year with the establishment of a breaches task force and audit regime, a quality assurance program and a review process. All these things will ensure that the pressure is put on Centrelink, the department and the Job Network to achieve the changes that the Ombudsman sought in his report last year.</para><para>It is worth quotingâthis is not in the amendments but it is certainly in the agreement with the governmentâwhat that breaches task force will be doing:</para><quote><para>The task force shall review relevant data, the social security guide and its procedures for implementation according to social security law to assess the fairness of breach penalties imposed on unemployment beneficiaries and new groups covered by the AWT legislation with reference to the administrative reforms announced by the minister last year, the 2002 report of the Ombudsman, the Pearce report itself, the review of the Australians Working Together legislation, the role of Job Network members and all of this to become a report back to the minister next April. </para></quote><para>The task force itself will include two nominees of ACOSS, a nominee of the National Employment Services Association, a senior member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the AAT, an independent chair, a nominee of the Minister for Family and Community Services, a nominee of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and a senior officer of Centrelink.</para><para>With those terms of reference, that task force covers the Pearce report, the Ombudsman's report and the administrative arrangements the minister has already agreed to, and it ensures that we keep the pressure on to ensure that the administration of breaching is improved. I believe that in this package we have an advance to getting the penalties reduced, at least for those prepared to comply on the first breach which affects around 80,000 people a year, and beyond that a strong commitment from the minister to ensure that the administration of breaching remains under continuous scrutiny, review and ultimately report. </para><para>From that point of view, the Democrats will not be insisting on the amendments we moved last year and on the Labor Party amendments which we supported. We remain committed to the spirit of those amendments. We believe that the Pearce inquiry report laid out a good road map for the continuing reform of the breaches system, but we believe that by establishing this task force we have ensured that that road map remains on track and that it will now be dealt with at the appropriate place by continuing detailed discussions between the government and the welfare sector. I am sure that this time next year we will see further significant improvements and reforms of this process coming from the government. I commend the minister on how far she has been prepared to come on this legislation in a difficult budgetary environment and in the administration in her department. I am reasonably confident that out of this we will see significant improvements in the breaching regime. On that basis, the Democrats can agree, with some extreme reluctance, to extending the mutual obligation system to new groups.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10448</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased that the <inline ref="R1550">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline> is now going to pass.

I admit I am not a historian on these issues, but I would be surprised if there is on the record a debate in this chamber in which a government has had to argue and compromise in order to invest money in people on welfare. Nonetheless, that is the exercise we have been through. At least we have been through it effectively with the Democrats, and I thank them for the process that we have been through. It has been tortuous in some respects for us but no doubt it has been tortuous for them as well, and we have come a long way, as far as I think we possibly can.</para><para>I will outline briefly the sorts of things that will happen under this bill. There will be working credit, which will help and encourage people on income support to take up employment. It will allow them to keep more of their income support when they work part time. There is the language, literacy and numeracy supplementâthe payment of $20.80 a fortnight. There are changes to the mature age allowance and partner allowance. There are more flexible participation requirements for the mature aged, that is, those 50-plus, and Newstart allowees and new requirements for parenting payment customersânew requirements that I very strongly personally support. The days of us simply putting money in someone's bank every fortnight until their youngest child turns 16 and then sending them a rude letter saying that now they have to get a job are thankfully over. At least just once a year we will have a compulsory interview with someone to acquaint them with opportunities to maintain their skills or to get new ones. That will start when their youngest child is sixâwhen their youngest child is at school. So no-one will have to leave children unattended and no-one will have to leave children without appropriate care. Just once a yearâI do not think that is enoughâwe will make contact with these people and have a discussion about what they can do to maintain their skills or get new ones. Then, when their youngest child turns 13, we will require participation of six hours a week on average. I personally believe that sole parents are largely doing this now anyway and that will be a piece of cake. It is on an average so that people do not have to participate when their kids are sick or when, for example, school holidays are on and the schoolkids are at home. That is a very sensible proposition that means that the sole parentâand they are largely womenâ when they get to the point that their youngest child is 16, will not get a sudden, rude shock that they have to get a job. They will have had a continual focus on what training opportunities there are and what they can do. They will have had at least two or three years of some sort of participation, whether it is work or training or voluntary participation. </para><para>The changes we have agreed to, after lengthy and detailed consultations with the Australian Democrats, acknowledge that first-time breachers perhaps deserve a more tolerant and lenient approach than second- and third-time breachers, and we have gone to great lengths to make sure that is the case. People who are first-time breachers and who want to make good and want to comply with the rules will be given much better treatment, much softer treatment. We have not been able to come to agreementâand won'tâ over the second- and third-time breachers. The government makes the point that, even in relation to first-time breachers, nobody has to be breached. Breaching is not something that happens to you because you are on the roulette wheel; breaching happens because you do not follow the rules that you are meant to follow. Nobody has to put themselves in that position. If you have a reasonable excuse, you do not get breachedâand that part of the debate seems to be forgotten. But we are prepared to say that we will take a softer approach with people who breach for the first time and who are prepared to make good and do so rapidly, and we hope that does work in building more incentives for people. We have done so primarily because we believe very strongly in the investment that we are about to make, which is about $900 million over four years.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the committee does not further insist on Senate amendments (18), (22), (24), (37), (39), (40), (42), (43), (47), (49), (50), (54), (61), (63) to (65) and (74) to (77).</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator J.J.

They also provide some additional criteria for the issue of stressful and personal circumstances, which the secretary is satisfied would, in combination, require a full-time effort to address.</para><para>With these amendments, we are trying to pick up onâand I think it is something that the Labor Party did most of the hard yards on in Decemberâthe notion of parents who really cannot participate in the labour market because of the illness of their children or because of a continuing set of circumstances which are not picked up by the term `family and personal crisis'. These amendments are only extensions of what had already been discussed in December, and I think they are fairly self-explanatory.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>10450</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to put a few comments on the record on behalf of the opposition as to our understanding of the totality of this package between the Democrats and the government. While we are prepared to give our support to these amendments on the basis that they are a step forward from where we are now, we do so in the knowledge that it is indeed a limited advance. As I said before, it is completely inferior to the recommendations put forward by Professor Pearce, Mr Disney and Ms Ridout in their independent report on breaches and penalties. Before Christmas, Labor's proposals, which included a full commitment to the Pearce report, were ultimately opposed by the Democrats. Before Christmas, they could not support this bill with the full set of Pearce amendments. Now, after Christmas, they are going to support it without them. Call it a U-turn or call it whatever you choose, but it does represent in our view a significant backdown in the space of a few months. </para></talk.start><para>I want to turn to the non-legislative components of the bill. Firstly, as I understand it, a majority of the deal between the government and the Democrats is not contained in legislation but will be in the form of an agreement or exchange of letters. We are expected to trust that the government will be good to its word that audit reviews and monitoring are going to take place. I say to the Democrats that former Senator Newman made a similar non-legally binding promise to review the operation of shared care rules in relation to family payments in 2000, and we are still waiting for Senator Vanstone to verify that this undertaking was even made. It is for precisely this reason that Labor insisted on amendments to this bill to ensure that a review of the changes relating to parents and mature age unemployed people actually happens. </para><para>The reported commitment to a task force to review and monitor arrangements is a strange one. The Pearce report represents the blueprint of independent arbiters and has been endorsed by the non-government sector. Why then do we need a new process? Probably because the government and the Democrats do not propose to ever implement the Pearce recommendations. The deal contains a commitment to involve the Ombudsman in reviewing breaching activity. Labor moved a motion, supported by the Democrats last year, which gave effect to this process.</para><para>These amendments deal with only first breaches and only some first breaches. We accept that the amendments represent a step forward, but they do not go as far as the Pearce report recommended. However, the biggest issue is that the deal does not extend to second breaches, so the unfairness in the current system related to second breaches remains. Last year, 60,000 people received a second activity test breach. They have faced 24 per cent reductions in their income support payments for six months. The evidence shows that the error rates and the hardship caused by breaching within this population is just as damaging as that experienced by those who receive a first breach. We have no truck with those few people who are serial offenders, those whose sole aim is to cheat the system. But many people do not understand all the red tape and all the rules, and as a result their second breach arises for different reasons than their first. In our view, there is no logic in accepting that first breach penalties are unfair and in reforming these without also addressing unfair second breaches. People who say something is better than nothing in relation to these forms have a pointâand I am sure that the Australian Democrats will argue that point quite forcefully. But the real question is: how much reform is needed to achieve a fair balance? The opposition has the view on that front that the package before us today does not restore balance.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>10451</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrat amendment (4) on sheet 2905:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Page 27 (after line 4), after Schedule 1, insert:</para></quote><para>Schedule 1A<inline font-style="italic">â</inline>Amendments in relation to administrative penalties</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Social Security Act 1991</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1  Subsection 557A(1)</inline></para><para>Omit âsubsections (2) and (3)â, substitute âsubsections (2), (3), (4) and (7)â.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2  At the end of section 557A</inline></para><para>Add:</para><para>	(4)	Subject to subsection (3), if:</para></quote><para>	(a)	an activity test breach rate reduction period is applicable to a person because of an activity test breach other than:</para><para>	(i)	a breach for failing to take reasonable steps to comply with a requirement of the Secretary to undertake particular paid work as set out in a notice under subsection 541(2);

It is the amendment which introduces a reduced breach period for the first breachâfor the vast majority of breachesâif the person complies within that eight-week period. The amendment is quite extensive and deals not just with Newstart but also with special benefit, which is fairly important.</para><para>Sixty-five per cent of breaches in 2001-02 were first breaches; I think that is important to remember. The carve-outs that the government have proposed and that we have accepted are for matters which go to direct participation in the job market. They are the breaches related to failing to attend job interviews, failure to take up suitable employment, failure to disclose earnings with the intent to obtain a social security advantage, failure to complete a job seekers' diaryâand even that is fairly narrowly defined in these amendmentsâand also situations where a person becomes voluntarily unemployed. It should be noted that more generous reinstatement provisions than these will apply if they are the sole parent, mature age workers noted in the bill that stands before the government.</para><para>We estimate that around 80,000 people a year will benefit as a result of these changes and that they will see, in terms of an activity test, their breaching period reduced from 26 weeks to eight weeks. That is a reduction in financial penalty from $889 to $273. That is a very significant advance. Provided people are prepared to comply, they will be able to achieve that reduction. It is also important to note that these amendments pick up the situation where a person is unable to comply due to personal circumstances beyond their control. In those circumstances, the secretary will be able to grant the reduction in the breach period. This is a significant movement towards Pearce; but, by any stretch of the imagination, it does fall short of the recommendations of the Pearce report. But, as I said in my earlier remarks, we are on the road towards the benchmarks set by Pearce, and I think that will be continued by the work of the task force. </para><para>I want to talk briefly about second breaches. I am disappointed that we do not include second breaches in this package; I would have preferred that. There are three significant factors about second breaches. The first is that the administrative arrangements will include a much more careful definition of a second breach. In particular, the minister has agreed in the administrative arrangements to ensure that, where multiple breaches occur out of the same set of circumstances, they will be treated as a single breach. That is significant because there have been circumstances that we have been aware of, and that welfare rights have been aware of, where people have been breached one, two or three times out of the same set of circumstancesâsuch as sickness or whateverâ and have rapidly moved from one breach to three breaches in a very short period of time. The administrative arrangements and the new policy directive that is coming out as a result of this agreement will address that issue.</para><para>The second thing is to be aware that the personal circumstances, which Senator Bishop spoke of, are taken into account in the amendments that the Labor Party negotiated last year. There is a very large set of criteria that are going into the Social Security Act as a result of the amendments agreed to by the government and the ALP last year. They increase the number of factors a secretary must take into account before breaching a person. That is significant and I must confess that, if that was not there, we certainly would not be talking about these arrangements today.</para><para>The third thing to be aware of is that, as part of these administrative arrangements, there will be a very significant change in the quality assurance auditing of breach decisions and a continuing review of a specific sample of breach decisions. The objective is to get around what the Ombudsman's report spoke about last year, which was the culture in Centrelink of ignoring the law and ignoring policy directives, and breaching people anyway, in particular not checking people's personal circumstances or whether they had a reasonable excuse. I accept that there has been some change and improvement in Centrelink's processes since April last year, but those notions of quality assurance, of audit and of mandatory review of a sample of breach decisions will result in a continuing enforcement of the need to change Centrelink's culture and ensure that breach decisions are directly in line with the law and with the policy directives of Centrelink. I think the combination of those three factors will result in many fewer second breaches than there have been in the recent past.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>10458</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move government amendment (1) on sheet QB 204:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 1 (line 8) to page 2 (line 6), omit the clause, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">2</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Commencement</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, on the day or at the time specified in column 2 of the table.

As I said in my earlier comments, there are elements of this bill that return some spending to the social security system, but these alone are not enough. Even the architect of the government's welfare reform review, Mr McClure, does not believe that the welfare reform process engaged in by the government has been productive or fair. Last week, Mr McClure said that the government's welfare reform program is `unbalanced and uneven'. He said the government is placing too great an emphasis on individual obligations and not enough on business and the community. He is right about this. As I have already said, the package of amendments agreed to today are better than none at all but, in our view, they are not enough. Real welfare reform needs to be a two-way street. For too many years it has been all one way, to the detriment of Australians living on or close to the poverty line. If we are serious about ensuring that every Australian has access to opportunitiesâa fair goâour social security system rules must reflect that. They do not now; they will not with this package. That is why we will not be supporting this legislation today.</para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the report of the committee be adopted.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

This will assist Australian businesses seeking to attract key personnel to Australia. It recognises the vital importance to Australia of an internationally competitive tax regime and allows businesses to reduce the additional extra costs they typically incur in employing temporary residents. </para><para>Removing disincentives to the temporary employment of skilled overseas workers will be of particular benefit for skill intensive industries, and will assist in attracting and retaining regional headquarters and offices. </para><para>Equally importantly, the exemptions will make it easier to attract workers in areas where Australia is experiencing skill shortages. </para><para>The amendments include an exemption from Australian tax on foreign source income and capital gains for a maximum period of 4 years to temporary residents. This exemption applies only where that income or gain is not associated with Australian employment or services performed while a resident of Australia. The amendments will also exempt temporary residents from interest withholding tax obligations associated with overseas liabilities. </para><para>Secondly, the bill exempts from income tax compensation payments for the loss of defence remuneration where the remuneration itself would have been exempt from income tax.</para><para>Thirdly, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to treat previously assessable income as not assessable where it must be repaid and that repayment occurs in a later year of income. It also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to permit amendments of income tax assessments for the year in which the amount was originally treated as assessable income despite the time limit for amendments to assessments being exceeded. </para><para>Fourthly, the bill also increases the level of expenses above which the medical expenses tax offset applies from $1,250 per annum to $1,500 per annum. For the 2002-2003 and later income years, the medical expenses tax offset will be available at a rate of 20 per cent of any net medical expenses above $1,500 in an income year. This measure was announced in the 2002-2003 Budget. </para><para>Finally, an income tax exemption is granted to the Commonwealth Games Federation.

However, I will not speak at the other stage. I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline>. It covers a range of measures designed to improve taxation laws. It is a series of bandaid measures, of catch-all for an overly complicated tax system. The breadth of measures indicates how many bandaids are required for the tax system. It deals with temporary residents and international tax, Defence Force personnel compensation, amendment to tax assessments outside the standard four-year time frame, increasing the threshold for the health expenses rebate and income tax exemptions for the Commonwealth Games Federation.</para></talk.start><para>The government has put this bill before us today to urgently get it through prior to the seven-week break, which we accept, it being a tax bill. But I will make the point which we have been making throughout the past few days that the Democrats have pushed for the Senate to sit for longer to avoid this backlog of legislation. I remind the Senate that this is the second least number of sitting weeks since 1988, except for an election year. We really should not be in the position that we are inâin Marchâof having to shovel through this legislation. We are still lacking comprehensive legislation on the taxation of trusts, the international tax regime and tax simplification in general. Apparently we still have two tax acts interacting, the older one written in 1936 and all the modern ones we have been shovelling onto it ever since. They do not quite fit, even though they are called one tax act. I always think of them as two kinds.</para><para>The government has put this bill forward to us. The Democrats will support the legislation as a whole. However, there is an area which we have difficulty with. The first part of the bill deals with a range of taxation exemptions from Australian tax for individuals who are considered to be temporary residents or temporary Australians. They create a new concept, which is a temporary resident. This is a person who is a resident under Australia's tax laws but who will not be taxed on their worldwide income. The Democrats will not be supporting this measure at this time.</para><para>The measures in this bill are a small part of a greater problem. They are supported by international tax and industry experts, but they do nothing to stop the international tax avoidance industry. Instead, they are designed to improve Australia's attractiveness as a destination for foreign expatriates. Making Australia internationally competitive is an admirable aim as long as the essential government functions are being adequately resourced. To achieve both objectives we do need a comprehensive review. The government has started this process but not yet released its findings. It has undertaken a comprehensive review of international taxation with the delicious name of RITA. RITA was introduced by the Treasurer on 2 May 2002 and the consultation paper issued by Treasury in August last year covered the broad spectrum of international tax issues. Chapter 5 was headed `Improving Australia's tax treatment of foreign expatriates'. I note the CPA summary of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform discussion stated:</para><quote><para>Â·	on chapter 5 issues (improving the tax treatment of expatriates), it was suggested that any changes here should ensure equality between permanent and temporary residents, particularly bearing in mind the current political sensitivities on this topic. While not a high priority, some thought to do nothing could send the wrong message to foreign investors. The RBT proposal for departing expats to give security for deferred CGT liabilities was not supported. It was also noted that the real problem in this area was Australia's high marginal tax rates ...</para></quote><para>The government will now have received the Board of Taxation's report on the review. Our preference is for the current measures proposed within this bill to be included within the review. In this way, a complete approach to the international tax environment can be achieved.</para><para>The Democrats have never been anti-industry or anti-business and are not attempting to stop Australia becoming a regional headquarters for business. In fact we fully support it: the intention to make Sydney a financial centre is an example. But we recognise that some changes are required in the longer term to improve Australia's tax competitiveness, and we would prefer a holistic approach. </para><para>The Business Coalition for Tax Reform is requesting a 1 July 2003 start date for some the specific reform measures. This is achievable if the government outlines its intention and enters into appropriate consultation processes with the Senate as soon as possible. We will be keen to review and possibly pass those amendments as part of that process with a 1 July 2003 commencement date. The Democrats will undoubtedly be criticised for not supporting this measure at that time. In our defence, other than seeking to include these measures within RITA, there are a couple of other comments I feel are appropriate to make. These provisions would have applied from 1 July 2002. The Democrats refusing this part of the bill is unlikely to have any impact on the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for foreign expatriates this year. Therefore, in the current financial year 2002-03, we would welcome the measures being included in the RITA package and we are prepared to consider them on that basis. I am conscious of the fact that in denying this provision we will put back an additional $50 million into the budget. Given the stress Mr Costello says that he is under for his surplus, maybe every little bit helps. Undoubtedly the government will decide to spend this money conducting their war in IraqâI know that is their priority at the moment. We would prefer to bring the 2,000 troops home, as you know, and spend the money on domestic needs, but that is not to be. </para><para>The government is struggling to support medical measures. It is struggling to look favourably at the improvements in the salaries of parliamentary staff. It is struggling at all sorts of levels to raise wages. In this environment, raising the wages of expatriates perhaps comes lower than those other needs. These reforms will assist wealthy foreign executives that have not exactly covered themselves in glory in recent times. Steve Jones returned to North Carolina with $30 million in options, bonuses and redundancy pay. Another American Paul Anderson took $18 million from BHP in retirement and redundancy bonuses. By the way, neither of these people were affected or deterred from coming to Australia by our current tax laws. Shareholders and employees of Suncorp and BHP are among the many that have been outraged by high payments which do not necessarily link with performance.</para><para>I must sayâand it is actually at an emotional level, and the minister before the Senate was not in the early debate on the corporate side of thingsâthere is a level of real anger about the executive and director community and, frankly, in that climate where they have not done the right thing by Australia in so many cases, it is very difficult for this chamber to look favourably upon a measure which will end up putting $50 million into their pockets. So that is an important matter.</para><para>The Democrats support the measure to exempt from income tax the payment of compensation to ADF and reserve personnel for loss of deployment allowances as a result of injury occurring while performing their duties. That is a particularly important measure at this time. The Democrats through our leader and defence spokesperson, Senator Bartlett, have continually expressed our commitment and support for Australian Defence Forces and we support these measures for that reason above all else.</para><para>The third schedule to the bill amends the ITAA 1997 to treat previously assessable income as not assessable income nor exempt income where the taxpayer must repay an amount in a later year of income. As an interesting aside, we note that Brad Keeling has today been assessed for a tax liability for tax penalties and interest of $8 million. These sorts of measures are interesting in that perspective.</para><para>Increasing the threshold for health expenses rebate is an area which we noted with a little concern. It should be noted that the rebate only applies to 20 per cent of the expenses over the $1,250 limit, so you currently have to spend $1,250 on medical expenses before you get the first marginal dollar back. This seems tough but it is clearly part of the government's desire to hammer at Australians on the public system. That may seem harsh to you but that is a reading you can make of this because the government is presently subsidising private health insurance, we think wrongly, to the tune of $3 billion. As you know, we have consistently argued that should be means tested, and there is another billion dollars you can put towards your surplus if you fancy recovering costs somewhere else. I will leave my remarks at that and cut short the debate accordingly. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10464</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank each of my Senate colleagues Senator Ludwig and Senator Murray for their contributions. I do regret that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 will not pass because it does contain a number of very important measures, but I am pleased that the expat measure might find favour at some later stage at least with Senator Murray. I just want to make a few brief comments, and I will be brief given the hour and the constraints on the Senate's time. </para></talk.start><para>In this bill the government is continuing to deliver on its promise of tax reform, and that is why I do want to make a few remarks. In regard to the measures to give foreign income exemptions to temporary residents, I acknowledge that there has been some concern, but I do not think it is justified. As has happened before, the measure has been attacked as a special concession for rich foreign executives. In my view this kind of criticism not only is unwarranted but also misses the mark. </para><para>The measure will apply to people who would have been Australian residents for tax purposes but who are only here on temporary entry visas. Labour market intelligence undertaken by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in the latter half of 2001 identified a national shortage of accountants, registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and information and communication technology professionalsâcertainly not the big end of town. People granted a temporary resident visa to come to Australia to alleviate the above skills shortages could benefit from the temporary resident tax exemption. These are really the kinds of people who will benefit most from the measure, not the rich foreign executives so often talked about.</para><para>I also want to make a very brief comment on the supposed relevance of the process called RITAâthe review of international tax arrangementsâand the relationship to the expatriates measure. I think once again there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevance of the measure to the review of international tax arrangements, the so-called RITA review. I want to emphasise that the expatriates measure was a Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommendation. The Ralph review did not look at international tax issues in a comprehensive way; instead, Ralph identified the most pressing areas for reform and actually identified the expats measure as being so important that it warranted a stand-alone measure. It was seen to be a real barrier to the flow of skilled workers into Australia, and the impediment was recognised as affecting Australia's international competitiveness. So the expat measure is contrary to the suggestions of both Labor's and the Democrats' stand-alone measure. There is nothing in the RITA review that would change or affect the expats measure. On the contrary, the review is based on the enactment of the measure, so the review proceeds on the assumption that this measure that is being rejected tonight is passed.</para><para>The measure has already been the subject of extensive consultation during and after the Ralph review, and there is considerable, if not overwhelming, support from a wide range of groups. It is simply a barrier to the competitiveness of Australian business, and it is a matter of great regret that the opposition in the Senate has decided not to support it. It is also a fundamental disappointment that other very important measures in the bill will not pass. Significantly, the bill exempts from income tax compensation payments for the loss of defence remuneration where the remuneration itself would have been exempt from income tax. This is particularly important at this time, with our defence forces deployed overseas. It ensures that, where the ADF member returns to Australia because of an injury sustained in service, the lump sum compensation payment received for the loss of the deployment allowance is exempt from tax. </para><para>The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to treat previously assessable income as not assessable where it must be repaid and that repayment occurs in a later year of income. The bill will also increase from $1,250 per annum to $1,500 per annum the level of expenses above which the medical expenses tax offset applies. It was a budget measure and it is once again very regrettable that it will not be passed in this bill. Finally, the bill will grant an income tax exemption to the Commonwealth Games Federation. This is a series of very important measures in the government's ongoing program of tax reform. I commend to the Senate the bill in its entirety.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10465</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10465</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to make a general remark before we start.

As the role was originally, the minister had the power to withhold such reports. This concern was reflected by the ICAA in their submission, which noted:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... the Minister's effective discretion whether to make public ... reports could be used inappropriately and limit the transparency of the Inspector-General's role. For example, the Minister could decide not to make public a report by the Inspector-General, to avoid embarrassment to the Government or the ATO.</para></quote><para>The Business Coalition for Tax Reform noted in their submission:</para><quote><para>... taxpayer confidence in, and the overall effectiveness of, the Inspector-General will depend critically on the ability of the public to examine its reports.</para></quote><para>In addition, submissions from a number of organisations stated that the inspector-general should be able to report publicly. These organisations were the Corporate Tax Association, the CTA; the International Banks and Securities Association of Australia, often referred to as IBSA; the Australian Institute of Company Directors, AICD; Taxpayers Australia; and the National Institute of Accountants.</para><para>Labor members are concerned that the minister's power to direct the inspector-general to investigate particular issues has the potential to monopolise the limited resources of the office. We are pleased that the government has taken on board Labor's views, and we find ourselves in a position to be able to support the amendments. Labor members remain concerned about some of the issues that we have gone through both in the report and during the speeches in the second reading debate directed at the <inline ref="R1628">Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002</inline>. The minister will understand that the bill has had extensive examination and, in that extensive examination, there were a range of issues about the role and the undertakings of the inspector-general and of course about whether this would duplicate functions that were already in existence.</para><para>As well as many of the concerns in the pieces that I have been able to read out, various other organisations have indicated their concerns. The AICD submission stated that the minister's power to direct the inspector-general's work program `has the potential to overload limited resources and to compromise other independent work that the IGT wishes to undertake'. So a number of issues have come up. The amendments that have been articulated in the message include the issue about the IGT's power to direct their own work program. Clause 8 on page 5, which is about the minister's discretion, has a little bit more clarity about it. The amendment improves this position by giving the inspector-general the power to incorporate the ministerial direction into their current work program. The public release of a report also assists in being able to come to a more considered opinion.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10467</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFollowing consultations over the suspension for dinner, agreements on the amendments have been reached with the government. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10467</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs you know, the review of the <inline ref="R1628">Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002</inline> indicated some concern that the institution may not end up having the effect that the government hoped for. The Australian Democrats have always taken the view that any government is entitled to try out new institutions if it believes that an effective outcome will be achieved and it will not cost a fortune. Perversely, of course, there is one problem: that it may be underfunded. If it does end up being underfunded, the government will be caught out. Apart from funding, our principal concerns related to independence, the objects and scope of the Inspector-General of Taxation and, of course, the manner of reporting and the accountability. Those were issues of some dispute. We are pleased that the government has seen fit to address thoseâin a different way to which we intended but certainly in a way which advances the causes I have outlined, namely, those of independence, scope and the ability to report. Because these issues have been addressed, we think it not necessary to insist on the full range of our amendments, or even on any of them, since those government replacement amendments are before us now. Accordingly, we will not insist on the amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>10467</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move government amendments (1) to (3) on sheet QU203:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 3 to 5), omit the clause, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">3</inline><inline font-weight="bold">  Objects of this Act</inline></para><quote><para>		The objects of this Act are to:</para></quote><para>	(a)	improve the administration of the tax laws for the benefit of all taxpayers; and </para><para>	(b)	provide independent advice to the government on the administration of the tax laws; and</para><para>	(c)	identify systemic issues in the administration of the tax laws.</para><quote><para>(2)	Clause 8, page 5 (lines 30 to 32), omit subclause (2), substitute:</para><para>	(2)	The Inspector-General may be directed, in writing, by the Minister to conduct a review.

It has been clear in all the government's public statements on the inspector-general proposal that the inspector-general is being established for the purpose of giving independent advice to the government on tax administration. The government is also keen to ensure that a systemic issue of tax administration may be reviewed by the Inspector-General of Taxation. However, the government has taken note of the concerns expressed during debate on the bill regarding the government's ability to direct the inspector-general to conduct a review. The government is therefore proposing an amendment to clause 8(2) of the bill, which would ensure that the minister remains able to direct the Inspector-General of Taxation to conduct a review. The amendment would, however, allow the inspector-general to prioritise the direction after taking into consideration his or her other work priorities in accordance with clause 9. </para><para>Another issue is whether reports by the inspector-general would be released. The inspector-general is required to make an annual report to the parliament. The minister is required to table this report within 15 days of receipt. In the government's response to the Board of Taxation report on the inspector-general that I released on 16 September last year, the government agreed that it was important for the inspector-general's reports on reviews into systemic tax administration issues be released publicly to maintain the respect and cooperation of taxpayers and their advisers. The government has therefore decided to amend clause 11 of the bill to require the minister to table or publicly release a report of the inspector-general within a specified time frame. Normally this would be within 25 sitting days of the minister receiving a report. However, the amendment also provides that the inspector-general may recommend that, due to special sensitivities or complexities in a particular report, the publication deadline may be extended. </para><para>The government believes these amendments address some concerns raised about transparency of the inspector-general reports while at the same time addressing the legitimate concern of ensuring that the public release of reports is achieved in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary speculation or uncertainty in the tax system. I thank my colleagues and commend them. I think that these are sensible accommodations, which will achieve very good measures that will certainly support the interest of all taxpayers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>10469</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer is yes.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10469</page.no><id.no>R1660</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>10469</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives returning the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002, acquainting the Senate that the House has disagreed to the amendments made by the Senate, and requesting the reconsideration of the bill in respect of the amendments disagreed to by the House.</para><para>Ordered that the message be considered in Committee of the Whole immediately.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10469</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.</para></motion><para>Last night and this morning we had a comprehensive and very good debate on the <inline ref="R1660">Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002</inline> and the amendments. I made the point at the time that some of the amendments moved by the Democrats and by the Australian Labor Party were very attractive to the governmentâand I will try to deal with them in a logical order. The Australian Labor Party amendment in relation to superannuation trustees was, without any doubt, delivered to the Senate relatively late in the game, although I respect the fact that Senator Conroy has been proposing this policy in broad terms for a period. However, the detail of the amendment has been before the Senate for less than 24 hours. Although I said that I was initially attracted to some of the principles in the amendment, I would like there to be a diligent process to deal with that and it is something that the joint statutory committee should look at, and the government is happy to look at that.</para><para>Turning to the amendments that deal with the principal policy of the repayment of directors' bonuses which this bill seeks to address, some amendments moved, I think from memory by both the Labor Party and the Democrats, on their face seek to enhance the government's policy objective, but they could potentially have perverse effects. By way of example, I refer to the amendment about the extension of the repayment of directors' bonuses principle to executives. I mentioned earlier today that executives were not defined properly in the law. That is something that no doubt could be overcome relatively easily and the government, if it chose to accept the principle, would undertake to do that.</para><para>The principle of seeking a director to repay a bonus is based on the fact that the director by his or her very duty will know if the company is moving towards insolvency and, for that director to vote themselves a pay rise or bonus knowing that the company is heading south, is something of which an executive by their very nature may not be aware. An executive may be running one section of a business that may be doing relatively well and that person could not be expected to be aware of the solvency or the overall financial health of the business because that duty may not be in their duty statement. That is one of the principal and policy reasons why that needs to be considered further. I am quite prepared and very happy, although it does not need me to give it any support, for that amendment and indeed these other amendments to be considered by the joint statutory committee. If that committee finds merit in them, and if the government sees merit in the committee's report, I am happy for any amendments in that regard to be made part of the CLERP 9 legislation.</para><para>I want to make a number of undertakings to the chamber in the event that I get passage of the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002 tonight in an unamended form. I want to make some commitments about the process of CLERP 9. Within a matter of weeks of the program set down for CLERP 9 the government has effectively been able to keep it on schedule. As I recall, the schedule was to have the CLERP 9 final policy released in April. I can report to the chamber that we are on schedule to do that. The timetable for CLERP 9 is a public timetable. The next part of the process is to have the government turn the CLERP 9 proposal into a policy. That policy is already well documented and the Treasurer and I have both made some commitments as to how it will be enhanced. </para><para>When CLERP 9 was launched, the government had already commenced a legislative reform process, in the reform of section 300A, of directors' remuneration and the remuneration of other executives. We have decided since then to bring that area under CLERP 9 and I have made a number of speeches and public statements about how the provisions of the law at the moment should be expanded. I have ensured that the words `up-front' and `in real-time' become part of the government's policy commitment that we are seeking to fulfil in CLERP 9.</para><para>Could I also reiterate that in the debate on this bill earlier today I said that the amendment that Senator Conroy moved in very good faith in relation to remuneration would not capture some of the behaviour he talked about. He referred, for example, to the behaviour not of directors and executives but of employees. I believe that if you want an effective regime you need to go to employees who in some circumstancesâand Senator Conroy named some namesâenjoy far greater remuneration than executives and directors. You would need to capture that. My expert advice is that Senator Conroy's amendment will not capture those other employees.</para><para>In addition, as for Senator Conroy's idea of having the remuneration policies voted on by shareholders, the reality is that for the 12 months leading up to the annual general meeting, where shareholders get to vote on the policyâand it can only be a plebiscite type indicative ballot; it is not a binding ballotâthe shareholders, and Senator Conroy knows this and does not contest it, will effectively be passing a poll that passes judgment on that policy. We believe that is a good principle because, as Senator Conroy said, it does send a signal to the management, the board, that their policies are inappropriateâ and Senator Conroy quoted the example of Vodafone. But the reality is that could occur up to 12 months after the remuneration agreement with a particular executive or employee has already been entered into.</para><para>I therefore say that CLERP 9 seeks to addressâand I believe will addressâthose issues. I think it is fair to say that it will seek to pick up many of Senator Conroy's constructive suggestions, but that in all areas it will go further and wider. My hope is that it will allow us to ensure that not only is the behaviour captured but there is a severe penalty for not complying with it. That is what has been missing. CLERP 9 is on schedule and I make the commitment that, if I can get the legislation on repayment of directors' bonuses passed through the parliament tonight in the form that the government presents it, as with the previous CLERP bills when I was previously in this portfolio, I will make availableâand most Corporations Law legislation is exposed for a period of three months under the corporations agreement where we have agreed with the states that these changes to the law are exposed publicly for three months; that is a public exposure process outside all of the parliamentary processesâthe CLERP 9 legislation to the committee as an exposure draft as soon as it is publicly released.</para><para>There is a benefit for me in doing that, because it means that I do not have to wait until the legislation is formally introduced for it to go to the joint committee. It can actually speed up the process. It is my hope that, with the cooperation which I think is evident all around the chamber on these principles, the CLERP 9 legislation, having been exposed and sent to the joint statutory committee on its release as an exposure draft, will be able to be given passage through this place before the end of this calendar year. I rely, of course, on the cooperation of everyone in the chamber to achieve this, but that is my hope. I think that process will be a test. You will not have to trust me on this; you will be able to have the legislation before your committee before the end of this financial year and voted into law before the end of this calendar year. </para><para>Senator Murray raised a point in the debates earlier about the provisions of the repayment of directors' bonuses bill, which he has moved by way of amendment, that cut off the loopholes for directors in relation to what Senator Conroy has called `golden hellos' and other benefits which can currently be exempt from the provisions that directors need to put before an annual general meeting and have voted on affirmatively by the body of the members. In other words, directors do require their remuneration to be voted on, but there are exemptions. CLERP 9 addresses those exemptions.</para><para>We believe that the CLERP 9 amendments are likely to in fact cut off more loopholes than Senator Murray's amendments. Senator Murray's intent would be to try to close those by 1 July this year. It is his honourable reason for trying to have them progressed today, so that they apply from 1 July. The practical reality in Australia is that most of the companies which have created the public furore and have caused people to lose faith in the Australian marketplace have already had their annual general meetings. So Senator Murray's intent will not, in my view, necessarily capture that behaviour or force those companies to come within the spirit and the intent of the law. If we are able to pass CLERP 9 and if the joint committee is satisfied with what I am alluding to tonight, Senator Murray's ambition to capture that behaviour will have been achieved, because the annual general meetings that occur in the financial year 2003-04 and, more particularly, calendar year 2004 will be achieved because CLERP 9 will be law.</para><para>I give those commitments to the chamber because I believe there is significant unanimity about the need for reform in this area. There is significant harmony between the amendments proposed in all but the super trustee ones; they are in a slightly separate bracket. But, in terms of remuneration disclosure and the provisions about closing off loopholes for directors' retirement benefits, there is significant harmony between the proposals. Therefore I foresee very little trouble in getting CLERP 9 legislated because I am quite confident that the provisions will be seen to be significant. My risk is that I bring in proposals that would not pass the tests applied by the Labor Party and the Democrats. I am, of course, aware of that risk but I am confident that I will pass those tests and that we can achieve that.</para><para>I would ask senators to reconsider the amendments. I would ask that they consider the fact that there is unanimity on the core of this bill and I think it is desirable to have this legislation in place now. We can get this doneâit is something that we all agree on, although some senators would like there to be some enhancements. We know that there are opportunities for further enhancement but we agree, here and now, on the repayment of directors' bonuses thing and what I am appealing for is to get that law into place tonight. It can pass this place, it can be out to Yarralumla and approved by the Executive Council and it can be the law of the land within daysâand we have all agreed on it. I have given you commitments now on the record in relation to the process and the development and the putting into law, over the coming months, of the provisions on which we have not reached full agreement. I seek your support in this endeavour.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>10471</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn one point of detail, I am a little confused as to Senator Ian Campbell's concern about not capturing these people. I think a straightforward reading of the amendment that we have moved, in actual fact, clearly indicates that we will capture the people we are talking about. But to some degree that is a debate for another day. I am sure we will be back to this and I am sure Senator Murray will be back to this when we do get around to dealing with CLERP 9. I am disappointed that the government has failed again to take up the opportunity that it has before itâdisappointed but not surprised. This is a government that has talked and talked about executive remuneration and corporate governance and has done nothing. The Howard government are good at talking about obscene salaries because they have had heaps of practice. They keep talking about it but never get around to actually doing anything. Back in 1996, in response to the $1.24 million pay rise to the Coles Myer CEO, Peter Bartelsâthis is 1996, Senator Murrayâthe Prime Minister, Mr Howard said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>I hope that I would have the support of all members of this parliament when I say to the working men and women of Australia that we would understand if you felt that there was one law for you and one law for the rest of the community.

You have to admire the seven years of consistently talking about corporate governance and doing nothing. And Senator Ian Campbell comes before us today and says: `Trust me. We are going to do something.' This piece of legislation is flawed, it is feeble and it will fail in its intent. It is a sham designed to get the Prime Minister off the hook on talkback radio when he gets asked these uncomfortable questions. We know that because last year when the government produced its much heralded CLERP 9 discussion paper there were 202 pages and 44 recommendations, and the words `executive remuneration' were not included. This government has been dragged screaming and kicking. Finally, Senator Ian Campbell and the government were flushed out and they came up with a second-hand idea from the ASX Corporate Governance Council that they want to wave in front of people and say, `We are going to be tough on executive remuneration.'</para><para>As they say, the devil is in the detail. We will be waiting; the chamber will be waiting; the parliament will be waiting; and we will be putting back those challenges to Senator Ian Campbell and the government. It is with great disappointment that I accept that this bill is better passed in its original form than not passedâbut not by much, I have to tell you. I said it is feeble, it is flawed and it will fail. I will buy Senator Campbell a bottle of champagne the day the first prosecution is successful under this legislation.

I would actually die for a researcher who could dig up such quotes from goodness knows where. The poor old Prime Minister must worry about all the things he has had to say over 25 years. I cannot remember what I said in the last year, never mind in 25 years. Senator McGauran really did get you off the hook, Senator Conroy, because, as I understand the agreement between France and Australia, the word `champagne' only now applies to products from France. You were up for a minimum of 50 bucks, I would suggest, and Senator McGauran got you down to a maximum of 20. I was worried that Senator Conroy, as a non-drinker, might be offering you one of the more cheaply priced versions of sparkling wine in Australiaâaround $4.50 or so on. But I think you will have to go a bit stronger.</para></talk.start><para>Anyway, back to the matter at hand. A serious point has been made on both sides, by Senator Campbell and Senator Conroy. The serious point is this: Senator Campbell recognises that there is now a unanimity of intentionâI think that is the best way to express it. I think all three of us would also recognise that the virtue of the debaters here is their knowledge of the field and the fact that they have been consistently involved, and are likely to be consistently involved in the future, in debating this area. In other words, we know each other and we know what to expect from each other.</para><para>We then return to the point that Senator Conroy made. It is quite clear that the government understands that the opposition and the Democrats feel very strongly in this area. We will seek to have the intent of our policy direction expressed or reflected in CLERP 9. It should not be that difficult since there is unanimity of intent. Senator Campbellâ through you, Madam Temporary ChairmanâI think the other virtue of this debate is that when CLERP 9 eventually gets to cabinet to be ticked off on, you will be able to advise the cabinet what sort of mood and attitude there is in the Senate towards these key issues and, hopefully, that will affect and influence those who have the task of considering how these matters are turned into legislation. </para><para>For that reason in particular I welcome the debate, the confrontation of ideas and the presentation of amendments as designed. It has enabled us all to shake out the moths a bit and to understand exactly what we intend and what we seek to achieve. I have advised both Senator Conroy and Senator Campbell that the Democrats share the view that this bill is an advance on present law. We think it is a pity that it does not go anywhere near far enough to address the appalling state that miscreants in the corporate world have got us into with the various conspiracies and crimes, which they have been committing with regard to remuneration. We think, therefore, we should not insist on our amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>10473</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have one final, late-breaking addition to the corporate snouts in the trough.

A fundamental change in this legislation is the privatisation of the Australian Dairy Corporation and its registration as a Corporations Law company, known as Dairy Australia Ltd. The Dairy Research and Development Corporation will be abolished and its functions will be transferred to the company.</para></talk.start><para>The reform bill gives the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the authority to declare an industry services body to receive and expend industry levy funds and matching Commonwealth R&amp;D funds. The industry services body will deliver the services currently delivered by the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, with minor exceptions. The levy bill consolidates three existing industry levies into a new levy known as the dairy service levy. All payers of the dairy service levy will be eligible for membership of the company and will also be entitled to vote at periodic polls on the levy rate. The proposed industry service model is similar in character to that introduced by government in recent years in relation to the meat, wool, horticulture and pork industries. </para><para>The Senate recently agreed to the passage of legislation consolidating the delivery of services to the egg industry in a single industry services body. Labor has previously expressed concern about the consolidation of industry functions in single industry service bodies. Nonetheless, we have not opposed these changes because we have, on each occasion, received assurances of strong support from the respective industries. The changes before us come with the same assurance, delivered by the government and representatives of Australian Dairy Farmers Ltd and Australian Dairy Products Federation Inc.</para><para>In relation to previous industry structural changes, Labor has asserted the need to maintain accountability of expenditure for public funds. The privatised ADC will manage $35 million in levy funds and $15 million in matching Commonwealth research and development funding each year. The capacity for the parliament to scrutinise the expenditure of these funds is clearly degraded in the transfer from a statutory corporation to a Corporations Law model. In his second reading speech in the other place, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, said that the new company will receive levy funds and matching contributions so long as it remains accountable for them to both levy payers and the parliament. Appropriate accountability measures in respect of levy payers will be imposed on the company through the Corporations Law. </para><para>The reform bill provides for a funding contract between the Commonwealth and the company. This funding contract will impose a reporting requirement on the company, but that will require reporting to the minister onlyâthat is, despite the assurance from Mr Truss that the company will be accountable to the parliament, there is no provision for such accountability in the bill. For that reason, Labor will move to include such accountability to the parliament in the reform bill. The company will, after all, be responsible for managing about $50 million per year in levy funds and matching payments. Thirty-five million dollars will be levied by the Commonwealth for the provision of dairy industry services and $15 million of public money will be paid to the company for research and development purposes. </para><para>The concern about accountability was a matter addressed by the shadow parliamentary secretary for primary industries and resources, Mr Sid Sidebottom, during debate on these bills in the other place. It is a matter that I have addressed with the minister's office, the department and the industry. I have been mildly concerned by the affront on the part of some industry representatives that the parliament might require some reporting to it on the expenditure of levy and matching funds. The proposed company will have special obligations as the declared industry services body for the Australian dairy industry. This company will have the privilege of expending very substantial sums of money levied by the Commonwealth and substantial matching R&amp;D funding.</para><para>Accountability was a focus of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee during its recent inquiry into the provisions of these bills, as noted in the committee report presented earlier today. The amendments I will move on behalf of the opposition are consistent with the comments of Labor senators in the report of the committee. It is appropriate to note that some accountability measures introduced by Labor in this chamber in respect of changed pig industry service arrangements have been incorporated in the reform bill. These measures include the requirement that a declaration of an industry service body be tabled in each house of the parliament and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. I note and endorse the requirement that the minister table an annual report in relation to the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund by the industry services body. Our concern about accountability is no surprise to the government and I look forward to its support for our simple amendments to strengthen the accountability regime.</para><para>I want to note a matter concerning the restriction on so-called agri-political activity that the government proposes to place on the industry services body. The current levy principles and guidelinesâthat is, the guidelines that apply to all leviesâsay that statutory levies are not to be used to fund agri-political activities. The principle is reasonable; the problem is that the government has not worked out what that means. The current draft constitutionâdraft 4, I believeâsays that, so long as the company is the services body, it must not knowingly engage in or support, directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise, political campaigning or political funding. The funding contract will further define the meaning of agri-political conduct but the definition in the current draft reads: being reviewed.</para><para>Unlike the constitution, which is now in its fourth draft, just one draft of the funding contract has been prepared. Prohibitions apply in relation to other industry service bodies, but the prohibition is not consistent from industry to industry. I am, frankly, not surprised. Some weeks ago I sought advice from the minister's office and the department on whether the proposed prohibition in the company constitution would be consistent with that in the Australian Pork Ltd constitution. I was told there was no such prohibition in the APL constitution, and the dairy arrangement would be breaking new ground. The department offered the same advice to the Senate inquiry. This is despite the fact that the APL constitution, available on the company web site, provides a very clear prohibition on agri-political conduct. It contains a four-part definition and provides what a director of that company must do if, in his or her opinion, the company proposes to engage in conduct which might constitute such activity.</para><para>The misunderstanding and confusion on the part of the government about the existence of the APL constitutional provision reflects the failure of the government to come to terms with all the implications of the new industry service models it has embraced in dairy and in other industries. It is reasonable to impose a ban on the use of statutory levies and matching funds for agri-political purposes, but it is equally reasonable to impose a consistent prohibition across industries. </para><para>I want to address what I see as a fundamental problem with the government's management of the dairy industry service reform program. The proposed start-up date for the company is 1 July 2003, a matter of some weeks away. The constitution and funding agreementâboth documents that have to be agreed between the Commonwealth and the companyâare not anywhere near finalisation. I understand negotiations on the funding agreement only commenced this week. No regulations have been prepared. Mr Truss, the responsible minister, said in the other place on 6 March this year:</para><quote><para>I note the comments from the opposition that they have not yet got access to the proposed constitution of the new company and the memorandum of understanding. I acknowledge that. I do not have a copy of it either; it is in preparation.</para></quote><para>The minister also said:</para><quote><para>It is our intention ... to have the draft of those available to the Senate at the time that they are dealing with their inquiry into this legislation. To the best of my knowledge, there are no significant issues but it is reasonable that the House should have access to those sorts of matters in the context of dealing with the legislation, and it is certainly our intention that that would happen.</para></quote><para>Mr Truss went on to say:</para><quote><para>The house is entitled to a look at those documents, and it is certainly our intention to deliver in that regard.</para></quote><para>Despite the minister's stated intentions, he did no more than deliver an early draft of the constitution, the first draft of the funding contract and no draft of the subordinate legislation. In respect of the proposed regulations, we are told that even the drafting instructions have not been prepared. It is Labor's contention that the minister has completely mucked up the introduction of the industry structure. Most importantly, in doing so he has let the industry down.</para><para>The opposition sought to deal with the legislation expeditiously but has been forced to confront unreasonable deadlines based on incomplete information. It is only the advice from industry that a delay to the establishment of the company is undesirable that has caused the opposition to agree to support its passage on the basis of the incomplete information from the government. There is a sense of deja vu about the administration of the reform proposal. Almost every industry reform process managed by Mr Truss has been the subject of the same disorganisation. We do not think it is good enough. We hope that the minister's conduct does not delay the commencement of the new industry structure or impede its effective operation due to the imperfect arrangements agreed in the current mad rush to finalise the arrangements. It is important to remember that the changes proposed in these bills did not evolve overnight. While the passage of the dairy industry legislation reform bill in October last year permitted the ADC to fund the development of the final model, the proposal is not unexpected. It is a mistake for the minister to blame problems on the timetabling of his own legislation.</para><para>The opposition will be supporting the legislation, subject to the passage of amendments which are in circulation. I expect that they will be passed and it is our hope that the government will accept them. I can do no more than stress again that this is a set of arrangements whereby we are effectively equipping a private company with the power to impose, through the mechanism of the parliament, a charge, a levy, on all industry participants with no exception. That is a serious matter and we take it very seriously. That is why we are insisting that the processes that are followed are proper, and that proper consideration is given to all of the matters that are relevant to this debate. I intend to address those matters further in the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>10476</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are debating the <inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1738">Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003</inline>. These bills, as Senator O'Brien has pointed out, convert the Australian Dairy Corporationâthe ADCâinto a company under the Corporations Act to be known as Dairy Australia and transfer the assets of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to the new company, merging the R&amp;D and marketing arms of the dairy industry. The levies bill provides for the imposition of a new levyâthe dairy service levyâto replace the current dairy promotion, research and corporation levies. The bills also provide that the levy will be determined by the minister following a ballot of dairy levy payers and a recommendation based on that ballot being provided to the minister. The levy payments will then be paid by the government to Dairy Australia, which will be a private company limited by guarantee, out of which appropriate payments will be made. Determinations of the allocations of funding by Dairy Australia will be done by its board, which will be elected by the same voting system as will apply to the determination of levies. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats referred this bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee because we were concerned about the proposed structuring and some of the accountability issues that arise out of this particular arrangement. This is the third occasion in recent years when the Senate has considered the effective privatisation of a statutory agricultural body into a private company structure. The Democrats are of the view that the first two experiments have not been particularly great successes. To be honest, we believe it would be appropriate for the Senate to learn the lessons of the first two experimentsâin the meat industry and the wool industryâin deciding how we deal with the dairy industry.</para><para>It should be noted from the views expressed to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee that the Dairy Farmers Federation were quite clearly in favour of this bill, and they certainly represent the majority of dairy farmers. But a very large proportion of dairy farmers have joined a different dairy farmers organisation, the Australian Milk Producers Association. They are opposed to this bill and feel that there has been inadequate consultation. During its examination the committee looked at the question of how much industry had been consulted, particularly on the important issues of how the board would be elected and how levies would be determined, the proposed constitution for Dairy Australia and the proposed Dairy Australia structure, the details of the collection and proposed use of the dairy service levy to be imposed under the levies bill, and the accountability mechanisms proposed for Dairy Australia.</para><para>The Democrats are somewhat concerned that the structures proposed in this bill fall short of what would be reasonable accountability. We need to remember that what we are doing with this billâas Senator O'Brien has correctly pointed outâis actually setting up a private company which will receive $30 million of government funding a year. This will comprise $15 million collected compulsorily from dairy farmers, effectively as a taxâit is called a levy but it is a taxâand $15 million in matching R&amp;D funding. The funding priorities for that $30 million will then effectively be determined by the board of Dairy Australia, which will be elected by the levy payers. Senator O'Brien also referred to the concerns the committee has expressed about the lack of information before the Senate on which to make decisions. We do not have a final constitution, although a draft was provided on the first day of the committee's hearing. We do not have the draft regulations. The statutory funding agreement has yet to be finalised; we have not been provided with that. Really, we are trying to make a stab in the dark. We have the bare bones of a facilitating bill. Beyond that, we simply have to assume that $30 million of public money will be handed over to a private company each year, and it will all turn out to be all right on the night. The Democrats think this is a rather unfortunate way of determining public policy.</para><para>I am not saying that there is anything untoward in what has been proposed for Dairy Australia. But I believe it would be appropriate for the Senate, in making its decisions on these matters, to have before it all of the agreements the government proposes and for all of the funding mechanisms and accountability mechanisms to be in place, so that it can make a properly informed decision. Those were certainly the very clear conclusions and recommendations of the Senate rural and regional affairs committee, which described the situation as `less than satisfactory'. It said:</para><quote><para>... the Committee considers the Senate should be able to have access to a completed constitution to allow informed debate on the Bill. This matter is particularly important in view of the mechanism proposed for establishing the corporation, its board election system and voting structure. </para></quote><para>The committee was also somewhat critical of the proposed accountability mechanisms, stating in the report:</para><quote><para>As the Committee has noted with respect to the constitution for Dairy Australia, the Senate should ideally be aware of all provisions of basic regulatory documents before debate on the Bill proceeds.</para><para>In addition, the Committee notes that necessary regulations relevant to matters in the Billâ namely the mechanisms to be used to conduct the poll on the level of the dairy service levyâshould ideally be available to the Senate before debate proceeds.</para></quote><para>In the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to ensure that that particular recommendation is met. I will be moving an amendment to ensure that, at the very least, in terms of the determination of the recommendation on the levy, the procedures for the conduct of the poll will be included in the regulations and that the regulations will also include provisions for allocating the votes to each dairy service levy payer.</para><para>The Democrats are quite concerned about the current model proposed by the industry and accepted by the government. That model will allocate voting strength in respect of the determination of board directors and in the determination of the levy recommendation on the basis of levy paid in the previous year. That means the bigger the dairy farm the more votes they get. This is, in principleâ remembering that this is a compulsory levy being collected under this billâeffectively a tax. Essentially we are saying, `The bigger the taxpayer the more votes they should get.' That is a principle I have great difficulty applying to a publicly funded corporation, because that is effectively what this will be. It is a principle which, if applied further, would see ratepayers at the local government level allocated votes not on the basis of each ratepayer getting a vote but on the basis of the rates they pay. It is a principle that, if applied to tax law as a whole, would see the big end of town determining the votes in this place as opposed to every citizen being rendered equal.</para><para>I can accept the argument that, because this has a quasi-commercial aspect, being a private company, there should be an element of recognition of the size of levies being paid. But I think that is a matter industry needs to consider again. I accept, in terms of the evidence provided to the committee, that it is a live issue on which there are opposing viewpoints. But I do believe that the model presented in the proposed constitutionâ which, I might add, is not a matter before the Senate at the momentâis not satisfactory in terms of what our standards should be. Rather than hold up this debate discussing that, I propose that that be a matter for regulation. We will have that debate when we see the regulation from government. I am putting industry on notice tonight that the Senate has genuine and serious concerns about the voting system proposed in this bill and that we ask that industry consider alternative models.</para><para>It should be noted on the record that the voting system proposed in this bill is similar to the voting system that was put into the privatised Wool Innovation Ltd, which was set up under legislation a few years ago. I have received a number of pieces of correspondence expressing concern about how that voting system has operated in practice. The last AGM of Wool Innovation saw the previous board, which I understand attracted the support of over 60 per cent of wool growers, removed and replaced by a board supported by the larger wool growers. That is a very unfortunate outcome. I would hate to see that operate in the dairy industry.</para><para>As a Queensland senator I am concerned because 63 per cent of milk produced in Australia comes from Victoria. Whilst I think Victorians are very nice people and Victoria is a lovely place to visit, they should not be determining by a 63 per cent margin how much levy should be collected from Queensland dairy farmers and how that money is spent. A system that entrenches that Dairy Australia will always have a majority of Victorian votes and a Victorian majority in the determination of both levy and board directors concerns me.</para><para>In evidence we received it was pointed out that around 25 per cent of dairy farmers would be contributing over 50 per cent of the levy. In this system we are proposing what is, to my mind, a fairly undemocratic system. The Senate needs to put industry on notice that it is not good enough. Senator O'Brien will also move amendments in the committee stage dealing with improved accountability mechanisms to ensure that the parliament is properly apprised of how its $30 million is being spent. That is a very important issue and the Democrats will be supporting the Labor amendments. With those very short comments I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting this bill in the second reading and that we will discuss these matters very briefly in committee. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10479</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline> is the result of a dairy industry and government process aimed at providing the industry with greater ownership and control over dairy industry service arrangements. The bill provides for the conversion of the Australian Dairy Corporation into a company under the Corporations Act 2001, to be known as Dairy Australia Ltd, and for all of the assets and liabilities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, DRDC, to be transferred to this new company.</para></talk.start><para>Dairy Australia is to be a Corporations Act company, limited by guarantee, with membership comprising voting members drawn from dairy levy payers, group A members, and non-voting members made up of the peak dairy farmer and processor bodies, group B members. Dairy Australia will be responsible for undertaking functions on behalf of the dairy industry similar to those currently undertaken by the ADC and DRDC. The bill provides for the current promotion levy, research levy and corporation levy currently directed to the ADC and DRDC to be rolled into one levy, to be known as the dairy service levy; for dairy levy moneys collected by the government to flow to the new company; and for matching Commonwealth research and development contributions in relation to eligible R&amp;D expenditure by the company. Dairy Australia will also administer the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund currently administered by the Australian Dairy Corporation. For this reason, the dairy adjustment levy will also flow to the industry services body but will be quarantined from other levy amounts.</para><para>The bill makes no substantial change to the operation of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund from its current administration by the ADC other than it is to be kept and treated as a trust. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will retain joint responsibility for the solvency of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund as is currently provided for under the Dairy Produce Act.</para><para>Dairy Australia, as the industry services body, will be required to conduct periodic polls of levy payers on the rate of levy. Details on the conduct of these polls including the timing of the polls will be set out in regulations. The staff of the ADC will continue to be employed by Dairy Australia following the conversion of the ADC. Also, DRDC employees will transfer to Dairy Australia. The bill provides for the fair and equitable treatment of all staff. A human resource management strategy is being developed in conjunction with the ADC and DRDC in relation to continuous employment provisions. </para><para>In relation to the amendments proposed by the opposition I must make it clear that reform processes of this nature are about handing control to the levy payers themselves and away from the government. It is for this reason that the bill makes the company accountable to its members for its activities and to all levy payers in terms of the rate of the levy. While the Commonwealth must be satisfied through the statutory funding agreement that the levy expenditure is appropriate, it is a requirement of the company to remain accountable primarily to its members as is required under the Corporations Act. For this reason the government is willing to support the amendments proposed by the opposition. The government is also willing to support the amendments proposed by the Democrats. The constitution of Dairy Australia sets out the membership structure of the company, therefore details relating to membership will be contained in the constitution of Dairy Australia and are not dealt with in the bill. </para><para>I can tell you that Dairy Australia's membership will comprise voting members drawn from dairy levy payersâgroup A membersâ and non-voting members will be made up of the peak dairy farmer and processor bodiesâgroup B members. Group A members' voting entitlements will include one vote for every whole dollar of dairy levy paid in the financial year preceding a meeting of that company. These voting entitlements will be set out in the company's constitution and are in line with those of other privatised industry service bodies in the meat, wool, horticulture, egg and pig industries. The voting entitlements are similar to voting rights accorded to shareholders in private companies where the value of votes is linked to the shareholder's investment in the company. While Dairy Australia will not be a company limited by shares, the principles remain the same in terms of level of investment through levy payments.</para><para>In relation to voting entitlements of levy payers for the periodic levy poll as set out in the bill, it is intended that regulations governing this poll will reflect the voting entitlements for group A members of the company as laid out in the constitution. It is wholly appropriate that the investment of levy payers is reflected in the voting entitlements not only on company matters but also in relation to the poll to be conducted periodically on the rate of the levy. Finally, I would encourage all dairy farmers to examine the benefits of the new arrangements for them and also to consider becoming active members of Dairy Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10480</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>DAIRY INDUSTRY SERVICE REFORM BILL 2003</para><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>10480</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Labor amendments (1) and (2) on sheet PF211:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 51, page 35 (after line 16), at the end of section 5, add:</para><para>	(6)	The Minister must cause a copy of the contract to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the day on which the contract was entered into.</para><para>	(7)	If the contract is varied, the Minister must cause a copy of the contract as varied to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the variation occurred.</para><para> (2)	Schedule 1, item 51, page 39 (after line 7), after section 12, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">13  Tabling of financial reports</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The industry services body must, within 14 days of lodging a financial report (the <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">annual report</inline>) mentioned in section 292 of the <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Act 2001</inline>, give the Minister a copy of the report.</para><para>	(2)	The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the day on which the copy of the report was given to the Minister.</para><para>	(3)	In addition to the matters mentioned in section 295 of the <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Act 2001</inline>, the annual report must include details of the following in relation to the financial year to which the report relates:</para></quote><para>	(a)	the amount of dairy service payments and matching payments made to the industry services body;</para><para>	(b)	the amount of those payments that were spent;</para><para>	(c)	outcomes as measured against objectives that apply in relation to the industry services body.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">14  Other reports</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The Minister must, as soon as practicable after the holding of each annual general meeting of the industry services body, cause to be tabled in each House of the Parliament a report in relation to the year ending on 30 June before the holding of that meeting.</para><para>	(2)	The report must include the following in relation to that year:</para></quote><para>	(a)	a statement as to the amount of dairy service levy received by the Commonwealth;</para><para>	(b)	a statement as to whether the Minister is satisfied, on the basis of information provided by the industry services body, that the spending of dairy service payments and matching payments complies with the funding contract; and </para><para>	(c)	if the Minister is not so satisfiedâ details of why the Minister is satisfied that the spending does not so comply.</para><para>These amendments will impose reporting obligations on the industry service body and on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The industry service body will be required to provide the minister with a copy of its annual report and the minister will be required to table the report in each house of the parliament. The annual report will be required to explain how much money the company received in the previous financial year and how it was spent. The minister will be required to provide a report to the parliament on the amount of levy collected and advise the parliament whether he or she is satisfied that the money provided to the industry services body was spent appropriately. The minister will also be required to table in each house of the parliament a copy of the funding contract and/or variations between the Commonwealth and the industry services body.</para><para>The opposition believes these amendments introduce important and appropriate accountability mechanisms in the <inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline>, an area in which the bill is currently deficient. This matter has been raised, as I said, at the second reading in the House of Representatives and in the Senate committee stage. I think it is a fundamental obligation given that what we are doing here is converting a statutory authority into a private Corporations Law company but, at the same time, equipping that company through the parliament with powers, by procedure, to impose a levy on all industry participants. That power is something that does not exist throughout the community. </para><para>There are, therefore, obligations which the company must meet. But also, for the parliament to be informed, the minister must be responsible for the information provided and must provide it in the manner set out in the amendment. This will ensure that there is proper accountability for a process whereby the Commonwealth equips this company with powers which do not normally exist in the community and, in relation to matching funding by the Commonwealth, with an appropriate mechanism to scrutinise the matching fundingâwhich currently would be available through the estimates process. Indeed, all of this information would be available through the estimates processâfor example, through the Levies Management Unit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. So rather than dwell on it, I will wait to see what the response to the amendments is, and I commend them to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>10481</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be supporting these amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>10481</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrats amendment (1), as amended, on sheet 2902:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 51, page 38 (after line 15), at the end of section 9, add:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Method of conducting poll</inline></para><para>	(3)	Regulations for the conduct of a poll must include provisions allocating votes to each dairy service levy payer. </para><para>As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, the Democrats have serious concerns with the proposed voting system outlined in the Dairy Australia constitution and outlined for the determination of the levy itself. We believe that it would be better to have a more democratic method of determining vote allocations, with much more emphasis given to equality of voting whilst possiblyâas the minister suggestedârecognising the level of investment being reflected in the levy. I am not quite sure why the level of investment is so important. I would have thought that investment was an emotional thing as well as a physical thing and that every dairy farmer has a very high level of emotional investment in their farm and a deep commitment to their industry.</para><para>This particular amended amendment will ensure that the Senate itself will determine the final process for allocating votes in terms of how we look at the regulation which will come forward. This puts the industry on notice that they have to consider this issue again and take into account the arguments which are presented in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report and also in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>tonight. I hope that over the course of the next couple of weeks, as the regulations are developed in consultation with industry, some sort of consensus position is adopted that properly reflects the democracy which is inherent in the collection of a compulsory levy whilst still possibly giving some sort of allowance for a level of investment. I commend this amendment to the committee. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>10482</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI know there is a desire for expedition this evening, but I think I should say a couple of words about this amendment. The opposition will support the Democrats' amendment. In its earlier form we were prepared to support it, not on the basis that it set out a model which was ultimately desirable for the industry but rather that it would keep open the issue of the method of voting, the allocation of votes, for the striking of any levy. Our view was that, given the desire for this legislation to pass tonight, that was a means of achieving it. I am aware that industry representatives in the building today are concerned that that might pose a greater problem than would be posed by a proposal that we simply wait for the regulations and see whether we can live with themâgiven that, although it is a blunt instrument, the Senate can disallow a regulation if it is not happy with the outcome.</para></talk.start><para>It is for that reason that Labor will be prepared to support this amendment. Some might say that in part it is redundant because of the way the legislation is currently framed, but it does mark the spot with regard to the position of the opposition and the Democrats. I have said to industry representatives from a very early stage thatâand whilst this does not directly address the matter, I think it is relevantâthe voting structure in the company and the means by which people find their way onto the board seem to me to not be able to necessarily deliver the most representative board for the dairy industry. I am prepared to be persuaded otherwise, but currently I have not been so persuaded. That is a matter that is in the hands of the minister.</para><para>The passage of this legislation with the amendment will put in the hands of the parliament a means by which we can look at the power of the company to pursue a levy which has very broad support. I would not want to hold anyone to this figure, because I understand it is a rule of thumb figure, but 25 to 30 per cent of the industry would make up about 50 per cent of levy payments. Therefore, theoretically at least, 25 to 30 per cent of the industry would have a majority and would be able to determineâif their votes were aggregatedâthe level of any levy. If those principles equally flowed through into the company then they would have a disproportionate influence, given that there is a community view that one vote, one value is important. It is not always carried through in these organisations, but we are in somewhat of a new world with companies effectively being given powers by the Commonwealth to do things that were otherwise performed by statutory authorities.</para><para>I do not want to delay the Senate unnecessarily. Labor will support the amendment. It is a compromise measure; it marks the spot. It says to the industry that, if ultimately they are proposing a voting system which is one vote for each dollar of levy paidâwhich is what they are proposingâwe at this point are unconvinced about that and would reserve the right to disallow such a regulation.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 agreed to.</para><para><inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline> reported with amendments; <inline ref="R1738">Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003</inline> reported without amendment or requests; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>10482</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator TROETH (VictoriaâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (8.45 p.m.)âI move: </para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL BLOOD AUTHORITY BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10483</page.no><id.no>R1706</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10483</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>10483</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition our support for the <inline ref="R1706">National Blood Authority Bill 2002</inline>.

The shadow minister for health in the House of Representatives, Mr Stephen Smith, indicated on behalf of the Labor opposition our support for the bill and the arguments behind that, so I will not repeat the arguments tonight. It establishes, as a collaborative partnership, the new National Blood Authority and draws together national blood supply planning and management within one organisation, which we think is a good advance in terms of public policy. I indicate that on that basis we will be supporting the bill. I will respond later in the debate to the proposed Democrat amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>10483</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats want to indicate their support for the <inline ref="R1706">National Blood Authority Bill 2002</inline>. We think that it is a good step in the national coordination of and access to a key health product. The Democrats congratulate the government in gaining state agreement to establish a National Blood Authority. We think that it is evidence of how Commonwealth and state collaboration can result in a good policy outcome. The National Blood Authority will be tasked with ensuring that people, irrespective of state or hospital system, will receive blood and blood products as needed, that blood will not be wasted and that it will continue to be free. In fact, given this success, we believe that the government should be considering how to extend this model more widely. Why is it that so many programs and services are fragmented, duplicated or left unaccountable? Why is it that state and Commonwealth governments continue to argue about whose fault it is that public hospitals have long waiting lists or are too stretched to provide safe health services? Why is it that medical practitioners are overworked and cannot get locums? Why, as we are warned, will we face huge shortages of allied health workers, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists, over the next few years?</para></talk.start><para>I and indeed most health policy analysts, academics and politicians would argue that mostly the problems are to do with the lack of national coordination. This is often spoken about as being a problem of jurisdictional responsibilities, but the bottom line is that coordination is a fundamental role for the federal government. Getting the agreement of states, monitoring and facilitating access to health goods and services and, importantly, making sure people across our country are not disadvantaged by location or state are all the responsibility of the federal government. This focus on coordination to ensure universal access to all Australians should never be lost. In our view, this is a key performance indicator.</para><para>Perhaps the National Blood Authority can act as a blueprint in terms of real state and Commonwealth cooperation for health services. It demonstrates that public hospital funding through the Australian health care agreements need not be the mud-slinging, responsibility-diving affair that we have had in this place to date. It requires a standardised agreement that is delivered through a national body that has the support of both state and federal governments. In this respect, the Democrats support the establishment of an authority that has the imprimatur of both states and the Commonwealth. In the past, we have called for an independent body, given the large amount of money invested by the states and the Commonwealth and the til-the-death wrangling that is associated with deal making in an uncertain environment. If it is the case that the Commonwealth is going to continue asking for outcome data that the states cannot or will not provide then perhaps such a body will continue to be necessary. On the other hand, should the Commonwealth and states arrive at an agreement for the contributions that both should make for a smooth operation of our hospital system and should they be able to agree on a collaborative funding model then this would represent an extremely satisfactory outcome. </para><para>So how likely is such a scenario? At the moment, given the lack of trust between the parties, we think it is unlikely to occur in the near future. But I believe that there are opportunities for building on the success of collaborative models, such as the National Blood Authority, to learn how to do business in a more constructive and certain way. As an interim measure to achieve this, I believe that the Commonwealth should seriously consider the role of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is time to end the inefficient and administratively overwhelming burden of reporting by community groups and health and welfare providers in order to receive their tiny grants. Not only does each level of government require different accountability mechanisms but different departments and even different programs within the one department require different cuts of the same data and hundreds of paperwork requirements.</para><para>These people have a job to doânot a particularly well-resourced jobâand they are often insulted and frustrated by the amount of paperwork imposed by government departments, which on the whole does not get used. I recently visited the highly successful Odyssey House in Melbourne, which offers a residential rehabilitation service for drug and alcohol users. Not only was I impressed by the commitment, philosophy and expertise of the health workers, which produce some fantastic results in terms of rehabilitation, but also I was stunned by the number of streams of funding on which the organisation is dependent to continue to survive. The house has to fund a full-time position merely to record the information necessary for all those silos, in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. I congratulate Odyssey House on its ability to organise itself in such a way that its funding continues, but I challenge the government to get out of the silo mentality and think about overall outcomes for people, with accountability mechanisms that are standardised across Commonwealth and state. The AIHW would be well placed to undertake such tasks.</para><para>I turn to accountability. Every Democrat senator has at one time or another called for an end to jobs for the boys. Wherever appointments are made to the governing organs of public authoritiesâwhether they be institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi-government agenciesâthe process by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. One of the main failings of the present system is that there is no empirical evidence to determine whether the public perception of `jobs for the boys' is correct, as these appointments are not open to sufficient public scrutiny or analysis. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of the minister with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regarding the procedures for making appointments. Perhaps most importantly, there is no external scrutiny of the procedure and merits of appointment by an independent body.</para><para>The Democrats will put up amendments designed to compel ministers to make appointments on merit. We have done this on over 17 occasions over the last few years and on every single occasion Labor and the coalition have combined to block reforms. Thus the trend of parachuting the mates of a new government into lucrative positions on various boards and authorities at the expense of the taxpayer continues. However, an encouraging sign was the ALP's recent support for Senator Murray's notice of motion noting the rejection of Graeme Samuel by the majority of the states and territories as nominee deputy chairman of the ACCC. The Senate asked the federal government to ensure that it fully consults with all state and territory governments regarding Professor Fels's replacement and to establish criteria for the selection and appointment process that not just include selection on merit but specify that any candidate should be demonstrably independent and have a strong interest in consumer and small business needs. </para><para>Even the British eventually accepted appointments on merit. Lord Nolan, head of the 1995 Nolan commission, managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments be based on merit. He set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments as follows: the minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selection on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards which include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds which are sought should be clearly specified. In particular, we have used the Nolan committee's recommendations in our amendments for the last four years. The amendments I will move will increase transparency and ensure greater confidence in appointments both to the board and of the general manager of the National Blood Authority. They do so by introducing a merit based appointment system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>10485</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are dealing with an extremely important piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R1706">National Blood Authority Bill 2002</inline>, and I would have thought that at this moment it is premature. The government appointed an expert advisory group to report into hepatitis C virus in plasma in 1990, and although, as I understand it, the government has received that reportâthe minister may clarify thatâI would have thought that that report would have gone to the issues which are relevant to this piece of legislation. I note that only yesterday Senator Hutchins submitted questions on notice to the federal Minister for Health and Ageing, and those questions raise serious concerns about what is considered to be one of Australia's worst medical disasters: tainted blood. Surely the federal minister might seek a reply to these questions before the conclusion of the debate on this measure. The question is: why not? This is an area where huge numbers of Australians have suffered. There are issues that the Barraclough inquiry is expected to report on which directly relate to the management of the blood plasma supply in Australia. The passage of a new bill relating to Australia's blood supply management could be considered premature prior to the full consideration of the expert advisory group's report.</para></talk.start><para>The common criticism of Australia's blood management from frequent users of blood products and victims of infected blood has been a perceived lack of independent process regarding blood management. Who will the board members of the new National Blood Authority be? What criteria are set out for candidates for board positions and who will their advisers be? Will any former or current Australian Red Cross Blood Service or CSL Ltd executives be considered for the positions? Will the National Blood Authority consider appointing an adviser from a consumer group, a consumer group that is independent of any government funding or blood service funding?</para><para>There are a number of serious questions relating to the integrity of the blood supply that need to be addressed. I have been asking questions about this over a period of time, in particular about CJD and hepatitis C. I would like to remind the Senate of the terrible effects of these diseases on many Australians. The history of the human pituitary hormone program has a history of broken rules. It is another example of the deadly results of the technological imperative driving so much medical research and the application of that research, too often with insufficient attention to proper procedure, health risk and informed consent.</para><para>As Dr David Howes, the former chief virologist and head of the biologicals branch of the National Biological Standards Laboratory, told the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into the CJD settlement offer in October 1997:</para><quote><para>It is the consumers who will pay the heaviest price ... when the duty of care plays second fiddle to other imperatives ... </para></quote><para>Our examination of the whole CJD episode provided a window into lax processes and cover-ups by those responsible for regulating human experimentation and by those whose grave duty it is to ensure the highest standards in the regulation and manufacture of biological products derived from blood, tissue and organs. Every day, recipients must live with the possibility that they could be living incubators of the human equivalent of mad cow disease. CSL did not meet the requirements of the Australian regulatory authorities in the manufacture and distribution of hormones. It failed to follow the world's best practice in the pooling and homogenising of glands. It failed to comply with the codes of good manufacturing practice. It told pathologists to ignore the exclusion criteria about possible hepatitis infected glands.</para><para>On the issue of hepatitis C, in December I called for a judicial inquiry into the management of Australian blood products in the 1980s following the recent laying of criminal charges against the Canadian Red Cross. The Red Cross was charged with endangering the public by failing to introduce surrogate testing for hepatitis C in the 1980s. The Australian Red Cross also failed to introduce the testing in the 1980s. It is estimated that 8,000 hepatitis C casesâalmost half those who caught the chronic blood virusâwould have been prevented had it done so. The surrogate screening test for hepatitis C was used in the US from 1986. The US Food and Drug Administration advised that testing could and should be used to guard against hepatitis C, but Australian Blood Management did not act. This test was in fact introduced in Queensland in 1988 at a cost estimated by the Queensland Blood Transfusion Service of less than 5c per test. Specific testing for the hepatitis C virus was not introduced in all states until February 1990.</para><para>An inquiry is necessary to examine the way blood has been managed over the last two decades. It should look at the failure to introduce proper surrogate testing for the hepatitis C virus; the failure to notify transfusion or blood product recipients of exposure to the disease; the failure to counsel and provide appropriate support mechanisms for those who have contracted HCV via transfusion or blood products; why inquiries were conducted in-house with no transparency of process or proper audit; the putting at risk of other Australians in contact with HCV victims who are unaware that they may have transfusion or blood related products contaminated by the hepatitis C virus; the treatment of victims left to fund their own treatment without proper support from the Red Cross or the government; the failure to set in place a nationwide compensation system for victims, introduced in the ACT only; and, finally, the need for a full review of Australia's current blood collection, processing and distribution systems with appropriate audit processes to ensure that standards and decisions are in line with other developed countries. Unfortunately, the Barraclough inquiryâthe report to which I referred beforeâwas limited to examining why donors with hepatitis C were asked to donate blood plasma for manufacture at CSL in 1990.</para><para>For too long the manufacturers of Australian products of human biological origin, made for the Commonwealth on behalf of the Australian people, have consistently failed in their mission. The harvesting of organs and other human tissues or fluids for vaccines, hormone preparations and other biological products used by millions of Australians has not always met appropriate standards. There has been a betrayal of public safety that cannot be allowed to continue. </para><para>In respect of the proposal put forward by Senator Bartlett and to be moved by Senator Allison about the constitution of the board, I do believe that we need to tighten this, particularly as it requires openness and transparent processes which serve the best interests of hospital patients and users of blood products. An initiative such as this can only strengthen the integrity of Australia's blood system.</para><para>I go to the nature of the National Blood Authority and refer to the key features of the national blood agreement. Those features include national policy leadership for the ministerial council and a continuation of the role of the Australian Health Ministers Conference assisted by a jurisdiction or board committee to be established as a subcommittee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council. Getting information out of that body is like getting blood out of a stone. Frankly, I would like a clear indication or undertaking by the minister that there will be transparency and that it will be accountable to this parliament. Will that organisation be able to respond to questions on various matters asked in estimates committees or will it take the view, `This is a state and Commonwealth issue and, unless we get the agreement of the states, sorry, we can't help you'? </para><para>That is what we get from SCAGS. When we ask questions of the Attorney-General about what occurs in SCAGS, his response is always, `That's a Commonwealth-state organisation and we cannot provide you with answers to your questions until we get approval from each and every state.' That is not good enough. Are we going to give away our responsibilities as members of this parliament to ensure the accountability of public funds, particularly when it comes to funds that go to the management of this vital issue? Blood is a vital issue. I am really concerned that there will not be sufficient accountability to satisfy the requirements of an audit and control process which is part of the duty of this parliament and particularly of this Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>10487</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe review of the Australian blood and blood products sector conducted by Sir Ninian Stephen made a number of recommendations about reforms to the Australian blood sector that are set out in the <inline ref="R1706">National Blood Authority Bill 2002</inline>. The provisions contained in this bill will strengthen accountability in the blood sector and ensure that Australia's blood supply continues to be safe, secure, adequate and affordable. Governments will be provided with better information to determine appropriate supplies of blood products and services in response to clinical need. Mechanisms will also be provided to ensure evidence based assessment of proposed new products, services and technologies through transparent evaluation of health gain.</para></talk.start><para>The establishment of the National Blood Authority is central to the achievement of these aims and will ensure the protection of consumers and the maintenance of public confidence in Australia's blood supply. The bill sets out the necessary operational elements to establish the National Blood Authority to undertake its primary task of managing and oversighting Australia's blood supply on behalf of all jurisdictions. While the National Blood Authority will undertake a liaison and coordination role in relation to the safety and quality of blood products and services, it will not be a regulator. The safety and quality of the Australian blood supply remains the job of the Therapeutic Goods Administration on behalf of all jurisdictions.</para><para>The bill creates the office of the general manager who will be responsible for the conduct of the National Blood Authority's functions and in whom statutory powers will vest. The bill also establishes a board which will advise the general managerâand I need to emphasise that; it will be acting in an advisory roleâon the conduct of the National Blood Authority's functions. The expected commencement date of the National Blood Authority and of the new arrangements more broadly is 1 July 2003. Subject to the passage of this bill by parliament, jurisdictions continue to work together to put in place detailed arrangements to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements with no disruption to the national blood supply.</para><para>I want now to respond to some of the issues that have been raised in the debate so far. As I represent the government I can say that the government will not be supporting the Democrat amendments. I want to reply to the points about the National Blood Authority board. All Australian governments have agreed through the national blood agreement to the composition of the National Blood Authority advisoryâand again I stress `advisory'âboard and the process by which members are selected and appointed. The agreement is reflected in clauses 14 and 15 of the bill. </para><para>Members of the National Blood Authority advisory board will be appointed by the Minister for Health and Ageingâand I happen to be the minister at the moment, and hopefully for a long moment, but none of us stays on here foreverâbut only after the minister is satisfied that key criteria set out in the bill are met as follows: all members have been selected by the ministerial council; the chair is considered by the ministerial council to be independent of the interests of suppliers and all governments; the Commonwealth has nominated the person selected to represent its interests and the person selected to represent the interests of the states and territories had been nominated by the states and territory governments. This process provides significant checks and balances by requiring the agreement of the nine Australian governments to the appointments. The board will have a balanced membership comprising an independent chair, a Commonwealth member, individuals representing the collective interests of the states and territories and the community, and the necessary financial and public health expertise to enable the board to advise the NBA in the conduct of its functions. The Howard government is committed to appointments to the board that are relevant to their task and able to reflect the needs of the Australian community. </para><para>The bill contains further safeguards for these appointments: all appointees will be required to give undertakings about conflicts of interest prior to the formalisation of their appointment and members will be subject to legislative provisions to maintain confidentiality in the course of undertaking their board duties. The bill contains specific provisions about the termination of board members in the event of bankruptcy, lengthy absence from board duties or paid employment that could conflict with the performance of duties as a board member.</para><para>With regard to the general manager, the bill creates the statutory office of the General Manager of the National Blood Authority. All Australian governments have agreed to the creation of this office in the National Blood Agreement, and it is set out in section 27 of the bill. The general manager will be appointed by the minister in consultation with the National Blood Authority. The usual merit selection processes that are the basis of all Commonwealth appointments will apply to this appointment. The position will be advertised nationally to attract the broadest possible field and there will be a competitive process to ensure the appointment of the best candidate to this very important position. The bill contains a number of checks and balances. The successful appointee, as the head of the National Blood Authority, will be subject to the constraints in the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 in relation to financial management and to the Public Service Act 1999 in relation to staffing matters. The general manager's remuneration will be set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal and the general manager will be required to declare all interests, pecuniary or otherwise, that could conflict with the proper performance of the duties of the general manager. The bill also contains provisions for the termination of the appointment of the general manager on a number of grounds, including bankruptcy, extended absence, engaging in paid employment outside of the duties of the general manager without approval, or failing to give notice of any conflicts of interest.</para><para>Although it is tangential to this bill, Senator Harradine's raises a matter of interestâthat is, hepatitis C and the issue of blood in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I did refer this to Professor Barraclough, a distinguished medico, who is chairing our quality and safety council, and Professor Barraclough presented me with a report late last week. I wish I had 30 hours in the day, but I do not. I have given that report a cursory glance, but I want to look at it in more detail. It is very important that I have the states' response to that report since the states were responsible for blood supply during that period. It is important that they respond to that report as well. I know that is going to cause some grief to people who have a personal interest in this issue, but I need to follow due process. I did actually contact Senator Harradine, given his particular interest in this matter, advising him when I received the report and indicating it would take some time before I could get a response from the states and that I needed to consider Professor Barraclough's report not only in depth but also in conjunction with the relevant state ministers. As I said, blood supplies were the responsibility of the states. That issue actually highlights the need for a national blood authority, so I strongly commend this bill to the house. </para><para>Senator Harradine also indicated that he had a concern that the National Blood Authority would not be accountable to this place. We have some other models, such as the Australia-New Zealand food and safety council, where we have a similar structure and where the general manager has to appear at estimates and respond to any questions. The same will happen here. The general manager reports to the minister for health and, in the process that we have when we indicated that we want to call people to estimates, would be required to present at estimates and answer any questions relating to the National Blood Authority. I think there is accountability in that process that this parliament has access to. It has the ability to question ad infinitum, as sometimes happens at estimates, the General Manager of the National Blood Authority. I commend the bill to the Senate.

If confidentiality clauses in supply contracts, for instance, contain penalties for releasing such information, where does that leave those suppliers, and does that undermine the general manager's power to obtain relevant information on the supply of blood products and services?

The IGA includes obligations on the States and Territories to develop and implement best practice systems for the planning and management of the supply and use of blood products ... and to ensure the provision of information and advice to the NBA in relation to demand for blood products ... Private hospitals are outside the purview of States and Territories, at least without specific legislative powers to obtain information. There would also be intergovernmental and possibly Constitutional issues raised by the application of such powers to States or Territory officials.</para></quote><para>This is the legal advice from our legal services section. With regard to clause 10(6) and the possible undermining of statutory information powers by confidentiality obligations, the advice reads:</para><quote><para>Clause 10 is drafted in accordance with the current legal policy guidelines of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to powers of this type ... This includes in this case a requirement that the privilege against self-incrimination be maintained in relation to the obligation to produce documents or give information. This is the intention of clause 10(6). The drafting of clause 10(6) complies with current Commonwealth drafting practice.</para><para>At common law and in equity, a person will not be in breach of a contractual or equitable obligation of confidence by complying with a statutory requirement to provide the information (because either the disclosure of the information as authorised by law will not be a breach of the obligation, or the obligation will not be enforceable through being contrary to public policy). </para><para>Accordingly, the statutory provisions requiring the provision of information will prevail, contractual or equitable obligations of confidence will not be able to be used to circumvent the clause, and a person subject to a requirement will not be in the invidious position contemplated in the Bills Digest.</para></quote><para>With regard to subclause 10(7) and reasonable compensation for compliance with statutory information powers, the advice states:</para><quote><para>The operation of clause 10(7) will not be constrained by the explanation in the EM, and will need to be decided as a matter of statutory interpretation in the circumstances of each particular case.

The opposition have made it clear that we support these bills in principle as far as they go. We still believe that the government has missed an opportunity for real and significant reform in this area, which is a burden that will now undoubtedly fall to future governments. We still have some remaining concerns with some detailed aspects of the limited scheme contained in these bills, especially with regard to how it impacts on the shipping industry. I commend the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to anybody who is interested in this bill. They should have a discussion about what ships do because, as I am sure those who attended the committee process will agree, we learnt an awful lot about what ships doâ they sail, up and down the coast, we discovered. And I was particularly gratified by that information.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, we are still amazed that a scheme that was originally conceived specifically to deliver incentives for cleaner fuels has come forward without providing anything of the sort. I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the Committee of the Whole to address two of these issues to improve the bills before us. However, overall we still support the bills because they seem to create a scheme that will maintain equivalent benefits to the existing schemes and they also achieve some rationalisation at the edges of the current system. Nevertheless, this support is still, as it always has been, conditional on the opposition being satisfied about the content of the regulations accompanying the bills. Once bitten, twice shyâ and the Democrats have been bitten. There is no question that these bills represent a fundamentalâas we would say in the Labor Partyâratting on a deal. To ask us to swallow these bills without fronting up with the regulations is just a step too far. </para><para>I see Senator Brown is in the chamber, so I am sure we will be hearing a lot more about this aspect of the bills. A promise was made, and to provide the parliament with just this part of the billâto treat it with such contemptâdoes the government no credit. We were assured by the government in prior briefings on the bills that these regulations would be provided in time, but they still have not turned up. We have given the government until the last possible minute to produce these regulations but, as we stand in the Senate today, there is still no sign of them. </para><para>It really does seem absurd to be assured by the government that on the one hand there is nothing tricky about them, that they just replicate the existing schemes, and on the other hand they are far too complicated to produce in a timely fashion for the parliament to have a look at them. I foreshadow that, unless we receive some more satisfactory answers on this issue by the end of this debate, the opposition will be moving a motion to adjourn consideration at the Committee of the Whole stage until such time as the regulations actually turn up. It only seems fair, Senator Brown. Let me repeat that: we still stand ready to pass these bills after consideration of our amendments, subject only to the regulations turning up and being in a satisfactory form. But voting for them sight unseen is a big stretch, especially given this government's previous record of welshing on explicit promises made to the ALP in writing and signed by the Treasurer on business tax reform, and the critical nature of the matters left to those regulations, such as the quantum of the benefit.</para><para>Let me now turn to the substantive provisions of the bills. As I stated earlier, the new scheme will replace two existing fuel schemes: the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme provides a rebate of fuel excise for diesel used in certain off-road business activities, including mining, primary production, electricity generation, hospitals and nursing homes, rail and the now infamous marine transport. The Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme provides grants for on-road use of diesel and alternative fuels, such as ethanol, compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to maintain previous price relativities with diesel.</para><para>If we go back to what the Trebeck fuel tax inquiry had to say about these schemes, they made it very clear that there were some very significant concerns about compliance costs imposed by these schemes. With regard to the DFRS, the fuel tax inquiry noted that the main issue seemed to be why only some off-road diesel users should be eligible for the DFRS, when often eligible and ineligible activities used very similar production processes and served very similar markets. With regard to the DAFGS, the inquiry reported that concerns centred on geographic boundaries that limit the eligibility of diesel used in 4.5-tonne to 20-tonne vehicles in urban areas. According to the inquiry, the consequence of this was that many businesses complained of the high compliance costs required to substantiate claims made under the DAFGS and the DFRS. Only about half the businesses claiming under both those schemes are able to claim all of their diesel as being eligible. Consequently, compliance costs are incurred by businesses to track, categorise and quantify their diesel use. This was considered to pose a major problem for businesses that use diesel in a variety of eligible and ineligible activities, as they are required to install additional compliance systems and, in some cases, fuel measuring devices.</para><para>That seems pretty unequivocal to me. Compliance costs have been a big problem with the existing schemes. That is also consistent with representations made to me by those in the industry over a very long period, yet the Senate legislation committee inquiry on these bills produced some very interesting evidence from the industry associations that seems to suggest the contrary. If the compliance issues associated with these schemes have indeed settled down, then that is a good thing. But I cannot help but be a little sceptical that something that has been such a major problem for so long has suddenly disappeared overnight, and just at the time that pressure was on about funding the new schemes. As I say, I hope that the compliance cost issue has really been bedded down but, with the government electing to take a business as usual approach in the new scheme, it seems to me unlikely to be the case. The true test will surely be to see how long it takes for the various industry associations and their members to renew their calls for simplification of administration once the new system is in place. We note that evidence to the committee suggests that the industry associations and other witnesses considered that the promise to maintain the existing level of entitlements will be met if the regulations do indeed look as they were promised to. This just reinforces the critical need for the government to make the draft regulations public as soon as possible. </para><para>I would now like to turn to the timing of the new scheme. The Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme was originally a promise outlined as part of the government's deal with the Democrats in May 1999 to pass the GST. The government committed to putting a sunset clause of 30 June 2002 on the existing fuel schemes and then replacing them with a scheme that would have measures to promote cleaner fuels but maintain equivalent benefits. This commitment was put into legislation in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999, which stated:</para><quote><para>The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will be to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels by measures additional to those under this Act, while at the same time maintaining entitlements that are equivalent to those under this Act and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, including for use of alternative fuels.</para></quote><para>The government did not do the work to meet that original deadline, so Labor reluctantly supported an extension of this deadline by 12 months, to June 2003. When legislating the extension to 30 June 2003, the government promised that the fuel taxation inquiry would address the design of this new schemeâI am sure that sounds very familiar to you, Senator Allison. But of course we know what happened to that exercise. The government equipped the inquiry with an oversight committee, a secretariat and a budget of $4 million, and asked it to take submissions and hold public hearings across the country and to then prepare a detailed report on these issues. This they dutifully did. Stretching to over 250 pages of detailed analysis and recommendations, it is a report with which I do not entirely agree, but I do think it was a good contribution to public debate and it deserved to be taken seriously.</para><para>Instead, the government dumped it unceremoniously on budget night last year, showing an utter contempt for all of those who had put so much time and effort into putting their submissions to the inquiryâall of those people, all of those hearings, all of the effort, time and money that people put into trying to communicate with the government. It was thrown out; just completely ignored. But fundamentally they were conned, because the government was just looking for something to avoid delivering on this. All these people were conned by the government's rhetoric and promises.</para><para>It revealed once and for all that people were right to be cynical about the real reasons behind the setting up of the fuel tax inquiry. It was set up for one reason, and one reason only: for the government to hide behind it during an election campaign. That is rightâthis was one of those big pre-election initiatives. `It's all right,' they told everybody, just quietly behind the scenes, `we'll fix it up after the election in the fuel tax inquiry. Don't you worry, your concerns will be looked after.' That was the con that everybody got sucked into before the election. This appalling act of cynicism was damaging in its own right. Why would people bother to get involved in a serious policy debate if they are going to be treated with such contempt at the end of it?</para><para>This government have got form. They just did it again to all those poor people who spent their entire Christmas period working on submissions to a Telstra inquiryâa cheap undergraduate stunt pulled by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. He phoned them up; his office, his department, got on the phone and told all these people, `Look, we want you to put in submissions to this House of Reps Telstra inquiry.' So a lot of people spent a lot of time and money over the Christmas and January holiday period only to find that, in a complete act of cynicism, Senator Alston dumped the inquiry almost on the first day of the parliamentary sitting. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âJust like you dumped your policy!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âI am glad you are awake there, Senator Campbell: welcome. It is extraordinary to see that they can get away with it, not once, not twice, but three times. But it is also damaging in setting back the progress of important fuel tax reform yet again. Evidence provided to the Senate committee made it clear that policy work on this issue was all put on hold while the fuel tax inquiry did its work. This seemed a fairly sensible response, given that the design of the new system was explicitly part of the terms of reference for the inquiry. By dumping the report in its entirety, the government essentially required that work on the new scheme to begin all over again. So perhaps it is not surprising that, yet again, they are way behind time in bringing the bill forward. Remember that it is now nearly four years since the original commitment, and the deadline has already been extended by a full 12 months. The good news is that people are not falling for it twice.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am just trying to remember the name of the new cabinet subcommittee or IDC that they are putting it all toâthe Energy Task Force, I am reminded by Subho Banerjee. Thank you for that. The Energy Task Force: that is the new scam, that is the new game. Everybody's concerns will be fixed, don't you worryâanother nod and a wink. It will all be fixed in the Energy Task Force. There is only one problem: the department are unable to tell us the terms of reference for the Energy Task Force. Apparently that is a secret, orâwhat I suspect to be the truthâthey do not have any because it is just another political scam.</para><para>Even now, after all the delays and procrastination, we only have this damp squib of an attempted reform. It is basically business as usual on the existing schemes despite their manifest problems. It contains no measuresâI repeat: no measures at allâon cleaner fuels, which was the original point of the new scheme. In addition, we are still waiting for the regulations to see how the scheme will operate in practice. It really is a disgrace, but one that reflects again the quintessential combination of arrogance and incompetence that lies at the heart of this government's performance.</para><para>The issues raised during consideration of these bills simply add to the other failures of the government's Measures for a Better Environment package negotiated as part of the GST deal in 1999. In this regard, the Senate Economics Committee may wish to consider the various tax and expenditure incentives in the MBE package as part of its broader reference to look at the structure and distributive effects of the Australian taxation system. In addition, the Senate may wish to take up the egregious failures of implementation of the broader MBE package in a broader reference to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee. The opposition will explore these options further in consultation with minor parties before making a final decision as to the best way to proceed.</para><para>I will conclude my remarks there in this second reading debate. We support these bills in principle. However, as foreshadowed in the House and in the Senate committee hearing, we consider that the bills should remain before the Senate until the accompanying regulations are available for parliamentary scrutiny. As I mentioned earlier, I will be moving two amendments in the committee of the whole stage to improve the bills before us. The first amendment deals with retaining the legislative commitment to cleaner fuels in the current legislation. The second amendment deals with denying grants or credits under the new scheme to vessels voyaging under a single or continuing voyage permit. That will come as no surprise to some people, I am sure. I will speak further on these amendments at that later stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>10495</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to have my speech on the <inline ref="R1745">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003</inline> and related bill incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>The Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme bill 2003 replaces the existing Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (DAFGS) and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) with a single rebate entitlement. The legislation comes into effect on 1 July 2003. </para><para>As Senators will be well aware, the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill was meant to provide price incentives and funding for conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels. It was meant to be much more than a simple re-badging of the current Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and it was meant to commence on 1 July 2002.</para><para>The Democrats are extremely annoyed that this bill contains no additional measures to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels. We are extremely disappointed that after four years and a lengthy Fuel Tax Inquiry, all the Government has done is send the issue off to the so-called Energy Taskforce. </para><para>The Government's lack of vision and complacency is obvious to all those who have followed this matter. The Government has failed to deliver a system of cleaner fuels for the long-term benefit of the Australian people. </para><para>Air quality is often the number one environmental concern of the Australian public. The 2001 State of the Environment report found that âthe main respiratory health risk for Australians arises from particulates and hydrocarbons. Since 1979, death as a result of respiratory diseases and respiratory cancers has been falling for males but rising for females, which mirrors cigarette smoking patterns.â </para><para>BP's submission to the recent Senate inquiry noted that data from both the UK (National Society for Clean Air) and the US (Earth Policy Institute) indicate that between 2 and 10 times more people die from the effects of poor air quality than from road trauma. </para><para>They cited the World Health Organisation's World Health Report which says particulates are âconsistently and independently related to the most serious effects, including lung cancer and other cardio-pulmonary mortality.â</para><para>I am proud of the gains the Democrats made on measures to improve air quality in the diesel package negotiated in 1999. National fuel standards for the first time in this country, massive reductions in sulphur content, grants for converting large vehicles to from diesel to gas, emission standards to bring Australia into line with Europe by 2005/6 and on-road testing for trucks. </para><para>From 1 January this year, all diesel sold in this country must be low sulphur diesel. So, instead of diesel which had an average content of more than 1300 parts per million of sulphur, the maximum is now 500 ppm and in two years time that drops to ultra low sulphur diesel which is 50 ppm. Those changes will massively reduce the particulates produced by motor vehicles and bring us in line with other countries around the world that reduced their sulphur content years ago. </para><para>But there is still an enormous reliance on diesel, we still have a very old truck fleet by world standards, poor maintenance practices and a long way to go to shift to cleaner fuels and renewable fuels, on and off-road. And that was where the Energy Credits Scheme was to kick in. </para><para>This was to be an opportunity to re-write these schemes to put incentives in place to shift to a more sustainable transport future.</para><para>The ALP yesterday accused us of failing to hold the Government to account, for failing to apply appropriate pressure to the Government in order to ensure that this scheme was developed. I'd like to address that accusation.</para><para>Let me start by saying that the failure to properly develop the scheme rests squarely with the Government and the failure of the Prime Minister to bring the four responsible ministers and their departments together to design a scheme that meets the agreed objectives.</para><para>Back in May 2001, 14 months before the scheme was meant to start, the Democrats produced a discussion paper canvassing a number of options. We consulted widely on the paper and we provided a summary of submissions and sent it on to the Government. </para><para>Before and after the 2001 deadline for the scheme passed, we complained on many occasions about the lack of progressâto the Prime Minister, the Minister for Environment and Heritage, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Treasurer and have repeatedly called on them to develop options for us to discuss. We have also always indicated our willingness to work with Government on this initiative.</para><para>I note that speakers from the ALP in that other place, have made much of the broken promise on these bills, as though the ALP has had no role in this situation whatsoever.</para><para>Need I remind the Senate that it was the ALP, who agreed to an extension of the two schemes last year. When they did so, they said that they would not support another extension. And yet this is what this bill is. Indeed, it is even more than this, because it locks in a new scheme without any mandated timetable for the introduction of cleaner fuels.</para><para>So, I say to the ALP, if you are so concerned with broken promises, if you are so concerned with the lost opportunity that these bills represent, do the right thing, show some backbone, and refuse to support these bills as we will. </para><para>Unfortunately, all the ALP is interested in doing is scoring cheap political points. That's what they did at the Senate inquiry into these bills and that's what they have done in the House and will no doubt continue to do in the Senate.</para><para>I frankly don't think the ALP has the slightest interest in renewable fuels or improving air quality. </para><para>Their shameful attack on ethanol has alarmed people to the point where the demand for ethanol blend petrol has practically disappeared. I look forward to the day I hear a Labor Senator make a speech in this place about the greenhouse and emission advantages of ethanol in petrol. I won't hold my breath. </para><para>In fact the ALP seems to have even fewer ideas about the way forward than the Government.</para><para>After this legislation goes throughâas regrettably it will because of the ALP's supportâI hope the Government will undertake serious, long term reform of the diesel grants and rebates schemes so that they shift us to cleaner fuels. I hope this is what the Government's Energy Taskforce will deliver but I think it is unlikely to happen.</para><para>It is more likely that the Government will agree to a handful of somewhat ad hoc measures that will tinker at the edges of better transport planning. </para><para>I think it is worth mentioning some of the very good suggestions made in transport industry submissions to the inquiry that would promote the shift to cleaner fuels. </para><para>In their submission, BP Australia made the point that diesel and petrol will remain the main transport fuel for this decade and for much of the next, so it is important that any attempts to improve environmental and health outcomes focus on these fuels. </para><para>They suggest that in addition to the implementation of a 1 cent per litre incentive for the production of ULSD from 1 July 2003, as promised, that the Government should provide an incentive of 1-2 cents per litre from 2006 for 10 ppm sulfur diesel. </para><para>Caltex too supports an incentive for the uptake of 10 ppm sulphur diesel, and is suggesting that a production subsidy be provided for 50 ppm sulfur petrol. Caltex argues that:</para><para>âIn the future, cleaner petrol and diesel will achieve a number of objectives:</para><para>Â·	Reduce air pollution from the existing petrol and diesel vehicle fleets</para><para>Â·	Reduce air pollution and improve fuel efficiency from new vehicles</para><para>Â·	Enable the manufacture of cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars in Australia, because appropriate petrol will be available to fuel them.</para><para>Lower sulfur levels allow for the development of more fuel-efficient engines, and from more fuel-efficient engines come lower greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>Another submission suggested phasing out diesel grants for vehicles over 20 tonnes operating in metropolitan areas that do not comply with ADR 70. That would encourage trucks over 8 years of age to be properly pensioned off instead of belching black smoke in our cities and we think it is a valuable idea. </para><para>Of course the proper maintenance of vehicles can be just as important as upgrading the fleet and I look forward to the Labor governments in each state, getting behind the federally funded on road vehicle testing NEPM that was part of our 1999 diesel agreement.</para><para>On the issue of alternative fuels, the inquiry heard much about the need to include biodiesel in the new scheme. Finalising the standard for biodiesel should be done as an absolute priority. Biodiesel does have significant environmental benefits. It is also important to finalise a standard for diesahol.</para><para>The Democrats are also very interested in the provision of much greater incentives for the use of public transport. In our major cities in particular, there is no reason why our public transport systems should not be as good as those in cities like Toronto. </para><para>There is also no reason why the Federal Government should not use its transport funding for improving public transport instead of putting it all into roads. </para><para>The Scoresby Freeway is an example of federal transport funding being squandered on unnecessary freeways when fixing up local roads and extending public transport is so desperately needed. The Scoresby freeway should not be eligible for Roads of National Importance funding and we all know it was by-election political one-upmanship rather than any sort of sensible transport planning. </para><para>There are enormous gains to greenhouse and air quality in shifting people out of cars and into public transport and if these systems were more reliable, safer, more comfortable and efficient, they would attract a far higher level of patronage.</para><para>The Bus Industry Confederation is arguing for three key initiatives. </para><para>The first is the notional application of the diesel credit for buses in metro areas. However, instead of providing this rebate to individual operators, the Confederation is suggesting that the funds be pooled into a Public Transport Fund and used to promote demonstration projects such as bus priority lanes. The projects that have been developed to date in Australia have yielded tremendous results, with patronage increasing by 30-40%.</para><para>The second would encourage a modal shift towards public transport through an employer based incentive scheme, an increase in fringe benefit tax liability on company cars and the restructuring of fuel taxes to more fully reflect the true costs of road use.</para><para>The third initiative is a national advertising and marketing campaign to promote the benefits of public transport use.</para><para>I am still hopeful that the Government will take some of this advice. It will not be the reform that I think we had a right to expect but it will at least take us in the right direction. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10498</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs has been outlined earlier this evening by Senator Conroy, there is a rather unpleasant history to the bills that are now before usâthe <inline ref="R1745">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1744">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. The bills themselves are designed to replace the diesel rebate schemes that existed before 1999. These bills are here this evening because of a deal done by the Howard government and the Democrats. The deal was part of a package in return for the Democrats passing the GST legislation. The Democrats' then leader, Senator Lees, secured a promise from the Prime Minister that the diesel schemes would sunset in July 2002 and be replaced by a cleaner fuel energy credit system. The minister for transport in the other place in June 1999 confirmed that the scheme would maintain entitlements equivalent to those in the current scheme. This was done on the basis of a requirement that there would be a huge improvement in the environmental performance of the industries that receive these payments funded by taxpayers.</para></talk.start><para>Therefore, the government committed that over the three years from 1999 to July 2002 they would replace the diesel schemes with an energy credits scheme that would result in better environmental benefits to the country. Three years is a significant amount of time, certainly enough time to consult widely with the industries affected. And what did the government do in that time? Well, they did what they are famous for: absolutely nothing. Now we know that the road transport industry was putting pressure on the government during 2000 and 2001 because they were becoming increasingly anxious about the change in the diesel scheme and the potential requirements under the new act. The government's response after all that inaction was to simply increase the sunset time to July 2003. That was done in September 2001â just before the last election, as you may recall.</para><para>What has happened since that timeâ surely full-scale consultation with industry, the Democrats and other interested parties? Unfortunately, and here is the rub, what we have got is only one of the promised elements. We have got the energy grants scheme to replace all of the diesel schemes, but we have not got the move to use cleaner fuels. The government has essentially reneged on its arrangements with Senator Lees over the GST in 1999. It promised that the diesel schemes would be replaced and that there would be a move to cleaner fuel sources. This government has demonstrated its usual approach: make a lot of noise about the changes, wait, wait and then wait some more. Then, at the very last moment, it tries to slip the legislation through without all of the promises that it made at the time.</para><para>What we are looking at, and what the Democrats have ended up with, is a non-core promise. There was all this noise back in 1999 about cleaner fuels for the transport sector, but what we have ended up with is the diesel schemes by another name. And let there be no doubt that we have to do something about cleaner fuels. In my opinion there are two compelling reasons for doing something, one financial and the other environmental. The environmental factors are well documented. Australia's transport energy sector accounts for 41 per cent of Australia's energy consumption. Nearly half of our consumption is from that one sector. They also account for between 14 and 17 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions. By any measure, the original deal that Senator Lees struck was an acknowledgment that we had to do more. By any measure, this is a serious issue demanding serious solutions. </para><para>What have this government delivered on the environmental front after four years? Not much of anything that I can see. The Prime Minister has now established an Energy Task Force, as Senator Conroy outlinedâyet again, an announcement with great fanfare and a promise to address these serious issues. Given this current bill, however, there is not a lot of confidence in that approach. How can there be when they so easily forgot their promise made to the Democrats and the Australian people only four short years ago? This is a classic case of the Prime Minister fiddling while dirty fuels continue to burn.</para><para>The other factor that I want to address is financial. Last year this country imported over $7 billion worth of oil and fuel products. Our country is dependent on foreign oil. It is estimated that by the year 2020 the demand for energy will have increased by 50 per cent. By 2010, 60 per cent of annual requirements for fuel products will be imported. In fact, over the last three years Australia has been consuming oil three times faster than it was finding it. Only last week the government announced that over 35 new sites have been granted to allow for further oil exploration. The reality that now confronts us is that we are going to run out of domestic oil and will at some time in the near future become completely dependent on imported oil.</para><para>We are only too well aware how recent events in the Middle East, Venezuela and Nigeria are impacting on Australiaâoil prices rising to $37 a barrel and the bowser price regularly exceeding $1 a litre. And yet, even though this forecast is grim and increasingly subject to factors out of our control, there is a solution. It was only this week that another significant natural gas field was discovered off Western Australia. The Jansz gas field holds some 20 trillion cubic feet of gas, the equivalent of 3.3 billion barrels of oil. Here we are blessed with an abundance of natural gas and we are sending it all offshore. This is a good result for our balance of trade, but needs to be set against the $7 billion worth of oil that will increase over time as less and less domestic oil is produced.</para><para>There are a number of uses for natural gas: power generation, fuel for vehicles, heating and cooking to name but a few. All of us here know only too well how the Northern Territory Chief Minister has struggled to get the gas from the Sunrise gas field to fuel industrial development in the Territory. However, there is another use that would address the environmental concerns and provide a net benefit to the Australian consumerâLPG powered motor vehicles. We are probably all aware that most taxis in this country are now solely powered by LPG. A motor vehicle travelling 20,000 kilometres per year on LPG reduces global warming gases by around 600 cubic metres per year. An LPG powered vehicle produces 20 per cent less emissions than a petrol powered vehicle. I am not arguing that it is the cleanest fuel, just that it is a major improvement on the current situation. Not only that, but that same vehicle travelling 20,000 kilometres a year would represent a saving of $800 a year at the bowser. For anyone, $800 a year is a reasonable saving. In Australia there are nearly 13 million motor vehicles. These 13 million motor vehicles represent a significant proportion of greenhouse emissions and $7 billion worth of fuel imports. Would it not be better for both the environment and the wallets of everyday Australians if we used LPG? On both counts the answer is yes.</para><para>I do not want to be accused of backing a particular manufacturer, but Ford Australia produceâand have been producing for some timeâan LPG dedicated motor vehicle. This is a production LPG car that comes with an internal LPG tank. All the fuel lines and the petrol tank are removed so that the loss of boot space experienced by an LPG conversion does not exist. So why are we not working with the industry for both domestic and commercial vehicles to have more LPG only vehicles on the roads? For a start, all government departments and agencies could have a requirement to switch to LPG vehicles. This of course would have a significant downstream effect on the domestic market because of the movement from fleets to the second-hand car market. This innovation from an Australian car manufacturer is what we should all get behind. It is a solution that is home-grown, built for Australian conditions, using an Australian fuel source and employing our fellow Australians. This is the sort of thing that this bill should have addressed. This is a simple practical application of the promise that the Prime Minister made back in 1999. It is time to find solutions to our looming energy crisis and the environmental price that we all pay by leaving things as they are. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>10500</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commend Senator Webber on her speech and I seek leave to incorporate my speech.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>We are facing a critical choice about how Australia should meet its energy needs while at the same time reducing and eventually eliminating the greenhouse gas pollution which leads to global warming. We can either move decisively to generate clean energy from the sun and the wind and use it efficiently or we can continue burning coal and oil and attempt to bury the resulting greenhouse gas pollution, equivalent to sending waste to landfill.</para><para>This summer's bushfires have underlined one of the costs of global warming. Research by Professor David Karoly, Dr James Risbey and Anna Reynolds for WWF Australia shows that average daytime maximum temperatures in 2002 were the highest on record: 1.6Â°C higher than the long-term average and 0.8Â°C higher than the previous record. They conclude:</para><para>This drought has had a more severe impact than any other drought since at least 1950, because the temperatures in 2002 have also been significantly higher than in other drought years ... The higher temperatures caused a marked increase in evaporation rates, which sped up the loss of soil moisture and the drying of vegetation and watercourses. This is the first drought in Australia where the impact of human-induced global warming can be clearly observed.</para><para>Coral reef bleaching, retreating glaciers, changes in the timing of bird migration and nesting, warmer surface temperatures in the Pacific, are all increasingly evident impacts of global warming. While the government has been assiduous in counting the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it has no estimate of the cost of failing to do so. The increased ferocity of this summer's fires alone is a cost that, if counted, would outweigh all public expenditure to date on energy efficiency or converting to renewable energy.</para><para>Prime Minister Howard has made energy a focus for this term of government and plans a major speech in June. It is already evident that he will back continued reliance on coal and oil as our primary energy sources, together with a push to make carbon sequestration technically and economically viable and publicly acceptable. He is likely to make some token gestures to the renewables industry; hold out the prospect of carbon trading, but not for a few years; and be enthusiastic about the hydrogen economy which, if viable, is decades away. He will, in other words, opt for minimal change here and now, masked by non-specific plans for future action.</para><para>Sequestration means literally isolating and then storing away carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. The idea is either for geosequestration of carbon dioxideâcapturing, transporting and then storing it underground in old oil fields, coal seams or saline water; or locking it up biologically, including in specially engineered organisms. For technical reasons, carbon sequestration is expensive dead-end technology. It requires an assured supply of carbon dioxide over decades and a new generation of coal fired power stations to make it economic. Relying on sequestration to address greenhouse gas emissions is an `end of pipe' solution that suits the big coal, aluminium and oil companies who can continue business as usual, and echoes the direction of the US. If we go down that path, we will be locked into coal and oil as our dominant energy sources for the foreseeable future with attendant risks of C02 escape and continued pollution.</para><para>The recent enthusiasm of the government for geosequestration and the newly coined oxymoronic term `clean coal' is matched by its declining interest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Decisions over the last few years have run down investment and capacity in the renewables and energy efficiency industries, placed coal executives in key positions and massively boosted research support for fossil fuels and geosequestration. For example:</para><para>1997	Abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, which funded renewable energy and energy efficiency by Minister Warwick Parer, a former coal industry executive.</para><para>1999	The GST package which extended the diesel fuel rebate to road transport and reduced the cost of petrol and diesel for business. According to analysis by Professor John Quiggin and the Australian Conservation Foundation, the net result was increased fossil fuel subsidies of at least $4.69 billion over three years, compared with new environmental measures worth less than $1 billion over the same period. </para><para>1999	Dr Robin Batterham appointed Chief Scientist, two days per week, while retaining his position as Chief Technologist at Rio Tinto, one of Australia's largest coal companies.</para><para>1999	Additional public funding of $1.9 million over three years given to the Petroleum Cooperative Research Centre for geosequestration research (GEODISC)</para><para>2002	$35 million interest free loan to Rio Tinto to establish a Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry, focusing on burying carbon dioxide and biological sequestration in engineered organisms.</para><para>2002	Abolition of funding for the Renewable Energy Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) which received a total of $10.4 million over seven years, while funding a CRC devoted entirely to geosequestration (succeeding one for petroleum), another for black coal and another for brown coal; the four fossil fuel CRCs have total funding of $68.7 million.</para><para>2003	Electricity market reform report, chaired by Warwick Parer, recommends abolition of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target.</para><para>In addition, Paul Pollard of the Australia Institute points out that the government's claim that it has committed almost $1 billion to greenhouse programs, like renewable remote power generation and greenhouse gas abatement, is misleading at best. The promised spending rate of $235 million per annum has been slashed to only $120 million per annum, meaning that the government is several years and one or two elections away from achieving the much-publicised $1 billion total expenditure.</para><para>Embedded subsidies promoting fossil fuel consumption are rife. For example, gas-gobbling 4WDs which use 30 per cent more fuel than equivalent light passenger vehicles, and are much more dangerous, continue to receive a 10 per cent tariff advantage over other passenger cars, at a cost of over $190 million in revenue foregone each year. They now account for 15-20 per cent of new light vehicle sales, up from two per cent in 1980. In the USA, a similar explosion in conspicuous consumption of so-called SUVs (sport utility vehicles) has spawned a massive campaign with slogans like `Support OPECâbuy an SUV'.</para><para>It is not just the federal government which is failing to take seriously the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Victoria is auctioning off its massive brown coal reserves for new ventures such as the recently mooted $6 billion proposal by Anglo American for a 500 MW power station and a plant to turn coal into 52,000 barrels of diesel per day (<inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, 21 March 2003). The NSW government has failed to rule out new coal-fired power stations, including Redbank 2 which is 39 per cent more polluting than the current best for coal. Queensland has at least 1500 MW of coal-fired power stations on the drawing board; and Tasmania plans 100 MW of forest furnaces, burning old growth native forests for electricity.</para><para>The Energy Grants (Credits) Bill 2003 is just the latest in a long retreat from support for clean energy. As part of the Democrats' GST package, the government promised to introduce an energy credit scheme in 2002 to give price incentives and funding to convert from the dirtiest to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels. It even included this commitment in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999:</para><para>s.4(2) The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will be to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels by measures additional to those under this Act, while at the same time maintaining entitlements that are equivalent to those under this Act and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, including for the use of alternative fuels.</para><para>The government has finally produced the Energy Grants bill a year late and with no additional environmental measures whatever. The Minister's comment in the second reading speech is derisoryâthe promise has been downgraded to a `note' and the government is `examining the issue as part of the consideration of alternative fuels within the Energy Task Force'.</para><para>I call on the government to honour its promise by bringing in legislation which includes incentives to switch to clean fuel and reduce fuel consumption. The existing arrangements can be extended for six months while it does so. As an example of what could be done, we will be moving amendments to eliminate off-road fuel subsidies to the mining industry and the native forest logging industry and we are reintroducing our idea to establish a Sun Fund, first developed by energy expert Margaret Blakers.</para><para>The Sun Fund would enable farmers and others to exchange their energy grant for an upfront lump sum to subsidise the installation of renewable energy systems including equipment and appliances to improve energy efficiency. This proposal was strongly supported by the weight of evidence to the 1997 Senate Committee which inquired into the Sun Fund Bill. It is a good idea and it should be supported as a complement to a range of clean energy programs. These should include an increase in the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target to at least 10 per cent by 2010, not its abolition. Greenpeace estimates in Putting Renewables on Target that this measure alone would create 14,000 new jobs as well as providing a consistent base for the renewables industry to develop. </para><para>It will take several decades to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Starting now, with that as our goal, we should be world leaders in the clean energy revolution. Clean energy means efficient use of energy in industry, commerce, homes and transport and a big switch to renewable sources. It means being in on the ground floor of new technologies and industries; increased employment in manufacturing and services, especially in regional Australia; cheaper power bills with more efficient appliances; reduced emissions not only of greenhouse gases but also of sulfur, soot and other pollutants; greater security from a diversity of generators and the shift away from conflict generating scarce fuels to abundant dispersed energy; export potential especially to Asia and the Pacific; and a capacity to play our part in transferring technology to low income countries so they too can reduce the carbon intensity of their economies.</para><para>One hundred years ago we were using wood, gas, and candles and a little hydro, and oil accounted for two per cent of world energy. Fifty years ago, there were no polio vaccines, computers, environment ministers or satellites. In the next fifty years, the clean energy revolution will produce changes as great again, provided we start now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>10502</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI congratulate Senator Bob Brown on his excellent speech. The government refutes the allegations made by Senator Conroy. The Treasurer and his office have worked in a cooperative spirit to try to brief the opposition and any other interested parties on the move to the new scheme and the <inline ref="R1745">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1744">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. I was made aware of the opposition's plan to stop this legislation proceeding unless we produced regulations about a day ago, and of course I became concerned. The government is very concerned to ensure that the introduction of the scheme is done in a way that does not create uncertainty for people who will be affected by the scheme.</para></talk.start><para>I wrote a letter to the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, dated yesterday, to effectively reinforce some undertakings, which I think are incredibly fair in relation to the progress of the legislationâand I think I will I table this letter, if I may. I made the point that, in respect of these bills now before the parliament, the government proposed to have the regulations gazetted in time for the commencement of the scheme, which is due on 1 July 2003âonly a few weeks away. I said that preliminary drafting instructions had been issued to the Office of Legislative Drafting on some matters, and drafting instructions on the other matters are still in the process of being prepared.</para><para>Clearly, tonight it is impossible to meet the entirely unreasonable hurdle that the opposition has asked us to jump over before we can consider our legislation. The regulations will, as the Treasurer has said earlier, replicate many of the matters that are currently prescribed under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme regulations and the relevant customs regulations, and the regulations will maintain benefits equivalent to those available under the existing schemes. The letter goes on to describe those things. It refers to the metropolitan boundaries, the EGCS regulations and a range of other things. </para><para>The point about trying to put the chicken before the egg, or the cart before the horseâ which is effectively what the opposition is asking us to do tonightâis that it is in contradiction to the longstanding practice not to release draft regulations relating to amendments currently under consideration of the parliament. The letter goes on to say:</para><quote><para>While there is often consultation on draft regulations, this occurs after the relevant legislative provisions authorising the regulations have been passed by the parliament and received royal assent. In any event, regulations cannot be gazetted until the enabling legislation has been passed by the parliament.</para></quote><para>So it is a classic chicken-and-egg situationâ and I would very interested to know whether there is any previous example of a Labor government ever putting regulations out before the legislation was passed.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âDon't complain!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âYou might find that those opposite, who are clearly seeking to find some way to derail this diligent process that the government has put in place, will be shown to be quite hypocritical in that regard. My letter notes that part 12 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides the necessary process for the parliamentary scrutiny of regulations. Part 12 requires regulations to be laid before each house of the parliament within 15 sitting days of the house after the making of the regulations, and either house can pass a resolution disallowing any of those. That is a proper and appropriate and well-tested process for scrutiny of the regulations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having said all of that, in this letter to Senator Ludwig, the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, I have committed the government to ensuring that proper consultation takes place on the regulations and that we will make available to the opposition the opportunity to be consulted in relation to the draft regulations. I think that is an entirely appropriate way to proceed. We are saying please give us the legislation tonight so that the drafting process can take place entirely normally. </para><para>Senator Conroy has brought an obscure process to this place at the last minute. He has once again sought to hijack the government's legislative program. He has made it impossible to proceed so that industry can go on with certainty, knowing that the legislation can come into place on 1 July and that consultation on the relevant regulations can occur. Having discussed Senator Conroy's proposition to adjourn this debate, it is clear that the minor parties, including the Greens and the Democrats, propose to support the adjournment and that if the government were to push on against the will of the Senate this legislation would be bogged down. It certainly will not be passed tonight; Senator Conroy has made that clear. He does not intend to allow us to have this legislation tonight and will ensure that, with the support of the Democrats and the Greens, this legislation cannot be passed and the normal process cannot be followed.</para><para>I conclude by rejecting the assertions made by Senator Webber in her speech about the government's reform processes. They obviously echoed some of the outrageous and unfounded comments made by Senator Conroy. Only a couple of weeks ago the OECD reported on the Australian economy and why it was outperforming all of the economies of the developed world. In that report, the OECDâwhich writes fearlessly independent research on international economiesâsaid that the Australian government's `commitment to reform, its willingness to commission expert advice and to heed it, to try new solutions, and to patiently build constituencies that support further reforms' is a reason for the Australian government's success economically today. They talk in that report about the dogged pursuit of reforms. They talk about excellent policy processes and about the fact that we pursue reforms doggedly. That is the reason why the Australian economy has outperformed the economies of the developed world. It is in stark contrast to the abysmal policy failures of the Labor Party in power, particularly in the last three or four years when Mr Keating was Prime Minister and many of the frontbenchers in the now opposition were members of the cabinet. This government has pursued reformsâwith great leadership provided by the Prime Minister and the Treasurerâoften in the face of stringent, populist opposition by those opposite.</para><para>Tonight's behaviour in relation to this scheme is a classic example of that oppositionist mentality. Three weeks ago there was a national focus on the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke government. The Hawke government, when Mr Keating was Treasurer, did implement a number of important reforms. They also wimped out on a number of important reformsâa big one of course being tax reform. But the history of Australia shows that all the big economic reforms of those early Labor yearsâwhich did achieve some internationalisation of the Australian economyâwere supported by a constructive opposition. The records of this place show that all of their major reform bills and their economic reform bills were passed with the support of a constructive opposition that believed in economic reform. </para><para>Tonight's debate is a great demonstration of the fact that we have an opposition that have lost all faith in a dynamic, internationalised economy and have returned to the old Labor principles of the 1940s and 1950s. They are now an oppositionist opposition who are determined to stop the government's reforms wherever they can. They are against fiscal reform, they are against tax reform and they are against international liberalisation reform. They are all for turning the clock backwards. Tonight's behaviour by the opposition is an example of just that. We have been lectured in this place by new senators saying that the government has not been extraordinarily successful in its pursuit of reforms. We have been lectured by these people who can say nothing but no. They do not have any answers of their own.</para><para>The best chance of a policy from this bloke opposite, Senator Conroy, is to steal one from the United Kingdom parliament. He cannot come up with his own policy. He stole his directors remuneration policy from the Tony Blair government and his banking policy, before the last election, from the Australian Bankers Association. He is yet to come up with a single original idea. This government pursue modern, international approaches. We actually come up with our own ideas and we have them tested. This bloke opposite has become a serial policy plagiarist. He is becoming famous for it now. I think it is time that the Labor Party lifted their game. They will not get away with this any longer. They have become the most strident, repeat offending, oppositionist opposition in the history of the Senateâthey have voted down more measures in this place than any other previous opposition in the Senateâand tonight's behaviour just reinforces it.</para><para>As a politician who does know when the numbers are against him, and in line with commitments I have made privately to Senator Brown, Senator Conroy and Senator Allison, it is quite clear that if the Senate will vote to adjourn this matter for procedural reasons I will test the proposition that Senator Conroy has said that he would like to have tested, which is that this matter be adjourned after a vote on the second reading.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sandy (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Sandy Macdonald)</inline>âBefore I put the question, I remind you that I do not think it is appropriate for you to refer to another senator as `this bloke'.

What would that entity be? It is the Commonwealth government. The total financial position of the Commonwealth is defined in the Constitution. Section 81 of the Constitution states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>All revenues or moneys raised or received by the ... Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund ...</para></quote><para>During the November estimates, the Department of Finance and Administration was asked to provide total receipts, payments and closing balance of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for each financial year since 1998-99. The department took the question on notice. When the department supplied their answer in January, they did not provide total receipts, payments and closing balance for the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Instead, they provided the receipts, payments and closing cash balance for the core bank accountsâ one subset of the CRF. When asked why they had not been able to furnish data on the total financial position of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution, they replied: </para><quote><para>The department does not hold that information ... But, going forward, we are trying to ensure that we can collect better information in this regard.</para></quote><para>This was a remarkable admission by the department of finance. In the 2001-02 annual report of the Department of Finance and Administration, the department describes its own role as `chief financial officer of the Commonwealth'. In May 2002, ASIC described the role of chief financial officer as the `guardian of the books'. The guardian of the Commonwealth's books was unable to tell the parliament the total amount of money received and paid out by the Commonwealth in each of the financial years from 1998-99 to 2001-02. It was unable to tell parliament the total amount of cash held by the Commonwealth over the same period. If a publicly listed company were unable to provide such information, they would be in breach of the Corporations Law and subject to legal penalties. How can parliament be expected to hold the executive to account for the expenditure of public money when the government cannot tell it the total amount of money that has been received and paid in each financial year and the closing cash position? This admission by the department of finance was in stark contrast to the claims made by the department to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.

We know the Commonwealth's total cash balance and the cash balance for each agency. I am told that within a few minutes after midnight ... all of that information is available</para></quote><para>It would appear, given the admission by officials at the most recent round of estimates hearings, that that is not quite the case. Governments have always been able to provide such information in the past. In fact, they were required to do so under the Audit Act 1901 until it was repealed in 1997, when the government introduced its new financial framework. The Audit Act had set the operational ground rules for the conduct of the Commonwealth's financial affairs under the Constitution since Federation. When the Audit Act was repealed and replaced in 1997 by three new acts, the Treasurer told us that this would result in `more transparent and informative public accounts' and `more businesslike reporting in the public sector'. They sure got that right. They copied Enron. These new acts were the Financial Management and Accountability Act, the Auditor-General Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. It was amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Act in 1999 that triggered the events that led to the department's remarkable admission in February 2003 that it had lost control of the money. In the move to accrual accounting, the government lost track of the cash. The explanatory memorandum of the 1999 amendment states: </para><quote><para>Requirements for debiting and crediting all cash transactions to a fund account in a central ledger will be removed.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>In future, transactions of agencies will be processed and recorded in their own accounting systems.</para></quote><para>It further stated:</para><quote><para>The amendments will therefore facilitate the move to devolved accounting and banking arrangements for agencies, consistent with more business like approaches used in the private sector.</para></quote><para>Hence, responsibility for receiving and paying money was devolved from the Department of Finance and Administration to individual agencies from 1 July 1999 under so-called agency banking. Moreover, responsibility for accounting for these transactions was also devolved to agencies. This, according to the government, is consistent with private sector practice. Most, if not all, private sector companies centralise both the treasury and accounting functions. In fact, I am unaware of any private sector company that has disaggregated its treasury and accounting functions in the way the Commonwealth has. In light of the Commonwealth's experience, no private sector corporation is ever likely to follow the government's example. </para><para>In fact, the government has now quietly done a complete U-turn. Almost four years after the government implemented its new financial framework, it has quietly abandoned the decentralised model for managing and accounting for cash. In November 2002, agencies were informed in a memo that Finance would once again exercise control over the money. Agencies will no longer be able draw down their appropriations as they see fit. Finance told agencies that from now on cash will only be released as needed under a `just in time' draw-down model. This was just one of 20 changes contained in the memo intended to address the significant failings of this government's financial framework. The low-key approach to announcing these changes is in stark contrast to the fanfare when the new financial framework was introduced four years ago. Some of the other changes announced in the memo highlight further failings in the government's control over agencies' spending. The memo states that Finance will `in consultation with agencies undertake a progressive review of all agency outcomes to ensure they appropriately reflect the purpose of the agency'.</para><para>It has long been argued that parliament is unable to oversee the expenditure of public money where such money is appropriated according to agency outcomes that are defined so broadly as to be almost meaningless. At one extreme are agencies like Defence which have only one outcome. Once money is appropriated to Defence, there is absolutely no legal constraint on how that money is spent. However, it would seem that parliament is not alone when it comes to having trouble tracking spending. The government itself is having trouble tracking how agencies are spending public money. As a result, four years after this government announced it was shifting to outcome based appropriations, it is returning to program based expenditure controls. The memo states that Finance will:</para><quote><para>... develop a definition of a `programme' and in consultation with Treasury and individual agencies, agree to a list of existing programmes.</para></quote><para>It also states:</para><quote><para>Cash draw downs for administered and departmental appropriations (will) be made on a program basis .... to facilitate the improved monitoring of cash expenditure.</para></quote><para>Agencies will be required to submit to Finance estimated and actual expenditure, both cash and accrual, on a program basis. The November memo reveals that the government has begun to address significant failings in its financial framework. However, the steps taken to date are far from adequate.</para><para>The government must now commit to introducing legislative change to ensure that parliament, not just the Department of Finance and Administration, receives comprehensive and timely information on government finances. Under the financial framework previously in place under the Audit Act 1901, the Minister for Finance and Administration was required to publish data on the total financial position of the Commonwealth. This data was contained in the aggregate financial statements pursuant to section 50AB of the Audit Act 1901. Under the act, the Minister for Finance and Administration was required to prepare a financial statement providing particulars of total receipts and expenditures of the consolidate revenue fund during the financial year. The financial statement also reconciled receipts and expenditures of the consolidated revenue fund with the budget outcome for the year prepared under the GFS framework.</para><para>However, the legislation went one step further. It required the government to submit the financial statements to independent verification by the Auditor-General in order to ensure that they had been prepared according to accounting standards and provided a true and fair reflection of the Commonwealth's financial position. The Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 does not require the government to report on the consolidated revenue fund. Even more significantly, the Auditor-General is no longer required to audit the budget outcome prepared under the GFS framework. Since Federation, parliament has been able to rely on the professional and independent opinion of the Auditor-General that the budget outcome was calculated according to applicable accounting standards. The government seeks to argue that the Auditor-General does audit financial statements prepared according to AAS31 accounting standards. That is all well and good, but these are not the numbers that the Treasurer quotes on budget night. When the Treasurer talks about the budget balance and the debt position of the Commonwealth, he is quoting GFS data. And this data is not audited. </para><para>There may be instances where the government has bent or even broken the GFS accounting rules. As an example, during Senate Economics Legislation Committee estimates hearings in November, the committee explored how debt retirement impacts the budget balance. When the government retires debt, interest expense is reduced and the budget bottom line is improved. However, if the debt has been repurchased at a higher price than the price at which it was issued, there will be an expense which will offset any interest saving. However, this expense on the repurchase of debt is recognised only when the debt is cancelled. If the debt is not cancelled, then an expense will not be recorded, despite the fact that the money has been appropriated and paid out. By not cancelling the debt, the budget position is overstated. As at 30 June 2002, the government had not cancelled debt that cost it $5.9 billion to repurchase but which had been issued at $4.8 billion. The government has admitted that it has no intention of reintroducing such debt to the market in the future.</para><para>The decision by the government to invest in its own debt overstates the budget position by $1.1 billion, Senator Watson. In another example, the government appears to have breached GFS. Under the GFS framework, all stocks and flows are to be valued at current market prices. However, Treasury officials confirmed during the estimates process last November that the largest component of government debtâCommonwealth government securitiesâis recorded at its historic value. This is a breach of the GFS accounting standard. The historic value of Commonwealth government securities is $6.3 billion less than its market value. By valuing CGS at historic value, the government is understating its debt by $6.3 billion.</para><para>When Treasury officials were asked during Senate estimates why they do not recognise debt at market prices, they pointed to `technical issues'. The government has been working on resolving these so-called technical issues for quite some time. As far back as 1998, the government released a fact sheet that detailed the work program of the accounting budget team. This included a list of technical issues that needed to be resolved. Included on the list was the valuation of public debt.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name></talker><para>âNo!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âIt was, Senator Hogg! I know you are amazed by that, Senator Hogg, and you, Senator Marshall. I can see there is just sheer incredulity on your faces at this. Four years later, it would seem little progress has been made on the technical issues, and public debt is still valued at historic prices. The failure to resolve these technical issues means that government debt is understated by $6.3 billion. If a publicly listed company's financial statements did not comply with accounting standards they would be in breach of the Corporations Act and subject to legal penalties.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is another issue of particular concern. Since this government came to office, it has repeatedly congratulated itself for selling off national assets to reduce government debt. A closer analysis of data published by the Department of Finance and Administration, however, raises serious question marks over how the proceeds of asset sales have actually been spent. Have all asset sale proceeds been used to retire debt? The consolidated financial statements show that the total proceeds from asset sales in the six years to 30 June 2002 were $58 billion. The department of finance confirmed during the February estimates process that, as at 30 June 2002, it had $10 billion on deposit with the Reserve Bank. This leaves $48 billion. Yet, in the consolidated financial statement for 2002, the Minister for Finance and Administration states:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth has continued to generate positive cash flows. </para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The continued generation of positive cash flows has enabled the repayment of some $41.3 billion in Commonwealth debt since 30 June, 1996.</para></quote><para>The question is: if asset sale proceeds have amounted to $58 billion, of which $10 billion is on depositâleaving $48 billionâwhy has the government only paid down $41 billion of debt? What has happened to the other $7 billion? The consolidated financial statements also contain a table that sets out total government liabilities. This table shows that total liabilities of the general government sector were $182.3 billion as at 30 June 2002. The corresponding table in the consolidated financial statements for 1996 shows that total liabilities of the general government sector were $219.1 billion. Hence, between 30 June 1996 and 30 June 2002, total liabilities of the general government sector declined by $36.8 billion. Asset sales have raised $58 billion, but total liabilities have fallen by $37 billion. Taking account of the $10 billion on deposit at the Reserve Bank, some $11 billion of asset sale proceeds remains unaccounted for.</para><para>Adding to the confusion, the finance minister issued a press release on 30 September 2002 entitled <inline font-style="italic">2001-02 Final Budget Outcome</inline>, which states:</para><quote><para>In dollar terms, the coalition government has now repaid $60.7 billion of debt since it came to office.</para></quote><para>Why does the minister state in the consolidated financial statements that $41.3 billion of debt has been repaid when in the final budget outcome press release he says that $60.7 billion of debt has been repaid? The department of finance had no answer. They returned to the committee late in the day and said:</para><quote><para>I firstly want to make a comment on the debt question. People are working on a reconciliation for you at the moment ... and what I have been told is that the answer is quite complicated. From what I am hearing at the moment, I would prefer that it were set out better than it is at the moment.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired) </inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>10508</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to deal with the second reading amendment moved by Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition. There is much in it that is attractive, but there are some elements that are not. In particular, I draw attention to item A, where the opposition wishes to condemn the government because it is the highest taxing government in Australian history. If there is a load of tosh, that is it. What I refer to, of course, is Labor's conduct when it is in government. I cannot imagine any incoming Labor government reducing the total tax take of the Commonwealth or even reducing its percentage to GDP, for the simple reasonâand they know as well as I doâthat there are vast unsatisfied needs that need to be funded from taxation.</para></talk.start><para>Every day I am in this chamber I hear from Labor, in conjunction with the crossbenchers, the call quite rightly for more expenditure on health, education, job creation and infrastructure. You cannot do that without taxation and revenue. To condemn the government because it is generating a high level of taxation is frankly utter hypocrisy. They should really back off from that claim because, from their current framework and policy understanding, I know that they will never reduce the Commonwealth's tax takeâand quite rightly. We actually need more revenue in this country for the needs of Australians.</para><para>While we say it is the highest taxing government in Australia's history, relative to the OECD, Australia is a low-taxing country. The problem is where tax is taken, the problem is in inequalities in taxation and the problem is who is paying too little tax and who is paying too muchânot the total tax take. Having said that, you might have gathered that the Democrats will be opposing the second reading amendment.</para><para>Having made those comments, you would not be surprised if I addressed my remarks to the means by which more money should be raised to be spent on Australians. <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> raises nearly $1.2 billion and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline> raises $264 million. That is spread over a wide number of agencies, the biggest of which is Foreign Affairs and Trade with close on $424 million, if you add the two together, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with $242 million, Defence with $108 million and another $125 million, and various substantial amounts to other agencies. </para><para>The way our Constitution works, the Senate is effectively approving in total an additional $1.5 billion for the government to carry on its functions. This is additional expenditure that was not previously budgeted for. As far as I am aware, the Democrats always approve the government's funding because we hold the strong view that you do not block supply. These are difficult times. We are currently being called upon by hard Left Australians in particular, and by other concerned Australians, to bring down this government by blocking supply. We will not do that. Despite how angry we are about the decision to send Australian troops to Iraq, we do not intend to interfere with the flow of money to government. Stopping the whole of government operating just does not fall into the Democrat lexicon.</para><para>The Senate will tonight be giving the government an extra $1.5 billion, but the concerns of the Australian electorate relate to where the government spends its money and to the priorities. I guess that is so for every government, but for this government it will be a matter which will be tested, I am sure, at the election later next year and the electorate will decide whether the government has been spending those tax dollars wisely.</para><para>I have voiced concerns previously which I believe are worth repeating: the obvious problem facing the Australian economy is that it is short of money to meet the needs of government and the needs of society. The government has made decisionsâsuch as going to war, for instanceâthat mean it might not have enough money without going into debt. The need for additional revenue is strong. Fortunately, finding that additional revenue is possible if the government will address at least two of the principles of taxation, namely equity and efficiency. The other one, simplicity, I think has escaped us all.</para><para>We know that the upcoming budget will not provide the resources that are needed to ensure the adequate health, education and social security of all Australians. We know that Mr Costello and Senator Hill have no idea of the potential cost of the war on Iraq. The legislation gives the Department of Defence an additional $233 million and it was passed in the House of Representatives prior to the deployment to Iraq, so undoubtedly the Senate will again be required to give our defence forces much more as the conflict in Iraq continues. The defence department will effectively be given a blank cheque to conduct a war whose end is not known to us and the payer will be all Australian taxpayers.</para><para>Where will the extra money come from? Mr Costello has held expenditure in health, education and in other important areas of government below the levels at which it needs to be spent. The pressure is building up and the government simply cannot put off spending more in those areas, because Australians have legitimate expectations that, in a society like ours, we deliver the level of goods and services that they believe a modern First World society is entitled to. Civil society in this country has high expectations of its governments. Can there be any more cuts in government expenditure? Will it have to raise debt or will it have to raise more taxes?</para><para>The electorate calls the shots and most voters are demanding that the government spends more, not less, on legitimate unsatisfied needs. It is not uncommon for each of us in this chamber to receive simultaneous and contradictory demands for a cut in taxes for the individuals or companies concerned but also demands for more money to be spent on their favourite activities. As strange and contradictory as that may seem, it is not in fact that contradictory. People often think that they are overtaxed in their particular circumstances, but more money still needs to be spent on essential items, from education all the way through to industry assistance. There is a great cry from most Australians for more government spending on creating jobs, on the environment, on internal security, on industry programs, on health, on education services, on drought relief and so on. More expenditure to be America's deputy sheriff or for health and education servicesâdepending on your particular bentâmeans raising more revenue.</para><para>Instead of simply increasing tax rates, the only alternative to raising revenue is to reduce income tax concessions and the hidden subsidies that the government has used in recent years to provide high-income earners with de facto tax cuts. I want to provide some examples of how Mr Costello, the Treasurer, can increase his revenue flow without further destroying essential government services. Firstly, the government's private health insurance rebate should be means tested. As a result of the government's 30 per cent rebate and the recent 7.4 per cent premium increase, the cost of this subsidy will reach over $3 billion this year. Over 75 per cent of that money goes to the top 40 per cent of income earners. Why is the government cutting back on bulk-billing for ordinary Australians but providing a 30 per cent subsidy for very wealthy individuals who can stay in five-star hospitals and have access to state-of-the-art gymnasiums? A reasonable capping and means testing of this rebate, without getting rid of it, could deliver savings of at least $1 billion. There would be minimal, if any, impact on the health system as the Medicare levy surcharge and a stressed public system ensure that the rich and well-off would never give up their private health insurance. So $1 billion, or one-third of that private health insurance rebate, could be saved by setting the appropriate means-testing mechanism. </para><para>Secondly, the government have announced that they will back down on the equitable taxation of family trusts. This has cost them to date at least $450 million a year. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommended that the taxation of companies and trusts be aligned. That is a matter of equity as well as of greater efficiency and greater revenue generation. This would have improved the simplicity of the tax system and would have reduced the use of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle. The government have decided that that is too hard. They do not want to take on the tax cheats who use family trusts to hide and inappropriately distribute their income.</para><para>Thirdly, the concessional treatment of company cars used for salary packaging should be reviewed. The fringe benefits tax treatment of company cars not only provides the incentive to salary package motor vehicles but also provides an incentive to drive them as much as possible. The more you drive the car, the less tax you pay. The deadline each year is the end of March. Throughout this month there would have been people who knew they must drive their cars to reach the relevant minimum number of kilometres for the year, whether that be 25,000 or 15,000. These people deliberately use their cars as much as possible because the effect of that is to get a tax benefit. It reduces their employer's tax bill and, in a salary sacrifice context, increases the employee's income. It is environmentally stupid, it costs the Australian taxpayer $900 million a year, moving on to $1 billion a yearâwhich is the government's own figureâand it is not equitable. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation estimated that even modest reforms to the taxation treatment of company cars could save $200 million per yearâagain, a challenge that the government has not accepted.</para><para>Another $600 million could be raised by reforming employee share schemes that benefit only some employees. Restoring the indexation of the petrol excise would also provide hundreds of millions of dollars and hopefully help encourage more environmentally sustainable fuels and better engine use. The overall value of work related deductions is about $7 billion. Up to $500 million could be raised by rationalising and capping certain work related deductions. Then there is negative gearingâthat is a rort. Reviewing negative gearing is a real possibility; other countries have done it. The majority of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, either do not allow or severely restrict negative gearing. It costs Australia well over $2 billion a year, perhaps approaching $3 billion, and tax reform could save at least $700 million, or one-third of that. I could go on with the list, which includes areas such as the rorting of the mutuality provision and other things, but now is the time, when the government is short of money, to take the hard decisions and address those areas. You will get Democrat support if you address those.</para><para>Corporate welfare and welfare for the well-off will always be good targets for any Australian government if they need to improve their budget bottom line. So the government should not consider that they must cut back on essential services if they are short of money, simply because they have spent too much on favourite programs or on this blank-cheque war. Reducing unwarranted tax expenditures and concessions is a possibility because tax expenditure, as the tax statistics show, is over $30 billion. We believe that a clever government and a clever Treasury could find $7 billion to $10 billion worth of reductions in there. As a nation, we need to agree on how much we want to reform income taxation and how much more we need to spend on essential needs. That is the challenge for the upcoming budget. The tax expenditure policies, budgetary cost, distributional implications, efficiencies and imperfections have not been systematically studied, and they should be. If they were, reform would release many billions of dollars for the government's needs. Perhaps there might even be some left over to give ordinary Australians some tax relief. The Democrats do not recommend an increase in tax rates, because at present we think that reducing wasteful expenditure and attacking unwarranted tax concessions and corporate welfare will produce a substantial sum of money which will go a long way to meeting the shortfalls in services that we currently face. </para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, before I sit down I seek leave to incorporate Senator Bartlett's speech on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003.</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>These bills allocate an additional $223 million for defence.</para><para>Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 includes an allocation of $108million mainly comprising $80 m for `indexation adjustments'.

But, in the interests of time and given the late hour, I seek leave to incorporate my remarks.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>In December last year, I gave an adjournment speech to the Senate on the progress of the Royal Commission into the building and construction industry, the Cole Commission. In that speech I outlined my concerns about the failure of the Commission to investigate all areas of the industry. In particular to investigate the failure of employers in the industry to comply with occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and the prevalence of industry practices such as tax evasion and `phoenixing'. This is the practice of liquidating one company which then resurfaces in a slightly different form, thereby avoiding tax liabilities and depriving workers of their legal entitlements, amongst other things. </para><para>Most particularly, I expressed my deep concern about the industrial relations agenda of the Howard Government, and in particular Workplace Relations Minister Tony Abbott, in establishing this royal commission. This agenda is one of explicit anti-unionism; my concern was that the royal commission was established not to investigate the industry, and thus respond to the claims of workers and unions involved of corruption within it, but as an exercise in union bashing. The tabling of the report in Parliament and the statement made by Tony Abbott yesterday has confirmed all my concerns.</para><para>The report, after a year of investigations and, as Tony Abbott pointed out in his statement yesterday, conducted â171 public sitting days ... Some 16 000 pages of transcript were taken from 765 witnesses.â1 Yet the report contains only two specific findings of breaches of health and safety by employers. As a former occupational health and safety officer with the CFMEU and a former worker in the industry, I find this result astounding. On average, one worker is killed each week on Australian constructions sites due to workplace accidents.</para><para>I have encountered a multitude of cases in which workers have been injured and, in some cases, disabled as a result of accidents on construction sites. A significant proportion of these accidents can be attributed to the failure of employers to meet OH&amp;S standards, which are a legal requirement. The CFMEU, in conjunction with other unions, has campaigned consistently and strongly on this issue, emphasising the prevalence of non-compliance and the severity of consequences for these failings for their members. Yet the Cole Royal Commission did not produce a single statement demonstrating illegal or unsafe work practices in NSW.</para><para>Similarly, not a single witness statement was produced by the Cole Royal Commission alleging tax rorts in New South Wales, or regarding the practice of `phoenixing'. This despite the Australian Tax Office estimation that the building industry fails to declare up to 40% of its income, and warning of the prevalence of phoenixing. These practices mean that government treasuries are starved of tax payments and workers entitlement payments withheld to maximise profits. Workers of the industry suffer as a result of loss of pay and entitlements, as well as problems with workers compensation in the event of injury that arise through these practices.</para><para>The CFMEU has worked over a number of years and throughout this commission process to bring these matters to the attention of government. Yet despite the prevalence of these practices and the severity of their effect, as my Labor colleague Robert McClelland highlighted yesterday,</para><para>â[i]ncredibly, there is not a single specific finding of unlawful conduct relating to underpayment of workers' entitlements ... avoidance of tax, or sham sub-contracting or phoenix company restructuring in the industry.â 2</para><para>The Royal Commission, despite the tremendous cost to the Australian taxpayer, has failed to address either of these areas of vital concern, among others. These are the areas of the industry that matter to the workers within it, as it is they who are the victims of these endemic problems. Yet their testimony has been virtually ignoredâonly 7 hours of hearing time was spent listening to workers of the industry, yet hearing time devoted to employers and their representatives was astoundingly over forty times that.</para><para>As representatives of these workers, the unions involved and particularly the CFMEU sought to bring these matters to the attention of the investigation, yet these attempts were also rebuffed. This is because this commission was never established to investigate the vast scope of genuine problems in the building and construction industry. It has, since inception, had an explicitly political agenda, as an investigation into the industry was turned unashamedly into a union-bashing exercise.</para><para>90% of public hearing time was dedicated to anti-union subjects. 81 % was spent attacking my union, the CFMEU. This is the union that has sought to represent workers within the building and construction industry, both to government and to the commission's investigation, only to be ignored.</para><para>Minister Abbott has just tabled one of the most expensive political tools in Australian history. He has tailored a necessary investigation into one of the most dangerous sectors of employment in the country to suit his own political ends. This commission has failed to investigate some of the most crucial problems in the building and construction industry: major problems areas that cost lives. </para><para>The areas of health and safety compliance and tax avoidance within the industry impact heavily on workers in the industry and on Australian taxpayers. Not only is he failing to address these fundamental issues, but his motivation is to crush one of the few protections available to workers and their families in this industry, the right to collective organisation through trade unions. In the words of my colleague, Mr Robert McClelland, yesterday,</para><para>â... we will not see this report used by the Howard Government as a political tool to advance a divisive industrial relations agenda.â 2</para><para>We will continue to fight for the rights of workers in this country, and for the level of government intervention needed to address these major problems within the building and construction industry.</para><para>1 Statement by the Minister for Employment and Workplace RelationsâRoyal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry 26 March 2003, 1.</para><para>2 Robert McClelland, SpeechâTabling of Cole Royal Commission Report, 26 March 2003, 2.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10513</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAfter a meeting with the Indonesian Charge d'Affaires, Imron Cotan, on 5 February, a difference has occurred as to what took place at that meeting.

In doing so, I wish to raise with the Senate an issue of gross misuse of the Australian taxpayers' dollarâthat being the Cole Royal Commission in to the Construction and Building Industries.</para><para>In my first speech to this place back in August last year I remarked how the 60 million dollars set aside by the Howard Government for this Royal Commission was a remarkable drain on our nation's resources and how it would be used as a politically motivated and government funded witch-hunt.  </para><para>Yesterday's final Report and that tabled in the Senate today have simply justified my assertion.</para><para>The history of this Royal Commission is an interesting one. It is worth remembering that Minister Abbott set it up in July 2001, just 4 months prior to the last federal election. </para><para>The initial budget allocation was $7 millionâa modest figure so far as Royal Commissions are concerned. But there was an election not so far away.</para><para>The Royal Commission was an obvious ploy so far as many were concerned to undermine the Opposition at a time of election.</para><para>As the Canberra Times noted the day after its announcement, `the Government's appetite for expensive election stunts continues unabated. The most recent example is yesterday's decision to launch a royal commission into the building industry'.</para><para>The Courier-Mail agreed. It said, `the inquiry and its timing are intensely political'.</para><para>There is no doubt that the royal commission was to be used as the basis for the re-election of the Howard Government. </para><para>But we all know well what happened to this plan... </para><para>It was conveniently overshadowed by the Tampa affairâone that was much more divisive and electorally advantageous for the Government of the day. The Tampa Affair rendered the Royal Commission somewhat less important, and as such it would be used as a card up the sleeve, for a time of this Government's choosing at some stage in the future. </para><para>As the election came and went, the original $7million quickly increased to $60 millionâ more than twice that allocated to another Royal Commissionâthe one investigating Australia's largest corporate collapseâthe one concerning HIH. </para><para>I would like for a moment to reflect on how the $60million allocated to the Building and Construction Industry Royal Commission was used to pursue the government's attack on these industries, their workers and their unions.</para><para>To begin with, Commissioner Cole, as a retirement bonus, picked up $660,000 for his role. Moreover, over $210,000 had been paid towards Commissioner Cole's allowances, including over $74,000 toward security installations at his private residences and over $26,000 worth of Comcar rides as at 12 November last year alone.</para><para>Lawyers assisting the Commissioner racked up over $10 million in fees as at 31 January this yearâand a final figure on all of these budget lines is at this stage unknown, as I await answers to my questions on notice from the Minister.</para><para>As my colleague, Senator Sherry pointed out to the Senate earlier todayâfor $60 million, Australians are entitled to expect that issues such as the horrific accidents that plague these industries would be properly investigated. </para><para>It is worth noting that on average, statistics would have it that one construction worker is killed on the job weekly in these industries. It is an issue of utmost serious concern. However, has it been adequately addressed by the Royal Commission, directed to do so? Of course the answer is no. </para><para>There has been some window dressing in this regard, with two findings of breaches of health and safety laws reported; however, all in all it pales in comparison to the findings made against workers and their unions.</para><para>Mr President, it was well known from the outset that the outcomes to be found by this Royal Commission had been predetermined from the beginning. It was simply an exercise in union bashing and nothing more. </para><para>This has been well documented in the mediaâby many individuals, even those known not to be the most union-friendly around. </para><para>Take for instance Sydney 2UE's Alan Jones, a self-confessed friend of Minister Abbott's, who said back in September last year, `there has been a fairly major exercise in union-bashing going on for some months, calling itself a Royal Commission into the building industry [...] Remember, this is the same building industry that delivered the 2000 Olympic Games and all its infrastructure miles ahead of time'. It is worth noting also, that while the Olympics were delivered ahead of schedule, they were also well under budget.</para><para>Jones went on to note that 97 percent of hearing time had been devoted to anti-union topics. </para><para>604 employers were called to give evidence and only 33 workers. </para><para>3 per cent of witnesses were from the rank of the worker and 71 per cent from employers or their representatives. </para><para>Only 2 percent of hearing time was spent on topics which didn't adversely affect the union, he said. </para><para>The Cole Royal Commission was ridiculously biased against unions and everyone knows it. </para><para>The Victorian unions gave the Commission the names of 200 companies suspected of illegal or inappropriate behaviour. Of them, only one of the companies was investigated during public hearings. </para><para>As noted by Senator Sherry earlier today, the Victorian unions were attacked by the Commission for overzealous auditing of employer books. Yet, when the Commission dealt with the fact that these audits showed up unlawful activity by employers, the report simply notes âthe failure by some employers to comply with the requirements of awards and agreementsâ.</para><para>Issues such as underpayment of wages, workers compensation fraud, illegal migrant labour, tax evasion, the existence of phoenix companies, sham sub-contracting and, as mentioned before, occupational health and safety issues were either barely addressed by the royal commission, or were referred off, to be addressed by discussion papers or were somehow outside the scope of the inquiry.</para><para>Remember, this was the Royal Commission empowered to investigate ALL issues of concern regarding the building and construction industries.</para><para>The Report's findings are a disgrace.</para><para>Australians would be well proved to be angered by this gross misuse of their taxes. This is a government hell-bent on using its power of office to suit its own ends.</para><para>Mr President, I will conclude shortly and I will return to speak on this issue in the near future and to comment in detail on the specific findings of the report, when another time arises for me to do so.</para><para>However, in concluding my remarks tonight, I just want to note that unions and their officials work tirelessly to bring about better wages and conditions for their members and for many other workers in our community. </para><para>Without unions, as this government would like to have Australian society, workers would have no power to gain outcomes which may afford them liveable incomes, reasonable hours of work or adequate safety on the worksite.</para><para>Many of the individuals named in the report are people who I know and who I have worked with. </para><para>People such as Dean Mighell, Earl Setches, Martin Kingham, Bill Oliver, Kevin Harkins and Tony Murphy among many others are people I know to be dedicated to lifting the standards of life and work for the members of their unions and others. </para><para>They are outstanding individuals who I know will continue to fight to defend the rights of construction workers.

Fee amounts exclude GST.</para><para>*Little or no attention was paid to issues of tax avoidance, collusive tendering, the use of strategic liquidations to avoid obligations to employees and to public revenue, failure to comply with Occupational Health and Safety standards, of the illegal use of immigrant labour, and the impact of that practice for wages. </para><para>All this despite the fact that the terms of reference stated that âfraud, corruption, collusion and anti-competitive behaviour, coercion, violence, or inappropriate payments or benefitsâ would be in the spotlight.</para><para>As it turned out the Commission did not take a broad view of an industry in which 1 worker dies on the job each and every week. Instead it chose to focus almost exclusively on the conduct of unions.</para><para>The Commission was presented with an enormous volume of evidence on Mr O'Connor's case, clearly uncovering poor working conditions in the City Link tunnel, but no adverse finding was made against Transfield. However adverse findings were recommended against the OH and S officer who had been sacked by Transfield after making complaints about the state of the site.</para><para>In broad terms the Commission ignored a number of facts and issues critical to any searching investigation of the building industry.</para><para>*Productivity in Australian construction is higher or equal to that in the US, Japan and Western Europe, while labour costs are frequently lower;</para><para>*The industry is recognised as a dangerous one, with Construction accounting for 15 per cent of workplace deaths across the nation, when construction only employs 5.9 per cent of the total workforce. In the face of this the commission investigated only one OH and S breach by an employer;</para><para>*Lost time through workplace injury far exceeds that lost to industrial disputes;</para><para>*The industry suffers for a high level of tax avoidance, ATO estimates that employers are hiding around 40 per cent, that $1 billion in unpaid tax in NSW alone, each year;</para><para>*âPhoenixâ companies are widespread, denying workers their entitlements, forcing sub-contractors into liquidation, and leaving Debts unpaid to the ATO, who are currently investigating 550 cases and have already collected $200 million in taxes and penalties.</para><para>The terms of reference themselves point to further politicisation of the Commission. The investigation of not just âillegalâ but also âinappropriateâ behaviour is problematic. Investigation of criminal behaviour relies on the testing of facts against a set of objective lawsâinvestigation of appropriateness is another matter altogether, requiring subjective judgement calls for the Commission, and unavoidably politicising it.</para><para>There is a common public misconception that Royal Commissions are conducted independent of Government. While they can be, this is by no means a sure thing. The way they are set up leaves lots of scope for the exertion of political influence.</para><para>Despite the legal trappings of lawyers, court rooms and cross examination, Royal Commissions are appointed at the discretion of the Executive, and can be dissolved by them at any time.

The parliament has been debating the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>, which are currently before the chamber. It is regrettable that time has not allowed a fuller debate but, suffice to say, these bills embody the continuing commitment of the Howard government to sound economic and financial management. Since 1996, when the Howard government came to office, the Australian economy has embarked on a long period of strong growth with annual average economic growth around 3Â¾ per cent. During this period, inflation has been kept low, the unemployment rate has been reduced and interest rates have fallen to historical lows. Moreover, despite the drought and the subdued world economy, Australia's economic outlook remains solid. A return to strong growth is forecast in 2003-04, assuming the end of the drought and a return to normal seasonal conditions.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of contributions that have been made that I seek to refer to very briefly. Senator Carr's speech, which has been incorporated, refers to the building royal commission. Senator Carr has slipped into what we have now come to expect from himânamely, the defence of the indefensible and the defence of the horrors of trade union thuggery in the building industry. I do not think anybody in this place takes Senator Carr that seriously, so I will not take any more time on that issue. In relation to my friends in the Australian Democrats, we will be agreeing to negative the second reading amendment, but I fear we will be agreeing for different reasons. The Democrats would seek to congratulate us for having a high-taxing regime, in fact, the facts are the oppositeâand I will get to that.</para><para>I want to deal briefly with the comments made by Senator Murray and by Senator Bartlett in his speech about the defence element of the budget and also our commitment in relation to Iraq. I refer those honourable senators to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> of today, on page 19, and I will read small sections of it. The heading reads: `Reality bites and human shields are wounded'. There is a report of a human shield coming out of Iraq, Reverend Kenneth Joseph, an American who said his trip `shocked me back to reality'. He had helped to secretly film 14 hours of uncensored video of Iraqi civilians, some of whom Joseph said `told me they would commit suicide if the American bombing did not start'. The report also stated, `They were willing to see their homes demolished to gain their freedom from Saddam's bloody tyranny.' Joseph's Iraqi contacts had told tales of slow torture and killing that made me ill, such as people being put in a huge shredder for plastic products feet first. I will not read more of this article. Suffice to say that, confronted with that sort of first-hand account, I believe the involvement by the Australian government and the Australian people in this war, along with well over 40 other countries around the world, is justified and appropriate. As it relates to the appropriations, my advice is that it will have no impact but there will be statements in the coming budget in May.</para><para>I return to elements of the second reading amendment and will deal with only a few of the assertions. The first is that this government is the highest taxing government in history and has the highest level ever of income tax. The suggestion that the Howard government is the highest taxing government in Australian history and has imposed the highest level of income tax is simply nonsense. </para><para>The historical cash taxation revenue statistics allow an accurate comparison of changes in the Commonwealth's tax burden over time, as equivalent accrual taxation revenue statistics are not available. The decline in Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97 to an estimated 20.9 per cent in 2002-03 is a direct comparison of the Commonwealth's tax burden over time. In 2003 and the forward years, the Commonwealth's tax share as a proportion of GDP is projected to remain below the minimum level reached in the five years preceding the introduction of the new tax system.</para><para>I will not deal with all the assertions in the second reading amendment, but one assertion is that there has been an alleged failure by the government to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people. Once again, there is no substance to that allegation. The government is forward looking. It has produced Australia's first ever Intergenerational Report, which identifies the fiscal implications of demographic change and other pressures over the next 40 years. Measures such as the prestigious Federation Fellowships and the establishment of 15 new major national research facilities are encouraging researchers to stay in Australia. In addition, the government has committed additional resources to increasing regional university places. Another assertion is that there are declining services. Most galling of all is the assertion that the government has somehow failed to keep the budget in surplusâ this from a party which left office promising the Australian people that the budget was in surplus and in fact left a $10.3 billion deficit. It really is a bit galling to be hectored and lectured by those opposite about fiscal responsibility when their record speaks for itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator Santoro</name></talker><para>âIt's a political outrage.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âSenator Santoro is quite right. But Senator Santoro would be aware that we on this side of the place have become used to this sort of political outrage. The government has a good record in achieving major cash surpluses. In 1997-98 it was $1.2 billion; in 1998-99, $4.2 billion; in 1999-2000, $12.7 billion; and in 2000-01, $5.7 billion. The government estimates that the cash surplus in 2002-03 will be $2.1 billion, and surpluses of the order of $5 billion per year are reported in the forward estimates. This government has a sound fiscal record and these appropriation bills are just an ongoing part of that. The people of Australia will greatly benefit from their passage, which I am sure will occur very soon. I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I commend the bills to the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>10519</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to incorporate my remarks so as not to hold up the Senate any longer this evening.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>I rise to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and, in particular, on issue of foreign aid.</para><para>Under this Appropriation Bill, $350 million is appropriated for the purpose of rephasing from the previous financial year Australia's contribution to the 13th Development of the International Development Association and our commitment to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC Initiative).</para><para>The $350 million to be appropriated under this Bill is simply what is required for Australia to fulfil its pre-existing legal obligations under multilateral agreements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">HIPC Initiative</inline></para><para>The HIPC Initiative was proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1996, in an attempt to relieve the external debt of eligible countries, whilst linking debt relief to poverty reduction.</para><para>A review of the Initiative was conducted in 1999, and a number of substantial improvements were subsequently made.</para><para>Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, countries become eligible for debt relief:</para><para>Â·	If they are eligible for concessional loans from the World Bank and IMF, which of course are only provided to the very poorest countries;</para><para>Â·	If they carry an unsustainable debt burden after existing debt-relief mechanisms are applied; and</para><para>Â·	If they demonstrate a strong record of macro-economic reform, sound poverty reduction and good governance policies, approved by the World Bank and IMF. </para><para>At a multilateral level, the Australia Government has pledged $77 million to enable the World Bank and IMF to forgive the debts of eligible countries.</para><para>In addition, Australia has undertaken to forgive the bilateral debts owed to it by Nicaragua and Ethiopia. I understand that these debts originally amounted to $6.3 million in the case of Nicaragua and $11.5 million in the case of Ethiopia.</para><para>Nicaragua will not, however, receive the bulk of the assistance pledged to it under the scheme until it implements a set of agreed policy actions relating to:</para><para>Â·	the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework;</para><para>Â·	the promotion of human capital development; and</para><para>Â·	social protection and governance strengthening measures.</para><para>According to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Ethiopia's current outstanding debt to Australia amounts to $8.5 million. Although Australia has stopped collecting repayments on this amount, it has not yet cancelled the debt. ACFOA recommends that this debt be cancelled immediately, taking into account that there are currently 11.5 million people at risk of starvation in Ethiopia.</para><para>Along with a number of non-government organisations regarding the HIPC Initiative, I share their concerns about the HIPC Initiative.</para><para>For example, Oxfam Community Aid Abroad and ACFOA have expressed concerns regarding the delay in delivering debt relief under and argues that most of the requisite conditions for eligibility under the Initiative should be abolished.</para><para>It should be noted that, although pledges to the HIPC Initiative are in the billions of dollars, most countries have been very tardy in following through with their pledges. This is despite the recognition that the situation in the world's poorest countries is desperate.</para><para>As Oxfam has pointed out:</para><para>âThe HIPCs suffer some of the worst levels of deprivation in the developing world. Around 3.4 million childrenâalmost one in five of the totalâdie before the age of five, most of them from poverty related infectious disease. Life expectancy is 51 yearsâ26 years less than in the industrialised countries. Around 47 million primary school age children are not in school, and many millions more do not complete primary school. AIDS is eroding hard-won human development gains, and malaria claims over a million lives a year, most of them children.â</para><para>Despite these severe conditions, delays in the delivery of debt relief to these countries continue and Australia is not immune from criticism.</para><para>The payment to the HIPC Initiative under this Bill was originally provided for in the Budget for the previous financial year, but remained unpaid until now, so that it has become necessary for an additional appropriation at this time.</para><para>Delays in the delivery of debt relief under the Initiative are exacerbated by the requirement that beneficiary countries implement broad economic reforms prior to accessing debt relief.</para><para>These reforms not only take years to implement, but they are then subjected to a time-consuming assessment before debt relief funds can start flowing through.</para><para>While acknowledging the importance of macroeconomic reforms, Oxfam contends that making debt relief contingent upon this process, deprives the world's poorest countries of the invaluable short-term benefits of debt-relief.</para><para>Oxfam has proposed an alternative model for debt relief. Under that model, countries would become immediately eligible for debt relief if they establish a transparently managed and audited Poverty Action Fund, through which debt relief funds can be used to finance priority areas for poverty reduction such as health, education, rural roads, water supply and employment generation programs.</para><para>Similarly, ACFOA recommend that the Government seeks the adoption by the World Bank and the IMF of alternative debt sustainability criteria for the HIPC Initiative, that are consistent with the Millennium Development Goals.</para><para>I take this opportunity to urge the Government to give serious consideration to these recommendations, with a view to advocating improvements to the HIPC Initiative more broadly within the international community.</para><para>What most significant about the Aid appropriations under this Bill is what is missing.</para><para>For example, there is no provision to increase Australia's contribution to overseas development assistance, despite the fact that it falls far short of the minimum amount recommended by the United Nations.</para><para>It is with great disappointment that I note the Government's response to the Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on âAustralia's Role in United Nations Reformâ, tabled in the Senate this afternoon. </para><para>In that response, the Government expressly disagreed with a recommendation by the Committee that Australia set a target ratio for Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) over Gross National Income (GNI) of 0.35 per cent to be achieved by the 200312004 financial year.</para><para>The Government indicates that the ratio for the current financial year is a mere 0.25%. In fact, Australia's aid budget is now the lowest it has been in 30 years.</para><para>This amounts to less than half the ration of 0.7% advocated by the United Nations.</para><para>Australia must increase its contribution to Aid and Development if it is to meet its obligations under the Millennium Development Goals, which require the international community to increase global aid by $70 billion dollars per year until 2015.</para><para>The Millennium Development Goals aim to halve global poverty by 2015.</para><para>I take this opportunity to remind the Government that they are not merely aspirational. On the contrary, they are being taken very seriously by the international community and Australia will be expected fulfil its obligations under them.</para><para>I call again on the Government to increase its contribution to overseas aid. We remind the Government that aid plays an important role in protecting Australia's national security.</para><para>Evidence demonstrates that terrorism and regional insecurity are frequently associated with poverty. It would make sense, then, for the Government to dramatically increase its contribution to overseas aid as part of its efforts to prevent terrorism.</para><para>It would make a lot more sense than spending extraordinary amounts of money adorning the fridges of Australian households with useless magnets.</para><para>Among the most urgent priorities for the international community at this time is the need to address the looming water crisis.</para><para>According to ACFOA, more than 1.1 billion people in the world today lack access to safe drinking water and about 2.4 billion people lack adequate sanitation. This situation is worsening and it is expected that by 2025, two-thirds of the human race will live in countries in which water is scarce. This poses an unprecedented threat to world security.</para><para>The Australian Democrats join with ACFOA in calling on the Government to immediately increase Australia's overseas aid for water and sanitation to $100 million in the next Budget, and to continue raising this level to $355 million a year by the 2007/2008 financial year.</para><para>It should be highlighted that Australia's current expenditure of 3.5% of the aid budget on water and sanitation is only half the average spending of other donor countries.</para><para>As the final preparations are made for the Budget over the next 6 weeks, I urge the Government to consider very carefully its shared responsibility to act now in order to avert this impending water crisis.</para><para>I urge it to take this responsibility into account in setting the aid budget for the next financial year.</para><para>Finally, I would like to close by making some observations concerning Australia's responsibility to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Iraq.</para><para>At a time when Australia has committed to participate in an immoral and potentially illegal war against Iraq, I would have hoped that the Government would have drafted some amendments to this Bill prior to it being debated in the Senate in order to provide additional funding for humanitarian aid in Iraq.</para><para>Already, we are witnessing the devastating humanitarian consequences of this war. More than half the Iraqi population depends on food rations provided as part of the Food for Oil program, which was suspended at the outset of the war.</para><para>The people of Basra and Umm Qasr have been without water for days, after water and electricity facilities were destroyed by Coalition forces.</para><para>In the mountainous region of Kurdistan, the most serious concern may be shelter for internally displaced civilians who have fled their homes because of their fear of chemical weapons attacks.</para><para>The first priority for the allocation of humanitarian aid is to provide food, water and shelter to the Iraqis and Kurds.</para><para>Despite this desperate situation, the commitments which the Australian Government has made to humanitarian aid in Iraq remain insufficient. Moreover, they pale into insignificance in comparison to the massive amounts of money we are spending to cause much of this devastation in the first place.</para><para>A number of countries around the worldâincluding China, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and Norwayâhave pledged aid to Iraq and neighbouring countries to relieve the evolving humanitarian crisis, while refusing to participate in military action.</para><para>I believe Australia should have been among this group of countriesânot among the so-called coalition of the willing.</para><para>As a number of non-government organisations have pointed out, it is important that Australia's humanitarian aid to Iraq is taken out of general revenue and not out of the aid budget. </para><para>I note that ACFOA has come out today and reinforced the importance of not cutting-back on poverty-focused programs in our region in order finance the reconstruction of Iraq.</para><para>I take this opportunity on the last day of sitting before the Budget is handed down, to call on the Government to make ample provision for humanitarian aid to Iraq from in the 2003-2004 Budget.</para><para>Question

alerting senators to the fact that the Queensland Labor government is incapable of managing its budget.</para></quote><para>The last occasion was only this month, following the Queensland budget mid-year review, in which the state treasurer, Mr Mackenroth, was visibly active trying to find excuses for all the red ink that would sound plausible to the average observer for more than a nanosecond.  </para><para>Further evidence of the Beattie Labor government's financial folliesânot to mention fiscal foiblesâis to be found in the attempt being made by the state education minister, Anna Bligh, to blame the federal government for cutting $3.8 million from her budget.</para><para>Minister Bligh would like it to be thought that she has to cut funding for pre-compulsory language programs in Queensland schools because the Commonwealthâand here I quote her verbatim-</para><para>`... last year decided to cease funding the National Asian Languages and Studies Strategy for Australian Schools (NALSAS) from the end of 2002.'</para><para>The verbatim quote is crucial, because what she says is completely and utterly wrong.</para><para>It is a lame excuse patently designed to hide a budgetary problem that has absolutely nothing to do with funding flows from the Commonwealth.</para><para>Ms Bligh, like every other education minister in the country, is very well aware that NALSAS was always a time-limited program.</para><para>It began in 1994 as a collaborative endeavour between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, initially for four years, with the states and territories providing matching funding.</para><para>Mr Presidentâ</para><para>I might digress just for a moment and make this point: the NALSAS program was very largely brought about by the strong interest and heavy lobbying of the former Goss Labor government in Queensland.</para><para>It was a creditable Queensland-fostered initiativeâan incubator if you like.</para><para>I believe that fact deserves to be nationally recognised, particularly for the strong advocacy on the issue of the then premier, Wayne Goss.</para><para>The important thing in the present debate, however, is that even from the start, in 1994-95, when funding first flowed, everyone concerned knew that it was a program for which the states and territories would over time assume responsibility.</para><para>Perhaps Ms Bligh has failed to read her departmental briefs on the history of NALSAS.</para><para>In the 1999-2000 Budget the Commonwealth Government announced it would continue to fund its contribution to the strategy only for another three yearsâto the end of 2002.</para><para>Ms Bligh would surely remember that, even if she's conveniently forgotten the origins of the program, because by that time she was Queensland's education minister.</para><para>Can it be that the dog has eaten her homework yet again?</para><para>The fact is that the states and territoriesâand the non-government education authoritiesâhave been aware since 1999 that NALSAS would end in 2002 and that they would have to meet their agreed obligation to fund it from their own resources.</para><para>That's four years Ms Bligh: One, Two, Three, Four.</para><para>In case there is anyone else on the Labor side who fails to understand what the situation has always been, this is what the 1999-2000 DETYA Portfolio Budget Papers stateâit's on page 28:</para><para>`The measure provides $90 million from 1999-2000 to 2001-02, commencing 1 January 2000. This funding will mean that the Commonwealth will have provided funding under the Strategy for seven years, by which time it should have become self-sustaining.'</para><para>The Commonwealth has contributed more than $200 million to NALSAS since it began in 1994-95.</para><para>The role of NALSAS was to support four priority Asian languagesâJapanese, Chinese, Indonesian and Koreanâand studies of Asia across the curriculum in schools. The majority of NALSAS funding has in fact been used for teacher professional development and development of curriculum resources.</para><para>Over the past eight years the NALSAS strategy did have a positive impact in the numbers of students studying an Asian language and the number of schools teaching Asian languages.</para><para>In 2000, more than 750,000 Australian students were studying one of the four NALSAS languagesâ23.4 per cent of all studentsâand just under half of all schools were offering a NALSAS language program.</para><para>Primary schools in particular have seen a rapid increase in the take-up of languages. Yet the proportion of senior students studying a language fell slightly from a peak of 14.45 per cent in 1996 to 13.22 per cent in 2000.</para><para>And despite the original targets of 60 per cent of all Year 10 and 15 per cent of all Year 12 students participating in NALSAS by 2000, only 8.6 per cent of Year 10 and 4.5 per cent of Year 12 students were in fact doing so.</para><para>The Commonwealth continues to fund the Languages Other Than English (LOTE) programâat a cost of $20 million a yearâas one of the eight key learning areas in the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century. </para><para>Mr Presidentâ</para><para>It is interesting that the Queensland minister has seen fit to express her disappointmentâI'm sure it is really a Thespian performance on her partâ in the decision of the federal minister to end NALSAS in accordance with the plan everyone has known about since 1999.</para><para>What is even more interesting is that Ms Bligh, in her widely circulated letter, goes on to say this:</para><para>`Our government understands the importance of learning another language to the future of Queensland, our children and our ties with other countries and cultures.'</para><para>It has chosen a strange way to demonstrate this commitment.</para><para>It is a fact that since the middle of last year, when the Labor Party thought it had at last found an issue to run with, the ALP has been attempting to create confusion among parents by suggesting that Asian languages will no longer be taught in schools.</para><para>But the fact is the teaching of languages, as with other subjects taught in state government schools, is primarily managed and funded by state governments.</para><para>Primarily is the key wordâthis budget year alone, the Commonwealth is providing $2.4 billion as supplementary funding to the states' $18.3 billionâthat's a supplement of more than 13 per cent.</para><para>The real issueâcertainly in Queensland's case, where the state treasurer has clearly run out of envelopes on the back of which he can do his budget calculationsâis financial responsibility and prudent budgeting.</para><para>Ms Bligh says she's short by $3.8 million. That's only 13 per cent of the finalâdoubled: they can't even get that rightâcost of the Goodwill Bridge that her bread-and-circuses premier insisted should be built for pedestrians across the Brisbane River.</para><para>It's not even icing on the cake when compared with the $280 million-plus Lang Park redevelopment sponsored by the state treasurer who is also minister for sport.</para><para>And it pales even further into insignificance when the $404 million extra Queensland can expect to get from the new Grants Commission relativities, illustrative estimates of which were released last month, pumps into the system. It's only 0.9 per cent of that additional funding.</para><para>And the specific language program that has raised her desire to find someone else to blame should anyway have been factored into the education budget forward estimates long ago. </para><para>Ms Bligh's problem isn't that the Commonwealth has gone out there and monstered her.</para><para>It is that she can't manage the education budget.</para><para>It is that she apparently can't win a budget review argument with the treasurerâif she's that short.</para><para>It is that she has a lot of angry and underpaid and under-resourced teachers on her hands.</para><para>And it is that their pay claim is going to the state industrial commission for arbitration and an outcome that will blow yet another hole in the Beattie Labor government's shredded budgetary credibility.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation Committee Report</title><page.no>10524</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>10524</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to incorporate an adjournment speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para>The Government's response to the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services on auditing of superannuation funds was tabled on 20 March. I made a brief statement that day.</para><para>Auditing is one of the first control points if anything goes wrong. The community, quite rightly in my view, has the expectation that, if internal controls don't pick up any weaknesses or problems, audit reports must be able to be relied upon to provide early warning of potential weakness which may lead to fund failure.</para><para>Given that superannuation is compulsory, the Committee has always favoured a prescriptive approach to its regulation. Recognising this, and that superannuation is a specialist area, the Committee pointed out in its report that a higher standard is required of those who carry out audits of superannuation funds, than that which is required for commercial companies where people may choose to invest.</para><para>I was most interested to note that there was significant support for the Committee's report from the peak accounting body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia.</para><para>I'll now turn to each of the Committee's recommendations and the government's response:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 1- Reporting to the regulator</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that Part 16 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) be amended to require auditors to report to the regulator any breach of compliance with the Act or suspicion of a fund's unsatisfactory financial position, at the same time as they report such issues to the trustee.</inline></para><para>The issues identified by the Committee which led to this recommendation laid the foundations for subsequent examination by the Superannuation Working Group, headed by Don Mercer. I am pleased to note that the Government supports this recommendation and that it will pursue</para><para>legislative change to require auditors to inform the regulator of any concerns at the same time that the trustee is notified. This will go a long way towards providing that essential early warning about potential weakness which may lead to fund failure.</para><para>While the proposed approach has been criticized by a small section of the industry on the grounds of compliance costs, I would point out that if the auditor provided the regulator with a copy of any report provided to the trustee, as opposed to providing a separate report, this would ensure that auditors' reporting costs are not adversely affected.</para><para>The same critics acknowledged that the proposal would raise the bar for those who give advice and are involved in the auditing and administration of superannuation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 2âAuditor independence</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the SIS Act be amended to require that auditors of superannuation funds be independent and that the auditor of a company is not also the auditor of its superannuation fund.</inline></para><para>I am not surprised that the government does not support this recommendation. However, in an environment characterized by a spate of corporate collapses, there had been a lot of complacency, and a `wake-up' call was needed, not only for parliamentarians, but also for the professional bodies.</para><para>The Committee was one of the first groups to raise the issue of auditor independence, as auditors are uniquely placed to provide independent assurance of financial reporting, administration, control and accountability. Since the Committee's report, the issue appears to have been taken much more seriously.</para><para>If auditors are to be the `first line' defence against corporate fraud, they must not only have the relevant skills and experience, but they must also be independent from their corporate masters.</para><para>To ensure that they have the necessary skills and experience, I note that the larger accounting firms have established specialist superannuation audit teams where a different audit partner from the same firm is involved in the superannuation fund audit to that of the company. I also note that smaller firms have had to specifically upskill and update their audit practitioners.</para><para>Whether audit independence is actually impaired, or whether there is only a perception that it is, one suggestion to address the issue is to adopt the Managed Investments Scheme model which would require a different audit partner to that of the company to be involved in the superannuation fund audit.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 3âReporting on risk management and investment strategies</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that APRA prepare a set of guidelines outlining the specific areas which should be addressed in the audit report on assessments of risk management systems and investment strategies for superannuation funds.</inline></para><para>Although it has noted this recommendation, the Government response appears to have failed to address the issue here. What is wrong with requiring the regulator, APRA, to prepare a set of guidelines outlining specific areas which need to be addressed in audit reports? APRA has issued guidelines before, ASIC does it all the timeâ what is the problem? Given that it is going to be self-regulatory, it is best for such guidelines to come from APRA, who could develop them in conjunction with the professional bodies.</para><para>The Committee envisaged that the development of such guidelines would increase the focus on corporate governance arrangements and risk management issues.</para><para>The guidelines would be complementary to, but quite different from, the Risk Management Plan which the Government has in mind. Expanding the scope of audit reporting to incorporate reporting on funds' risk management systems, is one way of addressing what was seen to be an area of weakness in current audit requirements. Such a proposal would ensure that the scope of superannuation audits is aligned with those operating in other segments of the financial services industry.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 4âFollow-up audits</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that where a qualified audit report has been issued (other than merely on a technical ground such as a late return), there should be a formal requirement for a follow-up audit to be conducted within a specified time.</inline></para><para>The Government says that implementation of Recommendation 1 will ensure that APRA is notified of any qualification in an audit report. But how do we know that APRA will work quickly enough once a qualified audit report is brought to its attention? This approach is putting a lot of </para><para>faith in an organization which has not performed particularly well in recent times to prevent fund failure. If APRA had a good track record, I wouldn't mind so much. But the events of the last two years have diminished my faith in APRA's ability to respond quickly and appropriately to early warning signals.</para><para>The Committee's proposal for follow-up audits would have largely formalized what we understand to be existing practice. These follow-up audits would address issues which, if not addressed, may jeopardize the financial condition and/or the safety of the members' benefits.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 5âAudit reports to members</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the auditor's report on a superannuation fund be sent, as a matter of routine, to all fund members, in order to improve accountability and ensure transparency of the trustee's actions and communication about the fund's financial state.</inline></para><para>Once again the Government has merely noted this recommendation. It is not good enough that audit reports are only to be sent to members on request. In the interests of improved transparency and accountability, audit reports should go to all members as a matter of course to keep them informed. Given the importance of superannuation, it is surprising that audit reports are only sent to members on request.</para><para>Even if the audit report were sent in an abridged form accompanying the annual member statement, at least this would provide members with better information about the performance and sustainability of their fund. Another cost effective way of achieving this recommendation is to include a copy of the audit report in the annual report to members. Including audit reports in annual reports is not only good practice, but also a basic accountability tool.</para><para>I had hoped that we could move on from the `dark ages' to a more enlightened approach.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 6âMandatory prudential reviews</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the larger superannuation funds regulated by APRA be required to carry out a prudential review, at a minimum of once every five years.</inline></para><para>All the better large funds already carry out prudential reviews as a matter of sound prudential management and best practice, so it is not a big imposition on the industry. In any case, it is a good governance practice which can only be to the benefit and protection of trustees themselves</para><para>who need to satisfy themselves that risk assessments have been done, that they are complying with statutory requirements, and that they are governing the fund properly.</para><para>I realize that the new licensing requirements will require the preparation of, and reporting against, Risk Management Plans and that this will go some way towards strengthening a fund's governance practices. But risk management is only one part of good governance. It is best practice to have a regular, broader prudential review which provides an independent assessment about whether the trustees are governing the fund properly. Such a review could be conducted on a 3 to 5 year cycle, or whenever there has been a fundamental change in the fund's corporate governance or fund administration systems.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 7âCertification by trustees prior to an audit</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that APRA consult with the relevant professional and regulatory bodies with a view to developing a requirement for trustees to provide a statement to the auditor prior to the audit of a superannuation entity. The statement would certify that the accounts were believed to be in good order and to comply with the SIS Act, and would note any areas of weakness or concern in the fund's financial and management strategies.</inline></para><para>In making this recommendation the Committee was fully aware that the current arrangements of a majority of medium and large audit firms require such an attestation prior to the completion of their annual audits.</para><para>However, the Government appears to have missed the point. What the Committee's recommendation tried to do was identify in more detail what should be required in attestations about the condition of the fund prior to the commencement of the audit. This would place more responsibility on the trustees to provide assurance to the auditor that the affairs of the fund were in good order prior to the commencement of the audit.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 8âAssessment of competency</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the current move within the accounting and auditing profession to require the formal assessment of competency in auditing superannuation funds proceed as a matter of some urgency.</inline></para><para>The Government, while supporting proposals designed to improve the quality and skills within the auditing profession, considered that this was a matter for industry. Given the problems associated with auditing, and the lack of auditor independence, I am not at all sure that the public would agree that self-regulation is enough to ensure auditing standards </para><para>are met. The Committee has been at the forefront of this issue, and has consistently called for prescriptive standards not only because superannuation is compulsory, but also because it is such a specialist area.</para><para>Unfortunately, some auditors, like some financial planners, do not always achieve the professional standards set by their professional bodies.</para><para>A formal assessment of competency in auditing superannuation funds is the way forward. Accordingly, the Committee has now written to the three peak accounting bodiesâthe Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, the National Institute of Accountants and CPA Australiaâcalling on them to demonstrate how they are upgrading the arrangements for improving the quality and skills within the auditing profession.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.08 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>10527</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>10527</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>ACIS Administration ActâACIS Administration (Modulation) Amendment Guidelines 2003 (No. 1).</para><para>Christmas Island ActâList of applied Western Australian Acts for the period 21 September 2002 to 21 March 2003.</para><para>Cocos (Keeling) Islands ActâList of applied Western Australian Acts for the period 21 September 2002 to 21 March 2003.</para><para>Criminal Code ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 43.</para><para>Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) ActâDetermination under paragraph 15(1)(e) No. 1 of 2003.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>10528</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Farm Management Deposit Scheme</title><page.no>10528</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 542)</subtitle><id.no>542</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10528</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 15 August 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many Australian primary producers currently hold deposits under the Farm Management Deposit (FMD) scheme.</para><para>(2)	What is the total value of FMD holdings.</para><para>(3)	Producers belonging to which industries are the biggest users of the FMD scheme.</para><para>(4)	(a) What percentage of total deposits are held by producers from the grain industry;

I am advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that the answers to these questions are as follows:</para><para>(3)	Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) establishes a complaints-based regulatory scheme for online content in Australia. Under this scheme, any person can complain to the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) if they believe Australians can access prohibited or potentially prohibited online content using an Internet carriage service or that such material is being hosted in Australia by an Internet content host.</para><para>The ABA investigates all valid complaints. Action is taken when online material is determined to be of a prohibited nature. Prohibited content is classified based on the classification scheme administered by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). The prohibited categories for Australian hosted content are Refused Classification (RC), X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures. For material hosted overseas, the prohibited categories are RC and X.</para><para>If, following an investigation, the ABA is satisfied that Internet content hosted in Australia is prohibited content, the ABA must issue a final take-down notice to the relevant Internet content host (ICH), directing the ICH not to host the prohibited content. Failure to comply with such a notice is a criminal offence and a continuing offence for each day the contravention continues. This may result in a maximum penalty per day of $5500 for an individual and $27,500 for a corporation.</para><para>If the ABA is satisfied that Internet content hosted outside Australia is prohibited or potentially prohibited, it must notify the content to makers of the filter software products that are listed in the Schedule to the Internet Industry Association codes of practice (scheduled filters). The makers of these products have agreed to update their filters to give effect to the ABA notifications, thereby blocking access to the content. The codes require Australian Internet Service Providers to provide - at no more than cost price - one or more of the scheduled filters for the use of their subscribers.</para><para>(4)	The ABA is an independent federal statutory authority responsible for the regulation of free-to-air, radio and television, pay TV, digital broadcasting and Internet content in Australia. To this end, the ABA administers the online content scheme set out in Schedule 5 to the Act.</para><para>As indicated in response to question (3), Schedule 5 enables any person to complain to the ABA if they believe Australians can access prohibited or potentially prohibited online content using an Internet carriage service or that such material is being hosted in Australia by an ICH. The ABA undertakes investigations of all valid complaints. Under Section 27 of Schedule 5 the ABA has investigated certain content when a complaint has not provided sufficient information.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 5 to the Act provides for the ABA to take action to investigate complaints about Internet content. The ABA must issue a take-down notice in relation to Australian hosted Internet content following an investigation if it is satisfied that the content is prohibited (according to the classification system outlined in the response to question (3)).</para><para>Schedule 5 to the Act also provides that if the content is hosted outside Australia, the ABA determines the likely classification of the content. If the ABA considers that the content is likely to be classified X or RC, it is notified to makers of the filter software products that are listed in the Schedule to the registered codes of practice for ISPs. As previously indicated, the makers of these products have agreed to update their filters to give effect to the ABA notifications.</para><para>(6)	The review will look at updating the existing telecommunication offences to address contemporary and emerging technological developments. </para><para>As indicated in response to question (1), the review will consider whether to extend the offence of using a telecommunications service in an offensive, menacing or harassing manner that currently applies to e-mail and telephone services, to also cover website material. </para><para>(7)	to (10) Questions (7) to (10) fall within the responsibilities of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I am advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that the answers to these questions are as follows:</para><para>(7)	If material investigated by the ABA is found to be prohibited, as defined in Part 3 of Schedule 5, the ABA may order it to be taken down if it is hosted in Australia or, if it is hosted overseas, referred to the makers of certain Internet content filters so that the filters are configured to block access to the content. </para><para>The prohibited categories for content are based on the classification scheme administered by the OFLC. Australian hosted prohibited content is RC, X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures. For material hosted overseas, the prohibited categories are RC and X.</para><para>(8)	The ABA has established and Online Complaints Hotline (http://www.aba.gov.au/internet/hotline) which adopts conventions that are agreed and used by international Internet complaints hotlines. The ABA's Hotline enables any person to complain to the ABA in writing if they believe Australians can access prohibited or potentially prohibited online content. Complaints can also be directed to:</para><para>The Manager Online Services Content Regulation </para><para>Australian Broadcasting Authority </para><para>GPO Box Q500 Queen Victoria Building NSW 1230 </para><para>FAX: (02) 9334 7783 </para><para>Email: online@aba.gov.au </para><para>The ABA operates a toll-free information service (1800 22 6667) where details on how to lodge a complaint can be accessed.</para><para>NetAlert, an independent body established by the Government to encourage and promote use of the Internet by all Australians, operates a toll-free national Help Line (1800 880 176) which is used to promote its website; to distribute information kits and direct people to the ABA Hotline if they wish to make a complaint. </para><para>(9)	and (10) As previously mentioned in response to questions (3), (5) and (7), there are different mechanisms in place under Schedule 5 of the Act to deal with prohibited content hosted within Australia and prohibited content that is hosted outside Australia. Australian sites hosting prohibited content may be issued with a take-down notice from the ABA. Overseas sites hosting prohibited content are referred to the makers of certain Internet content filters so that the filters are configured to block access to the content. The ABA can not issue a take-down notice for overseas hosted content. However, in the case of `sufficiently serious' content (ie child pornography) it refers the content to counterpart overseas hotlines.</para><para>(11)	(a)	The concept of an Australian High Tech Crime Centre (the Centre) was endorsed at the Conference of Commissioners of Police of Australasia and the South West Pacific Region and later by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (November 2002). Agreement was reached between the States, Territories and Commonwealth for the Centre to be hosted by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), while other jurisdictions undertook to support the Centre.</para><para>The aim of the Centre is to provide a national coordinated approach to combating serious, complex and/or multi-jurisdictional high tech crimes, especially those beyond the capability of single jurisdictions; to assist in improving the capacity of all jurisdictions to deal with high tech crime; and to support efforts to protect the National Information Infrastructure. </para><para>Police Commissioners are due to meet in March 2003 to further refine the roles, functions and activities of the Centre.</para><para>	(b)	The Centre is not a subsidiary of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC). The Centre is being established in recognition of the distributed and multi-jurisdictional nature of electronic crime, and the commitment of all Australian police services to work together in fighting it successfully. Other non-police organisations will also be invited to participate, including other Government departments, private and public sector industry groups, overseas law enforcement agencies, and other local crime agencies such as the ACC.</para><para>	(c)	The AFP hosted model was selected by the Australian Police Commissioners as the preferred method of developing the Centre. As such, the centre will be located within the Transnational Crime Coordination Centre of the AFP Headquarters in Canberra.</para><para>(12)	The day to day running of the Centre will be the responsibility of the Director, who will answer to an Australian High Tech Crime Centre Board of Management made up of Police Commissioners.  </para><para>Police Commissioners will meet in March 2003 to determine the exact level of the governance and the constitution of the Board of Management.</para><para>(13)	(a)	When Police Commissioners meet in March 2003 the level of personnel commitment will be one of the agenda items. All jurisdictions have committed to supporting the Centre but we are yet to determine exactly what form that support will take. </para><para>As mentioned previously, the centre will engage other organisations including Government departments, private and public sector industry groups, overseas law enforcement agencies, and other local crime agencies. </para><para>The AFP has committed its High Tech Crime Team to form the nucleus of the Centre's staffing. The High Tech Crime Team has just finalised a round of recruiting which will bring its numbers up to over ten people. In coming months, with the recruitment of further intelligence staff, we expect that AFP complement to grow to more than thirteen people. </para><para>	(b)	The Australian High Tech Crime Centre team will have a wide skill base to reflect the diverse nature of electronic crime, and includes areas such as general policing, national investigations, international liaisons, policy, intelligence and technical specialisation. All work to address the issues of high tech crime.</para><para>	(c)	As the Centre is a joint initiative between the states, territories and the Commonwealth, the Centre will address a very broad spectrum of criminality.
