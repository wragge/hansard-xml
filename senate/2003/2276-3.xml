It is a matter of regret that measures to place parent visas on a sounder basis and to expand their availability to people who wish to reunite families have been the victim of political rebuff in this place. I offer some sound advice to the opponents of the previous bill, which attempted to both liberalise parent reunion arrangements and defray potential future costs on the Australian community: think it through and think it through seriously. Having done that, reverse the position you previously held and vote to pass this eminently sensible bill. There should be no reason for argument over migration policy in this country. We are, after all—apart from Indigenous Australians—either migrants or descendants of them.</para></talk.start><para>The purpose of the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> is to amend the Migration Act 1958 to accommodate the new contributory parent visa under the visa application charge in the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and, in so doing, to amend the Migration Regulations 1994 to create new classes of contributory parent visas, permanent and temporary, with increased financial obligations in relation to health charges and social security payments. That this is the third attempt by the Howard government to introduce a new class of user-pays visa for parent migration to Australia speaks volumes for the paucity of policy talent on the other side of the chamber. It is good that parents who wish to join their children here in our country should be able to do so. But I believe the Australian community would rightly insist that such arrivals, at later ages and with a higher degree of likelihood of requiring expensive medical treatment that comes with age, should be at least basically able to guarantee that they can support themselves without a call on the public purse.</para><para>While discussing the historic policy failure that we see across the chamber and in parts of the cross-bench, I would like to record the fact that, in January, the Labor Party finally discovered the importance of citizenship, multiculturalism and settlement to our nation. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs said of this Australia Day conversion of the Labor Party—perhaps it was not on the road to Damascus and maybe it did not involve a blinding flash of light, but it was nevertheless significant— that the Labor Party shadow minister had done an excellent job of summarising the directions and changes in citizenship policy since the 1948 act. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>We thank him for his expressions of support for the Howard government's initiatives over the past seven years.</para></quote><para>It's great to have the Labor Party on board with us on citizenship, multicultural and settlement policy. The minister pointed out that, while Labor had produced a disappointing document, it did support what the Howard government had done over seven years. The minister said it was unfortunate that the Labor spokesman had called for numerous time-wasting reviews at every opportunity in his paper and he noted that this was typical of Labor's approach to policy and implementation—all talk and no action. </para><para>The minister provided a list of initiatives in the area of citizenship and multicultural affairs by the Howard government. I believe it is worth placing at least some of them on the record. They have included the appointment of the first ever Commonwealth Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs; the passing by parliament in March 2002 of the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment Act, which allows dual citizenship for Australians; the increase in take-up rates for citizenship by more than 75 per cent; an advertising campaign targeting eligible residents that produced a 56 per cent increase in applications for citizenship during the period of the campaign in 2001; the commitment of $7.3 million by the coalition government since 1996 to promote Australian citizenship; the introduction of the course, `Let's participate—a course in Australian citizenship'; the introduction of the <inline font-style="italic">What it means to be an Australian Citizen </inline>booklet to educate prospective citizens about civics and citizenship; and, in particular, the introduction of an affirmation using similar language to the citizenship pledge to allow Australian-born people to publicly affirm their commitment to Australia and its people. In addition, the Australian Citizenship Council was formed and it delivered the report <inline font-style="italic">Australian citizenship for a new century</inline> and the Australian Citizenship Council recommendation for the presentation of individual citizenship certificates to all new citizens, including children—who, until then, had been noted on the back of a parent's certificate—has been implemented. There has been expanded community involvement in local neighbourhood welcomes to citizens by increasing the number of service clubs and organisations holding citizenship ceremonies.</para><para>In this regard, could I just deviate a little from my prepared statement and commend the Rotary Club of Hamilton for recently hosting one such citizenship ceremony at the Hamilton Town Hall in conjunction with a local councillor, Councillor Tim Nicholls. It was a very moving ceremony on Australia Day. I had the pleasure of attending after the ceremony and was told it was a ceremony that really touched the heart. I think there were something like 19 new Australians who proudly took their place in the Australian community, and the Hamilton Rotary Club and Councillor Nicholls really deserve to be commended for putting together an event that will be memorable in the minds of all the people who were made citizens on that day and all of those who attended to show their support and appreciation for that brave step that they took.</para><para>There have been other achievements in citizenship and multiculturalism by this government: the observance of the first Citizenship Day on 17 September 2001; the appointment of 31 notable Australians as citizenship ambassadors; the provision of citizenship education and kits to schools under the 2030 program; promotion of citizenship awareness by using high-profile days like Australia Day, Citizenship Day and Harmony Day—which is just over two weeks away, on 21 March—as the focus for citizenship ceremonies, with numbers increasing over recent years; distribution of new promotional materials, including citizenship and affirmation kits and a citizenship stamp with Australia Post; the promotion of a highly successful 50th anniversary in 1999 and the promotion of the Centenary of Federation of Australian citizenship; and collaboration with the National Australia Day Council and the Australian of the Year to highlight citizenship to a broader audience.</para><para>That is the record, or at least part of the record, and I would respectfully submit to honourable senators that it is a full and fine record. It stands in complete contrast to the 13 years in office in which Labor had plenty of opportunities to implement the measures they are now calling for—13 years, in fact, to do anything at all. While Labor are apparently now on board on modern citizenship policies for the new century, they still cannot get their act together properly. For example, Labor want Australia to have a citizenship council. The Howard government in its first term commissioned the Australian Citizenship Council of eminent Australians to review citizenship law and policy. Labor have missed the boat yet again. </para><para>With their new call for a legislative statement of purpose, Labor seem to be dissatisfied with the preamble to the Citizenship Act that was introduced during the time of their own Keating government—again, a critique of themselves. They do not seem to know whether they are coming or going, but I think that we should be good sports on this side of the chamber and offer them the chance to redeem themselves on such an important issue, which really should be above politics and petty point scoring. As I indicated at the beginning of this speech, here is an opportunity—just the latest of many, in fact—for those opposite to get with the strength. I urge the Labor Party and others opposite to support the passage of this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>9201</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to make a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. These bills will enable 4,000 more parents of migrants to come to Australia, which everyone would agree is a welcome turnaround from the harsh cuts that this government made to the scheme earlier.</para></talk.start><para>There is a catch, however. All but 500 of these new places will be available only to the parents of well-off migrants, while 3,500 of the new places are being provided under a new visa which requires the applicant to pay a non-refundable health charge of $25,000 if they want to apply for a permanent visa. If they are happy enough with a temporary visa, with options to cough up more for a permanent visa, this amount can be paid in instalments, with an up-front charge of $15,000. On top of this, an assurance of support bond must be paid. This will cost $10,000 for the primary applicant and $4,000 for the secondary applicant. The bond is refundable after 10 years, minus the cost of any welfare benefits they may have accessed during that time.</para><para>Under the current visa system, the cost for a sole surviving parent to migrate would total $5,725. This includes a health charge of $1,050, an assurance of support bond of $3,500 and a visa application charge of $1,175. This is no small amount of money, but it remains within savings reach for most people. Under the new visa class, the cost would include a fee of $25,000, an assurance of support of $10,000 and the visa application charge of $1,175. This adds up to a total of $36,175. Simply to bring one parent, let alone both parents, to Australia becomes prohibitive. For many Australians or relatives and families to gather this amount of money is unachievable or will cause significant hardship.</para><para>Labor has always maintained that, whilst it is appropriate for sponsoring families to make a contribution to the health and welfare costs associated with the migration of parents, the system needs to be equitable and not cause undue hardship. The scheme outlined in these bills is not equitable and is likely to cause hardship. It is irresponsible for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to crow in a media release `More parent migrants to be reunited with their families' when this announcement will come as nothing but a cruel joke for those who simply cannot raise that kind of money or are waiting patiently for their parents to be allocated two of the 500 places that are currently on offer.</para><para>Given the uncertainty surrounding the length of the queue and the scarcity of places, many of those in the existing queue will aim to transfer to the new visa if this legislation goes ahead, regardless of what it might cost them. For some, this will be unachievable; for others, it will impose considerable financial hardship. I would like to point out that, even with the 4,000 new places, that is still only just over half the number of places that were available under Labor. These bills are not providing more places; they are replacing only a fraction of the places that the Howard government had already taken away, and they are doing so with the unfortunate addition of a $36,000 price tag. </para><para>In the language of this government and its immigration department, to live in the same country as your ageing parents is a case of `family plus'—in this case, an added extra, a little luxury for those who can afford it—but is certainly not within the scope of the government's obligations or interest. I would think the primary interest of the government would be to ensure the wellbeing, both physical and emotional, of those in its care. Strong, supportive families are surely an important factor in the wellbeing of all Australians.</para><para>In considering parent migration there is always going to be something of a balancing act. Parent migrants tend to be in an older age bracket and so cost more to the budget, as they create more additional health and welfare costs than they offset by tax. People wanting to bring their parents to Australia usually expect to support them and are perfectly willing to do so. Countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the UK require some kind of an undertaking on the part of a relative that they will be financially responsible for the parents who are migrating. But viewing parent migrants as a burden that Australian taxpayers should not have to shoulder is unfair and mistaken. The countries I mentioned do not require up-front charges for health costs or a monetary bond. The amount of money the legislation before us requires of people up-front is simply unwarranted. This government's user-pays framework is not very good at taking into account the contributions people make to society that cannot be counted in dollars. Economic analysis is not sufficient to weigh up the pros and cons of parent migration.</para><para>Parent migrants form no small proportion of Australian society and are an important part of our community. They are valuable to Australia—to our culture, to our social cohesion and to the structure of our families. Parent migrants take up much of the unpaid and undervalued work—such as child care, housework and work with community and volunteer organisations—as well as help to create strong and supportive families. This kind of assistance from families can be vital in helping migrant women back into the workplace after having children. Family reunion primarily serves social, not economic, functions. As Bob Birrell from Monash University has pointed out:</para><quote><para>If entry is available only to the rich, it makes a mockery of the social purposes of family reunion.</para></quote><para>For all of that, some of us might love to have a bit of distance between us and our in-laws! We all understand why people who come from other countries to live here would want to bring their parents after them. They want their children to know their grandparents, with all of the cultural and social benefits that brings, and they want to be able to look after their parents as they get older. We can all understand why there are thousands of people every year who apply to bring their parents to Australia under this scheme.</para><para>In the last year that the scheme was administered by a Labor government, 8,900 parent visas were issued. Labor had already introduced measures that required migrants to make a contribution to the future health and welfare costs of their parents. Labor had also introduced the balance of family test, which helped to ensure that the migration program was focused on those parents who needed to be reunited with their families in order to achieve adequate personal, social and economic support.</para><para>Under the Howard government, parent visas were capped at 7,600 in 1996-97 and then cut back even further in 1997-98, to 1,000 places. After attempts to create a new and much more expensive class of visa were rejected in the Senate, the number of places available for parents under the existing scheme was cut back even further, to a mere 500 places. That is 500 places for all of Australia's migrant parents all over the world. This measure was always going to create a severe shortage of opportunities for migrants to bring their parents to Australia, and that is exactly what it did. I do not need to point out how much stress and unhappiness that has caused many people both here and overseas.</para><para>There are now over 22,000 applications currently awaiting processing or being processed. Unsurprisingly, applicants can expect, as DIMIA puts it, `a substantial wait before their application is finalised'. It has been estimated that it will take 40 years to clear the queue, even if there were no more applications. This situation should never have come about. It was never inevitable that the number of parents waiting to migrate to Australia should grow so large and wait so long. </para><para>There is now a crisis in parent visa arrangements. The Howard government deliberately produced this crisis in order to bully the Senate into passing legislation that is patently unfair. The 500-place cap has created a situation where people are desperate, often with little hope of their ageing parents ever being able to arrive here. This is certainly the case for the constituents who approach my office about parent migration, usually at their wits' end. They are in a situation where any increase in places, at any price, will be welcomed, because by this stage they have no other options. This is not an acceptable means of getting legislation through the parliament, and it is not an acceptable means of forcing Australia's migrant community to accept these new and exorbitant fees and charges. What would appear to be a choice for the opposition when looking at this legislation is a no-win situation that only the Howard government could cook up: do we agree to legislation that will allow some people a good outcome, if this outcome is only achievable for those who can afford it?</para><para>Equity must be at the forefront of our minds when deciding on legislation that will affect people's everyday lives. We do not want to see the idea of `luxury'—an added plus afforded only to those who are rich—to start applying to things like quality health and education or a decent standard of living. We are seeing this mentality seep slowly out of this government's offices and into the public sphere. Australians should not be forced to accept this. Parent migration should not be solely the precinct of the rich.</para><para>It goes without saying that migration is vitally important for Australia's economic future. The emphasis in this government's migration program is on skilled migration. Australia competes with other countries for skilled young migrants in professions in which we have shortages. The difficulty of achieving family reunion can be a significant disincentive to come here. In encouraging people with skills that this country needs to come here, I think we should be serious about our investment in both their skills and their lives in Australia. It is not unreasonable, therefore, for them to be able to be reunited with their parents in this country.</para><para>Australia is also home to people who arrive here under our humanitarian program. It is not unreasonable for those who came here seeking asylum, those who have fled persecution of some kind and often had little choice about where they would end up, to want to be reunited with their parents and, indeed, to share with their parents the new lives they have made for themselves. It is reasonable to expect that family reunion be an important aspect of any humanitarian migration program.</para><para>It is also reasonable to expect migrants to make some contribution towards the health and welfare costs of their, often, ageing parents. However, it is neither reasonable nor fair to enable only the most wealthy migrants to Australia to have access to this privilege. The Howard government is always quick to bring up the question of the queue. The queue—and those who supposedly jump it— has been this government's ballast against local and international criticism of its humanitarian program. Australia detains asylum seekers—families and children—in unsuitable conditions, with inadequate access to judicial review, in order that the queue remains fair. How are these asylum seekers apparently jumping the queue? They do that by having enough money to pay their way. So under some circumstances it is not acceptable to pay more money to get migration outcomes, even if this outcome is asylum from persecution.</para><para>As I understand the bills before us, it is acceptable to the Howard government that people pay more money to achieve migration outcomes, provided that you are not in dire humanitarian need and provided that you are paying them. We are not really talking about jumping the queue here. We are talking about the creation of two different queues: one very fast queue for the rich parents and one very slow queue for the poorer parents. The new visa could be considered as a $36,000 e-tag for the parent migration tollway. </para><para>The government's manipulative campaign to sell this legislation to the parliament and to Australia's migrant community has been at the cost of thousands of parents who have not been able to migrate here since the cap of 500 places was implemented. It has also been at the cost of these parents' families, their communities and our society as a whole. The number of places available to parent migrants in Australia must be increased. But these places must be equally available to all who apply, not just to those who happen to be lucky enough to afford them. On behalf of Senator Sherry, I move the opposition second reading amendment No. 2580 which has been circulated in the chamber:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:</para><para>	(a)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	the Howard Government slashed the number of visas available for parents seeking to migrate to Australia to join their families to 500 in 1998,</para><para>	(ii)	through this savage cut in visa numbers, the Howard Government has deliberately created a queue of over 20 000 parents seeking to migrate,</para><para>	(iii)	the deliberate creation of this queue has caused stress and suffering for the families involved,</para><para>	(iv)	having created this crisis, the Howard Government's only answer is a new visa class which requires the payment of a $25 000 fee which will be beyond the means of many, and</para><para>	(v)	while Labor has historically supported sponsoring families making a contribution to the health and welfare costs associated with the migration of parents, the system needs to be equitable and not cause undue hardship; and</para><para>	(b)	therefore calls on the Government immediately to introduce a fair system of parent visas, which will stop families in the current queue suffering additional stress and hardship and will meet Australia's needs into the future”.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>9204</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak briefly to the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline> because the legislation is obviously something that some of the communities with whom I have contact have raised with me on a number of occasions, and I refer particularly to the Chinese community. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a piece of legislation that is a cynical play on the very strongly held views and desires of many migrants in Australia to have their parents migrate to join them. The reality is that the Howard government has created a crisis in parent migration, and what we are seeing today is a response to that crisis. The bills may well receive some support from members of the community, people who have been waiting an extraordinarily long time to have their parents join them and who have the prospect of many more years of waiting if the current draconian cap remains in place. So, on that basis, it would not surprise me if some members of the community think, `This is the best that we can get, and we will welcome it.' But the reality is that these communities have been put in this position by the draconian approach that the Howard government has taken to the issue of parent migration and by the cynical way in which the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has manipulated the numbers in this visa class in order to put pressure both on the communities that have this need and on the Senate. I am disappointed that he appears to have been successful in doing so.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to go back over a number of years, but I do not propose to canvass all the information, particularly that which Senator Stephens has already put before the chamber. In 1995-96 under a Labor government, the number of parent visas issued was 8,900. If only those numbers were available today to the people in the Chinese and other communities who are waiting for their parents to join them. However, consistent with its policies in a lot of areas, the Howard government upon coming to office immediately took a very aggressive approach to limiting parent migration. It tightened the balance of family test, successfully introduced a two-year waiting period for social security and introduced a cap on parent visas, from 8,900 in the previous year under Labor, as I said, to 7,600 in 1996-97. This number was slashed to 1,000 in the following year. So, over a period of two years, the number of parent visas dropped from nearly 9,000 to 1,000. It is no wonder that many in the migrant communities, both in South Australia and in other states, who desire to have their parents join them are feeling extremely stressed and upset at the delays, and the prospect of interminable and continuing delays, on the applications of their parents to join them in this country. </para><para>We have a situation where the government has created a crisis in parent visas by reducing the issue of parent visas from 8,900— that is, nearly 9,000—to 1,000 in 1997-98. But it gets worse. Similar amendments were put to the parliament subsequently which would have created a second, quicker visa application category for those who could afford to pay it. Labor combined with the minor parties to disallow those regulations, and in response the minister then reduced the number of places available for parents in this ordinary queue to 500. That cap remains in place.</para><para>If any of those opposite wish to trumpet their support for the parent migration program and wish to go to migrant communities to assert that they are supportive of parent migration, I would remind them and I would remind these communities that Labor has a record of nearly 9,000 issued visas in this category in 1995-96 and that, until these amendments are passed, if they are, this government has chosen in this recent year to cap the number of parent migrant visas at 500. This is a crisis of the government's own making, and it is not surprising that members of many ethnic communities, and I speak particularly of my contact with the Chinese community, are both fearful and upset about this situation.</para><para>It is estimated that there around 22½ thousand applications in the pipeline, with a cap of 500. About 14,800 have been fully processed and have queue dates. Given the ages of most of the people seeking entry in this category, and given this government's aggressive approach to capping the number of parent visas, many of these parents are likely to die before they ever get to the front of the queue. So it is not surprising that their families are pretty desperate, and it is not surprising that many families are so desperate they are prepared to pay any price they can afford, or even that they cannot afford, in order to ensure that their parents join them in this country. I have had quite a number of constituents lobby me about this issue, and it is extraordinarily sad to see people in such distress when they have elderly parents who wish to join them but who are prevented from doing so, not for any reason other than the fact that this government has chosen to slash the number of parent visas issued and to cap the number at 500.</para><para>A very cynical approach has been taken by the minister in both the capping of the parent visa category to 500 in response to the Senate's prior disallowance of the regulations and also his subsequent response. In May 2002, Minister Ruddock announced the 2002-03 migration numbers. He made the statement as follows:</para><quote><para>... 4,000 places in a full year remain available for parent migration should there be support from opposition parties to allow legislation to ensure a fair share of health and welfare costs is covered by a parent and the Australian sponsor compared to taxpayers in general.</para></quote><para>In that statement it is clear that the minister was indicating he would be prepared to add an additional 3½ thousand places on the basis of the new and more expensive visas and an additional 500 places over and above the existing 500 cap in the ordinary queue if the Senate passed the sort of legislation that is before us today. In other words, the Senate has had held before it a stick and carrot. We are told, `If you don't pass it we'll cap it at an inhumane number of 500, which will ensure that the great majority of people who apply for this category will not ever reach Australia, but if you do pass it then we're going to expand the number of visas for those people who can scrounge together sufficient money to pay for this.' It is an objectionable way to deal with the strongly held desires of migrant families who wish for their parents to join them. </para><para>I welcome the amendment which has been moved by Senator Stephens on behalf of the opposition. It is a sad day when we have a situation where we have such a small number of visas for ordinary people—for people whose families do not have $25,000—but we are prepared to fast-track parent visa applications for the wealthy. I oppose this. I do not oppose it because I am opposed to an expansion in parent visa numbers—obviously I think that the current government's position on parent visas is appalling—but because it means that many families who are waiting for their parents to join them but cannot afford this sort of money will continue to wait whereas those families who have the money can pay their way in. To my way of thinking, this is an inequitable and unfair piece of legislation that has been brought about by a manufactured crisis in parent visa migration which the community is desperate to have changed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>9206</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Australian Democrats I speak today on this piece of legislation to do with parent migration, the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline>. I make it clear from the outset that the Democrats do not like this legislation, in a large part, but the Democrats like the existing situation even less. That is the dilemma and the challenge that the Senate finds before it. It is true, as Senator Stephens and Senator Wong from the Labor Party have said, that the current situation of parent migration is a crisis, and it is a crisis generated by the government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. For that reason, I am fully in agreement with the first parts of the opposition's amendment. Nonetheless, I do not agree with a couple of their editorial comments at the end, so I move to amend the amendment by deleting parts 4 and 5:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit subparagraphs (iv) and (v), and paragraph (b).</para></quote><para>The rationale that has been put forward by the Labor Party ignores the reality that currently exists. I very much agree that the Labor Party's record on parent migration is far better than the current government's. But that was 1996; this is 2003.</para><para>It is true that the government is in effect trying to hold the Senate to ransom by insisting that it will not expand parent intake without the passage of this type of legislation. But it is not really the Senate that is being held to ransom; the hostages are the thousands and thousands of parents who are wanting to reunite with their families. Quite frankly, as much as I dislike the intent of implementing a visa with such a large fee attached, I do not think it is appropriate for those many thousands of parents that are being kept apart from their families to be simply told, `We would like to help you but it's the government's fault,' and then to have the government saying, `We would help you but it's the Senate's fault or Labor and the Democrats' fault.' That is all very well, but that just leaves them in the middle with finger-pointing either way. I have no doubt it is the government's fault that has left them in that situation. But simply saying to them, `Don't blame us, blame the government,' is not going to help them.</para><para>The final comments of Senator Wong were that many families who cannot afford the sort of fee that is required under this new visa will continue to wait. If you oppose this legislation, they will also continue to wait and they will continue to wait longer. Whilst this is far from the ideal mechanism, it will mean that the current existing visa category intake will double from 500 to 1,000; so quite clearly people will not wait as long as they otherwise would have. Also, those that can afford the new visa with the increased fee will obviously go across to that category, which will reduce the numbers in the queue for the existing visa. So not only will those who cannot afford the new visa have to wait for a shorter period of time because the number allowed in will double but the number in that queue will undoubtedly shrink, which will also mean that they can get through much quicker. It is simply not true to say that people will continue to wait as long if they cannot afford the amount of money that is required for this new visa. That is the reality of the situation. </para><para>The other thing that needs to be emphasised is to do with the history of this. We have heard some of that history from other speakers, and quite rightly so. Back when Labor was in government the intake was 8,900. In the first year of the Howard government it was 7,580. It dropped to 1,080 the next year and then 3,120. Then, when the minister tried to introduce regulations to introduce a similar sort of visa with an increased fee for a health charge, the minister quite openly said, `If this isn't supported, I will cut the intake back to 500 from 3,000.' He made that threat before the Senate made its decision. If I remember correctly, I on behalf of the Democrats moved to disallow that regulation and got the support of the ALP. That new visa category was scrapped and the minister held true to his threat and cut places to 500.</para><para>It is worth noting that the government, at that time, did not maintain the existing visa category—what might be called the `cheaper' category. It abolished it and everybody was made to go into the more expensive category. So there would have been no scope for people who could not afford the greater amount. Again, in 2001, the government brought it forward by way of legislation and it was very similar to the current situation, except that it had a lower intake. Again, it closed the cheaper category of the current intake of 500 people for that year so, again, fewer were able to get in under the existing category, with no likelihood of even that 500 remaining. It is also worth noting that the queue, at that stage, was just under 5,000 people. The queue now, two years later, is over 15,000, with a pipeline of over 22,500, so the crisis has become far worse in the intervening period.</para><para>The other thing, of course, is that at that stage there was a reasonable prospect of Labor winning the election and certainly, through discussions I had with their then shadow spokesperson, Mr Sciacca, there was a reasonable prospect of an increase in the intake if Labor gained office. That, of course, did not happen and we now have a situation where the crisis has deepened enormously. It would be irresponsible for the Democrats to ignore the depth of the crisis and to simply continue to say, `It is the government's fault; go and complain to them,' because one thing is quite clear: this minister is not going to shift on this matter.</para><para>We have now had four years of this draconian cap of only 500, and in just the last two years the queue has ballooned from 5,000 to 15,000. If we reject this legislation now we will condemn those parents to at least another two years with a cap of 500; that is absolutely guaranteed. Imagine what the queue will be like then. If it went from 5,000 to 15,000 in the last couple of years, after another two years it could well be anything—beyond imagination—30,000 or more. That is a completely untenable situation. I would welcome another mechanism for addressing this, but another mechanism is not available. It is the best that we can do under this government.</para><para>We have a responsibility in the Senate— and certainly the Democrats, as a party that takes its balance of power role seriously, has a responsibility—to look at what this means for the people that are affected by the legislation. It is important to look at the principles behind things and it is appropriate to talk about them. We should never forget that legislation is about people and how people are affected by it. If we say no to this legislation, the queue will continue to be at least 40 years long and will continue to grow. The torment of families being kept apart will get worse, unresolved for at least another two years, and who knows beyond that—there are no guarantees.</para><para>The alternative is to significantly enhance the intake, including doubling the intake under the existing visa category and shortening the queue in the existing visa category, because many will move across to the new category. Nobody knows which queue will move quicker, because nobody knows how many people will choose to go in which queue, but the key thing is that the queues will be significantly shorter. It is not the ideal outcome but, in the Democrats' view, it is far preferable, given where we are now, to provide that relief to those families to ensure that thousands more families are able to be reunited over the next couple of years than would otherwise be the case. If we oppose this bill there will be 1,000 families over the next couple of years who can be reunited: if we support it there will be 9,000, including 2,000 under the existing intake. It is a difficult choice but, in many respects, after thinking through the human impact, for the Democrats it is a clear choice. </para><para>It needs to be highlighted that the one party that I do not think can make any claim to standing on principle in relation to migration matters is the ALP. I noted in the debate in the lower house Dr Emerson saying that bipartisanship on the migration program was shattered in 1988 when the current Prime Minister, the then opposition leader, declared that he thought there might be too many Asians coming into the country. There may have been some difference in some aspects, but let us not forget the massive show of bipartisanship between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party leading up to the last election, particularly in the area of destroying families and keeping families apart. The member for Lowe, Mr Murphy, spoke in the lower house about his strong support for family reunion. In natural law alone it is intrinsic that parents be cared for by their children, and this is done through family reunion. Not only is he preventing family reunion by opposing this bill but also the Labor Party supported the government's introduction of the temporary protection visa, specifically aimed at keeping families separated—and not just parents from their children, but spouses from their partners and their children.</para><para>A more direct shattering of family reunion opportunities has never occurred before in this nation's history. We are seeing the direct consequences of that in the community. Many refugees are suffering hugely, not just because they have hanging over their heads the prospect of returning to a place where they face genuine persecution, but because they are not able to reunite with their families. We have families with one person on Nauru and another in Australia. We have the outrageous situation at the moment where a family that lost three children that drowned on the SIEVX are at risk of being separated again, just after they have had another child and are trying to rebuild their family. One of them has a four-year visa and the other has an expired visa and is in danger of being deported. That is all because of the Labor Party's support for the temporary protection visa. So do not come in here or the lower house and talk about having support for the sanctity of the family and family reunion. Spare us the humbug.</para><para>It does need to be emphasised—and some of the arguments that have been made both by the opposition here today and, indeed, in the lower house, reinforce this fact—that it is a crisis. With at least 22,000 people waiting, over 40-odd years, what are we going to do about it? Labor's solution is to say, `We'll do nothing but blame the government for the creation of it.' The Democrats' solution is to say, `Yes. It's been created by government, but we have a responsibility to try to address it and redress it as feasibly as possible, given the current circumstances.' That is what we are doing. I am quite willing to deal with the shallow and inconsistent criticisms that the Democrats will get from the Labor Party because I know that this legislation, flawed as it is, will help many thousands of families who are quite literally desperate. That it is the government's fault that they are desperate does not alter the fact that they are desperate. Our doing nothing about it, other than blaming the government, is not going to address that desperation.</para><para>Whilst I am always willing to deal with, accept and wear criticism, however flimsily based it is in logic, it is worth noting the criticisms that were made by the shadow minister, Julia Gillard. They surprised me a bit, because I did not think that was her style. She used the phrase of the Democrats being `rented by the hour'. I am surprised that such a sleazy, sexist piece of abuse came from Ms Gillard. I have heard it from others—from the bovver boys of the ALP—and it does not surprise me when it comes from them, but it does surprise me when that cheap, sexist rubbish comes from her. It is the sort of thing that one might expect from perhaps Mr Latham, who seems quite comfortable calling people whores quite openly in the lower house, but I expect better from the shadow minister. </para><para>As Mr Ferguson himself said in the lower house, significant elements in the Chinese community support this change. There is significant pressure from many migrant communities in Australia. I have a great deal to do with many of them and their peak bodies and with bodies such as the Migration Institute. Many of them say that this is a step in the right direction. They are not saying, `This is the perfect solution, this is great, we love it.' But they are saying, `The crisis has got so bad we have to do something.' And that is what the Democrats are doing; we are doing something to try to redress it. If Labor gets into government in the future and it wants to move some changes to reduce the inequities, we will be all for it, but we are not going to leave parents and families continuing to suffer in the meantime.</para><para>At the moment we have to deal with the reality of this government and the reality of the immense desperation that is in the community as a consequence of the government's actions. All the nostalgia in the world about how things were better, in this area anyway, when Labor was in government is not going to help one tiny bit those families who are in difficulty now. That reality simply has to be acknowledged. That is part of the important role that the Senate plays and certainly the Democrats play. We are not just going to make nice, purist, principled pronouncements and not care about what the actual human impact is; we are going to deal with the reality of the human impact. Many of the comments that have been made by Labor Party commentators and speakers in this debate in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have reinforced the fact that something needs to be done. That is an undeniable situation.</para><para>It is important to acknowledge the role of migrants and the role of family in the strengthening and building of the marvellous fabric of the Australian community. It is important to acknowledge that some of that fabric is at risk at the moment because of the situation that our nation finds itself in and because of some of the decisions and rhetoric being used by some political leaders. Keeping migrant families apart in such circumstances is hardly going to help maintain that fabric. Family is a central component to the ongoing strength and diversity of multiculturalism. Whilst it is an imperfect way to do it, the fact that we are able to dramatically increase the family reunion intake is welcome in the sense that it will help strengthen the fabric of multiculturalism at a time when, I think all of us would agree, it is under some threat.</para><para>It is also worth noting that the two-year waiting period for social security that Senator Sherry complained about in his speech was something that would not be around today if it were not for eventual Labor Party support. Again, we need to look at the record in relation to migration measures in this chamber over the course of this government. If we look at the ones that have been supported by the Labor Party and the ones that have been supported by the Democrats, you can see the Democrats have a much more consistent record in ensuring that there is a better outcome for people and that suffering is reduced wherever possible.</para><para>It is worth again noting the differences over time when this measure was first proposed by the government. It would have completely abolished the existing category and only allowed a category with a significantly increased fee and health charge attached. That was rightly rejected by the Democrats in the Senate. Two years later the existing category was retained but closed at 500, and the queue was a third of what it is now. The situation now is that the existing category under this bill will be doubled. It is probably the first time that we have seen any sort of movement upwards in family reunions coming from this government, which has dramatically increased the focus on skilled and business migration in recent years. It will also increase the total intake for the year to 4,500—nearly nine times the increase on the current intake.</para><para>This will undoubtedly mean that the queue will shrink much more quickly. It will still take some time to clear the backlog. Let us not forget that there is still the prospect, even with 4½ thousand a year, of at least a five-year wait, given the numbers that are currently in the queue and the pipeline. And it should not be forgotten that, even with this measure, we are still putting people in a situation where they will face a significant wait if they apply now. But at least those who have been in the queue for some time are likely to have some relief a lot quicker, and that reality needs to be acknowledged. Whilst the Democrats are far from pleased with the mechanism put forward in this legislation, there is no doubt that it is far better for the families that would be affected, including many migrant Australian families that have been here for many years, than simply just opposing it and allowing them to continue to suffer for a minimum of another two years and, quite possibly, indefinitely. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>9210</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> presents both opportunity and great difficulty as far as the Greens are concerned. We have a great empathy with the families of people who have migrated to Australia who are still back in the country of origin and cannot come here. We have a humanitarian impulse in our immigration policy, which says that those in greatest need from a humanitarian point of view ought to be at the front of the immigration queue to Australia. That said, the difficulty arises in this legislation because it is moving away from the government's avowed position of giving favour to so-called skilled migrants, which effectively means that potential migrants to the country who have money—for example, business migrants who have great wealth in their pocket and can therefore buy a way into the country by potential investment, or people who have been in the corporate sector and in charge of a corporation with 50 or more staff—get a queue jump in the immigration queue for coming to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>This bill aims to increase the number of parents waiting to come to Australia to join their families by 4,000 per annum. We know that the list of parents waiting is at least 22,000 at the moment. It is probably very much bigger than that. There is anecdotal evidence that some parents have been waiting an incredible 40 years to come to Australia, but for one reason or another have not made it onto the official list. You cannot underestimate the difficulty that some relatives of people who have migrated to Australia who do not have English, who do not have easy access to Australian consulate or embassy facilities, have in converting their wish to join their children into an actual application and then the ability to get here. The problem with this legislation is that for most people it puts a huge economic barrier—in fact, an impossible economic barrier—in their way. It says that, if you are rich, you are able to join your family in Australia; if you are poor, your chances are much more limited. We totally object to that.</para><para>That said, the legislation will enable 500 parents who otherwise would not be able to come here to be able to come, besides the 3,500 who will be able to buy their way. That presents an opportunity that the Greens do not want to dismiss out of hand. However, I am very attracted by the contribution to this debate in the House of Representatives by the innovative member for Calare, Mr Peter Andren. He put forward an important amendment which did not get the notice and the attention that it deserved from the government or the opposition. I am grateful to Mr Andren for allowing me to take up that amendment and I now foreshadow that I will present it to this chamber, where I hope it will get very serious consideration from the Labor Party and from the Democrats, because it manifestly makes this legislation fairer. If this amendment is put into the bill, it will answer some of the problems at least that the Labor Party sees in the legislation. It certainly will make it a better piece of legislation as far as the Greens are concerned, but it is not taking away from the government its wish to enable people who can pay to come to Australia as parents of residents, or citizens, of Australia, to do so. With apology, I will crib from Mr Andren's speech to explain the amendment that the Greens are bringing forward here:</para><quote><para>Much of the debate on the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline> has been focused on the principle of equity. The Labor opposition does not dispute the principles of a user-pays system or mutual obligation, and this is reflected in its failure to make any substantial amendment towards improving the equity of the proposed migratory system, save a meagre second reading amendment. Further, as I understand it, there will be no amendments moved by the opposition when this bill goes to the Senate— </para></quote><para>and we have seen that that effectively is the case—</para><quote><para>because of the supposed deal that has been done between the Democrats and the government. But why not at least try to back up its rhetoric with suggested improvements here in this place?</para></quote><para>Mr Andren says:</para><quote><para>I have been following this debate with a lot of interest. Most opposition members, while recognising that some contribution is required from potential migrant parents, say that this bill nonetheless remains an outrageous attack on migrant families, in the words of the member for Greenway, as I recall. If it is such an outrageous attack on new Australian families, why then has the opposition declined to make any attempt here in this place to redress the inequity it recognises is inherent in this bill?</para><para>Under the new scheme, a parent who wishes to migrate can pay $25,000 as an additional visa application charge, as well as provide a $10,000 bond for 10 years to guard against possible use of the social security system. This is in addition to the $1,175 initial visa application charge. A second parent applicant pays both visa charges in full and provides an additional $4,000 bond as support assurance. So, for a parent couple, a brand new visa can be bought for $66,350. </para></quote><para>That, as I said earlier, is an impossible barrier to many, many parents of people in Australia coming here. Mr Andren continues:</para><quote><para>Under the existing scheme, the visa charges amount to $2,225 ... with a $3,500 bond for two years and $1,500 for any second applicant. If you are struggling to afford the $9,500 to bring your parents to Australia under the current scheme, you will not have a hope of gaining entry under the new system proposed in this legislation.</para><para>On the government side, at least members are sticking to their position, however inequitable and economically discriminatory it may be. They rightly recognise that there is a considerable backlog of applications to be processed, with applicants waiting on average almost six years to receive their visas. This is a considerable problem for aged parents in particular, waiting to join their families. According to the government members, the new classes of user-pays visa will give those who can afford it the opportunity to leave this existing queue and therefore speed up the process. In this way, the new visas are good for everybody—so goes the government's argument.</para><para>What is really required is to deal with both of these problems—to redress the inequity and to speed up the processing.</para></quote><para>So I will be proposing an amendment. I have circulated it in my name in the same form as it was proposed by Mr Andren in the House of Representatives. I will be putting that amendment in the committee stage. He continues:</para><quote><para>This amendment will specify that the minister, while retaining the power to decide the number of visas available for each particular class, must determine that the number of visas available under the existing non-contributory parent visa scheme is equal in number to those visas available under the new class of user-pays visas to be introduced under this bill.</para><para>It is a simple change that will achieve what both sides of this debate believe is desirable in this new parent migration scheme. It will speed up the queues, and it will provide equality of opportunity for those who can afford a new contributory visa and for those who cannot. In relation to cost, which I anticipate will be the basis on which the government will oppose my amendment, I remind the government that its proposal of a $25,000 health services charge, which is the crux of the user-pays scheme, represents an estimate of 12 per cent of the costs involved in looking after aged citizens. The Government Actuary describes this figure as `12 per cent of immeasurable costs'. I invite—</para></quote><para>the government and the opposition—</para><quote><para>to make of that what they will. But if we accept this figure as the basis of the government's calculations, it leaves 88 per cent of health services costs still to be borne by the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>If we can afford to bear 88 per cent of the health costs of 3½ thousand people who can pay for their visas, we can afford to pay the costs of the same number who cannot afford to buy their way in. This is all the more pertinent in light of the fact that the government is relying on figures that were decided apparently so arbitrarily, evidenced by the fact they are based on `immeasurable costs'. I urge that this amendment be given serious consideration—</para></quote><para>by the government, by the opposition and by the Democrats. I will be advocating this amendment and pursuing it in the committee stage and will be looking at the government's response. It is not a new amendment. The government looked at it when it was proposed in the House of Representatives and will have done the homework on it. While it does not meet the Greens' requirement that the queue should be on a needs basis, not on an ability to pay basis, it does make it much more equitable. It will extend to over 500 parents each year the opportunity to come into the country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>9212</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. I will answer in part Senator Brown's comments in this way. Firstly, to those with parents in the queue who are watching or listening to this debate closely, Labor says this: always remember that you are in the position you find yourself in today, isolated from your parents and desperately worried about them, because the Howard government implemented the savage cap of 500 parent visas. And why did the Howard government do this? It did it in order to make people so desperate that what had been politically unacceptable became acceptable.</para></talk.start><para>Families are now so desperate that they know—given the age of their parents and the size of the waiting queues—the only way to get them here is to pay the price. This is the Howard government saying: `Show me the money.' The Howard government introduced this cap to force a reluctant migrant community who want their parents here to accept new fees and charges and to accept a system with two queues—one for those with money and one for those without. I turn to comments by Mr Ruddock in this debate from the earlier part of his strategy—if you could call it that. This strategy has been both cruel and cynical. It is as a result of this cruel and cynical strategy that these bills are now in the Senate. The genesis of these bills dates back to 7 May 2002 when Minister Ruddock announced the 2002-03 migration numbers. In doing so he made the following statement:</para><quote><para>... 4,000 places in a full year remains available for parent migration should there be support from opposition parties to allow legislation to ensure a fair share of health and welfare costs is covered by a parent and the Australian sponsor compared to taxpayers in general.</para></quote><para>The minister in that statement was publicly heralding that he would be prepared to add 500 places to the available 500-place cap to make a total of 1,000 places in the ordinary queue, provided that legislation passes this parliament to allow new and more expensive visas which would see 3,500 places created. On that basis, obviously, as I have said, I think we have seen the unfolding of a cruel and cynical strategy—the minister holding out to people who were desperate to get their parents here a potential solution, provided that they, this parliament and everybody else accepted something that was politically unacceptable: the creation of new and more expensive visa classes.</para><para>A little bit later, the minister outlined four options for the new parent visa classes. They were the subject of a consultation paper issued by the minister. But I make this one observation on these four options, which were a matrix of different levels of charges and different time payment arrangements: two of them were distinctly better in terms of minimising financial hardship than the provisions of these bills—that is, of the four options consulted on, two of them were distinctly different to the measures that are in the bills before the Senate today.</para><para>Turning to the current bills, it is instructive to at least try to work through what their effects would be. That brings me to a description of what is in the bills before the Senate today. The scheme outlined in these bills is as follows, as far as I can understand it. The current parent visa categories would be kept open to fresh applicants—that is, we have 22,000-odd people in what I have been terming `the ordinary queue'. People will be free to join that queue, and the number of places available in that queue will be increased from 500 to 1,000. Then there will be a whole new queue created, with 3,500 places per annum. People seeking to have their parents migrate to Australia in that new and more expensive queue will have two options. Option No. 1 is that they can pay an up-front charge of $25,000 per person and an assurance of support bond of $10,000 for the principal applicant and $4,000 for the secondary applicant, which is then refundable after 10 years less any take-up of welfare benefits. That is the first option: the immediate production of $25,000 and the production of a further $10,000 for the assurance of support bond for the principal applicant. Of course, the fees keep rolling on from there and escalate if you are migrating two parents. Then there is option No. 2, which at least gives people some respite in that it gives them some ability to pay over time. This option is structured on the basis that the up-front payment is $15,000 per person rather than $25,000. If you go with that option, you will receive a two-year temporary visa for the parent who migrates—obviously, they still have to meet all the other relevant criteria in terms of character and the like—and, at the end of two years, they can make an application for a permanent visa and pay a further $10,000 charge and an assurance of support bond of $10,000 for the principal applicant and $4,000 for the secondary applicant, refundable after 10 years less any take-up of welfare benefits. </para><para>Put simply—not that it is easy to put this simply—the difference between the two arrangements is that, in the first arrangement, you pay $25,000 and the assurance of support bond and immediately get permanent entry to Australia. If you take the second option, you effectively pay the charges over two years and get a two-year temporary visa which will become a permanent visa when you have finished paying off the money that is owed. For those who have followed this debate closely, we need to make a couple of things clear. One is that, for those people who are in the current queue, arrangements are made under this legislation to enable people to pay the higher charges and move to the new and more expensive queue. Obviously, given the level of anxiety that many people feel from having their parents in this extraordinarily long queue of more than 30,000 people, numbers of families will consider that option, irrespective of the hardship that it places on them.</para><para>Turning to the costs of parent visas, I think when you roll off a whole lot of figures—and people have been doing that in this debate—it is easy for people to get confused and see the numbers as just numbers. Migration matters, as we all know, are not straightforward. For families who are trying to work out where they stand under this legislation, it will not be simple at all. But the best way of thinking your way through it is to take an example to get a feel for the real qualitative and quantitative differences between the ordinary queue and the new queue. Take the example of a sole surviving parent who is somewhere other than Australia. If you sought to have that sole surviving parent migrate in the standard queue the costs would be a total of $5,725, comprising a health charge of $1,050, an assurance of support bond of $3,500 and a visa application charge of $1,175—unless, of course, there have been amendments to those figures recently. To migrate a parent in the new, expensive queue, it will cost a total of $36,175, comprising a fee of $25,000, an assurance of support bond of $10,000 and a visa application charge of $1,175.</para><para>You do not need to be particularly good with figures to be able to compare the enormous difference between $5,725 and $36,175. In terms of the finances of ordinary families, with a bit of a stretch many families might be able to raise $5,000 to $6,000—by saving, by small extensions to the mortgage, by short loans or by whatever mechanism people generally use to obtain those types of sums of money when they are in financial stress—but we all know from personal experience it is a quantum difference to try to access more than $36,000. It is the difference between an expenditure that it is realistic to save up for over time and an expenditure that most people would necessarily have to borrow for and, in borrowing, would need to have a substantial asset to secure the loan against. It is not going to be provided in an unsecured capacity. You are talking about people using the equity in their houses, for example, to access that amount of money. We all know many people who are simply not in that position and may not have an asset to cover or secure a loan of that nature.</para><para>In responding to these bills, Labor maintains the position that it has always maintained on the question of parent migration. The position we have consistently maintained from government to opposition—and which we will take into government again— is that, whilst it is appropriate for sponsoring families to make a contribution to the health and welfare costs associated with the migration of parents, the system needs to be equitable and not cause undue hardship. This is where we differ from the government and the Democrats. We believe that all families should have realistic options for reuniting with their parents in Australia. The bills ensure that only very few and perhaps rich, well-off or more fortunate families will now have this option available to them. These visa charges will rule out the everyday worker, most single parent families and most recently settled people who are still setting up home and getting established in Australia. In fact, it will rule out anybody who does not have $25,000, or $50,000 for a couple. </para><para>We believe the system detailed in these bills fails the tests of equity and of not causing undue hardship. It fails the test of equity by creating two queues, and people are very highly advantaged if they have the financial means to get themselves into the expensive queue. With the test of equity, we need to recognise that the standard queue will have only 1,000 places per year and that the more expensive queue will have 3,500 places per year. So if you have the financial resources—if you can access just over $36,000—you have, in effect, 3½ times more chance of getting your parents into this country. On the test of equity, of putting people in comparable positions, of not allowing privileged access for those who have financial resources, we think this package fails. </para><para>As I have indicated, we also think it fails the test of not causing undue hardship; by anybody's standard, $36,175 is a lot of money. That is for the migration of one parent. You can effectively pretty close to double it for two parents. Obviously the assurance of support is slightly different, but just as a rough calculation you can pretty close to double it if you want to get two parents here. Therefore, it will mean that people will need to go down the path of borrowing money and will need to find security to borrow those amounts. It is not just, it is not equitable and it is not fair. Many people will simply not have an asset or, if they do, they will be mortgaging the family home. There is no equity in this. Labor believe that these bills as a package have failed the tests of equity and of not causing undue hardship.</para><para>While Labor have remained consistent, unfortunately the Democrats have not. When you look at it, it appears there were a number of occasions in the past when Labor and the Democrats combined to block passage of comparable legislation or regulatory change. Perhaps proving the old adage that you might not be able to buy the Democrats but you can rent them by the hour, they have done a deal with the government and agreed to support these bills. It seems that the Democrat principle of believing that wealth or otherwise should not be a determining factor in whether or not people can get into this country has completely gone out the window and I find that disappointing. As we all know, it is not the first time this has happened. </para><para>To return to where I started—the cruel and cynical political strategy that this government is pursuing—these bills will be passed with Democrat support, if that is forthcoming. However, while we know that these bills will be passed, Labor believe that we should never have got into this position. We should never have got into a position where there are more than 20,000 desperate families in a queue for parent migration. We should never have seen the unfolding of a cruel and cynical political strategy that is designed to create the desperation and the political pressure for a new and more expensive visa class by so radically capping the current queue. This has, I think, been a bit of a three-card trick by the government, played on people who simply want to do no more than have their parents join them in Australia. </para><para>So what do you do? You make it virtually impossible for them to migrate their parents in the ordinary queue; having made it virtually impossible for them to do that, you allow a huge queue to blow out. People are then so desperate that they will tick any box, pay any amount of money or jump any hurdle in order to get their parents through. When desperation is at that point, the government comes in with legislation like this and asks people to support it. It is a cruel and cynical political strategy that is being perpetrated. We on this side of politics believe that we have been consistent about this matter. We believe that this political strategy is one that really hurts a lot of people and should not be pursued. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>9215</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge the contributions made by senators in this very important debate on the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, which deal with parent migration, a very important issue for many Australians. These bills implement the government's policy for parents who wish to migrate to Australia. The policy recognises the contribution—tangible and intangible—that parents make when they come to Australia and seeks to balance this with the need to offset the substantial costs of parent migration. This is perhaps in a different category from other aspects of migration when you consider the program as a whole.</para></talk.start><para>The passage of these bills will enable a significant increase in parent migration, while minimising the cost to Australian taxpayers. That is the balance we have to strike here. It is very important to remember that, should this measure be passed, it will open the possibility of an extra 4,000 places a year for parent migration to Australia.</para><para>In response to the willingness of parent applicants and their sponsors to contribute a fair share to the costs of parent migration, the government have set aside a contingency reserve of 4,000 places in a full year in the migration program. The government will introduce these new entry arrangements for parents as soon as possible after legislation is passed by the parliament. The four new parent visa classes proposed by the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> will assist those parents who were adversely affected by the Senate's previous rejection of parent entry arrangements. You have to remember that this proposal has had a very long history indeed. This is a golden opportunity for the Senate to provide greater opportunity for parent migration to Australia. The existing parent visa classes will remain open to new applications with an increase from 500 available places per year to 1,000 places per year. That is separate to the extra 3,500 places we have in the new category.</para><para>Australia is a migrant nation so there are many parents of migrants who would like to come to Australia. It is not surprising that one follows the other. The migration program is not discriminatory, but it does have selection criteria. There are limits and, of course, we cannot take everybody. The government do appreciate the benefits of parent migration. We accept that having parents to assist with child rearing assists people economically and in many other intangible ways. We totally reject any criticism that this government is anti family or anti family reunion, but we have to bear in mind that the costs of parent migration are high. A report from the Government Actuary showed that the cost is even more than it first thought and, in fact, runs into hundreds of thousands of dollars for each person. If people are in a position to make some contribution towards supporting their family, then it is not unreasonable to ask them to do so. The Labor opposition has never said that it opposes a contribution. People are being asked, in this case, to pay $25,000 towards the cost of a lifetime's health cover through Medicare. I will come to the detail of that in a moment, but it is a generous offer.</para><para>I now turn to briefly address the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. Let me stress that the proposal by the government is fiscally responsible and is a balanced package. In the Labor opposition amendment we have a suggestion that would lead to a blow-out in costs over time. The ALP has called for more parent migration, yet if we were to continue with the numbers under Labor we would see the costs blowing out over the period of the program from $2 billion to $12 billion. We have a duty to achieve a balance in this package, and that is what we are doing. In that $25,000 contribution we have asked that the parent or sponsor contribute 12 per cent to the health and welfare costs which would be involved. The Australian taxpayer contributes the remaining 88 per cent. We believe that is not only generous but also fair. We have achieved a balance. What Labor is proposing is a blow-out in costs. It is interesting that, as I said earlier, Labor has never opposed a contribution being made. Yet we have no detailed proposal put by the Labor opposition. We can rely only on its previous record and the figures we saw under the previous Labor government. This has to be a fiscally responsible package and it has to be fair, and it is. </para><para>There is also some criticism about skilled migration. There is absolutely no evidence that our parent policy has had any effect on skilled migration. Our skilled program is growing and we have a healthy pipeline of applicants. This is not the case in other countries that can be compared to Australia. The skilled program will benefit from the additional places for parents. What we have done is fair. We have doubled the number of fully subsidised places. The existing queue will shorten and allow others to access these 1,000 places more quickly. It is fair that those who can are able to contribute and get one of the contributory parent places. If not, they are able to wait a little longer and obtain one of the fully subsidised places—which, as I have mentioned, have doubled. The government have got the balance right. The responsibility now rests with the Senate to accept this proposal and to allow 4,000 extra places for parents who wish to come to Australia. If the Senate does not grasp this opportunity now, it will be lost. Many Australians will be justifiably disappointed with such a rejection. On this point, the government acknowledge the constructive contribution that the Democrats have made, and I thank Senator Bartlett for his contribution to this debate.</para><para>Senator Brown has outlined an amendment which he proposes to put at the committee stage. The government oppose that amendment. If the division were to be broken down as proposed by the Greens in relation to the existing program and the proposed additional places, there would be a blow-out in costs; it would cost over $5 billion in the 20-year period involved. For that reason, the government cannot support that Green amendment and will oppose it. If that amendment is passed, it will put the bill in a form that the government cannot proceed with; in other words, it will kill this bill. It will kill the opportunity for these extra parent places. So I say to the Senate: be very careful when you consider this. This is a very important issue. It has had a long history. You have a golden opportunity now to offer the possibility of up to 4,000 more places being available for parents who wish to come to this country. We cannot accept the Greens' amendment for the reasons which I have outlined, and we will go into more detail on that in the committee stage. I just say that for the record. We have had a constructive approach from the Democrats to this debate. They have not merely criticised but have made suggestions, and we have taken those on board. I commend this proposal to the Senate and also to the Australian people for what it offers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>—The question is that Senator Bartlett's amendment to Senator Stephens's amendment be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stephens's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion><para>Question negatived.</para><para>Original question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a second time.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>9216</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTRIBUTORY PARENTS MIGRATION SCHEME) BILL 2002</para><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>9216</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 2852:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Page 4, (after line 22), after Schedule 1, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Schedule 1A—Limit on visas</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Migration Act 1958</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1 Section 85</inline></para><para>Repeal the section, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">85 Limit on visas</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), the Minister may, by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>, determine the maximum number of:</para></quote><para>	(a)	the visas of a specified class; or</para><para>	(b)	the visas of specified classes;</para><para>that may be granted in a specified financial year.</para><quote><para>	(2)	The Minister must determine that the maximum number of visas that may be granted for Parent (Class AX—Migrant) and Aged Parent (Class BP— Residence) applications is equal to the total of the maximum number of visas that may be granted for Contributory Parent (Class CA—Migrant), Contributory Parent (Class UT—Temporary), Contributory Aged Parent (Class DG—Residence) and Contributory Aged Parent (Class UU—Temporary) applications.</para></quote><para>As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, this amendment originated in the House of Representatives, where it was put forward by the Independent member for Calare, Mr Andren. We think it has merit. I reiterate that the Greens are opposed to the inequity in the government's legislation that would mean that 3,500 parents would be able to come to Australia because they could pay over $60,000 and 500 extra would be able to come on the merits of their case. This is tilting the whole immigration scheme further under the government's philosophy that, if you want to come to this country, you have to pay for it, no matter what your needs or circumstances are and no matter how harsh and heart-rending the severance from your family may be. `Pay out large amounts of money or you do not get here' is a despicable philosophy.</para><para>The government has relented to past Senate obstruction of the user-pays principle—it is not user-pays; it is about paying a ransom up-front—and it has now said that an extra 500 places will be made available for those parents who have the greatest need to join their families in Australia. The amendment we put forward would mean that, instead of that 500 to 3,500 balance, it would ostensibly be 2,000 to 2,000. It does leave the overall number to the minister, but the minister has already indicated that he takes that as being a 4,000 entry, with the balance now being 2,000 to 2,000. So at least we would increase the number of parents who are able to come on a needs basis by a further 1,500 or thereabouts.</para><para>There has to be a pause for thought for the situation of people in this country who want their parents to join them and that of parents elsewhere around the world who want to join their children—very often, their children and their grandchildren—in this country. None of us should be oblivious to that. There is an enormous human component to this, which is the longing of people to be reunited with their families. In this country, every Australian who knew of the plight of immigrants— and, unfortunately, too many Australians do not know of their plight—who have waited long, long years to get their parents to join them would, I think, have enormous sympathy with them.</para><para>I note that, in his summing-up a moment ago, the minister indicated that the Greens' proposal would cost $250 million a year or, as he put it, $5 billion over the next 20 years. I will be asking him to give a breakdown of those costs, if he would. This is a serious debate and I do not want ballpark figures to be used in it. Frankly, I do not believe that figure. I refer to Mr Andren's speech indicating that the government's figures were based on an immeasurable set of presumptions anyway—or a measurable set of presumptions which lead to an immeasurable figure. So, politically, it is easy to bring a figure in here and say, `It is going to cost this amount of money.'</para><para>The minister has given a figure of billions over the next 20 years. I could come back right onto that and say that that is much less than the government is prepared to pay at the moment in its contribution to an attack on Baghdad, which most Australians do not want. I think that, if we could have a plebiscite or just an opinion poll in the next week over this matter, Australians would be enormously more in favour of having those people who have come to this country, including those from Iraq, reunited with their parents than of having the government spend the same amount of money supporting an attack by the Bush administration on the people of Iraq, where it would be sandwiched between George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein. But that is a different matter. I do want to hear the government justify the figures it is using. I do appeal to the opposition and the Democrats to look at this amendment that the Greens have brought from the House of Representatives into the Senate, because it has enormous merit. </para><para>We are not the government. The Greens, very often indeed, are accused of being unable to put forward solutions from a position of strongly held principle. Here I am, doing that, trying to extend the principle that we should have a more humanitarian solution. I think the government's solution is harsh. It is based on the almighty dollar to the exclusion of the human heart. I know the government is not going to accept a rejection of the bill by increasing to 4,000 the number of parents allowed to come into the country on a needs basis—and that will be the outcome of a straight rejection, as the Labor Party is proposing. However, there should be far greater equity in this. I do not believe there is a cost barrier. If there is a cost barrier, then there should be an increase in the number of parents coming into the country on a needs basis, at the expense of those who can simply queue jump because they have money in their pockets.</para><para>Let us look at the government's own rhetoric on queue jumping. The government has been accusing boat people coming to this country of being criminals and treating them as such, locking them up behind razor wire based on the argument that they paid money to people smugglers and were queue jumping because they had the money. Yet the government is making that official policy when it comes to parents wanting to come to the country: `You can queue jump if you have the money.' It is a people smuggler philosophy that the government is employing— surely the government can see that for itself. You cannot have it both ways. The government is putting its hand out and saying: `If you can put $60,000 in that hand, your parents can come to this country—or, if they can, they can come to this country. If you can't, go back in the queue.' It is the very thing that the government has been arguing in rejecting the boat people who get to this country and that has led them to shamefully treat those people as criminals. `Sure, we will put it into law now,' says the government—this philosophy that, if you have the money, you can get to the front of the queue.</para><para>We are not going to knock the government out of that position but we can ameliorate it. If the opposition and the Democrats were to join the Greens in supporting what I will call the Andren amendment, then we would get a much better outcome here. And there does not have to be a cost at all: the amendment is structured so that the minister is able to keep the same cost basis to the public purse but increase the number of immigrant parents on a needs basis, with a concomitant reduction in the number of those who are able to pay the huge cost that is involved in this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>9218</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was asked a question on migration figures. In July 2002 the Australian Government Actuary was commissioned to do an independent report. The final report was produced in October last year and is in the Parliamentary Library, and I understand the figures are available. I am advised that the report has estimated that over 20 years the total cost for the proposed parent migration package is $2 billion in net present value terms. If, however, 4,000 parent migrants per year came to Australia, paying only existing visa charges, the total cost to the Commonwealth over 20 years would be about $5.2 billion in net present value terms. So, if there are an extra 4,000 migrants with no contribution but current visa charges, then the extra amount would be $5.2 billion. As I said, the report was handed down in October last year and is available in the Parliamentary Library. I think that answers Senator Brown's question. If any other aspects of the legislation raise questions, I am happy to deal with them.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>9218</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know whether Senator Brown posed that question, but I posed it by interjection.

I would point out that the Australian Government Actuary is not an independent statutory position, unlike that which exists in other countries where the government actuary has an independent statutory position and reports to parliament directly—but that is another issue that I will take up at another time. The reason I raise the issue of the Government Actuary's independence is that the Government Actuary can be directed by the government of the day as to the way in which matters are researched. I have more concerns about that in other areas, but that is for another time and another debate. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown's amendment could be dubbed the fifty-fifty proposal. The difficulty the Labor Party have with it is that amending the government's legislation with a prescriptive fifty-fifty formula may not be the best way of ensuring an equitable allocation; therefore, the Labor Party will not support a precise formula in this way via amendment. There may be a different proportion that is more appropriate and so, to enshrine in a fixed way this particular proposal in the legislation, Labor believe, is inappropriate. Consequently, we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Brown.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>9219</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will speak briefly to both the amendment and comments that have been made. The amendment, as Senator Brown said, is the same one moved by Mr Andren in the House of Representatives on this legislation—and I want to note and pay tribute to the job Mr Andren does in what must be a far more frustrating chamber in which to put forward ideas and amendments. He takes his legislative and parliamentary role responsibly, and I am pleased to see his approach and his views on this issue being put forward here through Senator Brown, who has also proposed this amendment as a way forward.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats have a couple of difficulties, even though we have some sympathy for what is being proposed here. Certainly, having a higher proportion of people in the existing category who have to pay less money is supported by the Democrats. The big danger, as the minister outlined, is that the government will not accept the amendment and will kill the bill. I am not always one who will simply take ministers at their word. I think these sorts of statements need to be tested some of the time. I have dealt with Minister Ruddock many times on migration matters, most often in strong disagreement. The very genesis of this crisis that we now have was a similar threat that Minister Ruddock made back in 1998-99, that if the Senate disallowed his regulation seeking to introduce a health charge he would slash the intake from 3,000 to 500, which is exactly what he did. I am certain that the Democrats' decision would not have been any different back then; nonetheless, this is one minister who when he makes a threat carries it out, even if it is to the detriment of people. I have no doubt that the government almost certainly would kill the bill if this amendment got through.</para><para>There is a time issue here in terms of getting what is a reasonably complex new visa regime in place for 1 July so that those significant increases in parent numbers can come through. Another concern I have is that the amendment does not set a maximum number—even if the government were to accept the amendment, they could keep the total number at 500 and have 250 on the current visa price and 250 on the increased one—and does not ensure an increase in the intake. If the government wanted to be bloody-minded, as I suggest they have been in the past in this area, then that is a possible approach they could take to the amendment, which again would not address the underlying crisis, which is simply that the numbers allowed in are far too small.</para><para>The amendment would still entrench the new visa, which does have some equity problems. I openly acknowledge those and I hope that Labor's appropriate criticisms of them, which are matched by the Democrats, will be mirrored in a commitment by them to scrap it when they get back into government. We will wait with interest to see if that happens. Certainly, they would have the Democrats' support if they moved that way. If their words are genuine here today, then that would be what they would do—scrap this charge when they get into government. I hope to see it in their policy for the next election. I put on the record now that we would support them instantly in the Senate if they were to move that way. </para><para>We had a statement from Senator Ludwig—who, you may not have known, was reading word for word Julia Gillard's speech, certainly the last component of it, from the lower house; but I shall not put in a plagiarism complaint—that the Labor Party have been consistent on this and the Democrats have not. On the surface, that may be the case. Leaving aside the obvious retort— that for the Labor Party to talk about consistency on migration legislation, given their disgraceful record over the last three years in this area, is a bit rich—the thing is that a couple of things have changed; the Democrats' position has not changed. The first thing that has changed is that initially the proposal was to abolish the existing visa category and require everybody to pay increased health charges, so nobody would have been able to get in unless they had the extra money. The second thing that has changed is that this severe cap of 500 has now continued for four years, and will continue for at least another two if this legislation fails. So the situation has changed. The queue has changed dramatically. That is a reality, a human reality, that we have to acknowledge. We are dealing with people's lives here. That should not be forgotten. There would be a significant negative impact on many people's lives if this legislation— flawed though it is—were not to pass.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>9220</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister said that the cost would be $5.2 billion, but he did not take into account that 500 of the immigrants are already catered for in the government's proposal.

While I am on the point of this AGA report, I might add for the benefit of the Senate that it was the Labor Party that requested that the report be obtained. The member for Lalor requested that there be an actuarial study of the cost of parent migration.

The figure has dropped to $3.9 billion straight off. That means $180-odd million a year. But I do not accept that figure. If you take into account the amendment as it is written, you will find that it does allow for an adjustment of the overall number being accepted into the country. It will increase the number of people who come on a needs basis by some thousands, but there will be a concomitant decrease in the number who can buy their way into the country, and that could be adjusted to make this cost neutral. There is no argument for or against that; that is the case. I again ask the minister—and, indeed, the Labor opposition and the Democrats—to recognise that that is the case.</para></talk.start><para>This is a better outcome. The government's argument is about money; I have just said that that argument is met by the amendment. The opposition's argument is about equity; this enormously increases the equity involved. For the Democrats, it will give the government the opportunity to take this back to the House of Representatives for further consideration. I think that such an important amendment deserves further consideration. Quite clearly it will not necessarily knock out the bill. You may predict that, with due consideration, the government will decide from the House of Representatives that it does not accept this amendment. The Democrats have the numbers to ensure that that rejection is accepted by the Senate, and the bill will go through under the government-Democrats formula.

The minister is saying that there will be a big cost impost on the public purse even with the fee-payers and that they are only paying a small percentage. So I ask: what is the problem with making sure that those contributions are met from the government purse under this formula? There will be a minimal reduction in the overall number of parents who can come but a huge rise in the number of those who come on a needs basis. So we will get this onto a proper humanitarian basis and not on the money barrier basis for those people who do not have a lot of money, which is the government philosophy: block people out if they are poor, if they are needy, if they do not have a bag of money, and welcome them in if they do.</para></talk.start><para>That is what we object to and that is what the opposition objects to, and I know that is what the Democrats object to. The Greens are putting forward the Andren amendment, which does not fix the problem—it does not get rid of the people who can pay being able to come—but it does say, `Let's bring more balance to this and increase the number who can come who are otherwise prevented by the $60,000-plus impost.' The costs are not nearly as great as the government would make out, and I think the government knows that.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator J.J.

We note that it does increase the number of parents who can come to the country by 4,000. Five hundred of those will be on a needs basis and that is better than the current situation, which denies those 4,000 people, and particularly those 500 people, the opportunity to come here. We will be fighting very hard to have the whole 4,000 on a needs basis. It is an uphill battle with this government but, like the Democrats, we will be hoping that Labor write into their policy that the whole 4,000 and, indeed, the queue of all the parents wanting to join their people in this country will be afforded the opportunity to do so. So we support the legislation, despite our great objection to the weighting that there is for the rich over the needy. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>9222</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is worth noting for the record the position of the Democrats on this. As I said at the start of my second reading speech, the Democrats dislike many aspects of this migration legislation but we dislike the existing situation much more. It is some improvement on the versions that were bowled up to the Senate in previous times, although the fundamental problem of a visa for people with large amounts of money remains. It is an issue which the Democrats have been trying to find a way through for some time. We have at least managed to get an increase from 500 to 1,000 in the existing number allowed in under the existing category, so the intake of those people who are paying at that level will be doubled and of course the queue will be shortened by those people that can afford the extra charge going across to the new visa.</para></talk.start><para>It is a far from perfect solution to a crisis, but it will at least alleviate that crisis. If Labor—if and when they get into government again—have a better solution, then we will happily support it, but the Democrats are not prepared to leave tens of thousands of parents separated from their families for decades and decades, as is the situation now. The situation is far worse now than it was even two years ago. If we do nothing now, it will be far worse again in two years time, which is likely to be the earliest prospect, and maybe not even then, we have for dealing with it again.</para><para>It is worth noting the rationale behind the Democrat decision. I think a lot of the commentary from the ALP is fairly two-faced in that they say they support family reunion but do nothing to increase it. It is disappointing again to hear the remarks of people like Ms Gillard that are full of cheap, sexist, sleazy shots about being rented by the hour being mouthed by Senator Ludwig. Those sorts of cheap shots will not deter us from doing what we need to do in the interests of the community and the people. As I said earlier, it is worth acknowledging and reminding ourselves that legislation is about people and people's lives. I do not think we can leave them being held to ransom in a political stand-off any longer.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>9222</page.no><id.no>R1591</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1592</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1593</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>9222</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 15 November 2002, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>9222</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— The <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> and the two associated bills are matters which may well take considerable time to debate in this chamber, highlighting their importance for the Australian people. In this speech, I will attempt to address the substantive issues raised by this package of bills, and I note at the outset two significant features of this proposed legislation. Firstly, the bills now before the Senate are substantially different to those initially proposed by the government. In their original form, these bills represented an outright attack on heritage protection in Australia. Even though amended, this proposed legislation will still result in an unacceptable and destructive reduction in the level of effective protection that we can provide. Secondly, although the importance of these bills is not disputed by the government, they come to the Senate largely undebated. When they were introduced last year in the other place, the government gagged debate, thereby preventing any consideration of Labor's amendments to these unsatisfactory measures. We know of the continuing community resistance to many of the unacceptable aspects of these bills, but the government's obvious reluctance to debate their position can only serve to undermine further any confidence in either their willingness or capacity to protect our precious natural and cultural heritage. </para></talk.start><para>I highlight that these bills are indicative of the government's recidivist attitudes to the broad fields of heritage, culture and the arts in Australia. We are watching a significant government retreat from many of these aspects of Australian life. Australia is now seeing a government increasingly reluctant to meet its full obligations in cooperation with the states. We also see a government intent on curtailing effective community and expert contribution to heritage and cultural programs. This is most evident in the current debate and the deliberate downgrading of the Australian Heritage Commission—which currently possesses considerable powers to protect heritage sites—to the status of an advisory body operating solely under ministerial direction.</para><para>Notwithstanding the government's own amendments to this legislation, it is still fatally flawed. Labor will not vote to demolish the Australian Heritage Commission, nor will we vote in favour of reducing existing heritage protection. I will be seeking to introduce a series of amendments to this legislation. I indicate to the government that, if the government does not support these amendments, Labor will oppose these bills.</para><para>Australia enjoys a high international reputation for its pioneering initiatives in the protection of heritage sites and places. The original and current regime based on the Australian heritage protection act is just another of the many valuable policy initiatives first introduced by the Whitlam government. However, the past quarter of a century has seen many innovations, and grounds do exist to bring this legislation up to date. Labor recognise that a consensus exists on a number of new legislative provisions and support those aspects of the legislation. But we draw the line at gutting the very institutions and legislative provisions that provide the bedrock of heritage protection in this country.</para><para>Let us have a look at what these bills involve. The <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> seeks, among other things, to establish a Commonwealth heritage regime focusing on matters of national significance and Commonwealth responsibility; list places of national heritage significance on a National Heritage List; and protect and manage places on the National Heritage List. It also seeks to list places in Commonwealth areas with heritage significance on a Commonwealth Heritage List and provide for the management of such places. The associated bill, the <inline ref="R1592">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002</inline>, replaces the existing Australian Heritage Commission with an Australian Heritage Council to create a list of places of national heritage significance—that is, the National Heritage List—creates a Commonwealth Heritage List of Commonwealth owned heritage sites and requires management plans for all places on either of those lists. Finally, the <inline ref="R1593">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002</inline> seeks, among other things, to withdraw from any future heritage regime access to current gifting rules for taxation purposes and delete from the purview of heritage legislation places of telecommunications significance.</para><para>These bills in their original form were the subject of a Senate reference committee inquiry in 2001. That process identified widespread community concern as well as a large number of weaknesses in the provisions of those bills. This revised version of the legislation, which we are now considering, has addressed a number of concerns but continues to reduce heritage protection in a number of key areas.</para><para>I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to a number of these deficiencies. Firstly, the decision-making process for identifying heritage sites is at risk. The downgrading of the Heritage Commission to the status of an advisory group is not acceptable to Labor and to many others within the community. A decision maker, with a measure of independence, able to draw on a range of institutional expert advice is a necessary guarantor for heritage protection. The assessment process to list or delist sites should be on the basis of rigorous assessment and not expedient political need. We intend to move amendments to reinstate the functions and the powers of the Australian Heritage Commission and to retain its title. </para><para>Secondly, the definition of action has been diluted under this new legislation. It is not as inclusive as in the current act, for it deletes references to the provision of funding via grants and the granting of authorisation, including permits and licences. Labor, therefore, will move amendments to reinstate those Commonwealth actions for heritage items now deleted by the government to ensure that these things, such as the making of Commonwealth decisions on grants, are included.</para><para>Also, a number of areas require amendments to the proposed new management plan, strategies and commission functions. Regarding the approval of heritage strategies, before approving a heritage strategy the minister should be required to consult the commission. Similarly, the commission should be able to provide advice directly to the Commonwealth or to state agencies, as well as to any other person who seeks it. We also need to do a lot more in protecting Commonwealth heritage places, whether they are sold or leased. The provisions of the legislation are open to abuse or provide too wide a discretion for the minister, as demonstrated by the recent problems regarding internationally recognised heritage sites such as Point Nepean, sited at the entrance to Port Phillip Bay in Victoria.</para><para>It is clear, too, that this proposed legislation lacks the capacity to address issues of immediate relevance to the Commonwealth's own heritage and history, such as the near destruction of the Mount Stromlo Observatory heritage site in the recent bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory. It is one of the few heritage sites that illuminates both the origins and the extent of the scientific and research interests of the early Commonwealth, and yet the legislation, in the form offered by the government, does not provide a vehicle whereby the Commonwealth government can support restoration of such sites. Labor also questions the government's overemphasis on protecting heritage values of a place rather than protecting the place itself. This, too, is open to obvious abuse. Protection must be afforded to the physical site, as well as to the values of the place. The two are symbiotic. We reject, too, the argument that consideration of both physical site and associated heritage values will restrict the number of places that can be considered for either protection or preservation.</para><para>The process by which these bills have been developed has left heritage interest groups deeply divided. Some are now accommodating the government's wishes, while others remain resolutely opposed. Others still continue to oppose key sections but echo our belief that an updating of the legislation is required. Most significant, perhaps, is the public opposition to those aspects of the bills and their regressive consequences expressed by the former heads of the Australian Heritage Commission itself—the very people who have overseen the heritage developments in this country that have put us at the forefront of heritage protection schemes around the world.</para><para>It is worth looking at why the government has ignored these concerns. As I said earlier, we are watching a government in cultural and heritage retreat. We are seeing a return to the bad old days when the Commonwealth government created an arbitrary division between the concepts of what it called `the national' and `the federal', and it used this spurious argument to avoid both the obligation and the cost of supporting effective national programs in a wide range of areas in our cultural and social life. In passing, it is worth noting the opportunism of the government on the issues. If passed, this legislation will enable the Commonwealth to act as a Pontius Pilate on heritage matters, washing its hands of responsibility for many of the heritage sites because they will be regarded as a state responsibility. Such an attitude, if enshrined in legislation, would serve not only to reduce the effectiveness of heritage protection in Australia but also to divide those very groups on whom we rely to give life to that protection. </para><para>We are watching a process of marginalisation and a concerted attempt to undermine the cooperation and collaboration that has proved decisive in the long-term effectiveness of heritage legislation. By seeking to ensure that some groups will have a short-term advantage and be short-term winners, the government is, in reality, ensuring instead that we all be long-term losers. It is a process that has been under way for some time. In the heritage field this was seen more than five years ago when, at the time of the first assault on education, research and cultural expenditure, the government unilaterally abolished the National Estates Grants scheme and replaced it with a smaller and less flexible scheme. The National Estates Grants Program was a federally funded cooperative scheme between the Heritage Commission and the state heritage agencies providing funding, on a competitive basis, for community heritage projects across Australia. Many of those projects were small in terms of the amounts of money involved but were of enormous value to local communities. Its abolition was a disaster not just for heritage funding but also for important community projects and for the principles of cooperation itself.</para><para>Any programs of national interest or importance, whether they are dealing with heritage sites, VET qualifications or programs to combat salinity, must be based on recognised community values, not on expedient political definitions or bureaucratic concerns. The government's artificial distinction remains at odds with the concept of mutually shared heritage interests in which we all share a common responsibility. The latter concept has the virtue of avoiding the arid distinction between national, regional and local importance and instead recognises the essential interrelationship between all sites or collections of heritage importance.</para><para>Reform in heritage protection we accept; destruction we oppose. Labor's amendments will ensure that improvements to the legislation can be made without abandoning either the protective standards currently in force or the management measures that draw on both community and expert contribution. It has been a truism to say that, as Australians, we occupy a fragile continent. It must become equally commonplace to observe that Australia is now home to the world's oldest surviving cultures as well as to its newest—our multicultural societies. But such familiarity with these observations must not blind us to the reality that Australia's physical and cultural landscapes require both protection and renewal if they are to survive. It is this fundamental test that the government's proposed heritage legislation fails. Accordingly, Labor will move a series of amendments to these bills. We will invite other parties and independent senators to join us in ensuring adequate levels of heritage protection. We will call on the government to accept the decisions that are made. Labor will vote against this legislation if its major defects are not removed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>9225</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, the <inline ref="R1592">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1593">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 </inline>seek to create a new regime for the protection of Australia's historic, natural and Indigenous heritage, using the structure and processes of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The bills are intended to implement the new Commonwealth and state arrangements for the listing, protection and management of places of heritage significance, agreed at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1997. At this meeting, the Commonwealth government agreed to focus on the protection of sites of national environmental significance.</para></talk.start><para>Heritage reform bills were first introduced in the Senate in December 2000 and referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Since then, there have been further and ongoing consultations with heritage, conservation and other groups and individuals. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Cultural Heritage Forum and its members, as well as other interested groups, in dealing with these bills. Their commitment and persistence has led to improvements to the bills that are now before us in this chamber and, on behalf of the Democrats, I sincerely thank them for their efforts. </para><para>The new heritage regime which these bills seek to establish centres on the development of two heritage lists—the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. These lists are to comprise places that are deemed to have one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values. Both lists will include sites of natural, Indigenous or historic significance. Sites on the Commonwealth Heritage List will only include those places that are owned or leased by the Commonwealth. </para><para>As mentioned, the new heritage protection regime will form part of Australia's broader environmental protection system established through the EPBC Act. Sites on the National Heritage List will become an additional matter of national environmental significance, meaning that they will be subject to the same environmental impact assessment process for assessment and approval as other NES matters. That is to say that national heritage will become another trigger under the act. Commonwealth heritage places will be protected by existing provisions dealing with the environment on Commonwealth land and in the Commonwealth marine environment. Significant penalties for noncompliance will apply. In addition to this, management plans will be required for sites on the National Heritage List which are wholly within a Commonwealth area, and the Commonwealth must try to make management plans in cooperation with the states and territories for other National Heritage listed sites. Commonwealth agencies with responsibility for sites on the Commonwealth Heritage List will also be required to make management plans.</para><para>If the new regime is enacted unamended, the new Australian Heritage Council will replace the current Australian Heritage Commission. The council will comprise the chair and six members, including two members who are Indigenous persons with experience or expertise in Indigenous heritage. One of the council's key tasks will be to assess places for inclusion on the National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List. While the council will have responsibility for the assessment of sites for inclusion on these lists, it is the minister who will have the final say on whether or not a site is added to either of them. I will return to that point later.</para><para>The main concessions the government has made to the bills since they were first introduced are: firstly, the retention of the Register of the National Estate as a statutory list; secondly, the ability of the council to undertake assessments of places for listing on their own initiative; thirdly, the protection of national and Commonwealth heritage places outside Australia; and, fourthly, the requirement that Commonwealth agencies prepare heritage strategies and maintain heritage registers for the places they own or control.</para><para>We are particularly pleased with the government's decision to retain the Register of the National Estate. The register, as Senator Carr has already indicated, is Australia's only composite list of heritage sites, incorporating places of all levels of heritage significance. It was a visionary project and we are indebted to those Australians who initiated the list and established a commission to progress the identification and protection of Australia's unique heritage.</para><para>The Democrats fully support the retention and ongoing development of the RNE. This was a very strong recommendation of the many submissions to the inquiry. As mentioned, it is a unique list because it includes places of all levels of heritage significance. It is also important to many Australians because sites that are of personal importance to them are listed on it. Many Australians will never have the opportunity to visit this country's outstanding world heritage sites, like Kakadu, Fraser Island, Shark Bay, or Heard and McDonald Islands, or to visit other sites that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Heritage List. </para><para>For some, the most personally significant sites are local sites, which from an academic perspective may only be of local significance. Such locally significant sites also deserve greater recognition and protection. That is why the Democrats, whilst understanding the Commonwealth government's desire to focus on sites of national and Commonwealth heritage significance, urge the Commonwealth, states and territories and local government to work cooperatively to improve heritage protection for sites that may be of state or local significance. These sites should not be allowed to be destroyed through neglect or destruction, which is unfortunately happening to an increasing number of them. </para><para>We are also pleased that the government has decided to implement key recommendations from the Schofield report. Commonwealth agencies, particularly the Department of Defence, own a number of sites that are of great heritage significance. One such site is the defence department land at Point Nepean which has been mentioned on numerous occasions in the past and here again today. That place is up for sale, as we know. The Democrats were very pleased with the recommendations made by the consultants engaged by the government to look at this site. We hope that the Commonwealth will work cooperatively with the state government to ensure that this site is added to the Mornington Peninsula National Park for the benefit of all Australians. The Democrats are of the view that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to pay for the clean-up of this site and that the considerable revenue obtained through the sale of other defence department properties could be allocated for this purpose.</para><para>The changes to the bills that I have mentioned are steps in the right direction, and we welcome them. One change we are not so happy with is that the new bills weaken the obligation imposed on Commonwealth agencies to protect the heritage values of national or Commonwealth heritage properties that are sold or leased. The 2000 version of the bills was better in this respect. Other developments are welcome. Amongst heritage professionals, there is now widespread agreement that much needs to be done to protect Australia's heritage at the national level since the legal protection afforded to sites on the Register of the National Estate is very limited and in most cases non-existent.</para><para>The only substantive protection for sites is provided through section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. That section requires that the Commonwealth must only take action which `adversely affects' a place on the RNE or interim RNE if the minister or the authority proposing the action is satisfied that there is `no feasible and prudent alternative'. Secondly, it requires that, if there are no alternatives to the taking of such action, the minister or authority must be satisfied that all measures that can reasonably be taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken. The commission must be notified about any proposed action of a minister or authority. However, there is no requirement for the commission's advice to be taken into account. There are also no civil or criminal penalties for breaches of these requirements. Another major shortfall is that, as section 30 only applies to the actions of the Commonwealth, listing a place on the register does not impose any direct legal obligations on state, territory or local governments or on the owners of private property.</para><para>Whilst the Australian Heritage Commission has been fearless in its advice to various parties, it is fair to say that the current act does not strike fear into those who may wish to take action adversely affecting a place on the register. For these reasons, it is not surprising that a number of sites on the National Trust's annual list of endangered places are also listed on the Register of the National Estate. In the ACT, the Ginninderra Blacksmith's Shop is threatened by neglect; in the Northern Territory, the Adelaide River Railway Heritage Precinct is threatened by degradation through the inappropriate siting of a new railway; and in Queensland, Hinchinbrook Island and Hinchinbrook Passage are threatened by development.</para><para>In my home state of Victoria, the No. 2 Goods Shed in the Docklands, which is a stunning example of Victoria's 19th century railway heritage—I believe it is the longest railway shed in the Southern Hemisphere— now has a road through the middle of it. It is the extension of Collins Street. As I have said, the fact that the No. 2 Goods Shed is listed on the Register of the National Estate means very little. In 2000, 12 sites were removed from the register, demolished or otherwise damaged. </para><para>Indigenous heritage sites are under particular threat. One Indigenous leader I was speaking to last year informed me that a high-pressure hose was used to erase a rock art site in Queensland. This was a site that had been there for thousands of years and which was of great significance to the local Indigenous community. In Western Australia, rock art sites on the Burrup Peninsula are threatened by damage and destruction caused by industrial pollution. There are numerous other places that could be mentioned here if there was time.</para><para>I firmly believe that any nation that allows its heritage to be destroyed is impoverished for it. Our natural heritage reminds us that we are part of an ecological story that has been going on for millennia. It reminds us that we are part of the environment, not separate from it. These are special places that are important for the human spirit. They also have very significant intrinsic value. Our historical heritage provides a link with the past and reminds us of how we are part of an evolving community. For Indigenous Australians, their heritage is of great personal significance. Their heritage lies in the land, and we respect their right to manage their culture.</para><para>During the committee stage of this debate, we hope that the government will be able to provide us with details of where consultations are at with Indigenous people about amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. This act needs to be amended to incorporate the recommendations of Justice Evatt. We note too that Indigenous Australians' heritage is of increasing significance to non-Indigenous Australians. More and more non-Indigenous Australians are seeking to understand and celebrate the culture of those Australians who have occupied the Australian continent for more than 60,000 years. It is a reawakening process for many. Those who have previously thought of European settlement as the beginning of Australian history in this land are now starting to have a very different perspective.</para><para>These bills have been a long time coming, and we are looking forward to the committee stage of the debate. Our amendments pertain to the following matters, although this is not a comprehensive list. We support the separation of listing and management functions, including a heritage based listing process. We support retaining the independence and integrity of the current Australian Heritage Commission. This means supporting a commission that is able to provide frank and fearless advice. We also support increasing the commission's range of functions and ensuring that it has an appropriate budget with which it can implement its mandate. We also support retaining the commission's name, since it is an institution in itself. We support increasing the level of protection for places on the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List through various means. We support tightening up of time frames and providing improved transparency and accountability arrangements. We also support expanding the minister's capacity to deal with those actions and threats to our heritage under the act.</para><para>Our task from a legislative perspective is to ensure that these bills will give rise to a strong and robust protection regime. At the moment, whilst the bills represent a much needed step forward, it is our opinion that the step is likely to be a relatively modest one. We would like to be satisfied that the bills represent more of a stride. Much has been said of the potential of these bills to achieve a higher level of protection for those sites on the National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List. But the point I would like to stress is that the value of this new regime is only as high as the willingness of the government of the day to enforce the acts and to ensure that they are appropriately implemented and enforced. This not only requires political will but also requires added resources.</para><para>As I have said, the Democrats believe that these bills can be substantially improved, and for this reason we look forward to the committee stage of the bills, when we will be moving a number of amendments to achieve this outcome. I hope that all parties in the Senate will be persuaded by our arguments. I think they can, and should, be. Indeed, it is my hope that through a successful committee stage of this debate we will be able to bring this new heritage regime into being with the full support of the Australian parliament on behalf of the people. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>9229</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> , the <inline ref="R1592">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1593">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002</inline>. I want at the outset to congratulate the government and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for acting in so positive a way to improve Australia's record in the heritage area. Before going to the substance of the bills, I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate to note the great work that has been done by the steering committee of the General Douglas MacArthur Brisbane Memorial Trust in Brisbane. Their work is at the very heart of our built heritage. The project to develop the MacArthur Chambers site under an approved conservation plan uniquely links a vital part of our history with the vitality of our future. I am a strong supporter of the project and of the steering committee.</para></talk.start><para>The steering committee is chaired by Major General M. Blake AO, MC. The other members are Mr Geoff Rodgers, Managing Director of the Rowland Communications Group, who is deputy chairman; Mr C. Johnson, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who is honorary treasurer; Ms S. Pitkin, a partner in Clayton Utz, who is legal counsel; Mr A. Harvey Ross of Corporate Property (Queensland) Pty Ltd, who looks after property management; my friend Mr Geoff Thomas, chairman of CapitalCorp Financial Services, who assists with fundraising and has very significant commercial and political connections in the United States—in fact, it is worth while noting in this place that Mr Thomas is also Queensland's special trade representative to the United States of America; Brigadier Mike Harris MC, who handles military history; Mr J. Negus of the Australian American Association; Ms Robin Potter, from the Queensland Department of State Development; Mr Justin O'Connor, Official Secretary to the Governor of Queensland; Mr P. Herman of the Department of Veterans' Affairs; and Lieutenant Colonel J. P. Dwyer AM, who is executive officer to the committee. It should also be placed on the record that the MacArthur family in America has given permission for the family name to be used in the Brisbane project.</para><para>Under the development program, establishment of the full museum is contingent on recurrent funding, although the refurbishment of the MacArthur Chambers site commenced in late 2001 under commercial developers. Phase 1 includes the restoration of General MacArthur's World War II office and refurbishment of the eighth-floor museum. The MacArthur Museum project is being funded through government, corporate and public donations, with a target of $1.7 million to establish the displays. Donations by December 2002 had reached $555,000. For many years there has been public interest in providing recognition of the presence in Brisbane of General Douglas MacArthur and the headquarters of allied forces in the south-west Pacific area during 1942 to 1944, a crucial period in Australia's history. The trust itself has the Queensland Governor, Major General Peter Arnison, as its patron, and the chairman of trustees is Sir Leo Hielscher, Chairman of the Queensland Treasury Corporation. The MacArthur Museum project is a fine example of the kind of historically based built environment concept that deserves full support.</para><para>Incidentally, a few years ago I visited the offices of our consul general in New York where I and my fellow travellers were greeted with much grace by a former member of this place, the very distinguished and accomplished Michael Baume. The then consul general showed us into quite a beautiful room that only a few months earlier had been named the MacArthur room by our Prime Minister, John Howard—another clear indication of the special place General MacArthur has in the hearts of all Australians. It was very good to see former senator Michael Baume in this place this morning and to enjoy the conviviality and interchange that one always enjoys when engaging with him. I wish him well in his forthcoming visit to hospital. He is going for some minor reconstruction work, which I am sure will improve an already decent human being. </para><para>There is another development that I believe deserves recognition, and that is the report on the first year's progress of the environmental industry action agenda that was presented to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and the Minister for Environment and Heritage last month. The action agenda canvasses progress on 18 recommendations, including clearer financial reporting of environmental business criteria, a user-pays system for the collection of household and industrial rubbish, and a sustainability index on the Australian Stock Exchange. These are, I stress, practical measures, and it is practical measures that people right across this nation expect from their government and from agencies working with government. It is also true that the built environment is often overlooked when the broad issue of the environment is being discussed in the community. Yet it is in the built environment that people live. As a general principle, we need to be more conscious of the requirements of that environment.</para><para>I turn now to the substance of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2002 and the two other bills being debated today, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. It is important to note that the states and territories have accepted a number of key issues. These are the heritage roles and responsibilities of governments, the process of listing places of national heritage significance and the principle that the National Heritage List should aim to include the truly outstanding places of national heritage significance.</para><para>It is a pity that agreement could not be reached on the referral of state powers to the Commonwealth to enable the full protection of nationally listed places. It is perhaps not surprising that agreement could not be reached on the request by states for a veto on the nomination of a place for national listing. It is a shame that agreement similarly eluded governments on the development of common heritage protection standards. Clearly, we still have some way to go as a nation in reaching an effective and efficient accord on which level of government does what. It appears that conservation groups in particular are concerned that accreditation of state and territory processes may reduce the overall level of protection of the environment. The bottom line there, for most people, would surely be community expectation, chiefly at the local level. As a general principle, governments should seek to make regulation as light as possible and to devolve decision making to the lowest possible level. This is sometimes difficult in an ever increasing administrative environment. That too needs to be kept as simple and as straightforward as possible.</para><para>The minister noted in his second reading speech that there was a gap between state regimes, which protect places of local or state significance, and the World Heritage regime, which protects places of significance to the world. This bill establishes a mechanism for the identification, protection and management of heritage places of national significance which will be inscribed in a national heritage list. It provides for the minister, when making heritage decisions, to be guided by a body of heritage experts—the Australian Heritage Council. This too is an advance, although it seems the Labor Party does not agree that it is. The legislation is based on the national consensus reflected in the outcomes of the 1997 Council of Australian Governments Agreement on Federal-State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment, which was signed by all levels of government. That alone, in my view, should have persuaded the Labor Party to support the bill without substantial amendment.</para><para>I note that Labor assert that the bill and others in the suite of measures introduced to improve heritage management in Australia constitute a reduction of effective heritage protection in a number of important respects. These demerits, according to the shadow minister for environment and heritage, are that the Australian Heritage Council that is to replace the Australian Heritage Commission is an advisory body only, that the definition of action which triggers heritage consideration has been narrowed and deletes matters such as the provision of grants and the granting of authorisations, that the minister will acquire the status of listing authority and that heritage protection will now be accorded on the basis of `the values of the place' rather than `a place and its associated values'. </para><para>Labor—the party that believes in guided democracy, as long as it is guided by the ALP and ruled by commissions, placed men and other non-elected people—would think that, of course. I believe it is vital that we in this country sort out the complexity of demarcation lines in terms of who is responsible for what. And I believe it is fundamental to Australia's true human heritage, which is democracy, that people with other than chiefly bureaucratic interests have the bigger say in matters such as the environment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>9231</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, the <inline ref="R1592">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1593">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002</inline> substantially change federal laws that protect Australia's cultural and natural heritage. This is the latest attempt by the federal government to step back from its obligations to protect our heritage. The Australian Greens recognise that existing laws are inadequate to protect the nation's special places. The government has made some improvements to its original proposals, but the measures in these bills fail to redress the current shortcomings. They constitute a backward step in the protection of Australia's natural and cultural heritage. </para></talk.start><para>Our heritage helps define who we are as Australians—our Indigenous heritage, our European heritage, our relationship with the land and our truly spectacular natural environment. The Register of the National Estate lists 14,000 sites around the country of historical, natural and Indigenous significance. These sites tell an incredible story of the history of this nation. They include historic hotels, churches, memorials, halls, cottages and cemeteries from country towns to major cities. They include dreaming sites of Indigenous peoples and the natural areas of Cape York in Queensland, the Tarkine in Tasmania, the Kimberley and Ningaloo in Western Australia and the Nullarbor. This is in addition to `icon sites' like the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and Uluru and the Blue Mountains. You would think that we would want to do everything to protect this heritage, that we would invest in heritage protection. The reality is very different. Total Commonwealth government funding this financial year for the Australian Heritage Commission was just $6.935 million. This funding is meant to allow the Australian Heritage Commission to identify, value and conserve heritage places by advising the government on national estate matters, by compiling an inventory of national estate places throughout Australia with natural and culture heritage values and encouraging community appreciation of and concern for the national estate. </para><para>For too long the Australian Heritage Commission and heritage protection generally have been allowed to run down. The commission, established in 1976, has lost its independence and the strength and vitality that it had during the first two decades of its life. Now the federal government wants to introduce a new heritage regime that replaces the commission with a council without powers, which would devolve responsibility for protection of many sites on the register to state and territory governments, even though they have a chequered history of protecting our heritage. The federal government has also failed to provide additional funding to the states and territories to help them with this additional responsibility. </para><para>The campaign to save Sandon Point in New South Wales illustrates why we should not leave it to the states to protect our heritage sites. Archaeologist Dr Peter Hiscock has found that the area is one of the most significant Aboriginal sites on the eastern seaboard. The site has been recorded as a roosting site for Latham's snipe, which is a protected migratory species. The community in Wollongong has struggled since 1996 to save this site of natural and Indigenous significance from inappropriate residential development. People have formed a community picket that has just marked its second anniversary. Wollongong City Council and the developers Stocklands failed to adequately consult the community, but the residents' persistence in trying to save this important site has finally led the New South Wales government to appoint a commission of inquiry. While it will not re-examine the portion of the site for which medium- to high-density housing has been approved, it will make recommendations about the use of the remainder of the site. The Greens say that the government should buy back this site. Of course, the final decision on whether to save this area is in the hands of the New South Wales Minister for Planning. This is a strong pointer as to why, at the national level, we should not be moving away from an independent body, the Australian Heritage Commission, to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage as the authority empowered to list heritage sites. </para><para>Under the regime that these bills establish, the Register of the National Estate will continue to exist but the limited powers of protection that currently apply will cease to have effect. This means that all places on the register will be at risk unless and until they are protected by a state or territory government or assessed for inclusion on one of two proposed federal government lists: the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. This could take years, and in the meantime these sites are at risk.</para><para>The federal government will be responsible only for those places of `genuine national significance' which end up on the two new lists. The government has provided no information about which places will be on the lists under its responsibility. The icon heritage sites are likely to be included, but these sites are generally well protected under other laws. Even worse, these bills leave the decision to list a site to the minister for the environment. Instead of a place's heritage value being the basis of whether to list, the minister will take into account competing political and economic issues.</para><para>The bills also fail to provide sufficient protection for Commonwealth properties of heritage value when the properties are sold. Under these proposals, the Commonwealth agency responsible for a heritage site must ensure that the sale contract includes a covenant protecting the Commonwealth heritage values of the places. However, if the agency believes that such a covenant is unnecessary to protect the values, or is unreasonable or impracticable, then it is not required to enter into one. This provision places the minister in a secondary role. The minister cannot enforce the requirement for a covenant. This creates a loophole that would allow Commonwealth sites to slip outside the protection regime. The discretion of the agency is wide and potentially open to abuse. If the contract does not include a covenant, the minister must enter into a conservation agreement with the prospective buyer or lessee for the protection and conservation of the Commonwealth heritage values of the place. But this may not be a strong as a covenant.</para><para>These bills are also a backward step because the strong definition of an `action', which is outlined in the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, has been removed and replaced with the weak definition contained in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The effect of narrowing the definition of an action is to exempt all government decision-making and funding activities from the operation of the legislation. Currently, under the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the taking of an action includes: `the making of a decision or recommendation, including direct financial assistance to a state or territory, the approval of a program, issue of a licence or granting of permission'. However, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act definition of an action excludes these decisions.</para><para>The reduction in the types of actions to be covered in this bill will result in many Commonwealth actions that affect heritage places being exempt from proper consideration, assessment and decision. The Australian Greens will be moving or supporting amendments to restore the definition of an action that is outlined in the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The consequential amendments that the government is proposing omit tax deductibility for donations for places listed on the Register of the National Estate. These could undermine protection of those places. </para><para>Currently, a gift to a place on the register, to any of the National Trust bodies in Australia, is tax deductible. Under the proposed amendment, a gift of a place on the national or Commonwealth lists only will be tax deductible. As the register will continue to exist under the new regime, we see no reason to limit this provision. As it stands in the bill, the proposed provision will act as a disincentive to the gifting to the National Trust of heritage properties that are included on state heritage lists. We will be moving an amendment to restore tax deductibility to properties listed on the register.</para><para>The Greens are also concerned about the heritage bill's reliance on the values approach to heritage protection. This values approach has lessened heritage protection. It has not protected everything that is important about a place, only the defined values of a site. I will provide three examples to illustrate the problem with this approach. The first is the Basslink project in Tasmania. The environmental impact assessment recognised that the Basslink project will cause fluctuations in the height of the Gordon River, in the World Heritage area, of up to four metres above current riparian zones, upsetting sandbanks and adversely affecting riverine plants and animals. Despite these revelations, the final assessment of this project, conducted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, concluded that the values of the World Heritage area would not be affected. This conclusion fails to recognise that the damage to a particular place within the listed site affects the entire site.</para><para>Another example is the Great Barrier Reef. There have been a number of commercial shipping incidents, including a recent oil spill, on the Great Barrier Reef, none of which have resulted in prosecutions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Although these were incidents of great concern, it is arguable whether they had a significant impact on the `values' of the Great Barrier Reef. An impact on the `place' would, however, clearly bring such actions within the ambit of potential prosecution.</para><para>My final example is from the wet tropics. Recent illegal logging in the wet tropics region did not lead to any prosecution under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Although the activity was discovered within the World Heritage area, the definition of `values' as opposed to `place' opened up for debate the question of whether these actions could be prosecuted under the EPBC Act. The Greens will be supporting the amendments that we understand Labor has to ensure that both the heritage place and the heritage values are protected.</para><para>Australia has a rich natural, cultural and Indigenous heritage, as recognised in the 14,000 sites listed on the Register of the National Estate. These are places of significance to all Australians and the national government is the appropriate sphere for their protection. It is worth remembering that the portfolio minister for this legislation, Dr David Kemp, is the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. The Greens want to see more attention given to heritage protection and more funding for heritage protection, not less protection. These bills fail to deliver stronger protection. They require substantial changes and the Greens will be seeking the support of the Senate for a number of measures to improve these bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>9233</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate Senator Nettle on that outline of the shortcomings of the <inline ref="R1591">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, the <inline ref="R1592">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1593">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002</inline>. I also congratulate the previous speakers Senator Carr and Senator Allison for highlighting shortcomings and I note the heritage interest and concern of Senator Santoro, which I welcome. Senator Nettle has outlined the Greens' position on the legislation. I want to take a little while to talk about why we are in this position today. It is because of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. That legislation was brought in 28 years ago by the Whitlam government after the furore over the destruction of Lake Pedder in Tasmania, amongst many other things. </para></talk.start><para>When the Whitlam government came to office at the end of 1972, the then Reece Labor government in Tasmania was close to completing the dams that were going to obliterate the gently and magnificently beautiful Lake Pedder National Park, 300 metres up in the highlands of the wilderness of Tasmania. In fact, it was the gem at the heart of the western wilderness of Tasmania. The lake itself was two miles square. The beach, high up in the mountains, was 800 metres in width and two or three kilometres in length when exposed at this time of the year, although it was covered after the heavy rains and snows of winter. It was an extraordinary part not only of the nation but also of the world's heritage. But it was destroyed by vandals of the Hydro-Electric Commission and the then Labor and Liberal governments that serially supported this destruction of a national park, which was illegal until they brought retrospective legislation through the Tasmanian parliament in the early 1970s.</para><para>This led to arguably the first national conservation furore, with people right around the country aghast at serial state governments— the Bethune Liberal government as well as the Reece Labor governments which came before and after it—destroying such an heirloom for a tiny aliquot of electricity, a very tiny fraction of what comes out of the average coal-fired power station. But they were determined and they went ahead. Under enormous pressure, but with the great support of the first Minister for the Environment of that federal government, Moss Cass, there was an inquiry which went national. It came up with a recommendation for an Australian Heritage Commission and from that came the Australian Heritage Commission Act.</para><para>We are still in a country where the national heritage is being fragmented and destroyed at a remarkable rate. Look at the increasing number of species of our wildlife and botanical heritage we in this Senate see being put onto the rare, endangered and threatened lists. That is not just happening out of the blue through some natural form of attrition; it is happening because the basic living units of our ecosystems in Australia are imperilled and under enormous threat. This legislation has not staunched it, nor has the other environmental legislation that this country has.</para><para>Of all things, 28 years after the legislation was brought in to give the federal government that power—and the Whitlam government signed the World Heritage convention to augment it—we have the Howard federal government moving back to 1972 and handing back powers to the states, all except for a so-far inadequate—and it always will be inadequately defined—smaller list of those places judged to be of national significance and which go onto a national list. But most of the 14,000 places, sites and entities on the list will be handed back to states or will disappear into some sort of non-status. What a remarkable turnaround by the body politic in Australia, under the pressure of the moneyed interests! That is where it comes from. It is not coming from people pressure, but from the pressure of the moneyed interests, moving through this government to dismantle what little there is to recognise and protect in Australia's heritage.</para><para>Let me look at some of the places I know well that will be threatened under this system. They include the Tarkine forest that Senator Nettle referred to—Australia's greatest temperate rainforest. It is of World Heritage stature, but it has been denied a nomination because the state government wants to log it and not to keep it as heritage. Federal governments, both Labor and Liberal, have said yes to that. That, by the way, is an abrogation of Australia's obligation under the World Heritage convention to nominate sites of World Heritage significance. But it is listed on the Register of the National Estate and it is being logged. Under a regional forest agreement signed by no less than Prime Minister Howard, it is open for mining. What a way to treat this extraordinary piece of national heritage! That is how it is being treated.</para><para>What we should be seeing here today is legislation that says, `No; such a place'—this great temperate rainforest of extraordinary importance to the Indigenous people of Tasmania, as well as for its rainforest, wildlife and other values—`should be protected under national legislation.' We should be arming the nation with the means to protect such a site. In the United States, where the federal government has authority over lands, this would be a national park—a big `n' national park. Here, it is relegated to the cut-up process of state governments under pressure from woodchipping and mining corporations, and we are getting legislation to say, `That's going to be okay, Jack.' What a reversal of the process of protecting our heritage. </para><para>Why should responsibility for the environment be passed down the line, as Senator Santoro argued, saying we should devolve decision making to the `lowest possible level'—he is referring to local government— when it is of national significance? I certainly agree that we need to have local input into heritage decisions, but if you left it at that, under the pressure of promises of jobs and development which very rarely come true we would have lost the Franklin River, for example. If you leave it to state governments, we are going to lose much of the Tarkine Rainforest, which is of national and World Heritage significance.</para><para>Why is it that this government says, `Devolve it to local power' when it comes to the environment, but says, `Let's send it across to Geneva' when it comes to the World Trade Organisation and economic matters? There is duplicity here. If corporations want to get rid of Australian protective measures for economic or trade considerations, the government says, `Fine. Legislate through the parliament, and let's hand this power across to 1,500 faceless bureaucrats somewhere near Geneva.' But if the issue is our national heritage, the pride of this nation, what makes this nation different, then it says, `Devolve the power.' The government fails to give it even federal protection, let alone list it according to our obligations under the World Heritage convention where appropriate. The government wants to devolve it down to where the corporate interest, when it comes along and wants to develop, can have a smack at it and rip it to ribbons. What a double standard that is on the part of the Howard government.</para><para>Let me congratulate at this point the Crean opposition, the Labor opposition of the day, for making a stand on this issue. They are making a very important stand, and it is a stand based on the Labor Party's history of having brought the Australian Heritage Commission into being so long ago but in a period where, for once, the nation was recognising through the Whitlam government the importance of the natural, Indigenous and historic heritage of this country.</para><para>I want to talk about Recherche Bay in Tasmania. Recherche Bay is a magnificent natural harbour. If we were in the Northern Hemisphere, it would have a metropolitan city built upon it by now. Instead, it is largely as it has been for centuries and millennia. In 1792, along came D'Entrecasteaux with his two ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Recherche</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Esperance</inline>—meaning `research' and `hope' respectively—which were full of scientists. They had, amongst other things, instructions to look for La Perouse, who had disappeared somewhere in the Pacific after going via Port Jackson on his expedition some years earlier. When D'Entrecasteaux's expedition got to Recherche Bay, having passed the southern part of Tasmania and gone around a little onto the east coast, and found this harbour, they were mightily grateful, because they had been through some violent storms in the roaring forties coming across the Indian Ocean from South Africa.</para><para>They stayed there for five weeks. They loved it so much that—after circumnavigating Australia and going to Esperance in Western Australia; Esperance was named after one of their ships—they decided to come back again to get fresh water and new timber. And this time, during their five-week stay, they met the Indigenous people of the region, the Palawa people. It is all closely recorded and is the most magnificent story, including the planting of a garden ashore with European vegetables. On the morning the French met the Indigenous people—for the first time, the French thought—the Palawa took them back to their camp site of the previous night. In other words, the Palawa had been along and looked them over during the night, then left them and gone fishing in the morning. This is a remarkable interaction between these two societies, and the places where these walks and this interaction occurred are still intact on this small peninsula. </para><para>Now Gunns woodchip corporation wants to log it, and the Bacon Labor government, in the spirit of Lake Pedder, has said nothing to indicate it is going to stop that. The Bacon government might protect the postage stamp sized site of the garden—the 211-year old site that is still intact and perhaps the oldest intact European built site in our nation—but the context will be lost. They might even protect the site of the observatory down on Bennetts Point, where a global breakthrough in navigation was made by the French, or the site where a woman fought a duel—she was dressed in men's clothes so she could get on these ships—and was winged. We do not know exactly where that was yet, but that is a magnificent story in itself. There is so much of our nation's history in this remarkable place which is about to be woodchipped. If we were standing here today with legislation to protect that, we could be proud of it, but instead we are devolving the power that we have, which might protect it, back to the Bacon government.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title><type>Matters of Public Interest</type><page.no>9236</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Peter (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cook)</inline>—Order!

It is with displeasure that I inform the Senate that it really is a shocker. It is testimony to Labor's historic inability to run a budget properly or efficiently. Labor in Queensland has turned in a third consecutive deficit—a massive deficit of $741 million, which only last June was going to be a surplus of $23 million. This is a sad and expensive re-run of the picture last year, when Queensland Labor turned in a deficit of $894 million.</para></talk.start><para>Yet all the forecasts point to Queensland continuing to lead Australia in most of the measures by which economic performance is measured. Most private analysts—and, indeed, the Queensland government—say that the state's economy will expand at a fast rate this year, fuelled by housing and business investment and continued strong population growth. That is the consensus view for the current budget year, a year in which Queensland government tax revenue is now forecast to rise by 8.6 per cent to $5.3 billion.</para><para>With strong revenue growth—from stamp duty and gambling tax in particular—and the inflow of GST dollars from the Commonwealth, Queensland should be sitting pretty comfortably, despite the crippling drought and low commodity prices. Unfortunately, it is not. We need to ask why. The answer is very simple: Labor simply cannot run budgets. They are good at the spin—and the Queensland Premier is particularly keen on turning sows' ears into silk purses—but they are no good where it matters: in the detail, in the substance of financial management. That is why we see the budget running away from them, to the detriment and the cost of each and every Queenslander.</para><para>Labor likes to spend on the headline projects—for example, the Lang Park stadium and that ultimate extravagance the Goodwill Bridge, the footbridge over the Brisbane River that started out as a $13 million project and ended up costing twice that much—but it cannot do the hard yards. It cannot run the public hospital system without forcing the hospital authorities to close beds and cut staff hours and service delivery in an attempt to stay within inadequate operational funding budgets. It cannot run the police service without forcing the police to cut operational and training budgets—and it has made things worse this year by underbudgeting for the new police enterprise agreement.</para><para>The Queensland government cannot run the state school system without running foul of underresourced teachers; and classroom numbers, even by its own measures, do not meet requirements. The teachers are among a range of government employees now fighting bitter enterprise bargaining disputes. The Queensland government cannot run the ambulance system—the ambulance system that used to run itself because non-Labor governments allowed local communities to control it and to raise funds locally. Now Labor is introducing a new tax, introduced by a Premier who promised no new taxes, to pay for its centralised system that simply does not work. </para><para>There is no doubt that the Queensland government is struggling to maintain economic credibility after turning in its third budget deficit in a row. It is plainly desperate. Now it is even proposing to tax ride-on mowers; it wants to make owners pay an annual registration fee to cut their grass— how desperate can you get? Stay tuned.</para><para>Queensland is clearly in a serious budgetary position. Nothing demonstrates that with more clarity or more starkly than the fact that for the second year running its midyear review has made a lie of the budget papers. Treasurer Mackenroth has basically had to admit that for the second consecutive year the government's budget day forecast in terms of net operating balance in the GFS sector was a work of fiction. Last June, in the budget the Queensland government forecast a surplus of $23 million—razor thin in the context of the overall size of the budget but, nevertheless, a surplus. Now it says it will produce a deficit of $741 million. This adds to the horrendous $894 million deficit for 2001-02 and to the $820 million deficit in 2000-01. When he released the midyear budget review last week, the Queensland Treasurer said something truly extraordinary. He told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>:</para><quote><para>I'm able very comfortably to look at this deficit that's based on only one thing, and that is the returns on our investments.</para></quote><para>It is funny that when investment returns were running at or near their long-term average of around seven per cent he never felt he had to say—and I will try to imagine the quote he should have been saying—`I'm very comfortable to look at this surplus that's overwhelmingly based on only one thing, and that is the returns on our investments.' What the Queensland Treasurer said in his midyear review on the fully funded superannuation question is very worrying and worth putting on the record, because to date it has escaped significant mention. He said that the:</para><quote><para>... forecast General Government operating deficit position for 2002-03 is due to a significant downward revision in investment earnings—reflecting ongoing volatility in equity markets ...</para></quote><para>He went on to say that it:</para><quote><para>... is extremely difficult to forecast investment returns associated with the full funding of superannuation and other employee entitlements. For the purposes of the Mid Year Review, an assumption of 0% has been used for 2002-03, which is generally consistent with the assumptions used by other jurisdictions ...</para></quote><para>While other states have also been impacted by poor investment returns, the impact on the Queensland general government sector is magnified because of the relatively larger asset holding associated with the full funding of employee entitlements; in contrast with other jurisdictions, the assets and liabilities associated with superannuation are held and reflected in the general government sector. The Queensland Treasurer went on to say:</para><quote><para>If Queensland's superannuation arrangements were structured on the same basis as other jurisdictions, the General Government sector underlying result for 2001-02 and 2002-03 would be in surplus ...</para></quote><para>These are weasel words, and Queenslanders should worry very much about what their subtext is. Does the Queensland Treasurer propose to put up a case for not fully funding public sector superannuation? He makes the point that, if the superannuation investments had been excluded from the budget, the underlying operating result in 2001-02 would have been a surplus of $294 million and that the estimated 2002-03 operating surplus would be $42 million on the basis of the midyear review.</para><para>Historically, Queensland has fully funded its public sector superannuation liabilities— something that stands the state in very good stead. But, naturally, these are invested funds and the return they get obviously depends on the global investment market. These funds are invested with the Queensland Investment Corporation. Like every other managed funds investor, QIC showed a negative return last year because of the plunge in the local and world financial markets. I want to make one other thing very clear: what is under critical scrutiny here is state government mismanagement, not the investment returns or the funds management performance of QIC, which is absolutely beyond reproach and described as that by every serious financial commentator in Australia.</para><para>It is the Queensland Treasurer who is in the spotlight. He has redone his sums for this year on the basis of a zero per cent return on investment funds this financial year. According to market watchers, that is a very tough call since it implies an expectation of a seven per cent plus turnaround in investment returns over the year. Those interested in the actual outcome will also remember that last year's midyear review forecast an end of year outcome some hundreds of millions of dollars better than that which actually occurred. On that basis, I would suggest that the new forecast of a $741 million deficit, against the $23 million surplus originally forecast, can only look very shaky. </para><para>But the state economy is growing faster than most and government revenue is also rising. As the state Treasury's midyear review points out, economic growth in Queensland in 2002-03 is again forecast to exceed that of Australia as a whole, with growth of 4¼ per cent against the forecast national rate of three per cent. And this is in an economic environment where drought has taken an estimated one half of one per cent off growth. That is a distinct credit to Queensland's business community generally, and to the small business community in particular. But it makes the Queensland government's budgetary performance, when compared with the business community performance, even more woeful.</para><para>In the budget brought down in June last year, capital works spending in 2002-03 was estimated to be $4.837 billion. But that was 5.4 per cent less than the budgeted figure of $5.115 billion in 2001-02. If we factor in inflation, which the budget estimated at 2.75 per cent in Queensland in 2002-03, then capital works spending falls in real terms by 8.2 per cent. In 2001-02, capital works declined budget to budget by 3.2 per cent, or six per cent in real terms. So Labor is wrong again. In a development state like Queensland, capital works drives the economy and, unfortunately, Labor is again heading the wrong way.</para><para>The midyear review says that investment is forecast to be a major driver of growth, with business investment rising rapidly in response to several large development projects beginning in Queensland this year. This optimism needs to be tempered by future expectations. Both the Commerce Queensland Pulse survey and other analysts say that on the critical question of business expectations—confidence, in other words—the evidence is clear that expectations are falling in terms of conditions business people expect in 2003-04. I note that the Queensland Premier has questioned the findings of this survey. He says that private sector investment in Queensland is rising at a `record high', but Queensland business is saying that its confidence is sliding that the Beattie government has much of a clue about anything and that it is also worrying about future global economic conditions.</para><para>These are uncertain and dangerous times globally, and economic expectations are not helped by the stronger Australian dollar and continued slackness in commodity markets. Neither the strengthening Australian dollar nor commodity prices are of course due to the activity or, for that matter, the lack of activity of the Queensland government. At the same time, the primary task of a state government is to manage its budget as the agent of the provider of its funds. I would respectfully suggest that the Queensland government is failing in this primary task. Labor in Queensland has no more excuse than any other state government in this country to blame everyone except itself for this. It signed up for the GST deal on the basis that the states would get all the money and access to the first real growth tax they have had since giving away income-taxing powers 60 years ago. It is true that the full effect of the GST funding flow will not be felt until 2007, but the money is already coming in in Queensland's case to the tune of around $6 billion a year.</para><para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission has just increased Queensland's funding relativity vis-à-vis the other states in its 2003 review, with a next-year additional benefit of more than $404 million. Queensland's tax revenue in 2002-03 is up by 8.6 per cent on the figure forecast in the June budget papers. Current grants and subsidies are 2.9 per cent higher than the government was counting on last year. The Queensland government is a government of stunts and spectacular non-core spending. Labor in Queensland has proved itself to be an appalling manager of the budget it was elected to run efficiently. Queenslanders, as we are now witnessing, are beginning to pay through the nose for Labor's economic and budget mismanagement. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centre for Independent Studies</title><page.no>9239</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9239</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I wish to place on the parliamentary record my concern that there is an organisation in this country that is seeking to influence public policy in a directly partisan way, despite claiming the mantle of independence. That organisation is a think tank called the Centre for Independent Studies. The CIS is nothing close to independent; rather, it is the outsourced research arm of the Liberal government. This is the spring from which Ministers Abbott, Howard and Costello and company draw their ideas and turn them into the policies that are ripping up the social fabric of our country.</para></talk.start><para>The CIS advertises a slogan: `Tomorrow's ideas, today'. Its slogan ought to be `Tomorrow's Liberal policies, today'. To explain why, let me start by analysing the background of the directors and staff of the Centre for Independent Studies. This allegedly independent organisation makes conclusions such as `behavioural poverty' is a cause of material poverty. Taking that claim at face value, you would expect those making the claim to have some experience of poverty and you would expect them not to be members or supporters of the Liberal Party. You would hope that it was a balanced and diverse group of people who had come up with such a startling conclusion and only after there had been thorough and rigorous investigation. When it comes to the Centre for Independent Studies, you would be dead wrong.</para><para>The researchers at the CIS often have links to the Liberal Party or far Right organisations and the board is mostly rich, white, conservative and male. The board of the Centre for Independent Studies is made up of 17 men and two women. Its members are worth approximately $1 billion and together they run companies worth over $100 billion. At the top of the list is Michael Darling, who is worth up to $400 million and who lives in the dress circle of Bellevue Hill. Then there is John Calvert-Jones, a Murdoch in-law, who makes personal donations to the Liberal Party according to the Australian Electoral Commission. He is worth $300 million according to <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline>. Calvert-Jones is also a director of a front company for Liberal Party fund raising called Vapold, a company whose purpose is so thinly disguised that its registered address is the same as the Liberal Party's. You can see that these people are nothing if not independent. I could go on, but rather than take up the Senate's time listing all those executives on the CIS board earning more than $1 million a year, I will confine my comments to Michael Chaney who most recently reported salary packages making him $8 million a year. Chaney is, of course, a former Liberal Party member and he comes from a pedigree of Liberal politicians and he is head of the Wesfarmers empire. </para><para>Despite all these Liberal Party connections, the CIS is adamant that it has the right to call itself independent. The question is: independent of what? Yes, they are independent of morals and honesty, but are they independent of partisan politics? The answer is clearly no. In the past, the CIS has actively accepted up to $50,000 a year from a Liberal Party fund raising company called the Cormack Foundation. Who is on the board of that foundation? None other than Hugh Morgan, a CIS Distinguished Fellow, and John Calvert-Jones, a CIS board member.</para><para>There are no prizes for guessing that there are no ALP, Democrat or Green affiliated persons on the CIS board. I find this level of partisanship at the CIS, and the deception that is inherent in this partisanship, particularly galling. We are living in a time when it is harder and harder to decipher what is genuine information and what is simple marketing spin or political propaganda. I suggest to the chamber that much of what the Centre for Independent Studies offers as research is in fact thinly disguised political propaganda. It is about time someone exposed it for what it is.</para><para>There is a long history to why much CIS work lends itself to use by the Liberal Party. Indeed, the CIS, in the words of its Executive Director, Reg Lindsay, was developed using the example of the think tanks that drove the Thatcher and Reagan policy agenda of the 1980s. The important lesson from similarities between the CIS and overseas right wing think tanks is that their onslaught will continue until every last asset is privatised, every last single parent is blamed for whatever problem their child faces and until every person ironically believes universities should give up their independence and be run like a lean profit making machine. </para><para>The CIS prides itself on its international networks, including a little known group called the Mont Pelerin Society. Founded by Friedrich Hayek and including Milton Friedman amongst its alumni, 22 of Ronald Reagan's economic advisers when he took office in 1980 were members of this society. It is involvement in the Mont Pelerin Society and like-minded networks that is likely to continue feeding the CIS neoliberal propaganda machine well into the future.</para><para>I implore members of the public and the press gallery to see through the CIS façade of independence. Do not fall for the slick spin; ask where the research has come from; do a search on the Australian Electoral Commission web site when a new board member is appointed. It is a lack of scrutiny that has allowed the CIS to develop their current reputation and profile and it is proper and ongoing scrutiny that will expose their shonky research. </para><para>It is sad that public debate has reached the point where invective once considered to be far Right babble is now taken seriously as policy advice. For example, take a policy program called Taking Children Seriously. The sponsors of the program generally provide about $500,000 a year to the Liberal Party and include its biggest individual donor, Richard Pratt, through the Pratt Foundation. The sponsors of this program, which is meant to focus on the wellbeing of children, also ironically include a tobacco company called Philip Morris.</para><para>This babble is given credibility because Liberal politicians have systematically championed it. Right from the outset of the CIS, it has had links to the Liberals. They started with Jim Carlton, the New South Wales General Secretary of the Liberal Party; the Western Australian Liberal MP John Hyde; John Elliott; and Hugh Morgan from Western Mining Corporation who personally contributed to CIS coffers and organised $200,000 in seed funding that kept CIS afloat in its early years. In recent years, Tony Abbott has been the most vocal champion of CIS research. But it must be noted that the four most senior government figures—the Prime Minister, John Howard; the Treasurer, Peter Costello; the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Robert Hill and Mr Abbott— were all guests at the 2002 CIS annual conference.</para><para>Where has listening to CIS policy advice got Australia? A case in point is the recently revealed fact that Australia has just recorded foreign debt of $350 billion and its greatest quarterly current account deficit ever—some $11.6 billion. Following the CIS's policy prescriptions certainly has a downside. So, when you read the CIS bulletin <inline font-style="italic">Economic Freedom Watch</inline>, ask yourself how much freedom a $350 billion debt will buy you. When you take a look at the recent CIS article headed `Only deregulation can create jobs', ask yourself whether skilled and educated workers, fair trade, and research and development might also help to create jobs.</para><para>Perhaps one task the CIS are doing effectively for the current Liberal coalition government is that they may well be hiding the debt truck—or the debt road train—by parking it in their backrooms or garages and keeping it well out of public view. Even if you think only deregulation can create jobs, it is difficult to argue in favour of the various CIS policy arguments, which are often hypocritical. Its economic and social lines of argument just do not correlate. It is all for libertarianism when the question is about what to do with markets. But ask the CIS about moral or family decisions according to their wishes and the interfering, thumping fist of 1950s conservatism gets slammed on the table.</para><para>To give you an example of some recent CIS work, a former CIS researcher by the name of Lucy Sullivan claimed in 1999 that poor people are simply lazy and that, until divorce was made a less onerous process under Gough Whitlam, drug problems and youth homelessness simply did not exist. During her time at the CIS, Sullivan also managed to link the increase in women's participation in the work force to higher levels of rape and homicide. This extraordinary display of intellectual acrobatics is meant to pass as considered academic research. These claims alone are enough to ask: what process does the CIS undertake to review its research before publication? How often does the CIS Academic Advisory Council meet? Why did no-one challenge Lucy Sullivan before her absurd conclusion went to print? I challenge the CIS to put these details on the public record. </para><para>In the meantime, the public can shift its concern to other CIS publications such as `The Third World Debt Crisis: Can't Pay or Won't Pay', `A Private<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Education for All' and `Why Christians Should Support the Market Economy'. It shocks me that until now these outrageous examples of nonsense have been absent from the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. One place CIS views have not been absent from is the opinion pages of the national newspapers. The CIS receives hundreds of media mentions a year and its staff have more than 100 opinion pieces published each year. I do not deny the CIS its right to push its views wherever it can. However, when the CIS dismisses such serious issues as world poverty, I take offence. Helen Hughes of the CIS did this recently when she backed these claims by Indian economist Surjit Bhalla:</para><quote><para>... that the World Bank's poverty count of 1.15 billion poor people in developing countries is a gross exaggeration. </para></quote><para>It would have helped readers to know that Bhalla's previous book was called <inline font-style="italic">Between the Wickets: The Who and Why of the Best in Cricket.</inline></para><para>I would like to conclude my remarks by warning others about the dangers of raising similar concerns to mine about the CIS. The CIS have a track record of keeping you out of the loop if you are an uncooperative journalist and, if you are a mere public servant or academic, the CIS is likely to label you a communist or make defamation claims against you. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Smith Family and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling are recent victims of CIS vitriol, and it will not come as any surprise if I am next on their list.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: Media Ownership</title><page.no>9241</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>9241</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the media. A fortnight ago, Roy Greenslade, a columnist with the <inline font-style="italic">Observer</inline> in London, did a comprehensive analysis of all newspapers owned by News Corporation around the world—all 175 major titles. And all 175 newspapers in their editorials were running a line that was pro war in Iraq. Mr Greenslade described this as an `extraordinary unity of thought' among editors, which is all the more extraordinary because it happens to coincide with Mr Murdoch's public views on the war, published last month in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine.</para></talk.start><para>Conrad Black is also on the record as publicly supporting Tony Blair's `courageous' stance on the war, a line enthusiastically echoed in his British newspapers. In Australia, it has been left to the Fairfax papers, the electronic media and the public broadcasters to run the contrary arguments. This is all very significant, because in a few weeks, this parliament is set to debate a bill to deregulate media ownership. Already, News Corporation control around 57 per cent of the newspaper circulations in Australia. Under the bill proposed by the government, they will be able to expand their operations into television.</para><para>An argument can be put that restraints on cross-media ownership restrict investment, and that investment restricts the ability to develop quality, diversified media. Senator Alston went so far as to tell the Melbourne Press Club last month that our current media laws encourage `mediocrity'. On several occasions, he has pointed to the British Labour government, which is in the process of overhauling its media laws to loosen up the cross-media ownership restrictions.</para><para>Today, I want to discuss some of the key differences in the British media environment from which Australia might learn, which underpin fundamentally the deregulation of cross-media laws in that country and which do not exist as safeguards in the proposed laws for this country. British media laws contain far stronger protections of diversity and plurality than Australia's proposed law regime does. This should concern all senators and citizens who seek to ensure that diversity is maintained in Australia's media environment. </para><para>First, the laws will maintain the restriction on major newspaper companies buying into television. If a company controls 20 per cent of the national newspaper market, they will be prohibited from owning more than 20 per cent of a television licence. Further, if a newspaper company controls more than 20 per cent of a regional newspaper market, they will be prohibited from owning more than 20 per cent of a regional television licence. The Blair government, in its communications bill policy paper, defends these rules by arguing:</para><quote><para>National newspapers are the most editorially influential mass medium.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>... joint ownership of a substantial share of the national newspaper market and a substantial part of Channel 3, the only commercial public service broadcaster ... would represent an unacceptable concentration of influence in the current circumstances.</para></quote><para>Second, the British law goes further than the government's proposed `editorial separation' of jointly owned television and newspaper newsrooms by requiring commercial television operators to contract to a separate news provider for the provision of their news service. The government argues that this measure, mandated in the new law, `makes sure that the news service is independent of the licensee and unaffected by any of their commercial concerns'. The new communications bill will give the regulator more power to prescribe how much commercial television must invest to maintain quality news and current affairs coverage, also ensuring that such coverage is provided in prime time.</para><para>Third, the British communications bill will mandate in the new industry regulator, OFCOM, the current powers of the Broadcasting Services Commission to investigate radio and television against the standard that news and current affairs should be presented with due accuracy and impartiality, and that undue prominence should not be given to the opinions of particular persons or bodies in matters of political or industrial controversy. The government's policy paper notes:</para><quote><para>This power may become more important in the light of the likely consolidation in local radio markets, and OFCOM will need to use it to pay particular attention to matters of impartiality.</para></quote><para>OFCOM inherits from the BSC its very wide powers to regulate matters of impartiality, fairness and privacy. These include the power to impose conditions on licences, the power to require the broadcasting of corrections and findings and the power to fine broadcasters up to 250,000 or five per cent of their revenues for breaching conditions. As the communications white paper notes:</para><quote><para>One of the cornerstones of broadcasting in the UK has been the obligation on all broadcasters to present news with due accuracy and impartiality. The Government believes that these obligations have played a major part in ensuring wide public access to impartial and accurate information about our society and the opportunity to encounter a diverse array of voices and perspectives. They ensure that the broadcast media provide a counterweight to other, often partial, sources of news. They therefore contribute significantly to properly informed democratic debate.</para></quote><para>These powers contrast with those of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It has the power to take complaints on issues of fairness and privacy and make findings. But it has no powers to enforce its findings against commercial broadcasters, other than going through a very cumbersome process of making a matter a licence condition. Ironically, the ABA does have a power to require public broadcasters but not commercial broadcasters to broadcast corrections.</para><para>Fourth, while the British government is deregulating the mergers and takeover powers for newspapers, it is maintaining an exceptional public interest test on plurality. This test will be directed to cases that involve the public interest in the accurate presentation of news, free expression of opinion and plurality of views in the press. Where the exceptional public interest test is invoked, the competition commission will be expected to carry out effective tests of local opinion, for example, by means of citizen juries. Fifth, the laws carry very heavy obligations on broadcasters to carry regional programming. No such requirement exists in Australia, with only a first tentative move into the area with the proposed regional news licence condition recently proposed by the ABA. Sixth, the public broadcasters play a much more important part in British broadcasting. The government's white paper restates this role, arguing: </para><quote><para>First, public service broadcasting ensures that the interests of all viewers are taken into account.</para><para>Second, public service broadcasting is a counter-balance to fears about the concentration of ownership and the absence of diversity of views. It means news and current affairs are available in peak times, as part of mixed schedules, where citizens are most likely to see them. It guarantees the availability of full and balanced information about the world at local, regional and global levels. Such scheduling, together with the investment which public broadcasters have put into news and current affairs, is the key foundation of an open, balanced public debate.</para></quote><para>It is difficult to imagine our own government making a similar public commitment to public broadcasting here. Indeed, as ABC Managing Director Russell Balding pointed out at the Press Club in September, the BBC receives public funding eight to nine times that of the ABC, even though Britain's population is three times ours, while its land mass is just three per cent of ours. Mr Balding contrasted the key role that the BBC continues to play—in innovative programming and production and in digital conversion and regional programming—with the approach adopted in Australia by pointing out:</para><quote><para>Since 1996, the ABC has been reduced, reformed, refocused and restructured to the limit. Years of doing more with less has taken its toll—and as far as the ABC services go, we are at the limit of our comprehensiveness without additional funding.</para></quote><para>To put that into perspective, for the ABC to play the role in the Australian media that the BBC plays in the British media would require a trebling of its current budget. That is a budget increase of around $1.2 billion a year. Are we going to see that? Of course not. Then we need to recognise that the ABC will not be able to play the role of full counterweight to commercial media that the BBC does in the UK. The British communications white paper picks up the mantra that this government runs in terms of new options for news, arguing that plurality concerns may diminish as more people gain access to the range of services now available on digital TV and the Internet, but it concludes:</para><quote><para>For the time being, however, most people continue to rely on terrestrial TV, radio and newspapers. Cross-media consolidations which are desirable on economic grounds may tend to reduce the plurality of viewpoints and sources of information available.</para></quote><para>The paper points out that most European countries, recognising the importance of the media, have some specific rules entrenched in law to prevent the dominance of various players. These measures include numerical and percentage restrictions on monomedia and mass media ownership and cross-media ownership, the establishment of expert media bodies to advise competition authorities on media ownership issues, measures to promote editorial and journalistic independence and the requirement to promote media pluralism as a prerequisite to licensing.</para><para>It is important for policy makers, when they argue that Australia should follow the UK approach to deregulating media ownership, to recognise that, while the UK is looking at deregulating ownership to some degree, this is backed by a far tighter set of conditions on the responsibilities of media owners. The Democrats believe that Australia too could benefit from a tougher regime of responsibilities on media owners in terms of the public policy considerations of what they must provide to the public. We adopted many of the British ideas in our media policy which I released in September last year. I would certainly hope that the government recognises that there is a strong public interest case to be made that must offset the pure economic case for the consolidation of ownership. I would hope that, if our media laws are changed, with the added economic clout of new owners will come added responsibilities as well. The balance implicit in British media regulation is sadly missing in the government's proposed media ownership laws. It needs to be there if we are to get the most out of our media. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Hunter Region</title><page.no>9244</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>9244</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to draw to the attention of the Senate some of the key issues that are coming up in the forthcoming New South Wales state election, particularly as they affect my home area of the Hunter Valley. I am amazed, having watched some of the media and read the press reports, that the Carr government seem to be peddling the same bag of unfulfilled promises that they brought to the Hunter in the 1999 election. Therefore, I am putting Mr Carr on notice and letting him know that the once loyal Labor voters of Newcastle and the Hunter are simply sick and tired of being seen as a sure thing in an election. Like a magician using smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of an elephant that can disappear and reappear as if by magic, the Carr government is employing similar tricks to make old election promises reappear and then disappear. Recently, Mr Carr went to Newcastle with another bag of tricks disguised as election policies. As a resident and representative, I can tell the Senate that the regional residents are tired of being taken for granted just because it is thought they live in a safe ALP seat.</para></talk.start><para>Today, I would like to especially commend the Hunter Business Chamber for exposing the confidence tricks of the Carr government in an objective, non-political piece of research. The business chamber, through its regional infrastructure committee, recently conducted an in-depth analysis of relative infrastructure spending, which compared the amount spent per capita in Sydney with that spent in the Hunter. In the last six years, the Carr government has allocated $390 million in capital works in the Hunter. In the same period, the Premier has miraculously allocated $11 billion to spend on infrastructure works in Sydney. To save senators from rushing to their calculators, I can confirm that, for every dollar spent in the Hunter by the Carr government, $2.50 is spent in Sydney. Mr Rob Monteath, chair of the Hunter Business Chamber infrastructure committee, commented:</para><quote><para>We get nowhere near the amount of per capita spending on things like hospitals, schools, TAFE and roads where the need per head of population should be the same regardless of where you are.</para></quote><para>Mr Monteath said that Western Sydney was often seen as the poor cousin of the northern and eastern suburbs, but even it received $2 compared to every $1 spent in the Hunter. Mr Monteath went on to say:</para><quote><para>It also has its own complete Ministry of Western Sydney as opposed to our representation, which is a Minister whose job is to assist the Premier, and then on Hunter development and not the region itself.</para></quote><para>The government treats the Hunter as safe Labor territory—meaning there is no need to spend money there to buy votes. Mr Monteath calculated the spending difference by identifying every capital works project in the state budget paper from 1996 to 2002. In that time, for example, Hunter schools received capital works of $55 million and Sydney received $1 billion. Sydney hospitals were allocated $2.5 billion compared with $70 million in the Hunter. Sydney roads were allocated $2.35 billion and Hunter roads were allocated $167 million. Mr Monteath said that the $2 billion spent on Sydney sporting facilities over that time made a mockery of Premier Bob Carr's offer of $23.6 million for the upgrading of Energy Australia Stadium. Even if he fully funds the stadium, the Hunter would be well behind. </para><para>The Carr government is a very Sydney-centric government with its eye comfortably off the ball when it comes to Newcastle and the Hunter. Recently, Mr Paul Murphy, President of the Hunter Business Chamber, pinned this down when he addressed the Newcastle Business Club in his annual address. Mr Murphy said:</para><quote><para>I do not dispute for a minute that Australia's largest city needs massive investment. What I dispute is that our needs here have not even been assessed against those in the metropolitan area, let alone the amount we are allocated.</para></quote><para>When he rolled into town recently, Mr Carr brought with him a list of promises aimed to appease the voters on their way to the polling station. In New South Wales, we have in Mr Carr a lacklustre Premier who believes he not only can dish out empty promises to the people of the Hunter but in fact can repeat the same empty promises that he made in the previous election. </para><para>There do not seem to be any state ALP MPs who are ready to push for the Hunter's fair share. John Price, John Mills, Bryce Gaudry, Milton Orkopoulos, John Bartlett, Jeff Hunter and Kerry Hickey have obviously been told, `You have a safe seat. Stop bothering us for money.' John Brogden, in a recent visit to the Hunter, commented that the gaggle of state ALP Hunter MPs are very timid in parliament. It is no wonder that the Hunter does not get its fair share from the state budget. Paul Murphy again commented:</para><quote><para>Last year I suggested that the working man in the Hunter might in fact think a change is due.</para></quote><para>I have some good examples of Bob Carr's smoke and mirror tricks. I want to deal with two major projects that have been promised for the Hunter and have just evaporated. The first one relates to a new steel mill. In April 2001 and again in October 2001, Mr Carr announced plans for the resumption of steel making in Newcastle with the announcement of the Austeel project for the city. It was reported that the entire steel production for the first 15 years of the giant new Austeel project had been presold for $40 billion. It was hoped that the site at Tomago, which would inject a projected $2.8 billion into the Hunter economy, would be operating by 2004—that is, next year. However, this was reliant on state government approval processes being completed by February 2002. It is now one year after that date and Mr Carr has, again, wheeled out this promise to the Hunter. He is dangling this carrot again before us. He came up and made a big announcement in front of all the media—this is the third time that he has announced this project. He hopes we have all forgotten the earlier announcements. The delay by the state government nearly cost Newcastle this $5 billion Austeel project once before. So forgive us, Mr Carr, if we do not give too much weight to your latest pledge. Paul Murphy commented to the business club:</para><quote><para>We know the Austeel project has been sitting on state government desks without any apparent progress. How long does this government think that investors are going to hang around? </para></quote><para>What else have we been promised that we have not received? In 1998, Mr Carr and the transport minister, Mr Scully, announced that a $1.2 billion high-speed rail link between Sydney and Newcastle would be in place by 2012. This promise was outlined in the government's `Action for transport plan' unveiled on 23 November, 1998, just four months before the 1999 election. The Newcastle to Sydney link was to act as a second stage to the Sydney to Warnervale link, which would be completed by 2007. How much progress has been made on the high-speed rail link to the Hunter? Despite funding allocation for planning studies, Mr Scully's office was insistent as late as last November that the state government remained committed to its `Action for transport plan' and subsequent time frames for the construction of the high-speed rail link.</para><para>Strangely, though, in December last year, again only months away from this state election, Treasurer Michael Egan released a `State infrastructure strategic plan' where the Sydney to Newcastle high-speed rail link was identified as nothing more than a feasibility study. When questioned on this, Mr Egan denied that the government had ever committed itself to anything other than a feasibility study. Well, Mr Egan, we remember what happened before the 1999 election. Again, we have more smoke and mirrors: the promise of high-speed rail by 2012 with the first stage completed by 2007? Mr Carr boldly stated that the project was fully funded back in 1998. This broken promise— yet another broken promise—should stand as a beneficial lesson to voters that promises made by the Carr government four weeks before an election are just another con.</para><para>How can Mr Carr and Mr Scully be so vehemently and publicly committed to this rail link and then find it so unnecessary just five years later? This makes Mr Carr's promise last Wednesday that more will be spent on community infrastructure an embarrassment to himself, his Treasurer, his transport minister and his entire government. Newcastle and the Hunter do not need policy announcements delivered to them for the sake of political mileage. Mr Carr cannot just reannounce old budget statements when he comes to town and expect us not to notice. </para><para>I have put a deliberate focus on Newcastle and the Hunter here today, but the government's failure in this area is far reaching— right across New South Wales. In a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, former Auditor-General of New South Wales Tony Harris has delivered a damning public indictment of eight years of Bob Carr's government. In an article headed `Carr still stuck in neutral', the former New South Wales Auditor-General indicates that the Carr government has deliberately been sitting on its hands. He writes:</para><quote><para>... Carr's political success has cost the NSW community ... policies requiring thought and effort are ignored.</para></quote><para>On revenue raising issues, Mr Harris reveals what a master of smoke and mirrors Bob Carr really is. He says:</para><quote><para>A formulaic approach has also been used for budgeting. </para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>... hidden reserves ... have allowed the Carr government to buy its way out of political problems as they arise ... </para></quote><para>On vision and initiative, there is little danger of New South Wales suffering from `reform fatigue' under Bob Carr, according to Tony Harris. He points out that where reforms are attempted, the Carr government retreats at the first sign of opposition. Tony Harris writes that his government has avoided difficult policies; it is the `unchallenging approach'. Bob Carr is certainly stuck in neutral when it comes to appropriate state government policies in New South Wales.</para><para>The Hunter Business Chamber study shows the extent to which Newcastle and the Hunter have been short-changed on the vital infrastructure needs for its rapidly changing economy. To Mr Carr we say that Newcastle and the Hunter can no longer be relied upon to deliver a swag of safe seats because we see through the smoke and mirrors and the same empty promises whenever you breeze into town just before an election.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hawke Labor Government: 20th Anniversary</title><page.no>9246</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>9246</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I noticed a gap in the speaking order and therefore decided that I would fill it because today is quite a momentous day.

Rarely have we agreed, but we have always managed to get on with one another.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Twenty years ago, Australia, under the Fraser government, was suffering from double-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation and negative economic growth. It had been a government in which the now Prime Minister John Howard was the Treasurer. It was a government that had divided Australia. Bob Hawke, in his election campaign, talked about bringing the nation back together again to unify Australia, to focus Australia on its economic goals and to give Australia a sense of common destiny and common purpose. He also talked eloquently about not only uniting Australia but also recognising the dignity and the standing of honest men and women in Australia who worked for a living and putting aside the rhetoric about division and union bashing that had characterised the Fraser government.</para><para>That Bob Hawke had been in parliament only for two years is quite an outstanding element of his sudden rise to the leadership. He was of course a well-known popular public figure due to his long period as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He was a new union leader in his era. He was a Rhodes scholar with a degree in economics from Oxford University who gave his time to work for the ACTU and cut a dash as a most outstanding advocate in national wage cases, arguing for wage justice for ordinary working Australians. </para><para>When he became President of the ACTU his most famous signature, when asked a silly question by a journalist, was to dismantle the question, prove how stupid it was, and then provide the question that should have been asked in the first place followed by a long and interesting reply, which then became the authoritative text on that subject. He was regarded as a bit of a larrikin. But he was also regarded as having a lot of intellectual capability, and he was a popular Australian. He was elected in place of Bill Hayden on the very day that the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser called on the Governor-General to issue the writs for a federal election.</para><para>Labor won that election in 1983 with a 26-seat majority. I am now the only one left from that election on the Labor side of the class of 1983. I wonder what I have done wrong. Everyone else has gone off to pursue other careers or just left the parliament—I am the sole survivor.

The National Party is a little more tenacious perhaps. Let me go back to the situation facing Australia at the election in 1983. There was double-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation, negative economic growth and a $6 billion deficit in the budget, as the then Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, later a National Party senator, would remind us. That was the situation facing the country. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The first act of the new Prime Minister, Mr R. J. L. Hawke, was to call a national economic summit and for the first time in the Old Parliament House to bring into the House of Representatives the captains of industry, the leaders of the union movement, the state premiers and all those from civil society that had a major role to play in committing to a common accord about rebuilding the Australian economy and rebuilding and re-imprinting the Australian ethos as we drew the nation together to tackle what were then insurmountable problems.</para><para>Out of that national economic summit came the accord and, as well, the prices and incomes policy approach resulting in a Prices Justification Tribunal commitment. The idea was to trade off wage claims against tax cuts so that the real income of workers remained the same or rose, and to deliver to families Medicare and other services so that the disposable income in their pockets rose as they paid less for health and had greater access to the health scheme and as they paid less for other services.</para><para>We often hear in this chamber from members of the now government that real wages under Labor fell, and that as a statistical fact is true. But the real incomes to families rose because the social wage that was delivered to households ameliorated the cost of lower wage growth and the tax cuts delivered also improved purchasing power. So the relative position of ordinary Australian wage and salary earners increased. We knew that before the Hawke government was elected. We were used to wage claims that were large in dollar value terms but were cut down in taxation as soon as they were awarded. We knew that their value was eroded significantly as well as you paid higher prices for access to health and higher prices for a range of other services in the community. </para><para>That is what the Prices and Incomes Accord delivered. It was a revolution in the approach to managing the economy of this country. It resulted eventually in lowering inflation. It resulted too in increasing employment and, because a fiscally strong and disciplined ERC in the cabinet of the day presided over the budget, finally the budget was returned to surplus and remained in surplus until the recession that hit in 1991. Appropriately, at that time—as we are now hearing from Mr Costello, given the global recession at the present time—there was pump-priming expenditure to lift aggregate demand in the Australian economy so that the economy could be encouraged to shelter from the worst elements of the recession. </para><para>These were groundbreaking and significant achievements. On a number of occasions the Australian Council of Trade Unions traded off a wage increase for a tax cut. On one famous occasion—the year, I think, was 1984—the Australian Council of Trade Unions traded off a wage increase for the introduction of Medicare, the first universal free health service delivered for Australians. Over subsequent elections there were many efforts by conservative oppositions to try to dismantle Medicare. The history of the Australian electoral cycle is that to tamper with Medicare is to lose government. No conservative effort to dismantle Medicare was ever rewarded with a popular vote. So when John Howard came to office in 1996, after many years of trying to undermine, destroy or reduce Medicare, he just promised to keep it. Medicare is a Labor achievement that now endures even though now this government wants to destroy the health system. </para><para>One of the other great economic reforms of the Hawke era that needs to be recalled— and is vividly presented in the many magazine and newspaper articles that are doing a retrospective on the Hawke years—is the government's commitment to reducing tariff protection in Australia. Back in 1983 we were a highly protected economy. There was an interest on both sides of politics in keeping that protection in place. If you recall the Holden motor car in 1983, you will remember it was overpriced and underquality and did not run all that well. The result of protection from global competition was that we had a soft economy that did not produce the quality of goods at the price needed to compete on the international market.</para><para>The Hawke government, with the cooperation of many significant employer groups and the trade unions, started to wind back the level of tariff protection at a slow pace but in a manner that enabled Australian business gradually and increasingly to be exposed to international competition—not in a way that would wipe them out but in a way that that exposure to international competition would make them more competitive and stronger. Eventually, when tariffs for all industries fell to about five per cent—with the notable exceptions of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and the automotive industry—we had a reborn, internationally competitive Australian industry sector. This was done with some cost because, when the old rewarding jobs for the labour-intensive industries fell away, people came out of employment and needed to be retrained or relocated to take up the new jobs in a growing economy. Some people do not like change; there was a backlash about the reform.</para><para>What now underpins the strength of the Australian economy, what gave resilience to our economic performance in 1997 when the Asian currency crisis hit and what gives resilience now when there is a global downturn are those fundamental structural changes to the economy. We have a more vibrant economy because of those benchmark changes of the Hawke era. It should always be recalled that that is the truth of the matter. Academic, industry and business economists all say so. Of course, the economic cycle does not always perfectly attune itself to the political cycle. So the beneficiaries of this structural change, pioneered by the Hawke and later the Keating administrations, are the current government. They boast that these economic strengths are theirs. Well, there is precious little that this government has ever done to structurally and fundamentally reform the economy, but they have managed to surf along on the back of Hawke-Keating gains, claiming them to be their own and pretending that they are the responsible government. That is not true. You can consult just about any economist in Australia who will tell you that that is the case. In the retrospectives that we are now seeing in the press of what was achieved in the Hawke-Keating era, that is a point that is strongly made.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Sandy Macdonald—if I can acknowledge you in the chair as an honourable and distinguished senator representing the National Party—you will be aware that one of the other great fundamental changes that the Hawke-Keating era spawned, led in this case by the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, was the introduction of Landcare. I happen to know about this because I was the resources minister who had the privilege of introducing that scheme. It has been honoured, because it has been continued by this conservative government and it continues today. </para><para>I am out of time. There are many other things that deserve to be mentioned. I conclude on this fundamental point: Australia, under Hawke and Keating, became a country that is a citizen of this region. We were opened to the world. We forged closer relations with Asia. We established APEC. We led in international trade negotiations by pursuing reform through the Cairns Group, which we helped establish—the Minister for Trade at the time, John Dawkins, formed that. There were a number of fundamental changes which changed the complexion of Australia. Multiculturalism was a good word to use during the Hawke-Keating period and it should remain a good word to use today.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.49 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>9249</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Subcontractors</title><page.no>9249</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>9249</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to Senator Coonan, Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue.

I am happy to give an update on the state of our economy based on the release of the national accounts today, which are a further demonstration of the inherent strength of the Australian economy. GDP in the December quarter grew by 0.4 per cent. Over the year to December, GDP grew by three per cent, second only to Canada among the leading 15 countries in the world. More significantly, the non-farm economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the quarter. That is 3.9 per cent for the calendar year 02, clearly reflecting the underlying strength in the economy. Allowing for the drought, which is a one-in-100-year drought, and the weakness caused by global uncertainty, then clearly, based on these national account figures, our economy is in very good shape. They are consistent with our MYEFO forecasts of growth of three per cent this financial year and four per cent in the ensuing financial year.</para></talk.start><para>This week we have had the very good report from the OECD on the strength of our economy and its performance under our policies. We have also had the restoration, after about 15 years, of our AAA rating by Standard and Poor's, showing the strength of our economy. From the national accounts, we see very significantly business investment rising by 19 per cent in the calendar year 2002. That is a fantastic outcome and points to how solid growth is out into the future. We have the ACCI Westpac survey of industrial trends also showing very strong expectations for our manufacturing sector. More importantly, our automotive industry, our strongest manufacturing sector, had a record performance in January. It was its best ever January, with 61,000 vehicles sold. This came on the back of the best ever year for the industry in 2002. I think all this good economic news is a very good sign of the strength of our responsible economic management over seven years.</para><para>I am very happy to acknowledge today, on the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke Labor government, that some of the very sensible things that government did during its period in office have made a big contribution to the strength of our economy. There is no doubt that some of the reforms— which were opposed, no doubt, by the Left of the Labor Party—championed by Bob Hawke, such as tariff reform, financial deregulation and floating the dollar, were all very important in producing the outcomes we have had. I think the tragedy for Australia is that the ALP in opposition has completely turned its back on economic reform. It has trashed the very good position that Hawke and Keating adopted in the 1980s in relation to economic reform despite the opposition of their own Left. The ALP in opposition, since 1996, has opposed virtually every single economic reform that we have put forward to the Australian people. Paul Keating himself condemned the Labor opposition only last week when he said: </para><quote><para>More's the pity that the Labor Party between 1996 and certainly 2000 vacated the field of competition and productivity.</para></quote><para>I endorse entirely what Mr Keating said. The point is that it is now 2003 and the Labor opposition is still vacating the field of economic reform. I want to assure the Australian people that, despite the continued opposition from the Labor Party to further economic reform, we will stick to the task. Economic reform is an ongoing task. It must never stop if we are to ensure that we continue to build one of the world's great economies.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>9251</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>9251</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing.

Senator Crossin, you most probably will never get the chance to be in the situation where you have to do that sort of thing. That is the most dangerous question: will you rule in or rule out something. You say, `I am not going to play your game,' and they say, `Well, you are not ruling it out.' I said, `I do not know how you would means test.' Although I totally disagree with the article that Professor Duckett has in the paper today, he says that he does not know how you would means test because people move in and out. I cannot exactly find where he says it, but he indicates that it would be difficult to means test access to bulk-billing because people move in and out. That is exactly what I said. I said, `I do not know how you would do that,' meaning that I was not even contemplating it.

I have not indicated any figure to anybody and, as I said, what I want to do is work on a package to make sure that we have reasonable and fair access to doctors. As I have mentioned over and over again, when we came into government we had a total maldistribution of general practitioners. There were far too many in the city and far too few in the country and outer metropolitan areas. We have spent $562 million getting doctors out into rural areas. In the last five years we have had an 11 per cent increase in full-time equivalent doctors, more in terms of doctors on the ground. That is the first time we have seen a turnaround in getting doctors back out into rural areas.  </para><para>Some of the measures we have put in place such as rural bonded scholarships will take time to wash through because the students are still at university. To try and undo the damage Labor left, especially in work force issues, takes ages. The work force and access to doctors are some of the issues that affect access to bulk-billing. Where there are more doctors it is more likely that people will be bulk-billed. I also have indicated that, since the inception of Medicare, there has never been 100 per cent bulk-billing. Even Professor Deeble, the father of Medicare, yesterday agreed with the Prime Minister that no government could guarantee to make bulk-billing 100 per cent universal. He said, `We cannot make doctors charge a certain fee and whatever rebate you gave patients there would be some doctors who would not direct bill people.' So even the architect of Medicare, Professor Deeble, has indicated that you would never be able to achieve a 100 per cent rate of people being directly billed; that is, not having an out-of-pocket expense. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9252</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

He has been a keen advocate of the ongoing structural and taxation reforms that the government has implemented since coming to office. I know that he is committed to ongoing tax reform. Senators on this side of the chamber would be well aware of yesterday's glowing endorsement from the OECD of the resilience of Australia's economy and the Howard government's policies that have delivered that outcome. As Senator Hill pointed out yesterday, the OECD have quite rightly indicated that the pursuit of structural reforms across a broad front has been a key factor in sustaining Australia's economic performance. These reforms, combined with our exceptional macro-economic management, have made Australia a truly standout performer amongst OECD economies. </para></talk.start><para>While the success of the Howard government's economic reforms no doubt irks the opposition, it is a fact that most Australians and external observers both appreciate and understand it. The recent OECD report made it quite clear that, on the taxation front, the government has implemented an impressive and comprehensive overhaul of the tax system in recent years. It made the point that the government's reforms to indirect tax have not only helped broaden the tax base, and thus provide a secure and buoyant source of revenue for the states, but also improved the efficiency of the tax system.</para><para>The OECD report notes that these reforms have also delivered a fall in the price of most investment goods and services faced by business due to the removal of the cost of business inputs embedded in the previous wholesale sales tax system. As senators would know, this has removed a huge embedded tax burden on all businesses, particularly so for our exporters. This is important, given the impacts of the drought, the tough trading conditions and the weak external demand faced by our farmers and other exporters.</para><para>I have been asked about alternative policies. It is bizarre that the Labor Party argued up hill and down dale, right up to the last election, about the alleged flaws in these tax reforms and how they would damage our economy. But the outstanding performance of the economy since the introduction of tax reform and the recent assessment from the OECD simply shows how utterly wrong Labor were to oppose tax reform and how politically opportunistic their behaviour has been.</para><para>The OECD report also points to the ongoing tax reforms and, in particular, the major review of the international tax system. It points out that this provides an opportunity to assess the impact of our current international tax arrangements on the expansion plans of Australian companies offshore and whether there are impedients to the attraction of domestic and foreign equity. We can only hope that, in the interests of a competitive tax system, when these issues eventually come before the Senate, instead of wrongly banging on about the big end of town the Labor Party will adopt a more constructive approach in the interests of all Australians.</para><para>Australians should not have their future prosperity and success continually hijacked by a lazy and opportunistic opposition that have not had a tax policy of their own since 1993. The OECD report should act as a wake-up call for Labor, and Labor should stop blocking important budget reforms. If the OECD report concludes that the PBS and disability reforms are necessary and desirable changes, surely the opposition should be listening. These changes are far too important for petty political gains; Australians need responsible action from the opposition, and they need it now.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Children's Accounts</title><page.no>9253</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>9253</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan.

It is an absolute disgrace when the Labor Party simply obfuscates and tries to invent reasons as to why choice—which will enable people to move funds so that they are not trapped in a poorly performing fund— should not be implemented.

Before I get to the issue of Qantas, in relation to credit card reforms generally it is important to say that this is, of course, just the first stage of the credit card reforms. On 1 January this year the restriction on merchants charging consumers for using credit cards was lifted. This is the first element of the reforms. The restriction on surcharging has inhibited the normal market mechanisms from operating. Consumers who do not use credit cards have been paying more and those who use credit cards have been paying less than they otherwise would have been. Price signals about the costs of different payment instruments have been distorted, to the detriment of the economy as a whole. Generally, business has chosen not to surcharge. Customers are aware of surcharging and are prepared to consider payment methods other than credit cards and, generally, to shop around to different providers. </para></talk.start><para>In the case of Qantas, the government would certainly not be sympathetic to the airline, particularly when there are routes on which there is little competition. The reforms have only been in place for a short time, and we need to see how they settle down. To enable monitoring of the implementation of the standard, the RBA is keeping a close eye on the situation and collecting data from financial institutions. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the ACCC are, as I said yesterday, maintaining a watching brief on surcharging developments. ASIC is monitoring merchants to ensure that where surcharging occurs there is appropriate disclosure, and the ACCC will ensure that there is no anticompetitive behaviour between merchants in setting the surcharge levels.</para><para>The answer to Senator Cook's question is that, because this is only the very first stage of comprehensive reform in relation to the provision of credit by way of credit card, it is being monitored in the ways I have indicated. I might add that, with the ACCC being one of the monitors, this government would be mightily pleased if those on the other side would use whatever influence they can bring to bear on their Labor mates in the states who are opposing the appointment of Graeme Samuel, as the ACCC clearly needs an outstanding chairman.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9257</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question now that the minister has danced around the point and not quite answered the first question.

Therefore, if they choose not to be vaccinated, Defence Force commanders will not allow them to be put at risk from that particular threat. In relation to how many have refused the vaccination, I do not have an up-to-date figure on that—I will make inquiries. I am also not sure whether all of those who have declined to be vaccinated have returned to Australia or are in the process of returning or will return—or are being replaced or will be replaced by others.

I know all senators will be very happy, as I am, with the recent rains. It is a little early to say that the drought is over, but certainly recent rains have been very well received. If we do have some follow-up rain, the winter crop planting season will make the outlook very much brighter for farmers in 2003-04—brighter both emotionally and financially. According to figures that have been released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics at their Outlook Conference—which, as all senators will know, is happening over these two days in Canberra—farmers are poised for a $4 billion crop led recovery. ABARE's predictions for 2003-04 show a dramatic increase in the fortunes of the rural sector, provided that there is a good autumn break in the drought. According to Dr Brian Fisher, the Executive Director of ABARE, the net value of farm production should nearly triple to $6.1 billion in the next financial year and that is in very stark contrast to the $2.3 billion plunge in the current financial year. The recovery will come from increased crop plantings. Plantings should increase by about 12 per cent on last season to a record of 20.5 tonnes. Whilst the increase will come from crop plantings, livestock industries are expected to take a little longer to recover following the drought.</para></talk.start><para>The government has continually pledged its support for those in the rural sector affected by the drought. Part of this ongoing commitment includes the income and business support components of the exceptional circumstances assistance. These will be available—it is important for senators and the community to understand this—for two years following the declaration of exceptional circumstances. So even if rains come, that assistance will be available for another two years.</para><para>Since September last year, the Commonwealth has moved to introduce a number of new initiatives to the exceptional circumstances policy, particularly to those parts of the policy over which the Commonwealth really has had no control. We are providing immediate income support once the EC application is referred to ENRAC, we are using predictive modelling, we have waived the 12-month minimum deposit period, and the time taken by the Commonwealth department to determine EC applications has been halved.</para><para>However, one of the key problems with the exceptional circumstances assistance is the very recalcitrant attitude taken by all of the states to EC applications. It is a very unfortunate situation that the system at the moment is such that the states are responsible for making the application. Some of them do it with little care or responsibility and use it for political purposes—putting in the application, knowing that someone else will have to foot the bill. Mr Truss has announced the very sensible approach where, when this drought is out of the way, he will be calling a national summit of all of the industry leaders and the states to get a better approach to the exceptional circumstances assistance.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Family Payments</title><page.no>9259</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>9259</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services.

One of them is the number of doctors and where they are located—I have said this most probably five times in the last two sitting weeks. Where you have a higher number of doctors, you get a high bulk-billing rate—sometimes up around 90 per cent—and where you have fewer doctors you get a lower bulk-billing rate. Competition is one of the things that drives up bulk-billing rates. When Labor were in government in their last six years, they increased the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation by only nine per cent over that period. Over the last six years we have increased it for a short consultation by 20 per cent. For a long consultation, we have increased the rebate by 23 per cent; Labor in their last six years increased it by only five per cent. All these things affect bulk-billing. We also now have payments for doctors—it works out at about $18,000 per doctor—for dealing with issues like diabetes, mental health and asthma to achieve better outcomes. Unlike Labor, who had our children being vaccinated at the rate of 53 per cent— which was down around Third World levels—we actually put incentives in and gave doctors assistance to get that rate up. We now have it up at First World levels.</para></talk.start><para>Medicare came in, and I have a paper here from a speech that Dr Blewett made on 26 August 1983 to none other than the Doctors Reform Society. He said, `On 1 February next year, all Australian residents will be guaranteed automatic entitlement under a single public fund to a medical and optometrical benefit of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee.' Do you know what it is now? It is 85 per cent of the scheduled fee. Do you know what it will be tomorrow, at the end of this year and next year? It will be 85 per cent of the scheduled fee.</para><para>Despite the myths that are being put around, all Australians will have access to a doctor and a doctor can direct bill a person. If they charge 85 per cent of the scheduled fee, a person will have no payment to make. That is the case now and that will be the case in the future. We cannot tell doctors what to charge. Some of them—92 per cent of them in some cases—in some areas do not charge an additional gap and in other areas they do. One of the things that concerns me—and it does not seem to be a concern for anybody on the other side—is that, since the inception of Medicare, there have been some people who live in areas where they do not have access to a doctor who direct bills and does not charge them an out-of-pocket expense. </para><para>So we have people on the same income living in different areas and some pay an out-of-pocket expense and some do not. That is of concern to me, especially if they are low-income earners. It is not about how much gap or whatever. There has always been a gap. Some doctors charge a significantly larger gap and some charge none. But there is an issue about the fact that we should have equitable access. We have spent $562 million getting doctors into rural areas, and we have seen an 11 per cent increase in the number of full-time equivalent doctors in rural areas. We have a program to get doctors into outer metropolitan areas without detracting and taking away from the incentives in the other areas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9261</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

What is universal is that every Australian gets the same rebate to visit a general practitioner. Every patient gets the same rebate. That is the universality. The issue is that some people on low incomes live in an area where doctors charge a gap and some people on low incomes live in an area where doctors do not. One gets a gap and one does not. That is of concern to me. I have not heard anybody express that concern. It has been ever thus since the inception of Medicare.

It is a very simple question, to which we have received no answer. One of the minister's defences is that she cannot find out. That is simply not correct, because the regulatory requirements for children's superannuation accounts introduced by this government and this minister do stipulate that there have to be special application forms and clear identification of children's accounts within a superannuation fund in order for them to be opened. Given the regulatory requirements, all the minister has to do is ask how many of these accounts have been opened. But the minister is too embarrassed to ask, because, at least as of yesterday, the Labor opposition has been informed that no children's superannuation accounts had been opened.</para><para>I must inform the Senate that today I have had contact and we now know that one children's superannuation account has been opened—one. This is an important issue, because children's superannuation accounts are the latest in a long line of failures in respect of the Liberal government's approach to retirement incomes policy and superannuation—a failure to protect consumers from entry and exit fees and high fees and commissions; a failure to compensate victims, where a theft and fraud has occurred, with 100 per cent compensation; a failure to protect the superannuation entitlements of those workers whose employers go bankrupt; and, most of all, a failure to come up with anything that will seriously address the problem of the lack of adequacy of retirement incomes that faces many Australians. We know that the real policy of the Liberal Party is to force Australians to work until the age of 70—to work until they drop.</para><para>This policy of children's superannuation accounts was announced by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on 5 November 2001—the date of the Liberal Party's superannuation policy launch. When he launched the children's superannuation accounts package, he said it `trail blazes ... in the area of superannuation for children' and that `the wonders of compound interest' on contributions made on behalf of young people would `yield considerable returns' and produce `a strong savings and investment culture'. The Prime Minister of Australia was arguing that children's superannuation accounts were one of the great magic fixes to retirement incomes.</para><para>The Prime Minister said at that time that $42 million was being set aside to provide for the cost to revenue of these superannuation accounts. That $42 million prior to the election was approximately 447,000 children's accounts—almost half a million children's accounts were budgeted for in the Liberal Party's election promises. But by June last year, just before the legislation was passed in the budget, the Liberal government had scaled down from $42 million to $3 million the moneys allocated to children's superannuation accounts. Treasury informed us that this $3 million was to fund 47,000—not half a million but 47,000—children's superannuation accounts.</para><para>Given the Prime Minister's boast at election time that children's superannuation accounts were one of the great fixes to retirement incomes and a trailblazer in the area of superannuation, and his talk of `the wonders of compound interest', the Labor Party is quite interested to know how many Australians have actually taken up children's superannuation accounts.

Yes, it is true: it is necessary for the super funds to monitor superannuation accounts. They must monitor these superannuation accounts and the level of contributions to ensure that the limit of $3,000 over three years is not exceeded.</para><para>Less than 12 months have passed, and Senator Sherry is alleging that not one account has been opened. I doubt that he has rung up every superannuation fund, so the authenticity of his claims is suspect, to say the least. In time the funds themselves will provide this information. True, we might get some statistical information after a 12-month period—but the honourable senator is preoccupied with figures after nine months. I think he should have better things to do and better questions to ask than those he is asking at present.</para><para>The important thing about this great initiative is that contributions are going to be treated as undeducted contributions. They are not deductible. It would be inappropriate for these contributions to be taxed in the hands of the superannuation provider; however, the exclusion of the tax does not extend to non-complying funds. The Prime Minister was right: the magic of compound interest is very important over a 30- to 40-year period—there is no doubt about it. So this is a great initiative to get more people into superannuation and to increase national savings.</para><para>I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Stan Wallis on returning his $1.6 million in retirement benefits. He has set a fine example, because there is a perception that under the circumstances the payment is unwarranted. To a lot of people in the community superannuation appears to be a gravy train, which is unfortunate. It is up to the superannuation industry to tidy up its act. And it is up to Senator Sherry to tidy up his act and get a bit more relevance into the issues that he believes are important in relation to superannuation rather than create fictions and present inaccuracies to the Senate. It is not good enough on his part.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>9263</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Watson's time should be extended.

One of the great reforms in this country, which was introduced by the Hawke government, was the reform of superannuation. Those people opposite opposed it, did not support it and, when they got the opportunity, tried to vote it down. We remember well the words of Alexander Downer when in 1985 he described compulsory superannuation in Australia as—and I laugh when I say this—being a threat to the capitalist system; he said that he would remove compulsory superannuation.</para><para>We know that compulsory superannuation does three very important things for the Australian economy: it enables Australians to prepare for their own retirement, it enables the level of national savings to be increased and it creates a pool of investment capital to buy back the farm, to enable Australians to invest in Australian industry. That was one of the great Labor reforms. Before we came along, superannuation was the preserve of the rich and of the Public Service. Only 40 per cent of Australians had it; now 90 per cent do. What did this government do when they came to office? They wanted to abolish superannuation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Abolish superannuation?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Yes, you did. You legislated out the three per cent copayment that Labor had on the books, so the superannuation copayment never went to 15 per cent but remained stuck at 12 per cent. As a consequence, the effect of the measure is far less now than it could have been. The security that Australians could have looked forward to in their retirement will be less as a consequence. That is your contribution—fiddling with the scheme, coming up with stunts, pretending to make the scheme more efficient but all the time trying to undermine it. This is one of the great reforms; you did not like it, you continue to try to undermine it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I cannot blame Senator Coonan for all of this; her predecessor—the serial incompetent, Senator Kemp—was one of those who tried to do these things too. Senator Coonan today used that favourite Liberal word `choice'. I say to Australians: when you hear a Liberal talk about choice, watch out, because when they talk about choice they are going to take from you a right that you have. What are Senator Coonan and this government party up to on this new usage of the word `choice' with respect to superannuation? We know that on 7 August last year the Treasurer said—and this is the way they get you:</para><quote><para>More flexible working arrangements, training and re-training, and raising the preservation age for superannuation would all be positive moves ...</para></quote><para>That jargon—that raising the preservation age for superannuation would be a positive move—makes that sound like something positively virtuous. What does it actually mean? What it means is that the age at which people can access their superannuation savings is now 55, and the government proposal is to raise the preservation age so that you cannot access your superannuation savings until you hit the age of 70. We know that the government wants people to work longer, and there is some virtue in that proposition. But to coerce them into working longer by denying them access to their superannuation entitlements by lifting the preservation age from 55 to 70 is not choice. How can Senator Coonan sit there and pretend to lecture us about choice when she is trying to introduce a coercive measure that lifts the preservation age from 55 to 70 and denies Australians access to their hard-won superannuation entitlements, and thus a more comfortable retirement? That is not choice; that is blackmail. That is not choice; that is coercion. That is not choice or freedom. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>9264</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As Senator Cook rightly said, today is the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke-Keating government. In press commentary today and this week we have heard much of the reforms that were undertaken by the Hawke and Keating governments, and we on this side of the chamber give credit where it is due to those reforms. But we ought also today, when we consider that anniversary, consider the lost opportunities of that period.</para></talk.start><para>Two great areas of lost opportunity stand out from the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments when it comes to the economy. The first—a battle that we are still fighting today—was the lost opportunity to reform the labour market. The labour market remained unreformed through the deregulation of financial markets, the floating of the Australian dollar, the freeing up of the Australian economy that we saw, which was driven particularly in the early days of the Hawke government. The most needed reform of the lot—the reform of the labour market— was serially neglected by the Hawke and Keating governments. Australians are paying for it to this day. Still in this chamber we struggle week by week and month by month to get reforms of the labour market through against the blockage of the Labor opposition—who are tied to the trade unions—and the minor parties. That was the first, and probably the greatest, lost opportunity of the Hawke and Keating years.</para><para>The second was the lost opportunity to develop a comprehensive, national savings strategy. Senator Cook referred to the changes to the superannuation policies that were introduced during the period of the Hawke government. But those policies failed to make the link between superannuation and a comprehensive, lifetime savings strategy. We had to wait for the election of the Howard government before we had a government which laid on the table a comprehensive, lifetime savings strategy for Australian families. An important part of that strategy, a keystone of that strategy, was the `superannuation for life' document. In particular, that document did two things. Firstly, it enabled superannuation savings to be made from the time of childhood onwards. So, as Senator Watson—a person who, I pause to say, is respected by all senators in this place as the Australian parliament's most learned authority on superannuation policy—said, parents, grandparents, relatives and friends can now contribute up to $3,000 every three years on behalf of a child from its infancy, from the beginning of childhood. That makes the link between superannuation and lifetime savings. </para><para>Secondly, it breaks the nexus between superannuation and employment. We in the government do not believe that the only mode of delivering superannuation investment ought to be through the employment nexus. That is why we have facilitated the contribution from childhood onwards to a lifetime of savings. When you break the employment nexus so that superannuation is not exclusively a function of employment, you also give people choice.</para><para>Senator Cook used the word `choice' about 20 times in his harangue, but he failed to mention that to this day the Labor Party remains wedded to a superannuation model based around industry superannuation that denies the superannuation policyholder choice. Under the Liberal Party's superannuation for life policy, the investor is free to go to any superannuation fund of their choosing and not be locked into an industry fund. You know, Mr Deputy President, that the industry funds, generally speaking, have been the poorest performing of the Australian superannuation funds in the recent past. Under Labor policy, people are locked into industry funds that are, funnily enough, by and large controlled by trade union trustees. We are proud of our superannuation policy, because it links the concept of superannuation with the more important and wider concept of lifetime savings and because it instates the core liberal value of choice at the heart of our policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>9265</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We saw again today a repeat of yesterday's performance by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer when she was asked yet again to disclose to the Senate the number of Australians who have taken up this so-called great reform that gives one the ability to open superannuation accounts on behalf of one's children. The question was asked some four times—twice yesterday and twice today—but the minister has refused to provide any information to the Senate about the numbers of accounts that have been opened in this category. It does seem strange that this initiative, which the Prime Minister has described as trailblazing, is something that the minister is so reticent to talk about. It is a reform that Senator Coonan herself said that she would do all that she could to talk about, but that does not appear to extend to providing answers to the Senate in question time about the numbers of Australians who have taken up this initiative. This trailblazing initiative, this trailblazing reform, trumpeted by the government as being one of the answers to the complex issue of ensuring that Australians do have lifetime savings and do have a plan for their retirement, has really been nothing more than a flop. Unless the minister can provide us with an indication that there has been an enormous take-up of this reform, we say that so far it has been nothing less than a spectacular failure.</para></talk.start><para>There are many reasons you could pose for the failure of Australians to take up the option of a children's superannuation account. The first is an obvious tax incentive issue: there is little tax incentive as contributions have to be made with after-tax income. But the second and probably more important matter at this point is that people are, and continue to be, justly concerned that fees and charges will continue to eat into the savings that they make for their children and may well leave the children upon their retirement age with very little. It is this second barrier of fees and charges that highlights the Liberal government's failure to deal properly with the issue of fees and charges. This failure continues despite the fact that a number of reports recently have highlighted—as if it did not already need to be highlighted—the importance of dealing with unreasonable fees and charges in this industry. </para><para>Only recently—last month, I think—a report was released by the nation's prudential regulator, APRA, which was a pretty strong indictment of some aspects of the superannuation industry and the fees they charge. Despite the fact that those on the other side trumpet this issue of choice and argue that it does not matter that some funds charge exorbitant fees—fees that are manifestly beyond what the market rate should really be—because they are well performing, this fallacy has been destroyed by the APRA report. The APRA report quite clearly said that there appears to be no relationship between high administration costs and high returns. So there goes that fallacy that has been articulated on the other side: `It is okay, we don't have to regulate, we don't have to protect consumers and their retirement savings because, if the funds are charging more, they are getting higher returns.'</para><para>APRA has indicated that that is simply not the case. Despite that, you still hear from the other side this view that the big end of town is allowed to charge whatever fees it wants in relation to people's superannuation accounts. The government says that they do not need to be regulated and that they will just be returned in the returns to the superannuation account, despite the fact that APRA has indicated that is not the case.</para><para>A one per cent fee, which is a not unusual fee in the retail sector, does not sound like a lot, but over a lifetime that can translate to over $100,000. Australians should know that this government is basically saying to a certain aspect of the industry, `We don't mind if you charge up to $100,000 to manage this person's account. We don't care if that unreasonably eats into their retirement income. We're not going to regulate it; we're going to let the market determine what will occur.' This government has refused to address the issue of fees and charges, and that is a critical issue if we are to have a proper savings plan, if we are actually going to make national superannuation work. Instead, the government will leave it to the market and benefit a particular end of town. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>9266</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>9266</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today relating to military action against Iraq.</para></motion><para>It was a very straightforward question and for a moment, when I heard the minister's answer to a question which he gave yesterday, I thought that perhaps there was some faint hope in the position of this government, and then today I saw exactly the same words coming out of the Prime Minister's mouth. Those words were that the government and the cabinet would not make a decision on Australian involvement in military action in Iraq `until the United Nations resolves its position'. The fact that exactly the same phrase was used by Minister Hill and the Prime Minister might lead one to suggest that perhaps this was a clearly decided line of the government's.</para><para>But, as the minister's answer today made clear, if it was a deliberate line of the government's it was one deliberately designed once again to deceive the Australian people. As Minister Hill made clear in his answer, if the United Nations does not resolve its position in the near future or in a way that is satisfactory for the United States, that will not be relevant to the consideration that the government gives. As the minister said today, we will then just move to the next phase.</para><para>So the minister's answer yesterday and the Prime Minister's statements to the Australian people are completely misleading. The government is not going to wait until the United Nations resolves its position; quite clearly, it is going to wait until the United States decides whether or not it is willing to continue working through the United Nations or whether it is going to withdraw its resolution or ignore the Security Council altogether and go ahead regardless. That is completely different to the statements that the Prime Minister and Minister Hill have made and, again, it is yet another in the great long litany of examples of where the government has completely misled the Australian people by not providing the truth and the facts about what this government has decided to do.  </para><para>In the same way as this suggestion that the government are waiting until the United Nations resolves its position is clearly not correct, as the minister's own answer today shows, similarly the suggestion that the minister also made today that they will wait until that stage to decide whether or not to support any military action once the United States initiates it is clearly not correct. Everyone in the country knows what the answer to that question will be. As soon as the United States decides to go to war the Australian government and the Australian cabinet will make that decision to join in that war, regardless of the United Nations' position or even whether it has resolved a clear position.</para><para>That is totally unsatisfactory to the majority of Australian people and, indeed, the majority of people around the world—although, as was pointed out separately in question time today, at least in some of those nations, like the United States, the UK, France and indeed Spain, as I read today, the parliaments have had a chance to actually vote on whether to ratify going to war. Of course, Australia—the Australian people and the Australian parliament—is once again being denied that opportunity and will once again be denied that opportunity. It is worth noting that if statements by US officials are correct—and there is no reason to doubt them—it is quite possible that the end of next week will be the final deadline. So this sitting week—today and tomorrow—is the final opportunity for parliamentary examination of any of the issues involved, and it is an opportunity that once again the government is clearly going to ensure is not utilised.</para><para>I should mention also the fact that the minister knew nothing about when the proposed Gulf War veterans' health study will be released. This is simply a disgrace. It is 12 years after the last Gulf War and we have still not examined and released publicly the health impacts on the last generation of Australians that were sent to that war, just as we are about to create a new bunch of veterans. The government have had this report for ages now; they are sitting on it. It was initiated back in the middle of 2000 and it was meant to take six months, yet here we are nearly three years later with still no sign of a report. It is completely unacceptable and everybody, particularly the veterans and those defence personnel who are in the Persian Gulf at the moment, would have to wonder what it is that the government is trying to hide in relation to the real health impacts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>9267</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection of Bills Committee</title><page.no>9267</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>9267</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>9267</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the second report of 2003 of the Selection of Bills Committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to have the report incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The report read as follows</inline>—</para><para>SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE</para><para>REPORT NO. 2 OF 2003</para><para>1.

I note that the Labor Shadow Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Mr Kelvin Thomson introduced this bill into the House of Representatives on the 10th February 2003. </para><para>The intent of this legislation, is to once and for all protect the Great Barrier Reef from oil prospecting and, ultimately, oil drilling. Extending the boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef Region to include all waters east of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area to the boundary of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) will achieve this. These are areas currently under threat from oil exploration and drilling. TGS-NOPEC, a multi national oil exploration company is seeking approval to undertake seismic testing in the Townsville Trough, only 50 km from the boundary of the Marine Park.</para><para>It is important to note that under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, the Great Barrier Reef Region and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area exist as separate entities. It should also be noted that mining, and petroleum drilling are not permitted in any part of the Great Barrier Reef Region, under the Great Barrier Reef Region (Prohibition of Mining) Regulations 1999. The extension of the Great Barrier Reef Region boundary will therefore protect the whole area from oil exploration and drilling. It is extremely important to note that the adoption of this legislation will have no other effect than ruling out oil prospecting and, subsequently, drilling—no effect on any fishing, commercial or recreational interests, and no effect on visitation, whether it be private or through tourist operators. </para><para>Labor took a policy to the last Federal election that would have effectively ruled out oil drilling and exploration under the current TGS-NOPEC application. This private senator's bill gives effect to that commitment. This legislation will rule out threats to the Great Barrier Reef from all off shore mining forever. </para><para>It is particularly pleasing, then, to be supporting this legislation, given the government's lack of desire to protect the Great Barrier Reef. We have been calling for the government to think laterally, to think differently and to try a little harder to develop a method to protect the reef from oil drilling. The Environment Minister, Dr Kemp and his predecessors however have done everything possible to avoid taking action to protect the reef from oil exploration and exploitation. Can I suggest to the Minister, Dr Kemp that this is his chance? This is his real chance to do something to outlaw oil drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef.  </para><para>It is clear that oil drilling is precluded within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This legislation deals with the area between the eastern boundary of the marine park and the Exclusive Economic Zone, and that point needs to be made clear. That is where enormous prospectivity exists, and that is where damage could occur to the reef unless something is done to manage it. As I said before, Dr Kemp can legally make a decision to prevent exploration in the Townsville Trough region, which is in that area between the eastern boundary and the EEZ. He can support this legislation in the House of Representatives and then we will have ruled out oil prospecting and drilling, and protected the reef, I believe, for all time. </para><para>Labor has consistently opposed oil prospecting and drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef. We have pursued the issue consistently since TGS-NOPEC expressed its interest in exploration rights. At the last election, Labor's policy entitled “Caring for the Great Barrier Reef” included these words:</para><para>To preserve the health of the reef, Labor will:</para><para>Prohibit all mineral, oil and gas exploration and operations in Australian waters offshore of the Great Barrier Reef.</para><para>On April 16 2002, in Townsville, Labor's leader, Mr Simon Crean, reaffirmed Labor's commitment to protect Australia's greatest natural tourism asset—the Great Barrier Reef—from two devastating environmental threats by banning oil drilling and exploration both on and off the reef, and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol to tackle the disastrous impacts climate change would have on the reef. That commitment from the Labor Party is testimony to the ongoing desire that Labor has to protect the reef both from oil drilling and climate change. </para><para>The Australian Labor Party recognises the intrinsic values of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most significant listings on the World Heritage register. There are not many other icons in the world that have that level of significance. It is the international icon of all coral reef systems. It is the largest listing on the World Heritage register, listed in 1981. The listing of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area on the register complies with all four Natural Heritage criteria: geological phenomena; ecological and biological processes; asthetics and natural beauty; and biological diversity, including natural processes. </para><para>As well as these natural values, the Great Barrier Reef has enormous social and economic values. It is impossible to put a value on the time one spends with family or friends in places like the Great Barrier Reef. There will be many people all over the world who have cherished memories of their time visiting the Reef. Recreational experiences like snorkelling, diving, recreational fishing and boating will hold lasting memories for millions of people around the world. The education values that flow from the Reef are also enormous. Social values, by their very nature, are not easy to quantify, but it is important in any assessment of such a wonderful icon that we do not overlook these values.</para><para>Economic values are easier to quantify. The value of the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to be in the order of $1.5 billion annually to the state of Queensland. Well over half of this value is from the tourism industry with more than 2 million visitors travelling to the Reef every year. In employment terms, the Great Barrier Reef is vital to the ongoing economic health of Queensland. There are workers in the tourism, fishing and associated industries and in hotels, tackle shops, restaurants and on tour desks—the list goes on. There are an enormous number of workers who depend on the viability and sustainability of the Great Barrier Reef for their jobs. </para><para>Tourism is an industry dependent on perceptions. Oilrigs, even 50 kilometres from the Marine Park boundary, do not promote a perception to potential visitors of a pristine ecosystem that is valued by its community and by its government. </para><para>The tourism industry is opposed to oil exploration or drilling. Stephen Gregg, Tourism Queensland's Chief Executive Officer has said that Queensland tourism operators want to see a permanent ban on exploration or any potentially harmful activities anywhere near the Reef.</para><para>The seafood industry has similar views. John Olsen, President of the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, formerly the Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Association, has said, “It would be ridiculous for the Federal Government to give the go ahead for a seismic survey— that is, the seismic survey required for the EIA— that if oil was discovered, would inevitably lead to full-scale drilling”.</para><para>Mr Olsen can work it out. Why can't the Government? Guy Lane, an environmental scientist, has said that if they find petroleum reserves in the Townsville Trough, “It'll create this enormous political and economic vacuum and there'll be great pressure to start drilling. It really should be nipped in the bud at this stage”. Don Henry, Executive Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation agrees. He said “It is a disastrous ecological accident waiting to happen if it is approved”, adding that, “the Reef is worth more via tourism than any oil field”. </para><para>The Queensland Government supports these calls to ban oil exploration or drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef.</para><para>I can't understand how the Howard Government can be prepared to jeopardise the Great Barrier Reef's values—the social values, the economic values and the environmental values. Industry leaders and the broader community can see the sense in protecting the reef from oil exploration and drilling, so why can't this Government. </para><para>The history of oil and the Great Barrier Reef is a long one. I do not intend to give a complete chronology today of those interactions, but it is true to say that in 1968 Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the then Premier of Queensland, issued 16 licences to prospect for oil in the waters east of Queensland. In 1970, two companies, Ampol and Japex, postponed drilling near Whitsunday Island after significant opposition from the community. In 1974, a Royal Commission into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef concluded. The commissioners were split on whether oil drilling should be allowed on the Great Barrier Reef. In 1981, the coalition government passed the Act opening the Coral Sea to oil drilling. The government claimed that it would not allow oil drilling within 30 miles of the Great Barrier Reef. In 1990, oil exploration adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef was again proposed. The then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke quickly quashed this proposal. </para><para>I was disappointed then to find that the current Environment Minister, Dr Kemp trying to rewrite history in a media release of the 10th February 2003 suggesting that Labor was in fact proposing oil exploration back in 1990. It just goes to show how little he knows about the history of proposals to drill for oil on or near the Reef. </para><para>I think the current Environment Minister has much in common with the Liberal Shadow Environment Minister of the time, Fred Chaney, which just goes to show how progressive the Liberal Party is on issues like the environment.</para><para>The then Liberal Shadow Environment Minister, Fred Chaney, said on ABC radio:</para><para>“I'm certainly in favour of continued oil exploration in prospective areas just as I'm firmly of the view that we make sure the Great Barrier Reef is protected”.</para><para>I would have said to Senator Chaney—although I was not here then—and I do say now: you can't have your cake and eat it too. Fortunately, then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke intervened to stop oil exploration. The current Prime Minister should do as the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke did and rule out oil drilling and exploration adjacent to the Reef. </para><para>It is becoming increasingly clear that this Liberal Government is seriously considering allowing oil exploration and drilling adjacent to the Reef. We have TGS-NOPEC seeking approval to undertake seismic testing in the Townsville Trough just 50km from the Marine Park boundary and this Government is doing nothing.</para><para>The Labor Party though is not going to sit by and allow this Government to place at risk the environmental, economic and social values of the Great Barrier Reef. The position that we need to establish is that we, as a nation and as a community, are not prepared to compromise the values of the Great Barrier Reef—not at all, not in any way. Oil prospecting and drilling on or near coral reefs and the sustainability of those coral reefs are conflicting notions. </para><para>The ongoing desire of the oil industry to explore in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef such as the Townsville Trough is not going to be averted until clear direction by government is established. This legislation provides the Coalition with a sensible and practical mechanism that has no cost to Government to provide that direction—to rule out oil exploration and mining for good and I invite the Government to take up this opportunity.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted;

Remedial action to repair the damage is desperately needed. The status quo is simply not sustainable. This is clearly the view the Labor Party has put over the last two years and the view that I expressed in last year's research paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Research: engine room of the nation</inline>. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, says that the Australian university system is characterised by blandness and homogeneity. I take the view that nothing could be further from the truth. The differences between our universities, especially between the largest or wealthiest and the rest, have created a huge gulf between the haves and the have-nots of Australian higher education. That is the basis of the crisis that I am talking about. The problems are well known. It is not just about money, but money is at the core of the problem; the system is increasingly divided between winners and losers. Those universities that are already rich and powerful are being further advantaged by a government that sees the market as an answer to all our problems. </para></talk.start><para>The themes of the government's Crossroads review of higher education have been emphasised by Dr Nelson. The truth is that he can no longer deny that there is irrefutable evidence of a decline in quality, even if productivity has increased. He cannot deny that access to tertiary education is becoming more difficult for people who are less well off and less well connected. He cannot deny that there is a decline in the regional, social and economic responsiveness of universities as they are forced by the financial squeeze to narrow their teaching and research profiles. Those financial pressures can be measured by simple facts such as that expenses over the last 10 years have increased by 102 per cent while revenues have increased by only 81 per cent. The Commonwealth's share of those revenues, including HECS, has declined from 72 per cent in 1996 to 61 per cent in 2001. The aggregate sector operating result has declined from $560 million in 1997 to $460 million in 2001. That is a drop of $100 million. I acknowledge that there has been a recent improvement in the financial position. It is due mostly to currency movements and the improved performance of the four big universities in eastern Australia. The `great eight' universities now have a third of the sector's enrolments and almost half of the sector's revenue. They account for two-thirds of the operating result and three-quarters of the cash and investments. The 13 regional universities, on the other hand, have less than 25 per cent of the sector's enrolments, 21 per cent of the revenue, 13 per cent of the operating result and about 10 per cent of the cash and investments, but they have a third of the sector's debt.</para><para>The financial loads on students have skyrocketed under the Howard government. Under Labor, students were required to pay about 25 per cent of the cost of their degree. They now pay on average 40 per cent. Class sizes have blown out, with staff-student ratios up from one to 16 to one to 19. This has obvious implications for staff workloads. The range of subjects and programs offered by our universities and the research that they are able to provide have substantially contracted. These are the facts. There has been an increase in the appeal to the very crude commercial values within the university system itself. The number of qualified students missing out on a place—or unmet demand—is growing at an extraordinary rate across the country. There is now a profound problem, particularly in teacher education and in nursing, which, if not immediately addressed, will have profound social impacts on this country.</para><para>The traditional values that once defined our universities—that is, being committed to excellence in both teaching and research, and being committed not just to the pursuit of vocational training but to greater public good and to community service—have all been put under serious strain by this government. A very grim picture is emerging now. For evidence of this we look no further than the government's own documents, particularly the Department of Education, Science and Training's own higher education triennial report,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>which was published in the dead of night on Christmas Eve last year. It lays bare the damage done to universities by deregulation and their exposure by this government to an unnecessarily heavy reliance on the free market. The report says that expenditure by universities is growing faster than their revenue base. They have real trouble identifying further and larger sources of income to compensate for the government's financial cuts. The financial management of the public higher education institutions is generally pretty poor. Financial reporting processes and practices lack transparency and thoroughness. Universities have made a number of disastrous decisions leading to massive cost blow-outs in the purchase and adaptation of large-scale computer software. The report says that the diversification of revenue sources—for example, through international students and consultancy markets—has created real threats to educational quality as well as, in a number of cases, considerable financial losses. There has been an increased reliance on fee-paying students, particularly through the use of franchising arrangements, which has led to unacceptable risks to quality and financial stability, especially with the smaller universities. </para><para>Universities have experienced significant problems managing their capital expenditure—that is, their building maintenance and construction programs. They are increasingly being called upon to use their capital moneys to fund their recurrent operations. This all adds up—as the opposition has been saying for the last couple of years—to a crisis. The undue reliance on an ideological obsession with the market obscures the need for significant public investment in higher education. Instead, our public universities are being thrown wholesale to the wolves in the marketplace and to the broader commercial environment, which is far from benign, especially for inexperienced players.</para><para>Minister Nelson tries to reassure us by quoting system-wide financial data, but the financial soundness of Australia's universities rests largely upon four super performing, what I call `megafauna', universities—the real winners in the competition jungle. They are the universities of Queensland, Sydney and Melbourne and New South Wales. They constitute some 50 per cent of the operating result for the whole sector. We are looking at a situation where the operating surplus of two of these four hyperachieving universities is $29 million, for the University of New South Wales, and $88 million, for the University of Sydney—but the sector-wide average was $12 million.</para><para>At risk is the capacity to generate new ideas and new knowledge. Places for Australian students in postgraduate courses has declined by 16 per cent between the 1996 and 2001. The proportion of students obliged to pay fees for these courses jumped over that time by 30 per cent to almost 70 per cent. Higher degree, or research, students commencing study have fallen as a percentage of all new students from about four per cent in 1996 to less than three per cent last year. The government's new research training scheme, which is part of its flagship Backing Australia's Ability, looks set to implode after only two years of operation. The four megafauna universities share between them over $200 million of the total $527 million available in 2003. Another $113 million goes to just four more. The remaining 29 universities—or 78 per cent of institutions— are allocated only 40 per cent of the research training funding. The big four are running a sustained campaign to make the allocations of research funding entirely competitive and performance based. Such a change would fundamentally undermine the basic principle we have come to accept in this country as defining a university—that is, an institution that encourages excellence in both teaching and research.</para><para>What we are seeing under this government is a change from what we have understood to be the basic principles of what it is that makes a university. Commonwealth funding has declined from 68 per cent to just 61 per cent over the last couple of years. Individual students are being asked to make up the difference. What we also notice—and it was in the press today—is that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee are saying that they cannot see anything from the government that would give them reason not to be up-beat about the government's future intentions.</para><para>I was quite surprised by this, because the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee executive officer says:</para><quote><para>Certainly our information gathering is that our objective of 1.6 per cent of GDP by 2007 ... is likely to be achieved.</para></quote><para>It seems to me, when I look at the details of it, that if we take the current estimate that higher education is funded at 1.4 per cent of GDP it will require a further 0.2 per cent of GDP to be committed to higher education by 2007. On current estimates of Australian GDP in 2005 and 2006, that will exceed $883 billion. Given that universities rely upon the federal government for about 60 per cent of their funding, that would involve the Commonwealth share increasing by approximately $1.06 billion per year. That is an additional $5 billion to 2007. </para><para>You have to ask yourself: what is the AVCC up to in these sorts of circumstances, where a basic mathematical conclusion can be drawn from the statements that have been made that the government commitment would have to be $5 billion extra to meet their claims? The government's own figures, in table A8 in the first Crossroads paper, show a decline in public spending on higher education as a percentage of GDP—a decline. Those figures are 1.1 per cent in 1991 to 0.93 per cent in 2000. They are official government figures that I am quoting. During the same period, private expenditure increased only marginally, and that was largely off the back of increased student fees.</para><para>If we look at the 730 submissions that have been put to the government, the seven discussion papers and the 50-odd forums that have been held as a result of this Crossroads process, we note that the government paid the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee $100,000 to have one of its officers seconded to this review. We ask ourselves: what is the government proposing under these circumstances? I see nothing in any of the speculation so far which goes to the issue of the fundamental crisis within the Australian higher education system. What we are seeing is that the proposals being advanced will strengthen the already rich, the already privileged—those who are able to call upon the investment for what is now nearly 150 years of public support in those major institutions.</para><para>It seems that the government is attempting to shift the burden to students and their families to unprecedented levels. What we are noticing here—and it is a pattern that has emerged over recent years—is a continuation of the government's policies. It strikes me that, in these circumstances, we are likely to see a situation where a number of universities are going to be facing very serious financial problems in the years to come. We note already the uneven impact of the government cuts. If we look across Australia we see that, because the cuts that have been made were to the forward estimates, the cuts appear disproportionately to affect south-eastern Australia. Victoria lost effectively 5.4 per cent of its operating grants; Tasmania lost 5.26 per cent; South Australia lost 5.01 per cent; the Australian Capital Territory lost 2.56 per cent and New South Wales lost 1.28 per cent. Queensland and Western Australia were able to achieve some additional support. The Northern Territory, particularly the Northern Territory University, on the other hand suffered a serious cut of 5.73 per cent. They are official DEST figures.</para><para>It pays to remember, when we are looking at these programs, that the government is in fact proposing to fund growth. According to Dr Shergold, at a recent seminar he gave before moving on to bigger and better things, there is likely to be an increase in student places of about 0.5 per cent by 2014. This was predicated on the assumption that Tasmania and South Australia would actually lose places and would see a decline in the number of places that are offered. If we take into account the effect of lifelong learning, we see that many of the calculations the government is making about future demand are quite cavalier and are misplaced. They take no account of the changes to the work force. They take no account of the changes that are occurring within Australian society. It strikes me, in the circumstance where the government is calling upon us to endorse a proposition that students should take on a greater burden in the funding of higher education, that we are entitled to ask the question: what has the government done to defend higher education in this country? It seems to me the system cannot flourish in circumstances wrought by years of funding neglect and policy vandalism by this government. Our fine university system is reeling. There are very strong reasons to fear what this government is intending to do to the higher education system.

Given that it is 20 years since the election of the Hawke government, I assume his speech was made in tribute to that occurrence. I recall also that today is the 50th anniversary of the death of Joseph Stalin. Perhaps it is the latter that is more important to Senator Carr. However, on the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke government it is important to look back at why we are where we are. Writing in the<inline font-style="italic"> Age</inline> last year, the former Labor Federal President Barry Jones said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A turning point in the history of Australia's higher education was the comprehensive reorganisation that was initiated, and indeed imposed, from 1987 by John Dawkins, Bob Hawke's minister for education and training. I have little doubt that Dawkinisation will prove to have been the greatest single mistake of the Hawke-Keating years.</para></quote><para>If the Hawke government got it wrong, and I think they did, at least they had some policies. We have heard the outline of some concerns by Senator Carr, but we have not heard anything about policies or solutions. Of course, that is becoming the theme for the Labor Party in the year 2003. One thing about the Hawke government is—and we read the tributes today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> where Mr Kelly wrote about Mr Hawke being one of the great prime ministers—they did believe in competition. They got over class warfare and all that stuff, and they embraced the market. They believed in competition, but sadly they did not believe in competition in the university sector. They believed, in effect, that one size fits all. Senator Carr and I would probably agree that in the university sector one size does not fit all. The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 18 February this year said:</para><quote><para>In the early 1990s Labor's John Dawkins tried to do it by merging universities and colleges of advanced education to form fewer large institutions. But, instead of freeing them from bureaucratic controls and letting them compete on price, quality and specialisation, the Dawkins reforms increased interference in academic work and resulted in too many institutions trying to do the same things and getting equally rewarded regardless of how well they did it.</para></quote><para>As I say, competition and excellence were not rewarded under the Dawkins scheme. That, of course, was a major problem. In a sense this ideological obsession with equity punished diversity, stifled excellence and failed to reward entrepreneurial activities in higher education. That is the core problem. I have taught at a couple of universities and I know that Senator Carr has taught as well. There are often enormous pressures on academic staff today and I recognise and accept that, but the answer is not simply an injection of public funding. Just like the market that Mr Hawke and Mr Keating embraced in the 1980s, universities have to be able to specialise in what they do well. For example, James Cook University in my state of Queensland might be able to specialise in tropical medicine. For the University of Central Queensland, in Rockhampton, it could be dry basin agriculture. Also, universities specialise in what their strong faculties are and what their strong academics do. That is extremely important. Just like societies and economies flourish by concentrating on what they do well, institutions, and indeed universities, must concentrate on what they do well. That is what they have to be allowed to do, and that is what the Labor Party miss. They think it is a matter of public funding. Universities must be able to do what they do and do it well. That is why Dr Nelson, in a sense, has taken a leaf out of Mr Hawke's book. He has been very consultative and has spent last year and this year producing seven discussion papers covering a range of topics. He has asked the Productivity Commission to examine the resourcing of the university sector. He has held 49 consultative meetings around the country with 800 participants. He has examined over 700 submissions and consulted with various stakeholders including the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the National Union of Students, the National Tertiary Education Union and the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations.

I refer to access to tertiary education. That is critical. I remember too well when I was an undergraduate student in the eighties that the Labor Party initially opposed tertiary fees. Remember that? They said, `If you impose tertiary fees, fewer people will go to university.' That is what they said 20 years ago. It was appalling. In effect, they were giving the middle class welfare. They were subsidising middle-class kids. These were not disadvantaged kids; they were middle-class kids. The post-Whitlamite baby boomers were giving a pathetic display of middle-class social welfare. To the credit of Senator Walsh and others, finally the Labor Party thought we had to have tertiary fees. Do you know why they thought that? They thought that because it would increase access to tertiary education. It would help poor kids who came from disadvantaged places to have access to tertiary education.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The first part of this process involves increasing access to tertiary education, and access to tertiary education has doubled in 20 years. The next part of the process is to allow universities the entrepreneurial capacity to charge fees and to encourage overseas students because that would give them more money to attract more students. The problem is that we have gone only half way down the road. The Labor Party thinks it is a matter of more public funding. It is not; it is a matter of specialisation, of universities doing what they do well and of carrying on with the reforms introduced many years ago by Senator Walsh and others. As usual, the Labor Party believes that this is simply a matter of more public money. Indeed, it is all about letting universities do what they do well. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>9286</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will begin by picking up on a statement made by the previous speaker in relation to people who oppose fees. Senator Mason was referring to arguments put forward in the early eighties. I might add that it does seem a long time ago that the ALP opposed fees. However, when they did or when proponents of publicly funded or free education, for lack of a better expression, opposed fees, we did it not because we thought fewer people would go to university but because we thought fewer people from disadvantaged backgrounds— those traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds—would have access to universities.</para></talk.start><para>If this government had not abandoned the research, by postcodes and other demographic traits, through the higher education roundtable and HEC, as it was called then, we would be able to put on the record today the demographics that have either benefited or been disadvantaged as a consequence of fees and charges in our institutions. Those of us who believe strongly in publicly funded and accessible education believe in it because we acknowledge that higher education, or education generally, is a public investment; it is not a cost. It does not work in the way traditional markets work. In fact, I do not think that it is particularly useful to consider university education in a market context because the conventional market approach is not appropriate.</para><para>Returning to the debate initiated by Senator Carr, the Australian Democrats support this MPI debate. We have consistently opposed barriers to education in the form of fees and charges. We remain profoundly concerned about the massive cuts to universities. There have been cuts of more than 15 per cent in real terms since 1996. In the past seven years under this government we have seen massive cuts to public funding for education and specifically for higher education. That has led to the very real decline we see today in the quality of educational experience at our universities.</para><para>If people doubt that, it is well documented in the Senate committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Universities in crisis</inline>. You just have to look at staff-student ratios which have blown out from one to 19 in 2001, up from one to 12 in the early 1990s. There is overcrowding and course closures. We have uncompetitive academic salaries, overworked and stressed staff and general and academic staff who have been waiting on staff pay claims for a number of years in some institutions. There have been major cuts to libraries and other infrastructure. These typify the climate within our higher education institutions in Australia today. The government is well aware of these problems. If we do not believe that, we only have to look at that leaked cabinet submission from Dr Kemp back in 1999. Education is not a mere commodity; it is an investment. At some point, governments that want a sustainable education system and to ensure benefits and access for the students of today and tomorrow will have to acknowledge that.  </para><para>In the past few weeks we have had selective leaks about the Crossroads paper. I call on Minister Nelson, who I acknowledge has been consultative in this process, to release Crossroads so that we are not hearing just selective leaked reports through certain newspapers. From the leaks so far, we can see that we are looking at further deregulation of undergraduate fees by allowing universities to charge top-up fees. We are also looking at real interest rates on top-up loans; a Big Brother approach to managing students; penalties for slower completions without any examination of the constraints on completions as a result of hopelessly inadequate income support measures in this country; further undermining of universities by providing Commonwealth loans to students in private colleges—an increasing trend we have seen from this government—where private colleges are not universities; and we are looking at an expansion in the number of domestic full-fee undergraduate places from around 25 per cent to 50 per cent in courses. That is really code for this government to say, `We have no intention of fully funding genuine growth in places.' In short, the government is looking to abrogate its responsibility for addressing the very serious and very real problems that afflict our institutions.</para><para>The recent Productivity Commission report stated that we already have the fourth most privatised higher education system. That is extraordinary. On average, Australian students pay more than their American counterparts for public university education. We know that fees and charges are a psychological and financial disincentive for aspiring students, particularly for those from disadvantage backgrounds.</para><para>I want to send a very clear message to the government today: the Democrats do not believe that reform of student fees is a solution. No amount of fiddling with student debt can mask the real problem of insufficient public investment in higher education. I look forward to debating Crossroads. My message to Minister Nelson is: `Bring it on. Let's have this debate. No more leaks.' Our education sector requires public funding and any reports of $1 billion or $1.5 billion in around 2007 will only begin to make up for the cuts that were debated in this place in 1996. I would love to have a debate about binary divides versus the unified national system, because that is what Senator Mason was alluding to with the green and white papers introduced by John Dawkins, but now is not the time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>9287</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to support the motion moved by Senator Carr. In fact, I believe it goes only part of the way in examining what the government has done in relation to higher education. The words are not strong enough, in my mind, to portray what has happened to this sector of the education system since 1996. It is not only the government's failure to defend Australia's national system of higher education but also the abhorrent and abysmal neglect of this system throughout the government's last seven years in office that needs to be addressed. Well may the Prime Minister celebrate his seventh anniversary this year, because there are not too many people in the higher education sector jumping for joy and celebrating with him, as they have had to endure massive cuts and massive changes in that sector due to the government's neglect and failure to recognise that there are significant problems. </para></talk.start><para>Not only that, we have a government that is unwilling to accept any responsibility for the dismal state it has put this sector into since it came to office in 1996. Some 10 years ago, this country had an internationally recognised and renowned and efficient higher education system. That has sadly changed and gone downhill under the Howard government. There have been three major reviews in higher education sector in the last five years—three major reviews and a leaked cabinet submission. We had the West review in 1997-98. We had the Senate inquiry—a massive inquiry which has been spoken about many times in this chamber— where at the end of the day even the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee admitted to the Senate committee, on the record, that we have a higher education sector in this country that is in crisis. That is from the people who manage the system on the ground on a day-to-day basis. Then there was a cabinet submission, which was leaked. When the wheels started to fall off, the previous education minister tried to cobble together some decent policy. Now we have the Crossroads paper and its seven subsequent discussion papers.  </para><para>Senator Stott Despoja talks about an education minister who embarks on a consultative process. Let us see at the end of the day when that paper is released whether that consultative process has been genuine. There is consultation and there is real consultation where you actually listen to what the community and the sector are asking for in relation to higher education, not just what the bosses, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee or industry are asking for. Parents, students and people who work in that sector need to be listened to as well. At the end of the day, we will see how genuine this consultation has been.</para><para>This government has missed in its seven years since being elected an opportunity to invest in the economic and social future of this country by backing, supporting and putting the public funds that are needed into the higher education system. Let us have a look at a report card, if you like, on the university sector in this country at this point in time. We know now that a staggering amount of funds have been ripped out of the public funding purse that should have gone towards the Australian universities since 1996. In fact, you will find that the cuts to the operating grants between 1997 and 2000 in the federal budget have averaged around six per cent. The costs have shifted from this government to students and their families by increasing the HECS fees as well. Under this government, HECS fees have risen by 69 per cent from 2000—from $2,442 to about $4,120. We have had massive cuts to operating grants and the cost of funding higher education in this country has shifted to families and students.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Try looking at the total money.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—The figures are there, Senator Tierney. Get up and explain to us why your government has increased HECS by 69 per cent and why you believe you can justify students propping up a higher education system that used to be well funded and publicly funded before your government was elected. Not only that, we have also seen massive pressure put on students. As I said, HECS contributions are up. Australian students are paying some of the highest study and living costs in the world—higher than the US, Britain and Germany. We have seen a shift in the responsibility—from publicly funded institutions to students having to find those funds in order to study and survive, and to prop up a system that should be publicly funded. We have seen overcrowding in classrooms. Students, we know, are forced to sit on stairs and in corridors. Tutorials of 30 students and lectures of 400 or more are common.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Where are your policies?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—We heard that, Senator Tierney. You were sitting with us during the Senate inquiry when you would have heard day after day about crowded lectures, packed tutorials, not enough staff and staff being overworked and severely stressed. In fact, the figures show that increases in the average number of students per teaching staff are up to as high as 70 per cent in some places. At Central Queensland University the staff-student ratio increased by 70 per cent from 1996-2001. At Charles Sturt University the ratio increased by 53 per cent. At RMIT it increased by 40 per cent. At my own Northern Territory University the staff-student ratio has increased by 28 per cent. Universities are having to do less with the publicly funded purse and the emphasis has gone onto either students or private industry. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The evidence does not support suggestions that Australian universities are over-reliant on public funding or are heavily subsidised by international students. In fact, our tertiary education system, as Senator Stott Despoja said, is already the fourth most reliant on private funding, largely through student fees or funding from privately owned and operated entities attached to universities. Only Korea, Japan and the United States are more heavily reliant on private funding than Australia. In fact, if we look at the source of funds for Australian universities from 1981 to 2000, funds from the government in 1981 amounted to 90 per cent; by the year 2000 they were down to 46.8 per cent, so less than 50 per cent. By the year 2000 this government was putting into the higher education system from the public purse less than 50 per cent of the funds. Non-government funds have risen from 9.9 per cent in 1981 to 17.1 per cent in 2000. Student fees in 1990 accounted for 20.3 per cent of funds to the higher education sector and now account for 36.2 per cent. </para><para>So the evidence is clearly there before us, and there are figures to back up the claims, that funding from the public purse to the higher education system has significantly reduced in the last 20 years and that funding out of the purse of students has significantly increased since 1990 to at least the year 2000. This is really about the government walking away from its responsibility to support a publicly funded system of higher education in this country. We know that students are paying more and the universities are getting less. In real terms universities received on average $1,103 less per student in 2001 than they did in 1996. We know that the share of the costs of subsidised places borne by students has increased from 19.6 per cent in 1996 to 34.5 per cent in 2001. On average, students were liable for $1,745 more per year in 2001 than they were in 1996. We have a system that is in crisis. We have a government that is blinded by the `fact' that nothing is wrong. It believes that everything is going quite fine along this road in the higher education area and that if there are any changes to be made its hands will be totally off the wheel and it will not be the government that picks up the pieces. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>9289</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk about excellence in higher education.

Of these, just over 393,000 were subsidised undergraduate and postgraduate places, around 23,000 were government supported research student places and the remaining were undergraduate and postgraduate fee paying places. There were around 6,500 fee paying places in 2002, representing less than two per cent of undergraduate students. Only 242 transferred to a HECS place after the first year. There are 23 institutions offering undergraduate fee paying places around the nation. Fee paying undergraduate places are additional to those places subsidised by the government. Most domestic fee payers would be in a HECS place for a different course if they did not pay fees. By taking a fee paying place, they have freed a HECS place for someone else. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Generally, institutions that accept fee paying students keep their entry scores to within five points of HECS cut-off. Courses that accept fee paying students tend to be highly competitive with high cut-off scores pushed up by strong levels of demand from students. Fee paying students are still required to meet academic standards set by the universities and are deemed by the particular institution to be above the academic cut-off for the relevant course.

There is the mark of their great expertise: 100,000 students seeking to get a place in higher education could not do it in 1992. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee estimated that in 2002, after discounting for a range of factors including people applying multiple times, the number of genuinely unsuccessful eligible applicants was between 10,600 and 17,450. One in 20 missed out. The number was much higher under Labor in 1994: one in 10 missed out. What a track record! What a recipe for success those opposite bring to this debate!

A healthy education sector is a necessary prerequisite for a healthy economy and a healthy society.

But, of course, this is not what is happening.</para></talk.start><para>Instead, we are about to see the culmination of a long-term goal of this government: to enact a significant withdrawal by the Commonwealth from the responsibility of delivering a high-quality university sector. This is a transformation that has been under way since the coalition government came to office—and to a certain extent before that as well—which has seen the systematic underfunding of the sector, softening up the key players for the sucker punch that appears imminent. </para><para>The leaks in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> have made this abundantly clear. In the area of fees, we are looking at further deregulation of the current fee structure, an increase in the HECS-liable fee for all students—an increase that will be used to the maximum by vice-chancellors eager for precious resources—and the threat of a move back to a two-tiered system with some, perhaps those regional universities, forced to focus on teaching and losing their research component. This is in spite of a mountain of evidence that shows that such a move will undermine teaching quality. A third tier may also be in the offing, consequent to Dr Nelson's fixation on having one or two top 100 universities, even if this comes at the expense of the sector as a whole. We are looking at a continuation of the process embarked on last year with the extension of PELS, which is public money, to private providers within the sector.</para><para>Dr Nelson's elitist views that universities are overpopulated with students who do not really belong there are complemented by an attack on those who have made it through: the introduction of a Big Brother style ID card and a database system to deal with slow completion rates in a coercive and aggressive manner that looks to strip numbers and make savings rather than assist struggling students and increase completion rates. The government has abandoned the goal of universal, comprehensive, equitable public higher education. Instead, it is ushering in a bargain basement, deregulated, user pays service, which features growing privatisation both in public university services and in competition with them.</para><para>The Greens' vision is for a comprehensive, publicly funded, well-resourced and accessible higher education sector. The peak student bodies, academic staff and unions are crying out for an immediate injection of funding of $1 billion. Solutions to the problems caused by reduced public funding and increased competition will not be solved by more reductions in public funding and increased competition.

It is the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke government, so I pored over this document to see what visionary approach the Labor Party was trying to adopt at that time. Well, I was out on Cape Barren, I tell you! I could not find anything here at all in terms of vision for higher education—nothing whatsoever. There was a bit of tinkering here and there at the edges and criticism of the Fraser government, which was pretty predictable, but no vision for higher education.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us move on in time to the next opportunity. Let us look at what they were doing at the end of the Hawke-Keating era. For 13 years we had massive numbers of students who could not get into higher education; we had a funding crisis in higher education; we had increased enrolments and we did not have matching resources. What was Labor's answer at the end of 1996? Their plan—this is a serious plan; the Minister for Finance and Administration is here so I am sure he will be very interested in this plan—is to suggest to universities that they take out loans. It is suggested that universities take out loans to pay for their expansion and for their increased costs and repay that money within six years. </para><para>If the former Labor government had remained in office, just think of the position we would be in today. We would have a totally cash-strapped higher education system because they would be not only fighting to find funds to expand higher education but also having to pay back the loans that the Labor government said they were going to make it take out if they had won the election in 1996. Not only were they bereft of ideas; they were a bit bereft of money, having a $10 billion black hole at the time. They certainly had no way of funding the future expansion and development of higher education.</para><para>Let us move on to 2001. Kim Beazley came out with his policy for higher education. We had Knowledge Nation. We all waited with bated breath for Knowledge Nation, and all we got was spaghetti and meatballs. They did not have any really visionary idea. They did not provide two things: first, they did not provide any money—there was no extra money for this program, as usual, from the Labor Party—and, second, they had no vision for where the sector was going.</para><para>I have had a look at the plan regarding where we are going in higher education. Compared to what those opposite were proposing at that last election, the difference is just incredible. All they put up, really, was a proposal to have a cyber university with 100,000 students. We asked the question: `When is this going to happen?' The answer was: `It is going to happen in 10 years.' There was going to be an extra 100,000 students and it was going to take 10 years to do, and they were all going to be online. We know now—and I am not going to go into the details—what professional educators think of that idea. It was just a wacky idea. It was never, ever going to work. </para><para>Those are the ideas of the Labor Party. We have heard from Labor Party senators today, as they have joined in this debate, or tried to create a debate on higher education, criticisms of the system but, as I have said, we have heard absolutely no plans in relation to where higher education would go. They have had plenty of opportunity to contribute. We have had the Crossroads review and we have had the minister provide the opportunity for the Labor Party to join in that review. We welcome their ideas. But did they participate at all? Did Jenny Macklin put anything in? Did the Labor Party put anything in? The Australian Education Union did; they put in a submission. I was at the plenary session when we heard what they had to say. But there were no new ideas.

He added that legislative scrutiny was not concerned with the political acceptability of what was proposed but rather—in words that I think are very apposite—it looks for wisdom, fairness, justice and restraint in the way policy objectives are achieved. The existence of these committees, in the view of Justice Cox, clearly stimulates and promotes a democratic environment. </para><para>The chief justice returned to these themes in comments expressly addressed to scrutiny of bills committees, noting that their importance cannot be understated. He observed that an important function of such committees is to stimulate debate to provide a more principled answer to complex issues rather than a policy process whereby discussion of rights is either absent or marginalised. In his opinion, processes under which governments had to justify their actions relating to rights should be welcomed, particularly where a parliament is likely to be dominated by the executive.</para><para>The chief justice illustrated his comments by reference to uniform national schemes of legislation under which the Commonwealth, state and territory executives agree on a model of legislation which cannot be amended from that agreed form. He suggested that the result is effectively no parliamentary scrutiny of this type of bill. As a consequence there is a real challenge to ensure that parliament is not relegated to a rubber stamp for national legislative schemes. In a generous concluding comment, the chief justice observed that the systematic referral of bills to committees in the Senate has been a significant and in many ways a successful innovation.</para><para>One of the other highlights of the conference was a paper by former Senator Barney Cooney, who was a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for 17 years and a chair of that committee for 12 years. The conference recognised former Senator Cooney's contribution to legislative scrutiny by inviting him to be a co-patron of the next conference, together with Dame Catherine Tizard, a former Governor-General of New Zealand.</para><para>Former Senator Cooney's paper emphasised the role of legislative scrutiny committees in the original dimension of parliament, which saw the development of the rule of law, the curbing of arbitrary power and the appropriate restraint of the executive. This function was vital to a fair and democratic society. Former Senator Cooney observed that the parliamentary committees which scrutinise legislation may be the only way to ensure that some action is taken over flawed legislation. Former Senator Cooney saw the parliament as having a central position in good governance, exemplified by legislative scrutiny. </para><para>Former Senator Cooney saw common values in legislative scrutiny principles which were recognised by parliamentarians regardless of their party political stance. These values were a continuation of those expressed in great historical documents such as the Magna Carta, the United States Bill of Rights, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and, in more recent times, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He warned, nevertheless, of the tension created in parliament between its ancient role as a check on the executive and more recent perceived dominance of the legislature by the executive. Happily, however, former Senator Cooney concluded that parliament had not surrendered its older function. Legislative scrutiny committees were vital in protecting personal rights and liberties, which are the foundations of civil society. </para><para>Other papers and ensuing discussion also raised issues with which the committee has been concerned. Among others these included international best practice for explanatory material for primary legislation, about which the committee recently agreed to write to the minister responsible for the legislation handbook. Other topics included matters with which the committee has become only too familiar, such as incorporation by reference to external material, and delegated legislative power with no provision for parliamentary scrutiny. However, the conference did not restrict itself to current concerns but included more speculative questions such as the desirability of routine public hearings for the legislative scrutiny process and whether our committees should issue press releases, in the same way as courts, in relation to their more significant actions. The relationship between the scrutiny of bills committees and a possible bill of rights attracted considerable attention.</para><para>On behalf of the committee I presented a paper on entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation, illustrating the role of the committee in protecting personal rights, while Senator Johnston gave a paper on regulation making powers in bills which focused on the committee's function in relation to parliamentary propriety. The committee's report to the conference on its activities during the last two years indicated that for the first time it has reported in a systematic way upon amendment of bills, and noted the encouraging number of cases where ministers have agreed to amend provisions upon which the committee has commented. The committee will table a detailed report of the conference papers and proceedings after consultation with our colleagues on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee.</para><para>The Commonwealth has always been an active participant at these conferences, and Senator Johnston and I found this one to be worth while and productive. The nature of the conference was perhaps best expressed by the chair of a state legislative scrutiny committee who was on the record as saying that he learnt more from one hour at the conference than from his previous nine months in parliament. I put on the record my thanks to Janice Paull from the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for her support to Senator Johnston, Senator Marshall and me in attending the conference.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>9295</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>9295</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>9295</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the 394th report of the committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of Australia's quarantine function</inline>. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>This report presents the committee's review of Australia's quarantine function. The review arose from the committee's statutory obligation to review reports of the Auditor-General, namely, Audit report No. 47 of 2000-01, <inline font-style="italic">Managing for quarantine effectiveness</inline>, which was tabled in June 2001. Besides the audit findings, the government provided in the 2001-02 budget almost $600 million over four years to strengthen Australia's defence against the introduction of exotic pests and diseases. This followed the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom in February 2001. </para><para>The committee has therefore sought to reassure the parliament on two issues: (1) that the Auditor-General's recommendations have been carried through; and (2) that the additional funds allocated to the quarantine function are being well spent. In general, the committee believes that Australia's quarantine function is in good shape and additional funding is being appropriately used. It is not possible for Australia to adopt a zero risk stance with regard to quarantine, so there will be, from time to time, incursions of exotic pests and diseases. The committee believes Australia is well placed to meet those threats.</para><para>However, the committee has found some gaps where enhancement is warranted. Evidence to the inquiry has revealed a significant gap in border protection with regard to the potential for exotic biofouling organisms to enter Australia on the hulls of foreign vessels. The committee believes that biofouling organisms on foreign vessels is primarily a quarantine matter and has recommended that in Northern Australia, where the threat is greatest, the activities of the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy—NAQS—be expanded to meet this threat. The committee considers that the Quarantine Act should be amended so that biofouling organisms fall within the legislation. As well, the committee has recommended that relevant agencies identify areas and introduce procedures whereby vessels posing a quarantine risk can be routinely, expeditiously and safely disposed of. The committee has reviewed quarantine preparedness and effectiveness under the NAQS program and has taken evidence on Australia's ability to meet the threat of exotic pests and diseases. The committee believes that Australia is well prepared to meet existing and future quarantine threats, especially those emanating from the north. </para><para>Notwithstanding these comments, the committee received evidence of a long-term decline in the level of scientific expertise available in Australia which might be needed to assist in identifying disease incursions. The committee is concerned at this decline. The creation of a critical mass of expertise often requires a significant lead time, beginning with university undergraduate courses. While the committee did not take detailed evidence regarding how to build up scientific expertise, it supports any practical moves to address this particular weakness.</para><para>The committee has reviewed Australia's appropriate level of protection, or ALOP, and in particular whether the ALOP needs to be more precisely defined. The committee does not consider greater definition is warranted. A more quantitative ALOP would invite debate and legal challenge as to whether quarantine measures for particular imports were consistent with the ALOP. Moreover, the World Trade Organisation considers that Australia's current definition is appropriate. Indeed, other countries do not have a precisely defined ALOP. There is little by way of precedent provided by previous dispute cases before the World Trade Organisation, so altering Australia's ALOP would needlessly increase uncertainty.</para><para>Evidence received by the committee is that Australia is no longer at the forefront regarding import risk analysis and has, in this respect, slipped behind New Zealand and the United States of America. The committee believes, therefore, that it is time to revisit the recommendation of the 1996 Nairn quarantine review that a centre of excellence be established to undertake risk analysis research.</para><para>A problem with the import risk analysis process identified by the Auditor-General and confirmed by the committee is that there is a significant backlog in dealing with applications to import commodities. A contributing factor is that Australia is vulnerable to a wide range of exotic pests and diseases. Nevertheless, evidence indicated that the backlog was leading to a degree of frustration expressed by some of Australia's trading partners. The committee believes that it would be reasonable for applicants to have to wait no longer than six months before consideration of their application was commenced, and it has recommended that additional resources be provided to allow this to be achieved. </para><para>I turn to current and projected free trade negotiations. The committee notes that there has been no credible indication that Australia is likely to trade off its current position on quarantine. However, the committee emphasises that determination of quarantine measures based on scientific assessment and risk analysis should not be compromised to facilitate free trade agreements.</para><para>During the inquiry, the committee conducted extensive inspections of Australia's quarantine border operations. The committee was impressed with the enthusiasm, professionalism and performance of those officers it met and the strategy in Northern Australia of involving Indigenous peoples in quarantine activities. During the inspection of the Sydney Mail Exchange, the committee saw various goods, such as vacuum packed bratwurst sausages and plant material that had been seized from international mail items. These had been detected by X-ray operators. The sensitivity of the quarantine detector dogs was also demonstrated when a packet of seeds in an airmail letter from Europe was detected during the committee's visit.</para><para>Indeed, the committee experienced at first hand quarantine in action when it returned from its Torres Strait inspection visit. To his embarrassment, the inquiry secretary was bailed up by a beagle: his bag had contained several oranges some days before. The committee also took the opportunity to inspect the new Customs container X-ray facility in Melbourne. This facility is expected to X-ray some 100 containers a day and is able to detect items such as illegal hand guns, drugs and plant material, including contraband cigarettes. The committee notes that in December 2002 this facility identified some 3.8 million cigarettes secreted in a consignment of radio headphones.</para><para>I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearing. AFFA was particularly cooperative in shadowing the evidence which was being received by the committee and addressing issues as they emerged, as well as responding to the committee's queries. I would also like to thank members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat staff: the previous secretary to the committee, Dr Margot Kerley; inquiry secretary, Dr John Carter; research staff member Ms Mary-Kate Jurcevic; and administrative staff member Ms Maria Pappas.</para><para>I would like to add a couple of other comments which I thought were quite significant. For example, evidence from the Australian Society of Parasitology suggested the biggest threat to Australia's future quarantine function is the national decline in educational research training. They said:</para><quote><para>There is no department of parasitology left now in this country. That has become a department of microbiology, and I believe from next year there will be two people who are parasitologists left in that place.</para></quote><para>They then go on later in their submission to say:</para><quote><para>CSIRO have cut back extensively on their parasite area as part of their cutback in the whole of the agricultural research area. </para></quote><para>These are issues that I want to draw to the Senate's attention. Also, as I mentioned earlier, in all the inspections we have been impressed with the professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm of the various personnel in the field. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise, for example, the dedication and professionalism of NAQS botanist Dr Barbara Waterhouse. Dr Waterhouse, in her own time, in addition to her other duties, has provided many thousands of specimens, including Siam weed, to the Queensland Herbarium. Officers like Barbara Waterhouse really do need public commendation for their dedication and hard work in the interests of keeping exotic weeds and diseases out of Australia. I think Australia is well served by people with the professionalism of Dr Barbara Waterhouse and her colleagues. Indeed, we would like to thank all people who have gone beyond the call of duty in keeping undesirable plant material out of Australia. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>9298</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to support the motion to take note of this report. I congratulate the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on its review of Australian quarantine functions. I want to address the term of reference concerning the impact of international agreements on quarantine activities, including proposed bilateral free trade agreements. From the government's point of view, formation of the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States is this nation's key trade focus. The WTO Doha Round negotiations have faded into the background as the Howard government has turned its full attention to the proposed FTA with the United States. So skewed has the government's focus become that yesterday the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, signalled that the government had just about given up on success at the World Trade Organisation. According to Mr Vaile: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... we cannot discount the possibility that the WTO round will not deliver a result—in agriculture, or in any other sector for that matter.</para></quote><para>This is the sort of defeatism that only a trade minister who is not up to the job would engage in. Success during the Doha Round is crucial for Australian exporters, particularly exporters of agricultural commodities. </para><para>Equally important to our agricultural sector is the maintenance of our quarantine barrier. In part, that is why the government's focus on an FTA with the United States is of such concern to so many of our rural industries. The fact is that the United States has our quarantine system firmly in its sights. I want to tell the Senate what the US administration told the US Senate about its ambitions for our quarantine system. The Bush administration's Special Trade Representative, Mr Robert Zoellick, wrote to the US Senate on 14 November last year. He said:</para><quote><para>We recognize that an FTA with Australia is of particular interest and concern to the U.S. agriculture community. Making progress on a number of issues of concern to U.S. agriculture will be essential for the successful conclusion of these negotiations.</para></quote><para>Mr Zoellick specifically identified our quarantine system as a target, again saying:</para><quote><para>... several US agriculture interests have raised serious concerns about Australia's use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as a means of restricting trade.</para></quote><para>For those who are not aware, that is a reference to the measures relevant to our quarantine system.</para><para>This week the Minister for Trade made a song and dance about Australia's objectives in respect of negotiations about an FTA with the United States. The government has been much more reluctant to tell the Australian community about the United States objectives, which include, in addition to diminishing our quarantine barrier, the dismantling of our single export desks for wheat, sugar and rice. On Tuesday this week, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, said the government would defend our quarantine system and the single desk. What he did not say is that these issues are on the table and subject to ongoing negotiations with the United States. How do we know this? Because that is what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Senator Cook and the estimates committee during the recent estimates round.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—They don't make the decision.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>—Order!

Just three weeks ago, Australia's senior free trade agreement negotiator told a Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade committee—and he should know—that:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The government's consistent position in relation to the FTA negotiations with the United States has been that no sector or issue would be excluded from the scope of the FTA negotiations.</para></quote><para>The clear position of the government is that no sector or issue is excluded from the scope of the free trade agreements negotiations. As a matter of fact, the committee was told that `nothing is ruled out'.</para><para>Compare that statement to the assurance given by the minister for agriculture to farmers earlier this week. Mr Truss said our quarantine system and the single desk would not be on the negotiating table. This government has a well-deserved reputation for verbal dexterity on matters of honesty. In this case Mr Truss, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the senior FTA negotiator cannot all be right. The government is running with the hares and hunting with the hounds: on the one hand, fronting up to Senate estimates and telling the truth—that is, that it is all laid out on the table and up for grabs: quarantine, the single desk, the lot— but, on the other hand, turning up to farming meetings and saying that the government would not think about giving up the right to manage our quarantine system. This issue is particularly important in the context of the import risk assessment management process that Senator Watson touched on. </para><para>I understand that informal discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and industry representatives have raised the outcome of the current import risk assessment processes concerning chicken meat, pig meat and citrus, which have been identified as matters that may be of interest to the US free trade agreement negotiators. The government says that the free trade agreement negotiations will not compromise the integrity of our quarantine standards. That is all well and good, but the government must also commit to ensuring that the integrity of the import risk assessment process will not be compromised. I am concerned that, while the priorities that underpin our quarantine standards may survive the FTA negotiations, they will survive in name only—that is, the integrity of the import risk assessment system will be diminished.</para><para>I am also concerned that the import risk assessment process will be compromised through reducing the number of steps in the process, the time available for each step in the process, or a combination of both of these actions. Taking short cuts in an IRA process is a dangerous move that may risk hundreds of thousands of rural and regional jobs. I understand the government is placing pressure on Biosecurity Australia to release a draft import risk assessment for uncooked chicken meat before serious negotiations with the United States commence. That would be a deadline based not on a considered process but on a need to gain some leverage in upcoming trade talks.</para><para>I am also aware that representatives from a company known as Smithfield, the third largest pork producer in the United States, were in Australia in January looking at strategies for marketing their product in this country—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—They might want to—</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Their product from the US, Senator Boswell. That company is clearly backing the Bush administration to get the right outcome on pig meat in the upcoming free trade agreement negotiations. Most of us have an understanding of the threat to our domestic industries from uncontrolled disease outbreaks. Australia is blessedly free from many animal and plant diseases that afflict our international competitors, but the difference between our situation and theirs is sliver thin. The only difference is the foresight of previous governments in establishing a comprehensive, rigorous and science based quarantine system—the system which complies with the WTO rules and serves our national interest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is vital that the government stands up and defends the integrity of our quarantine barrier. That is the clear message received by the committee in written submissions and evidence. It is a message that Labor acknowledges and understands. It is disappointing enough that the government has given up on the reform of agricultural trade barriers through the WTO, but I am calling on the Minister for Trade to reconsider his defeatist approach. I call on the government to come clean on what is really up for grabs during negotiations on the free trade agreement with the United States.</para><para>I want to congratulate the participants in the inquiry. I was not part of it, but I think it has done a very good job. I want to acknowledge the many individuals and organisations that provided submissions and evidence to the inquiry. The interest in the inquiry is due to the evidence of the important role that quarantine plays in protecting our rural industries, our natural environment and the health and welfare of the people of Australia. Any attempt by the Howard government to undermine our quarantine regime will be at its peril. I referred earlier to a document, a letter from Mr Zoellick, which I seek leave to table. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>9300</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought we would have a bit of relief from Senator O'Brien.

A public servant said one thing. Senator O'Brien, you know how this system works. It works through the minister making a decision. You come in here and try to confuse and upset people by trying to string together a few different arguments that are not related, from a few different people, then you draw a conclusion that the single desk policy is at risk and that we are going to open the doors of import risk assessment and put our primary industries at risk from all sorts of diseases.

Having been involved in both the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee and the legislation committee for a long time now, I have had a great interest in this. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, were involved, with me and other members of this chamber, in an inquiry which looked specifically into the issue of recruitment and retention of ADF personnel.</para><para>Given the increased tempo of the Australian defence forces, the follow-up report of the Australian National Audit Office is timely indeed. As in all audit office reports— and I have laid this criticism in this chamber before—I feel they have been a little bit too kind in their approach in dealing with this government agency. But, having said that, the report, in my brief read of it, does say that the ANAO have noted that there has been an improvement in retention since the last report they did, report No. 35 of 1999-2000, which was tabled on 3 April 2000. If that conclusion is correct—and I have no doubt that it is—it is welcome indeed. But the real question is: is the improvement enough?</para><para>My real concern goes to the initial stages of the report done by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the recruitment and retention of ADF personnel, when it tracked the number of reports that have been done into this specific issue over a period of time. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report said:</para><para>Over the last 20 years, there has been an extensive range of reports on the Australian Defence Force (ADF) touching on personnel issues. In fact, internal reports on personnel issues, especially on recruiting, have been issued about every two years. This plethora of reports has had the unfortunate consequence of maintaining the state of turmoil; they have not allowed Defence to settle down and work through a series of recommendations before the next report was issued.</para><para>That is a real concern. When we went out to the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation in Tuggeranong we saw such a range of reports there, and no sooner would one be produced than it would start to gather dust because there was another one produced that had superseded it. It raises concerns about where Defence are going.</para><para>When one reads the recommendations and the issues that were identified in that previous ANAO report, and we see that those issues were also identified in the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the issue—after a very thorough and intensive inquiry, I might add—one would expect that by now the Department of Defence would have moved on. But when one looks at just some of the recommendations that are in the report that has just been tabled, report No. 31 of 2002-03, one has just cause for concern.</para><para>If one looks at recommendation 1—and I am not going to read the whole of the recommendation but just that part that I think is appropriate—it says:</para><para>A project to assess the cost of replacing personnel is expected to be completed by 2004. </para><para>Given that the previous report of the ANAO was back in April 2000, and we had a Senate inquiry report in October 2001, finally we see in this report that Defence are getting around to assessing the cost of replacing personnel and are to complete this by 2004. Surely that is something that they could easily have got on top of a lot earlier, because it is one of the key issues in looking at the wastage that is occurring in retention of personnel in the Australian defence forces. One then goes on to recommendation 2, which says:</para><para>Specific responsibility for retention has been assigned to several organisational levels in defence.</para><para>Immediately I see that, I start to shudder, because it means that it is getting the good old shuffle around the Department of Defence once again. It goes on:</para><para>The Services ... are also working to refine the key drivers and the effects of retention issues.</para><para>Surely these have been canvassed enough over the years, going back, as I said, to the Hamilton report in 1986; the Cross report, which was a very comprehensive report making 48 recommendations, in 1988; the Glenn report in 1995, which made 120 recommendations; issues arising out of the Defence efficiency review back in 1997; the <inline font-style="italic">From phantom to force: towards a more efficient and effective Army</inline> of August 2000; and, of course, the Defence white paper itself.</para><para>One wonders what is really happening inside Defence. Are they just stalling once again to have appropriate reform take place so that the important issue of retention can be addressed? In recommendation 2, they go on to say:</para><quote><para>It is estimated this framework will be completed in July 2004. Personnel matters within Defence have been, and continue to be, the subject of new planning processes ...</para></quote><para>If anything has ever been planned, it must be personnel matters within Defence. They have been hauled over, they have been reviewed, they have been put under very close scrutiny over a long period of time and, with three fairly substantial reports on the status of retention and recruitment within the ADF, we find now that they are subject to a number of new planning processes. The report goes on to say that the proposed Defence people plan will continue to provide a vision and strategic guidance for Defence personnel policies, will specifically target recruitment and retention issues, and is to be considered by the Defence People Committee in 2003.</para><para>One would hope that we are going to see more activity than just these platitudes that are repeated in the ANAO report tabled here today. One would trust that there is more activity in the Department of Defence than is indicated here. Looking at the issue of education in this report, which is a real problem within the Department of Defence, would tickle the fancy of anyone. Young people, moving with defence families, find themselves the subject of a number of education systems throughout Australia because of the transfer system. This report alludes to the fact that Defence is continuing to use the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, together with ongoing discussions with state and territory education departments, to promote the educational interests of defence families. I met a young person the other day who, during their school career, had been to 13 different schools. Of course, that must have an impact on the continuity and quality of education they receive. In our Senate defence committee inquiry into the retention and recruitment in Defence, we found that that is a major issue. Here in this ANAO report we find that there are still ongoing discussions. This is something that has been the bane of Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiries over a long period of time. Former Senator West often spoke of the difficulties in this area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Responses to Senate Resolutions</title><page.no>9302</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>—I present various responses to resolutions of the Senate as listed at item 15(a) on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">The list read as follows—</inline></para><para>Response from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to a resolution of the Senate of 6 February 2003 concerning the use of nuclear weapons </para><para>Response from the Minister for Police and Emergency Services (Mr Wood MLA) to a resolution of the Senate of 11 December 2002 concerning the protection of unsupervised children</para><para>Response from the Premier of Western Australia (Dr Gallop MLA) to a resolution of the Senate of 9 December 2002 concerning photovoltaics in Australia</para></interjection></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>9303</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>9303</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This response from the Prime Minister is to a resolution of the Senate of 6 February, and is a particularly important response in the current context of Australian troops who are quite likely to shortly be committed to war in Iraq with troops from the US, the UK and possibly other nations. The resolution of the Senate specifically expressed opposition to any use of nuclear weapons in any conflict in Iraq and sought that the Prime Minister oppose any Australian involvement in a war where there was the possibility of nuclear weapons being used. It builds upon questions that were asked by the Australian Democrats of the Prime Minister's representative in this chamber, Senator Hill. These questions sought the Prime Minister's action in getting a clear-cut statement ruling out the possible use of nuclear weapons by the governments of the UK and the US. We wrote to the Prime Minister specifically asking him to use his so-called peace mission to the US and the UK, and to the United Nations, to get a clear-cut guarantee from those nations that they would not use nuclear weapons. What we have, in this response by the Prime Minister, is another occasion where he will not make a clear-cut statement, leaving himself wiggle room all the time. You wonder why the Australian people sense that there is something just not right at all about this whole plan for war when even on something as basic as the possible use of nuclear weapons you cannot get a clear-cut statement from the Prime Minister. His statement says:</para><para>At no point during my recent meetings in Washington and London was I given any cause for concern with regard to the threat or use of nuclear weapons ...</para><para>There is a big difference between not being given any cause for concern and being given a clear-cut guarantee that nuclear weapons will not be used. We all know, and the Australian public knows—they are not fools— that this Prime Minister is very good at not being told what he does not want to know. We have seen it with this Prime Minister in the children overboard affair amongst other things. People who have discussions and meetings such as these are clearly not going to raise anything. Who in their right mind would raise the possibility with the leader of another nation that nuclear weapons might be used if that leader has said that if he knows there is going to be the use of nuclear weapons Australia will not be involved? Of course they are not going to tell him, which is why the Prime Minister should have asked for—it is pretty straightforward—and received a clear-cut guarantee. Simply providing this misleading half statement to the Senate in this response to the Senate's resolution, saying that he had not been given any cause for concern, is simply not good enough. It is the sort of diplomatic doublespeak that might sound fine on the surface but is clearly not convincing. If he did get a clear-cut guarantee he would say so. So, again, you have to wonder why he didn't get it and why he won't make such a simple straightforward statement.</para><para>From the Democrats' point of view, it is another indication of the approach this government has taken in leading Australia into an unjust and unnecessary war, tying us immovably to the foreign policy objectives of United States and ignoring the multilateral frameworks for peaceful disarmament. Every step of the way there has been obfuscation. There has been an unwillingness to provide information to the Australian people. There has been a lack of interest in providing information to the parliament. There has been continual dodging and weaving about what decisions were made when and what the decisions actually mean. We still have the pretence being followed that, somehow or other, it is actually a realistic possibility that if war starts the Australian government may still decide to turn our troops around and pull out. That is an absurd concept, as every Australian knows, yet we still have the Australian Prime Minister continuing to hold up this fiction that no decision has been made and Australia may still decide not to participate in any war that starts. </para><para>We had the fiction today and yesterday when the Prime Minister and Minister Hill said that no decision would be made until UN processes were finalised. When pressed on what that meant in question time today, it quite clearly meant nothing of the sort. It meant, `If we don't get what we want out of the UN then we'll look at the situation and do something else if we so decide.' This continual sophistry and the Prime Minister's lack of being direct, straightforward and up-front is part of the reason why so many Australians are apprehensive and very concerned about the prospect of war. They know the case does not stack up. They know that the arguments are flimsy and the justifications are poor. When you continue to get from the Prime Minister these half answers, containing escape clauses, as some kind of response to a clear-cut resolution of the Senate, it is no wonder that the Australian people do not support this approach. </para><para>For the Prime Minister to get a clear-cut guarantee from his allies that they will not use nuclear weapons is a simple request and, one would have thought, a simple thing to achieve. The reason why these questions continue to be asked and the reason why the Senate supported this resolution on 10 February is that Prime Minister Blair and the UK defence secretary, Mr Hoon, continually refuse to answer—using the usual diplomatic trick of neither confirming or denying and saying that it is hypothetical and all those sorts of tricks—the straightforward question: is there any prospect of nuclear weapons being used? As Mr Howard says in the response, `I see no prospect of nuclear weapons being used.' It is easy not to see something if you do not want to look, but that is simply not good enough for something as fundamental as this. </para><para>Let us remember that one of the key justifications for this potential conflict is disarmament. President Bush was on the television again today saying, `We will disarm Saddam Hussein.' That is good. Everyone wants to do that. The Democrats say we should ensure peaceful disarmament and let the current processes through the UN run their course and not cut them short because they do not meet the US timetable. If we are seriously considering doing this as a government and as a nation—because if the government decides to pull us into war our nation will, for better or worse, be at war— supposedly we are doing that predominantly for disarmament. However, one of the key issues that would undercut any prospect of genuine disarmament around the globe is the use of nuclear weapons. It would dramatically annihilate any prospect of serious disarmament. If we are serious about disarmament, it cannot stop at Saddam Hussein. There has to be a genuine global commitment—a commitment globally that seems to have weakened in recent years, I might add—for disarmament across the board with other nations building on the frameworks, conventions and agreements to reduce those weapons and particularly weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons.</para><para>For the UK to refuse to rule out the use of those weapons, and for many senior US officials, including their defence secretary, to have repeatedly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons—leaving aside any prospect that Australia could be party to an action that may lead to our side using nuclear weapons—is grossly irresponsible. There should be no wriggle room. There should be no room for doubt or for manoeuvre. There should be no prospect whatsoever of that. Any risk is too big a risk in this area. I acknowledge that some people who are genuinely concerned about weapons of mass destruction argue about humanitarian issues in Iraq. Some people, whose views I respect, say that the choice is difficult, but there is a case. The Democrats believe that that case has not been made by a long shot, but I recognise some people believe that. However, if people feel that there is some need for war as a difficult, hard and unfortunate choice, the least they can do is ensure that there is a cast-iron guarantee that nuclear weapons will not be used. The Prime Minister has failed to get that guarantee from the UK and the US governments when he is in the perfect position to get it, and he has failed to give that guarantee to the Australian people despite being given the opportunity by the Senate's resolution. In his response to the Senate today he has once again left the door open and refused to make a simple, clear-cut, categorical statement of absolute certainty. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>9305</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister has been very duplicitous on this matter. He initially said, and he reiterates this in his letter to the Senate, that if he believed that nuclear weapons were going to be used, he would not allow Australian forces to be involved. His original statement on that led me to put the motion before the Senate, which the Senate supported, that, during his trip to Washington and to London, he should put to President Bush and to Prime Minister Blair the Australian position that no nuclear weapons should be used in any war with Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>If you read the Prime Minister's letter carefully—and you have to read between the lines with this Prime Minister—he did not do that. The Prime Minister did not have the gumption when speaking about war preparations with President Bush or Prime Minister Blair to say, `I am not going to allow Australian defence personnel to be involved in a war where there is even the smallest potential for nuclear weapons to be used.' He did not have the gumption to say that on behalf of the Australian people, let alone on behalf of the 2,000 defence personnel he has placed in that theatre of war. The Prime Minister quite clearly should have had the guts to raise the issue because it has been raised in the international media. In fact, it has not just been raised out of thin air; it has come from US defense sources. They leave open the option of using nuclear weapons—so-called bunker busters—if needs be. It is a remote chance, but that option is left open. The President of the United States, no less, has refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons.</para><para>Australians would be appalled by the use of nuclear weapons. But this Prime Minister will not say, `Australian Defence Force personnel are not going if nuclear weapons could potentially be used.' This Prime Minister does not have the gumption to say to the President of the United States, `I want you to clearly rule out nuclear weapons.' That is what the Senate asked him to do, and that is what commonsense says he should do, but he did not do it—and ditto for London and Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is irresponsible of Prime Minister Howard. He said that he would rule out our troops being in Iraq if there was a chance that nuclear weapons would be used, but he failed to clear the air on the matter when he could have. He told the Senate:</para><quote><para>At no point during my recent meetings in Washington and London was I given any cause for concern with regard to the threat or use of nuclear weapons should there be conflict in Iraq.</para></quote><para>Because he did not ask, and that was stupid and irresponsible. That was a prime minister tugging his forelock to George W. Bush. Our Prime Minister does have a subservient attitude to the President of the United States if he is unable to raise a question like this, eyeball him and say: `No nuclear weapons, George, or Australia is not going to be there. Let's clear the air on that.' Prime Minister John Winston Howard does not have the gumption, so the spectre of nuclear weapons, however dim, remains hanging over the potential for war—which is effectively a reality now—with Iraq.</para><para>Many of us here will remember the threat by President Nixon of the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam. The world was horrified. When you look at the character of that president, you can see that that threat had to be taken seriously. We have to remember that there is only one country on the face of this earth that has ever used nuclear weapons in conflict, and that is the United States of America. The Iraqis do not have the wherewithal; they do not have nuclear weapons. The biggest arsenal in the world is under the control of George W. Bush. The reports coming from his camp—and maybe they are just to frighten Saddam Hussein, but nevertheless they are reported in the American and world media—say that there are exigencies where bunker buster nuclear weapons are going to be used in this war. </para><para>The Senate told our Prime Minister, when he left to go to the United States and Britain, to raise the issue and clear the air on this. He did not do that, and instead he sends this fob-off, pathetic letter to us. The Prime Minister has squibbed on this. He has squibbed on the right of his Defence Force personnel to know that nuclear weapons are ruled out as far as the coming conflict is concerned. He has let them down. These are the very people he went to see off. They have a right to maximum security and backing from their government, but they do not get it when it counts. </para><para>We know the fear there is about having injections to vaccinate against anthrax and smallpox, which personnel could be exposed to in this war. We know the division of feeling there is about that among our Defence Force personnel. Let none of us believe that the spectre of even the smallest chance of nuclear weapons being used in this war is not a matter of enormous concern to our Defence Force personnel, their families and this country. The Prime Minister has let the country down once again. He has let the troops down, and he cannot say, `I didn't know,' because the Senate asked him specifically, days before he went, to speak to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. He did not and he sends this pathetic response to the Senate. Let that be on his record, and let us all pray that nuclear weapons do not enter into the coming conflict which Prime Minister John Howard supports and to which he has sent our Defence Force personnel to engage in against the wishes of the majority of the people of this country. But it should not be left to us to pray that that will be the outcome. The chance of this should have been eliminated, but the Prime Minister failed when he had the opportunity to do just that.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>9306</page.no><id.no>R1671</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>9306</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator ELLISON (Western Australia— Minister for Justice and Customs) (6.14 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>9306</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>9306</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill makes a secret ballot of employees a precondition for protected industrial action.</para><para>This bill is identical to one introduced into the House of Representatives on 20 February 2002, which was rejected by the Senate on 25 September 2002.</para><para>A secret ballot is a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action.

When this matter was considered in the Senate on the last occasion, the Labor Party successfully moved a number of amendments to this legislation. The Labor Party took a positive approach in addressing a number of issues and in successfully moving amendments that relate broadly to issues such as the ability of the commission to place some greater restrictions on legal representation and the associated costs. There was an amendment on the publication of guidance information by the minister and a further amendment allowing for the grouping of unfair dismissal claims where they have occurred at the same time in relation to more than one employee of a single employer. </para><para>The major issue of contention is the successful move by the Australian Labor Party to not remove from federal legislation and from federal awards provisions that entitle employees of small business to argue a case of unfair dismissal in front of the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In the Senate the Labor Party has removed a provision that the Liberal government was attempting to have passed which removes a fundamental protection and security and right of employees of small business where they believe they have been unfairly dismissed—and I would acknowledge it is a small number of cases where a small number of small businesses behave prima facie incorrectly and do not follow due process in dismissing employees—to argue for their reinstatement and/or compensation in front of the independent industrial commission. </para><para>The Liberal government's legislation removes that basic, fundamental right and security and protection from small business employees in respect of the federal industrial relations jurisdiction. We estimate that this would remove that right and protection and security from the 30 to 40 per cent of small business employees who are covered by the federal industrial relations jurisdiction. The Labor Party will maintain its position and will vote tonight to reject the message from the Liberal government. We believe that all Australian workers have a fundamental right to security and protection and a fair go—the right to argue in an independent commission that they have been unfairly dismissed. It is a right to argue; it is a right to present a case. They may not win their case but they should at least have a right to argue the case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Half don't win their case.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—That is exactly right; I take the interjection of Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Where they do present an argument, half of them do not win their case. But at least they have a right to argue their case, a right to be heard and a right for that case to be determined by an independent industrial commission. It is interesting to observe that this so-called `fair dismissal' legislation applies to the federal industrial jurisdiction but does not remove that right in respect of all the state industrial commissions which allow the right for small business employees to argue a case. This legislation does not propose—indeed it cannot—to take away the right of small business employees to argue a case in state industrial jurisdictions. </para></talk.start></continue><para>If the message from the government were accepted and if this legislation were accepted, you would have two categories of small business employees in Australia: those in the federal jurisdiction, the 30 to 40 per cent of small business employees who would have no right at all and who would have had their right to argue a case removed by this legislation; and those in the state industrial jurisdictions who work for small business and who would still have a right. We would have, of course, another category of employees who work for a so-called `large business' of more than 20 employees in the federal jurisdiction who would have an ongoing right to argue for basic security and protection and the right to argue that their dismissal was unfair.</para><para>This matter has been before the Senate on, I think, seven or eight occasions. The Labor Party will not be backing down. It will not be changing its mind. It will not agree to the removal from a substantial number of Australian employees the fundamental right to have their day in front of the independent industrial commission to argue that they have been unfairly dismissed. The Labor Party believes that it is fundamental in Australian political culture that all Australian citizens have a right to their day in court if they so choose. A Liberal government wants to remove that right for a considerable number, probably a million plus, of Australian workers. That is unacceptable to the Australian Labor Party. It is a fundamental principle from which it will not be backing down.</para><para>I have indicated that there were a number of amendments. The Labor Party took a positive approach to this legislation. It successfully moved what would be considered to be minor amendments in the context of the issue I have been discussing but, nevertheless, they are important amendments because they improve the process of unfair dismissal for small business. But the Liberal government cannot even see that these amendments improve the process of considering an application of unfair dismissal by a small business employee in the federal jurisdiction. </para><para>As I said earlier, I think this matter has been debated by the Senate seven or eight times. The Labor Party has not changed its view, and it will not be supporting the message from the Liberal government in the House of Representatives. It will not back down on the fundamental principle of protecting small business employees and providing security for them in the federal jurisdiction. As a consequence, if this message is rejected, the government has two or, possibly, three options. Firstly, it will have established a trigger for a double dissolution election. Of course, exercising the use of that trigger is a decision for the Liberal-National Party. Secondly, it can choose not to proceed with what the Labor Party believes is an unfair approach which removes essential protections and securities and removes the fundamental legal right of all Australians to a fair go to argue, in this case, in an independent industrial tribunal. That is the Liberal government's call. That is a decision that it will have to make on the assumption that the Senate continues on the path of ensuring that small business employees continue to be protected and continue to have a right to argue for unfair dismissal in the federal industrial commission.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>9309</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The starting point for me is the question of whether the truth is being told in this matter.

There was the claim that getting rid of a couple of thousand unfair dismissal applications involving small business under federal law would result in 50,000 jobs. The trouble is that the Senate record shows that the person who originated that claim is the head of COSBOA. He told the Senate committee quite clearly how he did it. It was a thumb-suck; it was an off-the-cuff remark. Subsequently, he recanted that claim. However, ever since, the government has hung its hat on that specific claim.</para><para>I want to return to a more immediate bit of excessive hyperbole and exaggeration. Senator Ian Campbell, who otherwise is a very nice man, gave a radio interview—and he can correct me if the record shows otherwise—in which I recall him saying that the Senate opposes legislation all the time, that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats should stop being negative all the time and should stop opposing for the sake of opposing, and that we do not have any alternative policy ideas. Those comments were made with a view to persuading the people of Australia that the non-government parties in the Senate behave in a particularly obstructive and destructive way, and with a view to trying to insist that the executive government of this country has an authoritarian right to impose its will.</para><para>Let us look at the facts and at this idea that the Labor Party and the Democrats are negative and oppose legislation all the time. Let us start, if we may, with the period when Labor were in government. You would assume that the coalition would let through every single bill. Of course, they did not. In conjunction with the Democrats, they quite properly stopped certain legislation going through. For the period May 1990 to December 1992, 602 bills were passed by the Senate; two bills were negatived. Again, under the Labor government, from the period May 1993 until December 1995, 496 bills were passed by the Senate and seven were negatived. I assume that at that stage Senator Ian Campbell was in the chamber and would have participated in opposing bills, quite properly and well done for it. For the period May 1996 to July 1998—this is the first period in which the coalition were in power— 427 bills were passed by the Senate and two were negatived by the Senate. For the period November 1998 to September 2001, 582 bills were passed by the Senate and 14 were negatived. </para><para>The number of bills passed from February 2002 to 3 March was 162 bills in 123 packages. Six bills were negatived by the Senate: the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits-Budget Measures) Bill, in June 2002; the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill, in August 2002 and March 2003; the Workplace Relations (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill, in September 2002—voted against, I seem to recall, by the government—the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill, in November 2002; and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill, in December 2002. </para><para>Three bills have been laid aside by the House with unacceptable Senate amendments: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill, in June 2002; the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill, in September 2002; and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill, in December 2002. </para><para>The point is that the people of Australia were misled by the view of the parliamentary secretary, who carried the debate on this bill and who is the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. He misled the people of Australia over the behaviour of the non-government parties in the Senate. But he is truthful in saying that some bills were rejected—he did not say `some bills'; he said `lots' or `all' or `many'—because the Senate is the only chamber, unlike the house of the executive, which is sometimes called the House of Representatives, where legislation is productively debated, often clause by clause, where expert and community input into that legislation is invited by the Senate's committee system and where it is possible to make the government of the day accountable. They have to justify their legislation. They cannot just impose it.</para><para>There is another bit of information which concerned me in terms of its accuracy. In a press release on Sunday, 2 March 2003 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, said:</para><quote><para>Opposition parties have voted against the unfair dismissal legislation 27 times.</para></quote><para>I do not know how that figure is arrived at. I went back and checked. Perhaps you can substantiate it. Unfair dismissal and small business legislation, as I have it, have been rejected in seven bills. Maybe there have been more but these are the only ones I can find. The first is the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill in 1997, which was negatived at the second reading on 21 October 1997. </para><para>By the way, you might recall that in the debate I said that the Democrats had an agreement with the government that there would be a fair go all round and that fair dismissals would apply for all workers— every worker would be entitled to access unfair dismissal legislation. I said that the government had made a public commitment in the 1996 election that all workers would be covered by unfair dismissal legislation. In response, the parliamentary secretary said: `Ah, but we went to the election in 1998 and 2001 with a changed policy and we have the mandate of the people.' I will remind you that the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill in 1997, after our agreement but before the next election, actually reneged on our deal. That was negatived at the second reading on 21 October 1997.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 No. 2 was negatived at the second reading on 25 March 1998. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 was negatived at the second reading on 14 August 2000. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 No. 2 was negatived at the second reading on 26 March 2001. In the case of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment (Small Business and Other Measures) Bill 2002, which was introduced to the House of Representatives on 30 August 2001, an election was called before the bill was dealt with in the House of Representatives. The Workplace Relations (Fair Dismissals) Bill 2002 was laid aside by the House of Representatives on 28 June 2002 with unacceptable Senate amendments. The Workplace Relations (Fair Dismissals) Bill 2002 No. 2 passed the Senate on 3 March 2003 with amendments yet to be considered by the House of Representatives. I am sorry to take you through that litany but that says to me seven bills, not 27 times. But perhaps the parliamentary secretary can justify it. </para><para>My point is that I do not see why on radio that night Senator Ian Campbell felt the need to exaggerate. I think he is right. I think his constituency absolutely supports the coalition campaign to get rid of unfair dismissal legislation, not just for small business workers but for all business workers. I think that is so. But the fact is that the parties which represent the rest of the Australian population do not support that, and that is a debate contest. You do not need to say that the Senate opposes legislation all the time—I have read you the record that it does not—or that it has been voted against 27 times when I can find only seven bills.</para><para>The other thing that emerged since the debate which interested me—and I was interested to hear Senator Coonan recounting from the document today—was the OECD Economic Survey into Australia, March, 2003. It says at page 80:</para><quote><para>OECD assessments consistently show that Australia's employment protection legislation is one of the least strict in the OECD area—</para></quote><para>this is March 2003—</para><quote><para>the only countries with more relaxed EPL being the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland. Australia's strictness of EPL ranks particularly low with regard to procedural requirements in the case of individual dismissal and on the criteria used in the compensation given for unfair dismissal.</para></quote><para>This is despite the fact that many of the states have more rigorous regimes than does the federal regime. The report continues:</para><quote><para>Employee conduct in economic redundancy or retrenchment are legitimate grounds for dismissal. There are also relatively low legal requirements for notice periods. In addition, regulations for temporary employment are comparatively light-handed. There are no restrictions on the type of work or areas of economic activity where temporary work agencies can become active. Current legislation neither specifies a maximum number of successive contracts or contract renewals. It is likely to have played a facilitative role in the adoption of new techniques such as ICT, which often require changes in personnel.</para></quote><para>My interpretation is that they are saying we are an easy to dismiss country where flexibility in work practices contributes to job growth and performance. To be fair, the article does then go on to quote the Harding report. It does go on to say that the government is attempting to make further changes to make it even easier. But Australia is not regarded by the OECD at least as a repressive regime which restricts job growth. It has been included in an overall report which ticks off Australia very well as a highly productive and performing economy.</para><para>The points I want to conclude with are as follows: we and my party, who are not beholden to either business or the unions, have the view that the evidence does not show that you should be taking away the human rights of individuals in employment circumstances where they have been unfairly dismissed. When this legislation was defined and set out originally we know that all parties agreed to the 1996 election commitment that all workers would have unfair dismissal coverage. We believe that the government invented this bill and type of approach solely to provide double dissolution triggers, and they have used them for that purpose for three elections. We believe that no evidence has been proven to show the actual job consequence of getting rid of unfair dismissals. We accept that getting rid of impediments to how you hire and fire do indeed affect the mentality of people when they hire and fire, but quite properly they are therefore more careful about the people they hire and they are therefore more careful about the means by which they dismiss them. </para><para>Our view remains that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill is a contrived bill and it should not be supported. But our view remains, as does the Labor Party's view, that the unfair dismissal regime does need further reform. And we and they, I am sure, will contribute to further reform of the processes concerned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>9312</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With the exception of the last few minutes, Senator Murray has spent the last 15 minutes responding to my claim that the opposition parties—particularly the Labor Party and the Democrats—in relation to this measure and some other key budget measures including the PBS reforms that were negatived by the Senate yesterday—were oppositionist. As I said in an interview on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program, they displayed an oppositionist mentality. It was negative and carping. It also defined the Labor Party because they define themselves by what they oppose not what they propose. I stand by that.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murray has had to show a sensitivity to being exposed as being part of a trenchant opposition to a number of measures. It is not entirely fair on the Democrats because they have, particularly where he has been involved, shown an openness to negotiating and trying to get better public policy— and I commend him for that. But I stand by my claims that the government has been re-elected twice on a mandate—and I think he respects this—to reform unfair dismissal laws, particularly in relation to small business.</para><para>Senator Murray described me as a nice guy—I do not know whether I would do that or not. I try to be nice sometimes and it is struggle sometimes, but I am sure I can be grumpy, nasty and horrible sometimes as well. I do try to be nice, unlike Senator Murray who is nice almost all of the time.

But you have admitted that you at least thought I was a nice guy, perhaps just because I buy you the odd brandy or so—and we are cooking up some reform on alcohol taxation behind the Treasurer's back. Senator Murray, against his better judgment, because he is very sensitive about this obstructionist tag, would respect the fact that when the government loses measures that are close to its heart and to its program we are not likely to go on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program and say, `Sorry, we will try harder next time.' </para></talk.start></continue><para>We are very committed to this reform. Small business are committed to it. The trouble is small business are a minority. They do not have a powerful trade union representative. They are disorganised in terms of a national structure. Small business people, as Senator Murray knows, spend an enormous amount of their waking hours just trying to pay the bills and the rent and put food on the table for their families. They do not have a lot of time to get involved in political activity. They do not have a trade union. They do not have a union structure that puts the representatives of the labour movement into the Senate on an almost guaranteed set of railway tracks. They are not organised; they are a minority. But they feel very strongly about this measure. We feel strongly not only because they do but also because we believe that it will in fact improve employment opportunities for the most disadvantaged people in Australia.</para><para>Senator Murray wants to have a piece of the best econometric modelling in the country which will give him a cast-iron guarantee that it will create 50,000 new jobs before he will even contemplate putting this measure into place. His main argument is that we do not have any evidence to show that it will create that outcome, so he is not prepared to buy it. I doubt that we could buy the research that Senator Murray wants.</para><para>In relation to his attack on my truthfulness, I have said that this is an oppositionist and obstructionist Senate. If you analyse the figures that Senator Murray quoted to the Senate about the number of bills negatived under the previous Labor governments—the terms of the Hawke and Keating governments—and our government, they show that this is in fact the most obstructionist Senate, in those terms, that there has been. I am happy to analyse and debate that at another time, but the Senate has opposed a number of serious measures that are at the core of this government's program. The Senate has the right to do that, and I will defend that right. But if you are going to do that, please accept the political responsibility for doing it. The government wants to put a program in place to deliver economic reform, economic growth, job security and enhanced employment prospects. You do not get job security by locking people into jobs that they are not suited to. </para><para>In defence of my truthfulness in relation to this, the opposition's record on defeating unfair dismissal reform goes back to 1996. The opposition had voted against these measures 27 times up till when I made the claim, 28 times by Monday, 29 times by the debate in the House of Representatives yesterday and, I suspect, 30 times by tonight.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Haven't you got the message by now?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I will table—in fact, I will give it to Senator Murray over a brandy later—the full list of the number of times the Australian Labor Party have voted against unfair dismissal laws. I hope he will accept that they had voted against it on 28 occasions up till Monday and, in about one minute's time, it will be 30 times in both chambers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So we get the message that Labor do not want to reform unfair dismissal laws. They do not want to help small business. They are beholden to their trade union roots. They are beholden to their vested interest of supporting their mates in the trade unions. They care about the rights of people who are members of unions and who have jobs. We care about those people too, but we also want to give other people who do not have a job an opportunity to get a job and to get the self-esteem and economic opportunities that attach to having employment. We want to build an opportunity society not just for trade union members, trade union bosses and trustees of trade union superannuation organisations; we want to build an opportunity society for the people who are least able to defend themselves because they are not a member of the Labor Party or a member of a trade union. The government will insist on this bill.

That is the section that relates to the Australian Health Ethics Committee and the Australian Law Reform Commission's joint report into the issue of human genetic information. Members in this place would know that this is an issue that the Democrats have had a long-running interest in. I would like to begin by commending the ALRC and the Australian Health Ethics Committee for their joint inquiry. They have yet to present their final report into the protection of human genetic information; however, the comprehensive discussion papers that have been provided so far through a series of wide-ranging consultations are impressive indeed.</para><para>Most people in this place, particularly those involved in the stem cell and other science debates recently, would recall that genetic information is often predictive rather than prescriptive. There are some specific ethical and certainly privacy issues that relate to this information. Also, in Australia we have yet to come up with a comprehensive regulatory regime that seeks to protect people's personal information—that is, their genetic information—DNA, for example. We have no state laws, and certainly no federal laws, that specifically refer to the special characteristics of genetic information and thus seek to guard it in a way that ensures that people not only have confidence that that information is protected but also that it cannot be used in any form of discrimination against them.</para><para>In late 2000 the government announced a joint committee inquiry into genetic privacy. I am glad to see some of the recommendations and some of the debates that have surrounded this joint inquiry and I look forward to seeing some legislation, some regulatory system, emerge as a consequence of the work that has been done. One of the recommendations that has come out of this inquiry is the establishment of a Human Genetics Commission of Australia—the HGCA. That was recommended through the discussion papers, particularly the one released last August. I think honourable senators should look at some of those recommendations, but that one in particular. I think it is a very good idea to establish such a genetics commission.</para><para>For issues as complex as the protection of the genetic information of humans, I think detailed consideration must be provided. The best way of doing that would be through an independent, stand-alone statutory authority such as the proposed commission. It is intended that that body would provide high-level technical advice about human genetics and, of course, advice on the ethical, legal and social implications that arise from the advances in biotechnology. I agree that the commission should liaise closely with other government departments, authorities and entities to provide a national and coordinated approach to the protection of genetic information. However, the requirement for wide-ranging consultation should not be so onerous that the entire process is allowed to delay the introduction of federal laws to protect genetic information.</para><para>While I commend the work of the committee, and it is certainly outlined in the report before us this evening, the instigation of that inquiry was long overdue. It has been a long time coming. When I first introduced some of these issues to the Senate back in 1998—and certainly as others before me have done, such as my predecessor, Senator John Coulter—it was described as simplistic, futuristic or just not necessary. Since 1998 and the Senate committee report into my private member's bill in 1999, we have fully-fledged, documented cases of genetic discrimination in this country—cases of people who have applied for bank loans and have been denied bank loans on the basis of their genetic information or indeed information that suggests that they could get a disease at a certain point in time, or people who have been discriminated against in employment situations. It is time for law; it is time for regulation. I look forward to seeing the final report. I urge members of the Senate to consider such a regulatory approach in the near future.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Biotechnology Centre of Excellence</title><page.no>9315</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>9315</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>The Allen report was tabled this morning. That report is a whitewash of the decision by a panel recommending the grant of $43.55 million to Dr Trounson's National Stem Cell Centre. Saying it is a whitewash is no reflection at all on Mr Allen or the Allen group. The fact is that the Allen report was written to address very narrow terms of reference which ignored the central ethical issue of funding human embryo experimentation. It will be said that these will go through a human research ethics committee, but they are institutional committees and are not answerable to the public. The grant was for activities that are contrary to Victorian law and the grant pre-empted parliamentary debate on human embryo research legislation.</para><para>In August last year the Prime Minister announced that the government would be reviewing the May funding decision to award the money to the National Stem Cell Centre. The centre will undertake experiments on human embryonic stem cells derived from the destruction of human embryos. It was 10 weeks between the Prime Minister's announcement and the tabling of this report. Again I say that the report is in fact a whitewash because of the narrow terms of reference.</para><para>The concerns I raised earlier have not been addressed. The report is limited to examining the bureaucratic selection process for awarding the grant. But the selection panel, which was heavily influenced by commercialism and persons with drug company interests, made no ethical evaluation whatsoever of the proposal. In addition to that, no evidence was provided in the application of any proof of concept that there was a likelihood of funding cures for diseases using this money, let alone proof of actual cures anywhere in the world using human embryonic stem cells. Mr Allen nevertheless highlighted a number of disturbing trends, including the involvement of a concentration of experts `in peer review in grant making, complicated by the inevitable interconnection between their institutions and research programs'.</para><para>In December I called on the Prime Minister to give an undertaking that this funding would be supervised by an independent and publicly accountable ethics body. Without this guarantee, ethical review of the Stem Cell Centre will be undertaken by an in-house ethics group whose members will be appointed by the centre itself. The centre will not of course appoint people who are likely to slow or interfere with its work. The Prime Minister has not responded as yet to that call, and I urge him to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>9315</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline font-style="italic">Review of the National Biotechnology Centre of Excellence selection </inline><inline font-style="italic">process </inline>makes it clear that there are numerous potential conflicts of interest in this matter, as I and others have sought to show.

I would like to make some general remarks this evening about the obligations that we have to listen to each other and to consider each other's views rather than the opportunities that we have to slag off at each other because we are on different sides of politics. I am talking about when someone has a different view in the community generally rather than in this chamber. </para></talk.start><para>This proposition was brought to my attention recently because a mate of mine who had a very strongly different view from mine on a relatively minor issue became exasperated when he was arguing his case because of questions and counterarguments that I would put. He then tried on me the oldest trick in the book, which all of us, in opposition and in government, would have had played on us. He said: `Look, am I just wasting my time? Haven't you made up your mind on this issue?' I thought: `Hello! Are these the words of someone who has made up his mind on the issue but expects me to keep an open one?' We would all have found this to be a common situation; one that politicians are often afflicted with. People approach us, they expect us to have an open mind to their view, but they do not have necessarily have an open mind to our view and certainly do not have an open mind to the views that others express.</para><para>This is not unusual. All of us will have had the experience, in opposition and in government, of people expecting politicians to agree with them. That is just par for the course. Many will have experienced being told that they are weak, lily-livered populists—people unwilling to lead. When we choose to do something that is popular, that a Joe Citizen happens to not agree with at the time, Joe Citizen will say we are weak, lily-livered and unwilling to lead. He will remind us that you cannot lead from behind; you cannot lead by following opinion polls. However, when we do something unpopular, it may well be that the same Joe Citizen will claim that we simply do not understand; that we are servants of the people, polling clearly shows what the people want and we should follow what they want.</para><para>Generally, I welcome dissent. I enjoy the battle of ideas. I think the voice of dissent is the bell of freedom. But I do think we need more respect for the views of others and we are entitled to get in return, if we give that, more respect for our own views. The bell of freedom can be extremely frustrating, and I think never more so for me at the moment than in relation to a potential war in the Middle East. I have never thought that free speech means that person A gets the right to speak and person B must listen but person A does not have to listen. It does not mean you must listen to me because I have got free speech and you have to hear my views but, by the way, I am not going to stay around and listen to yours. Free speech does not mean that; it is meaningless if you try to attribute that process to it.</para><para>I completely accept that there are many people who hold very genuine reasons for believing that Saddam Hussein should be given more time, that he should have been believed in the first place or that some additional form of appeasement should be endorsed. I do not happen to agree with any of the views I have heard so far, but I accept that there are people who genuinely hold those views, and I welcome a proper airing of them and a further airing of them if anyone feels they have not properly had their say. But I would also welcome those people having the good grace to listen to alternative views, just as I argue theirs should be listened to.</para><para>What I do find somewhat repugnant is a view by some who were protesting a few weekends ago that somehow, because they were protesting, they were right and that the rest of us should understand that there were hundreds of thousands of people out there so we all have to agree with them. I find equally repugnant the proposition: `Because I am protesting, I care and it follows that the rest of you do not.' I am sure the rest of us do. Even people who disagree with the prospect of a war and did not protest, care; and certainly those who might see it as being more inevitable than otherwise, nonetheless care. Perhaps the most offensive of the propositions is: `I'm opposed to war'—as if it follows that anyone else is in favour of a war; as if anybody could be in favour of that as an ideal option. And then there is the ever present: `I want peace. I want to march for peace. I feel good about it. I have made a contribution. I can go home and have my yum cha and tell my grandchildren I played a part.' As if anybody I know would not prefer peace— yet it is the somehow smug and condescending attitude of some of the protesters and some of the people participating in this debate to make the immediate assumption that, because they do not want war and they do want peace, everyone else has the contrary view. That is simply not the case. </para><para>I would like to make the point, although it probably does not need to be made, of how horrific war is. People die. Families are shattered. Civilian deaths are quite chillingly referred to as collateral damage. But, despite the horrors of any war, there is a certain type of honesty to it in the sense that it is missing of the covert acts of terrorism that we see. There is a warning, there is a build-up, there are rules of engagement, there is the Geneva convention. As ghastly as it is, it is conducted in some type of order. It is quite the opposite to terrorism, where there are no rules of engagement. The Geneva convention is not recognised by terrorists and they would not see it as being applicable to them. Terrorism is quite the opposite to war: military targets and military personnel are not the focus; civilians are. So, pretty clearly, I would have a preference for one over the other.</para><para>The horrors of Saddam's regime have been terribly well documented. I have not heard anybody arguing that it is a great regime. I have heard arguments for believing him or giving him more time and more appeasement. I have not seen a better outline of the horrors of that regime, and the people who have assessed it as being horrific, than an article by Paul Kelly in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> last Wednesday, entitled `Craven trudge to a moral morass'. I would like to remind those who take some comfort from recent concessions that they are concessions, they are not cooperation. They have not been made willingly and they have only been made because of a building threat of war against Saddam Hussein. I hope the UN debate expands the coalition of the willing and I hope the words of a former Secretary-General about the UN, that it is there not to take us to heaven but to save us from going to hell, are borne in mind.</para><para>Lastly, I draw attention to remarks made by a United States admiral, who visited here in the 1980s for one of the Coral Sea commemorative services, which as you know we have in Australia in early May. He reminded the people present that Australian servicemen lie in graves all over the world, but he made the point:</para><quote><para>... the only territory which Australia has won from those wars is the soil in which its dead lie.</para></quote><para>That is an important point to understand: Australians have never gone to war to take other peoples' property or land. He says:</para><quote><para>... the Australian came as a liberator and ... died with his allies in a common quest to turn back the tide of aggression.</para></quote><para>He goes on to point out that Australians have always acted on the belief that the security of the free world is indivisible. I think that is a very important point. I have heard people say, `This isn't our problem. This is far away.' He congratulated Australia on being, in this century, a model of a distant country that has recognised the responsibilities of free men everywhere and who have sent their sons to fight, and sometimes to die, for those responsibilities. Everyone I know hopes that that does not have to happen, just as we hope that our policemen, on a day-to-day basis, do not lose their lives when protecting the rest of us. Finally, he says:</para><quote><para>Australians have stood and died with other free men in defence of others, just as American sailors stood and died in defence of others here in Australia and in the Coral Sea.</para></quote><para>I think it is worth asking ourselves where we would be if people in the United States had said at that time, `That is on a distant shore; it is not our problem.'</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Townsville</title><page.no>9318</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>9318</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to provide the Senate with some clarity about reported events that involve the member for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, making comments about harassment of Defence Force personnel in Townsville in mid-February. I am motivated to provide this explanation for a number of reasons. Firstly, there has been some local and national coverage of Mr Lindsay's allegations and it is of concern to me that the level of accuracy in the coverage varied considerably. Secondly, on returning to Canberra this week, I was concerned at the number of my colleagues who expressed concern to me that ADF personnel had been mistreated in Townsville. Mr Lindsay himself is responsible for the story gaining any status at all. He is personally responsible for raising the issue and bringing the obvious support for the Australian defence forces in the cities of Townsville and Thuringowa into question. On Wednesday, 19 February Mr Lindsay was interviewed on <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline>. The transcript states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Louise Willis: Can you describe some of the abuse that you've heard about?</para><para>Peter Lindsay: Well, the terms used were “warmongering”, that sort of thing.</para><para>Louise Willis: Could it be mistaken for just people expressing a normal expression of views about the federal government's stance on Iraq?</para><para>Peter Lindsay: There was no mistake on the tone of the harassment that occurred. It was people—</para></quote><para>note the plural—</para><quote><para>targeting, directly targeting, members—</para></quote><para>again, note the plural—</para><quote><para>of the defence force. And you've got to, you've got to respect people's views, you've got to listen to people's views. There's ways of doing that in Australia. But you don't go to a shopping centre and verbally spit at a soldier from the Defence Force.</para></quote><para>Fortunately, Louise Willis did take the opportunity to interview General Peter Cosgrove, who attempted to clarify the situation. He said that it was, `One report of a minor incident.' But, unfortunately for Townsville, the damage was done. This became a national story that escalated to other alleged incidents, including alleged spitting. Quite rightly, the next day the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> reported that a soldier was vilified in a Townsville shopping centre as a warmonger. The story apparently came from a group of soldiers who told Mr Lindsay of the incident on Tuesday night. There was also a rumour going around that soldiers had been told not to wear uniforms in public places.</para><para>I know Townsville fairly well—I have lived in the city for some years and I speak to Defence Force personnel quite a lot. There is a deal of resentment about Mr Lindsay beating up a story to make their community looked divided in the national media when, in fact, there is an extremely high level of local support for our defence personnel. Senior officers in the ADF in Townsville were appalled that this story got away in the way it did. Unfortunately, the editorial writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline> picked up the Lindsay line, did not bother to check the veracity of the story and blew it up into an attack on the opposition, amongst others. He essentially blamed the opposition for the `ratbags in the anti-war movement'. The <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> was far more circumspect. The editor did not blame media outlets for simply doing their job but certainly had a good swipe at Mr Lindsay for jeopardising the bond between the ADF and the Townsville community. The editorial went further by saying, `One stupid incident could serve to harm those putting one side of the argument—the peace movement—unfairly.'</para><para>So this is where the story started and where `spitting' at soldiers comes from—Mr Lindsay's careful choice of words. This is someone trying to ratchet up what sounds like one exchange of views between a soldier and a member of the public at a shopping centre into Mr Lindsay's several incidents, spitting and a no-uniform guideline—all in a town where relations between the Army and the public are extremely good. Thank you, Mr Lindsay. It is a low act. The <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> did not buy the whole vilification story and went back to one of the local members. On the following day, 21 February, the state member for Thuringowa, Ms Anita Phillips, challenged Mr Lindsay to prove his allegations. What did he say? The <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> states:</para><quote><para>The army had acknowledged the case of harassment and he had spoken to several soldiers who had confirmed a number of instances, but he would not name the soldiers. </para></quote><para>The article quotes Mr Lindsay as saying:</para><quote><para>“Their commanding officer would just come out and say to them, `Why have you been speaking to a federal politician?'”</para></quote><para>I have to say that that is just pathetic, considering Mr Lindsay is their federal representative and they have every right to speak to him, given that any alleged vilification could be because of the government's decision to deploy. </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> went on to say that Mr Lindsay said his objective for putting the issue on the national agenda was to `stop this sort of behaviour before it gets away on us'. This is more slippery rationalisation. So the behaviour that was widely reported, thanks to Mr Lindsay running breathlessly to the media, had not taken off. Mr Lindsay is heroically stepping in and beating up an issue which he imagines may occur around Australia.</para><para>Mr Lindsay has a history of trying to politicise the ADF for his own personal agenda. During the 2001 election campaign, he claimed that the 2nd Battalion commonly referred to themselves as `Howard's own'. This was complete nonsense. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> reported on 19 October 2001 that at least one soldier:</para><quote><para>... was perplexed by a report in the local newspaper yesterday claiming that Lavarack's second battalion referred to themselves as `Howard's Own' because of the PM's close affinity with the soldiers he had previously deployed to East Timor.</para></quote><para>The press corps asked Major Bob Worswick whether that was really how the battalion referred to itself. He looked perplexed and replied, `We are the 2nd Battalion Group.'</para><para>Another paper at the time reported other soldiers `blaming local Liberal member Peter Lindsay' for the battalion's new name. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> went on to say:</para><quote><para>Certainly none of the dozen or so troops we chatted to thought much of it. They were clearly bemused.</para></quote><para>This is the sort of weaselly disingenuous behaviour that we have come to expect from Mr Lindsay. Just last week he claimed that everyone in Townsville has access to a bulk-billing doctor. That is nonsense and everyone in Townsville knows it. Let me make my position very clear: I have no time for those who would abuse ADF personnel—no time at all. But I also have no time for a politician who will use a casual conversation, not investigated or substantiated, to beat up a national story to get his name in the limelight. Using the ADF to bring into disrepute the protests against the war, to bring into disrepute the good relationships between the community and the barracks in Townsville and to generally cause bad feeling around the place is to be condemned. To make Townsville look divided in the national eye is also disloyal to his own constituents because it is not true.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>—I will take up Senator Lightfoot's interjection because there was no spitting.

I begin by congratulating the RMIT Globalism Institute and the <inline font-style="italic">New</inline><inline font-style="italic">Internationalist</inline> on organising a successful conference in Melbourne last week that debated issues in relation to West Papua. I would also like to acknowledge and congratulate David Bridie on his extraordinary efforts not only in relation to the conference but in staging a concert on the Friday evening for the benefit of the West Papuan people and for the protection of their human rights.</para></talk.start><para>The conference provided a long-overdue opportunity for a comprehensive, honest and wide-ranging debate on the future of West Papua. It is encouraging to hear that, among the people who participated in the conference, there were a number of Indonesians who participated actively in the deliberations. Any debate on the future of West Papua has to begin with an honest assessment of the past and particularly in the case of West Papua there is clearly a need to acknowledge the mistakes of the past. </para><para>Many countries, if not most—I presume— have some aspects of their history which continue to cast a shadow on the present. Of course, Australia and certainly Indonesia and other countries are not immune from that. Each country, and its people, has a responsibility to account for past actions and recent past wrongs, whether that involves quashing legal untruths such as the doctrine we have seen in our country of terra nullius, or simply saying sorry. However, it is not about who is right or who is wrong. It is not about guilt or blame. It is about moving forward, particularly in the case of West Papua. Obviously wrongs should be acknowledged where possible and remedied if they can be.</para><para>In the case of West Papua, there are two obvious issues that require attention. One is the appalling human rights abuses that have occurred and the other is the illegitimacy of the Act of Free Choice. There is now a great deal of evidence to establish that grave human rights abuses have taken place against the West Papuan people over a number of decades. I know that there is conflicting evidence over the number of deaths that have occurred, but it is widely accepted that at least 100,000 West Papuans have been murdered by the Indonesian army. In addition to these murders there is clear evidence of wrongful imprisonment, torture and general intimidation. The first priority in considering the future of West Papua is to put an end to these human rights abuses. This will require the further establishment and maintenance of proper democratic processes and the rule of law in West Papua.</para><para>The history of atrocities committed against the West Papuan people also stands as a clear warning to our country and to Australians that we should not engage in joint military activities with Kopassus. The evidence against Kopassus, as we have seen over many years, is overwhelming and its disregard for human rights continues to this day. Australia should have nothing to do with an organisation that so flagrantly violates human rights and particularly the rights of innocent civilians.</para><para>The other outstanding issue relates to the 1969 Act of Free Choice, an act which many of us consider to be legitimate. The Act of Free Choice—ironically named, I think—has consistently been challenged by the West Papuan people and is frequently referred to as the `act of no choice'. Under the terms of the New York agreement, which gained the support of the UN Assembly, all West Papuans were to be given the right, given the opportunity, to vote on their future. Instead, as we know in retrospect, the Indonesian government selected 1,025 people to represent the entire population of 800,000. Those people voted—and I think most of us know the history—to remain a part of Indonesia. It has since been revealed that there was considerable duress involved. In fact some of those voters have claimed that their lives were threatened. They were told, for example, that they would have their tongues cut out if they voted for independence.</para><para>It is useful, in this context, to think of article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:</para><quote><para>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.</para></quote><para>Not through hand-picked individuals who are unable to represent the views of the wider population because they are prevented from communicating with them or they are subject to serious threats to compel them to vote a particular way. Article 21 of the universal declaration also provides:</para><quote><para>The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.</para></quote><para>If these procedures are considered a minimum standard for the election of governments, it follows that they should also apply to decisions regarding independence—which are, after all, decisions about who should ultimately govern a group of people.</para><para>Given the circumstances surrounding the Act of Free Choice, it cannot be said that the West Papuan people have ever been given a genuine opportunity to determine their own future. As such, they have been prevented from exercising a fundamental right under international law, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is time this was acknowledged by Indonesia and by us, as a country, remembering that Australia played a key role in the Act of Free Choice. I hope, too, that the international community will recognise the fact that the West Papuans have not had a genuine opportunity to determine how they want to be governed. </para><para>If such an acknowledgment were to be made, the real challenge would then lie in determining how to remedy the injustice. For example, should another vote for independence be conducted? If so, who would be eligible to participate in such a vote? I am not pretending that these issues are anything less than complex. To what extent would the more than one million transmigrants who now reside in West Papua affect the outcome of the vote? What practical planning would need to be involved to facilitate West Papuan independence if that were the outcome of the ballot? These issues are hard, but they should not dissuade us from remedying the wrongs of the past and assisting the West Papuans to determine their own future. We must tackle these issues. We must ensure that all parties are equipped with the relevant information, that they have the opportunity to freely participate in democratic governance processes without the threat of human rights violations, and that the debate can occur in good faith. </para><para>It is important to recognise that independence will not signal the end of West Papua's challenges; it will probably signal a whole set of new challenges, and we have seen that in relation to East Timor, of course. It would be a mistake to restrict this debate to the issue of independence alone. There are broader issues to be considered, such as how to ensure that the West Papuan people benefit from their rich natural resources and how to prevent further degradation of their environment. Australia, too, must take responsibility for our involvement in past wrongs against the West Papuan people. It is a documented fact that in 1969 Australian government officials boarded a plane at Port Moresby and forcibly removed two prominent pro-independence West Papuans who were travelling to meet with UN officials in New York. As a relatively powerful neighbour of West Papua, separated by only 200 kilometres or so, Australia has a responsibility towards that region and the West Papuan people. First and foremost, our priority must be to prevent any further human rights abuses being committed against them. This will involve listening to the accounts given by West Papuans and providing them with whatever assistance we can to ensure that democratic processes are adhered to and that the rule of law operates effectively, and that has to involve the allocation of resources, too. The East Timor experience demonstrated the effectiveness of concerted action by the Australian government. This should inspire us to play a role, particularly in relation to West Papua.</para><para>At the conference last week, Mr John Rumbiak—who will visit Parliament House tomorrow, I understand—warned that tensions in West Papua are escalating. He said that West Papua had the potential to erupt into a bloodbath. In this respect, he predicted that West Papua could well be the next East Timor. At a time when Australia is sending its troops to engage, potentially, in a war against Iraq, I think that Mr Rumbiak's warnings are timely in reminding us that our immediate responsibility has to be to our region. I hope that the Prime Minister, and others in the parliament, listened to the warnings of Mr Rumbiak and I encourage people to look at the papers from last week's conference—it is fascinating reading. Given our proximity to West Papua and our comparative wealth and power, we have a unique opportunity to play a role in putting an end to the human rights abuses that the West Papuans have suffered for so many years. I hope this government will play a leading and compassionate role in resolving this issue in a way that assists our region as a whole. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Service Delivery</title><page.no>9322</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>9322</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak tonight, it is with considerable pleasure that I bring to the Senate in this adjournment debate a positive story of service delivery by a Commonwealth agency in my home state of Western Australia. I raise the issue of service delivery in the area of social welfare and social justice in response to the relentless cynicism and negativity brought to this issue by the opposition. I want to discuss the concept of mutual obligation—and its administration by Centrelink in Western Australia—a concept which is obviously going to continue to shape and influence Australian social security beneficiaries in a positive and successful way long into the future. Having been the target of constant opposition attack, mutual obligation is said to be not working and to be difficult to administer. I want to make the point that I see no opposition policy on the subject matter at all. More particularly, there is no policy that has, as a central plank, the removal of mutual obligation as the foundation stone of social service delivery. </para></talk.start><para>My comments tonight relate to and arise from a very positive and uplifting experience that I have had, in the short months that I have been a senator for Western Australia, in dealing with Centrelink and their delivery of services to beneficiaries and recipients in Western Australia, particularly during the performance year 2001-02. One of the key performance indicators of a service organisation such as Centrelink always is, of necessity, client satisfaction. The story of Centrelink in Western Australian is a very positive and encouraging one from the perspective of policy initiative and delivery within the reform context that this government has laid out. In 2001-02 customer satisfaction commenced at 73 per cent. It rose, on their benchmarks, in the 12-month period to 82 per cent. This is a truly outstanding effort. </para><para>I pause to observe that this organisation has a central function of directly dealing with very large numbers of people and with meeting their demands and needs. At Centrelink's Cannington and Mandurah offices, for example, highly professional and dedicated staff see on average hundreds of people every day, thousands of people every week and hundreds of thousands of people every year. There are, for example, 800 personal contacts at the Cannington office each day. That is quite a staggering figure, and when I visited that office I was amazed to see the level of expertise and enthusiasm there.</para><para>This gratifying outcome has been achieved because of the professionalism, dedication and sheer hard work of the staff and senior management and, most importantly, because of the innovative policy guidelines put into place by my colleague Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services. The policy innovations in this area are working, are successful and are an enduring example of plain good government. The minister's and the department's achievement in this area stands as one of the government's brightest stars. </para><para>I say this acknowledging that the opposition have now plainly lost the high ground that they once prided themselves on occupying, a loss which they themselves concede daily in their total incapacity to provide any hint of a policy initiative which does not have mutual obligation as a central plank. We live in an ever-changing world and the government have now firmly stamped our authority on an area that we have reformed for the betterment of all stakeholders, including vastly improved services and outcomes for those who need assistance, particularly in the area of unemployment benefits.</para><para>Centrelink in Western Australia has responded magnificently to the reform agenda and continued to work hard to achieve outstanding results in providing high-quality services to its clients. In Western Australia there are 24 Centrelink offices stretching from South Hedland, in the north, to Kalgoorlie in the east, and Esperance in the south. Two years ago, only three of the offices were meeting 65 to 70 per cent of their key performance indicators. The performance of other offices ranged down to meeting just 35 per cent of KPI measures, with a general feeling that it was impossible to improve their performance to any significant degree. </para><para>By June 2002 the position had improved to such an extent that 18 out of the 24 offices were able to meet over 90 per cent of the KPI measures, including seven who achieved 100 per cent. The lowest-performing office was able to achieve 81 per cent of its KPI measures. Remember that only 12 months previously achieving 50 per cent or more of the KPIs was not seen as attainable by the majority of offices in Western Australia. By June 2002 the position was reached that all offices across the state attained 100 per cent of their KPIs, a remarkable turnaround and achievement. At this time 17 per cent of WA's offices were in the top five per cent of national office performance across the nation. This level of performance is truly a cause for celebration and a credit to Centrelink's WA management and staff. </para><para>In Western Australia the number of complaints received by this agency has fallen, from 342 in May 2001 to 225 in April 2002. Through weekly discussions with the Ombudsman's office, the feedback has been that complaints about timeliness have been greatly reduced. The most significant drop in the number of complaints has been in the student allowance area. This is largely attributed to the establishment of the Student Servicing Centre. With the encouragement of the minister, a new office on the Curtin University campus is soon to be opened. The Western Australian Centrelink offices have made great gains over the past 12 months. The achievement of all offices in meeting 100 per cent of their KPIs is nothing short of magnificent, considering that only 12 months ago such an achievement was not even contemplated or indeed thought about.</para><para>To gain a short insight into Centrelink's operations, one has only to look at the efforts of their officers after the devastating Bali bombings—and members of the Kingsley Football Club and many Western Australians were deeply affected by that tragedy. Staff from Centrelink helping victims of the Bali bombings went above and beyond the call of duty. On the Sunday morning after the event one of my staff spoke to a Centrelink employee on his mobile phone and on that Sunday he actually went into the office to assist one of my constituents with an issue. I was gratified by the level of commitment, enthusiasm and ease with which that employee shouldered the burden and assisted us. Centrelink staff have shown great compassion towards and empathy with the people affected by the Bali tragedy by assisting with payments, helping with flights to other states for funerals and referring people to other services that were needed. They are a real example of how ordinary people can do extraordinary tasks when they are needed and of how people in their normal jobs, even often much maligned public servants, can do more than what is asked for in the spirit of helping their fellow Australians in a time of great crisis.</para><para>I have attended the Cannington offices of Centrelink and have been impressed and amazed by the capacity and ability of the staff in their dealings with their clients. They have lived up to all my expectations of what an efficient and successful government agency should be. As members of parliament, we often hear of only the worst-case experiences of our state and federal departments and it can, I believe, warp our perspective. When do we ever get a call out of the blue from one of our constituents saying what a good result they have had or complimenting us on administration or service delivery? This is why I wanted to congratulate the staff of Centrelink around the country and particularly in Western Australia, where my personal experience has shown me that they are making a fine contribution by carrying out fine work on behalf of the parliament, the government and all Australians. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.52 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>9324</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>9324</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Advance to the Finance Minister—Statements and supporting applications for funds for—</para><para>October to December 2002.</para><para>January 2003.</para><para>Airservices Australia—Corporate plan July 2002 to June 2007.</para><para>National Biotechnology Centre of Excellence—Review of selection —Report to the Prime Minister by the Allen Consulting Group, December 2002.</para><para>National Health and Medical Research Council—Review of the implementation of the National Health and Research Council's strategic plan 2000-03, December 2002.</para><para>Telecommunications carrier industry development plans—Progress report for 2001-02.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>9325</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>National Health Act—Determination under—</para><para>Section 5D—PHS 1/2003.</para><para>Schedule 1—PHS 2/2003.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>9325</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996, as amended on 3 December 1998:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 July to 31 December 2002—Statements of compliance—Department of Education, Science and Training.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>9326</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Air Traffic Controllers</title><page.no>9326</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1025)</subtitle><id.no>1025</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9326</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 December 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Further to the advice given to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in the estimates hearing on 20 November 2002 that Air Marshal Houston and Airservices Australia had agreed to work towards the provision by Airservices Australia of air traffic control services at Townsville and Darwin airports:</para><para>(1)	(a) When will the consultation phase commence and conclude;

This study estimates the costs of CO2 avoided from different electricity generating technologies, namely pulverised coal power stations (PC), natural gas combined cycle power stations (NGCC) and coal integrated gasification combined cycle power stations (IGCC).</para><para>This report estimates that the total cost per tonne of CO2 avoided ranges between $US22 and $US111, of which $US16-86 or around 75% of the total cost is the additional cost of capturing and compressing CO2 at the power station, $US1-3 is the cost of transporting CO2 per 100km of pipeline, and $5-21 is the cost of CO2 storage.</para><para>The additional cost of capturing and compressing CO2 at the power station is estimated to increase the cost of electricity by US 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour for IGCC, US 3.32 cents per kilowatt hour for PC and US 1.61 cents per kilowatt hour for NGCC. It is estimated that by 2012, these additional costs could be reduced to US 1.04, 2.16 and 1.23 cents per kilowatt hour respectively.</para><para>(b)	These estimates are based on research, analysis and other analytical evidence examined by the IEA GHG R&amp;D Program as reported in “Solutions for the 21st Century - Zero Emissions Technologies for Fossil Fuels”, published in May 2002.</para><para>(c)	The analysis presented by the IEA GHG R&amp;D program in “Solutions for the 21st Century - Zero Emissions Technologies for Fossil Fuels” appears to indicate that it does take into account the loss of energy efficiency resulting from the CO2 capture and sequestration process.</para><para>(2)	(a)	Zero emissions is a relatively new concept but is receiving increasing interest, particularly in terms of developing sustainable long term greenhouse solutions. The concept involves the capture and storage of emissions such as <inline font-style="italic">CO</inline><inline font-style="italic">2</inline> or their conversion into inputs that can be used in other production processes. These technologies have the potential to reduce <inline font-style="italic">CO</inline><inline font-style="italic">2</inline> emissions from coal power generation to very low levels. </para><para>(b) Many of the technologies associated with zero emissions technologies are available on a commercial basis in various applications including power generation, the petroleum industry, chemical industry and food processing. Recent advances in clean coal technologies and the bringing together of various energy research and development streams suggests that zero emissions technologies are technically feasible and can be developed into affordable solutions for achieving large scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. </para><para>(3)	(a)	The Australian Greenhouse Office provided $100,000 in 1999/00 and $100,000 in 2000/01 to the Australian Petroleum Cooperative Research Centre (APCRC) GEODISC Research Program.</para><para>Geoscience Australia provided in-kind assistance valued at $158,000 in 1999/00, $248,000 in 2000/01 and $355,000 in 2001/02 to the APCRC GEODISC Research Program.</para><para>Under the Department of Education, Science and Training's Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program for the period 1997 to 2004, the Commonwealth provided funding to APCRC for use in its approved research program.

A number of programmes delivered during these financial years have been superseded by new programmes: Community Support Programme (CSP) was replaced by the Personal Support Programme (PSP) that is administered by the Department of Family and Community Services; and Return to Work was replaced by Transition to Work in July 2002.</para><para>(4)	(a)	The appropriation for the Work for the Dole Programme nationally for the 2002-2003 financial year is $147.009 million.</para><para>	(b)	The appropriation for the 2002-03 financial year for the Transition to Work Programme is $10.227 million.</para><para>	(c)	The appropriation for Job Network (including Intensive Assistance, Job Search Training, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and Project Contracting (Harvest Labour Services)), for 2002-2003 financial year is $874,632 million.</para><para>	(d)	The appropriation for the Indigenous Employment Programme for the 2002-03 financial year is $57.586 million.</para><para>	(e)	The appropriation for the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS) and the General Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (GEERS) for the 2002-03 financial year is $85.183 million.</para><para>	(f)	Funding for the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett employees (SEESA) is not appropriated for any one financial year, however, $500m was appropriated for the life of the programme under the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Act 2001.</para><para>(5)	(a)	In the 2002-03 financial year, $403,833 has been approved for delivery of Work for the Dole (WfD)activities in the electorate of Gippsland. Work for the Dole activities are approved on a monthly cycle depending on applications received. It is not possible to predict whether new activities will be approved for the delivery of WfD activities in the remainder of the 2002-03 financial year.</para><para>	(b)	Funding will be made available to Mission Australia under the Transition to Work programme for the 2002-03 financial year in the electorate of Gippsland. Transition to Work funds are disbursed in response to the number of participants that apply and are eligible within an Employment Service Area. The boundaries of the relevant Employment Service Area and the electorate of Gippsland are not aligned. It is not possible to predict the number of participants that may live in the electorate of Gippsland.</para><para>	(c)	Job Network funding is not appropriated on the basis of electoral boundaries. The estimated expenditure in the electorate of Gippsland to the end of December 2002 was $3,207,000. Projected expenditure for 2002-2003 will be in the order of $7,000,000.</para><para>	(d)	The Indigenous Employment Programme (IEP) is not appropriated on an electorate basis. However it is determined that expenditure to end December 2002 under the IEP in the electorate of Gippsland was in the order of $205,000. </para><para>	(e)	The various employee entitlement schemes are national schemes that are demand driven, according to insolvency, therefore funds are not regionally allocated. Recipient electorates are determined by claimants' postcode where available. Some postcodes cover more than one electorate and the information contained shows all relevant data for each electorate. Due to postcodes covering multiple electorates, some payments to recipients will be assigned alphabetically to an electorate. This may result in a minor statistical anomaly. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Attachment A</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Funding provided to the people of Gippsland
