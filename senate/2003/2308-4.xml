The government has now authorised our defence forces, which were predeployed in the gulf to acclimatise and contribute to the campaign to pressure Saddam Hussein into compliance, to take part in coalition operations. There is no more serious decision for any government than to commit its forces to military conflict abroad. Under our system, this decision lies with the executive of government—the cabinet. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that the parliament, at the first opportunity, have the chance to debate this motion. It is essential that the reasons for that decision be made plain to the representatives of the people and that they have a full opportunity to debate those reasons and record their views.</para><para>In 1991 the world judged that the Iraqi regime was a dangerous aggressor. In the interests of world peace and regional security, the community of nations required Iraq to surrender its offensive arsenal, its chemical and biological weapons and abandon its nuclear weapons program. Iraq agreed to comply. We have waited 12 years for it to action this commitment. On 8 November 2002 the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1441, the 17th Security Council resolution on Iraq regarding the threat it poses to international peace and security. This resolution, which was adopted unanimously, gave Iraq a final opportunity to demonstrate immediate compliance with its disarmament obligations. Over the last four months, we have seen no evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein is willing to comply with resolution 1441. He has offered up minor concessions but has not demonstrated that he is willing to declare or destroy Iraq's prohibited weapons programs. The government believe very strongly that Iraq's continued defiance of the community of nations presents a challenge which must be addressed. </para><para>It is inherently dangerous to allow a country such as Iraq to retain weapons of mass destruction, particularly in light of its past aggressive behaviour. If the world community fails to disarm Iraq, we fear other rogue states will be encouraged to believe that they too can have these most deadly of weapons and that the world will do nothing to stop them. As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads, so the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups multiplies. That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent. Possession of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct, undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people.</para><para>The federal government's principal objective is the disarmament of Iraq. However, should military action be required to achieve this, it is axiomatic that such action will result in the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. Early this morning, President Bush telephoned the Prime Minister and formally requested Australia's support and participation in a coalition of nations who are prepared to enforce the Security Council's resolutions by all necessary means. This request was subsequently considered and agreed to by the cabinet. </para><para>In a speech around midday today Australian Eastern Standard Time, President Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Iraqi leadership: Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours or face military conflict. Nobody wants a military conflict. The world has for years tried other means but to no avail. We cannot walk away from the threat that Iraq's continued possession of weapons of mass destruction constitutes to its region and the wider world. </para><para>In the final analysis, the absolute conviction of the government is that disarming Iraq is necessary for the long-term security of the world and is therefore manifestly in Australia's national interest. The events of the last four months, Iraq's history and 12 years of defiance have convinced the Prime Minister and the government that the only way to deal with this challenge is by force. Sadly, the government is not surprised that it should have come to this. Force has been the only language that Saddam Hussein's regime has ever understood. </para><para>For 12 years, Saddam Hussein has forced his nation to endure stringent economic sanctions and pariah status rather than give up his weapons of mass destruction. The presence of weapons inspectors has hindered and irritated him, but it has never stopped his weapons programs. Even during the first four years of weapons inspections, when the inspectors perceived they were making real progress, Iraq continued to develop and successfully conceal biological weapons. Luckily, a series of defectors blew the whistle on some of Iraq's prohibited weapons programs, forcing the Iraqi regime to reveal one of the most sophisticated and expansive offensive biological programs in the world. We cannot always expect to be so lucky. Inspectors were ordered out of Iraq before they could finish dismantling the program. The available intelligence indicates that, since the departure of inspectors in 1998, Saddam has continued to work on his chemical and biological capabilities and maintained his nuclear aspirations. </para><para>Even under the threat of force he has only engaged reluctantly in token, piecemeal destruction of weapons and he continues to deny the existence of weapons programs. Even with over 200,000 coalition troops massed at his borders, he quibbles about how interviews are to be conducted with his scientists and how many of the reconnaissance aircraft supporting the inspectors can fly at any one time. After 12 years he does not believe that the international community has the will to act. He has made a terrible error of judgment.</para><para>For 12 years, the international community has been trying to get him to relinquish his prohibited weapons programs, as required by the cease-fire which ended the Gulf War. Australia has been an active participant in this process. During those 12 years, there has rarely been a time when Australian defence personnel have not been deployed in the gulf—in 1990 to enforce sanctions, in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm, in 1998 to support Operation Desert Fox and, throughout, an almost continuous presence with the Multinational Interdiction Force. Now we join with the coalition in an attempt to bring this longstanding conflict to an end, once and for all.</para><para>This will be difficult. Saddam Hussein is married to his weapons of mass destruction. He will never give them up willingly. Militarism and aggression are the foundations of his regime. If you doubt this, consider his actions against Iraqi Kurds and the Shia majority, particularly the Marsh Arabs; the estimated 400,000 combatants and civilians who lost their lives in the war that followed his invasion of Iran; and the 100,000 killed when he invaded Kuwait. Since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, more than one million people have died in the internal conflict and wars he has generated. Intelligence analysis tells us that Saddam Hussein considers these weapons programs to be essential both for internal repression and to fulfil his regional ambitions. No doubt he looks to a time when the world will be distracted by other events and he can use this arsenal to bully and coerce his neighbours and to dominate the Middle East.</para><para>Iraq's continued defiance represents a threat to the delicate balance which supports nonproliferation. It is no idle speculation that other countries in the region, perceiving this threat, might decide that their own security requires that they develop a significant chemical, biological or even possibly nuclear arsenal to deter attack from Iraq. Moreover, other rogue states would be tempted to ignore the international conventions on arms control, which Australia and others have so painstakingly built over the last 30 years, and would feel they could get away with developing similar weapons programs. This is proliferation. We know the lessons of history: the more nations that have these weapons the more likely they are to be used. That is why we fear proliferation. And we are very concerned about the potential for the proliferation of these weapons in our own region. </para><para>That these weapons may become commonplace in the arsenals of sovereign states is frightening enough, but it would be a nightmare for the international community if they were to find their way into the hands of terrorists. And we have every reason to be concerned about the expansion and increasing sophistication of international terrorist networks. We know as a matter of fact that terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda want to obtain weapons of mass destruction. They are actively seeking them. They desire them because of their potency. With such weapons at their disposal, terrorists could target entire cities or regions. Their victims would not number in the hundreds, or the thousands, but potentially millions. The Prime Minister has not claimed that Iraq has yet provided al-Qaeda with weapons or assistance on developing effective delivery systems. But, given Iraq's history, its preparedness to use these weapons on civilians as well as military targets, its links with other terrorist organisations, its tolerance of an al-Qaeda presence in Baghdad and al-Qaeda's desire, the Prime Minister and the government consider it imperative that the opportunity be removed. </para><para>Twelve years ago the community of nations determined that Iraq could not be permitted to develop and possess weapons of mass destruction. Today's security environment reinforces that judgment. Of course our alliance with the United States is also a factor—unapologetically so. The crucial long-term value of the US alliance should always be a factor in any major national security decision taken by Australia. America has given very strong leadership to the world on the issue of Iraq. The Security Council would not have become re-energised at the task of disarming Iraq had it not been for the United States. We support the American position because we share their concerns.</para><para>Alliances are two-way processes and, where we are in agreement, we should not leave it to the United States to do all the heavy lifting just because they are the superpower. To do so would undermine one of the most important relationships we have. In an increasingly globalised and borderless world, the relationship between Australia and the United States will become more and not less important.</para><para>Armed conflict is a terrible thing. Even though the Prime Minister's ultimate responsibility is for the security of the Australian people, he is conscious of the dangers military action will pose for Iraq's civilian population. But, when you put human suffering into the balance on this issue, there is a powerful case that human suffering will, in fact, be even greater if Saddam Hussein is left in power. Perhaps it is enough to note that, in 1991, the Security Council thought it necessary to pass resolution 688, which demands that the Iraqi regime cease its repression of its people. In April last year, the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution condemning:</para><quote><para>... the systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq, resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread terror ... </para></quote><para>The regime's hallmarks are summary and arbitrary executions, the use of rape as a political tool, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, widespread and systematic torture, and maintaining of decrees prescribing cruel and inhuman punishment as the penalty for offences. The Prime Minister does not make these points for effect but to demonstrate that the short-term future for many, if not most, Iraqi civilians is neither secure nor peaceful, regardless of whether Iraq is subject to military action or not.</para><para>The government is, of course, deeply disappointed that the Security Council has been unable to maintain a unity of purpose on the issue of Iraq. The strong position taken last year, clearly articulated in resolution 1441, was that Iraq was being given one final chance to disarm, one final chance to show its immediate willingness to meet the terms of the cease-fire agreed in April 1991. The goal of 1441 was immediate and complete disarmament, not simply the return of weapons inspectors. That is merely an issue of process. A further resolution by the Security Council demonstrating that it was galvanised to take action might have, just might have, persuaded Saddam Hussein to take the steps necessary to achieve a peaceful solution to this conflict.</para><para>The position articulated by those opposed to action is fundamentally flawed. They recognise that the threat of military action has been the only way to elicit a positive response from Iraq. Yet they squander the leveraging power of a military force by clearly demonstrating they are never prepared to actually use it. This strategy not only is illogical but ignores the practical reality: it is not possible to keep our forces in the gulf on alert indefinitely. </para><para>The government does not accept that the only thing required to achieve complete and comprehensive disarmament is more time. If Iraq had cooperated actively and openly over the last four months, we would support a longer implementation timetable. That is not the case. The regime have continued to lie and obfuscate, making only token gestures of cooperation. They have not given the slightest indication that they intend to fully disarm and abandon their prohibited weapons programs.</para><para>We wanted the inspectors to do their job, but we have never accepted that they should have to play the role of detective. They have neither the skills nor the powers to fulfil this role effectively. Their presence inhibited Saddam's weapons programs, but the presence of inspectors alone could never have delivered total and complete disarmament in the face of Iraqi defiance and duplicity. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> A peaceful path to disarmament could only have been achieved if the Iraqi regime had been truly committed to disarming and worked in active cooperation with the inspection teams. Iraq had to demonstrate it wanted to disarm. It was always a question of attitude.</para><para>We reject totally the argument put by France and by some other countries that the presence of inspectors will lead, over the passage of time, to disarmament. We cannot and will not ignore the experience of the last 12 years. We believe that the time has come to disarm Iraq, by force if necessary. We are participating in the US led coalition to achieve this objective.</para><para>It is important to understand that the decision taken by the government is in accordance with the legal authority for military action found in previous resolutions of the Security Council. We supported and would have preferred a further Security Council resolution specifying the need for such action. But we did so to maximise the diplomatic and moral pressure on Iraq, not because we considered a new resolution to be necessary for such action to be legitimate.</para><para>Our legal advice, provided by the head of the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department and the senior legal adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is unequivocal. The existing United Nations Security Council resolutions already provide for the use of force to disarm Iraq and restore international peace and security to the area. This legal advice is consistent with that provided to the British government by its Attorney-General.</para><para>Security Council resolution 678, adopted in 1990, authorised the use of all necessary means not only to implement resolution 660, which demanded Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, but also to implement all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687, which provided the cease-fire terms for Iraq in April 1991, affirmed resolution 678. Security Council resolution 1441 confirms that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations—a point on which there is unanimous agreement, including by the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>Iraq's past and continuing breaches of the cease-fire obligations negate the basis for the formal cease-fire. Iraq has, by its conduct, demonstrated that it did not and does not accept the terms of the cease-fire. Consequently, we have received legal advice that `the cease-fire is not effective and the authorisation for the use of force in Security Council 678 is reactivated'. It follows, so the Prime Minister and government are advised, that referring to the use of such force against Iraq as `unilateral' is wrong. Any informed analysis of the Security Council resolutions leads to this conclusion. </para><para>We note that the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Keating government, Mr Michael Costello, has reached the same conclusion. The use of military force is already authorised by the United Nations. This advice is not new. Our deployment of forces to the gulf in 1998, in support of Operation Desert Fox, was undertaken on the same basis. The Clinton administration clearly understood and argued, as the Bush administration does now, that existing Security Council resolutions clearly allow for the use of military force. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—Are you going to table the legal advice?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—I table, for the benefit of honourable senators, Australian legal advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, legal advice provided to the British government by its Attorney-General and the transcript of an interview with Mr Michael Costello, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Keating government. I hope that satisfies Senator Bolkus.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australia and the other members of the coalition are therefore still acting under the authority of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. We continue to regard the United Nations as the most important framework the world has to achieve a secure and peaceful world. Our commitment to the UN is perhaps personified by the 1,200 ADF personnel who are currently serving in the Blue Beret all around the world.</para><para>The government is extremely disappointed that the Security Council has been unable to demonstrate the necessary resolve to confront Iraq's continued defiance of the United Nations. We consider that it is critical for the United Nations to remain fully engaged on the issue of Iraq and take responsibility for coordinating the humanitarian and reconstruction support which will be required once the military conflict has been resolved. Just as we believe action against Saddam Hussein's regime is in our nation's best interest, so too we believe it is clearly in our interest to help rebuild a stable and prosperous Iraq. To that end, the government will make a significant contribution to that reconstruction effort.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—What happened to democracy in all of this?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Australia will do everything in its power to encourage the establishment of a representative government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government also wants to reassure Australia's Islamic community that our actions in Iraq are not an attack on Islam—one of the world's great faiths. This reassurance has been given to, and accepted by, President Megawati of Indonesia—the leader of the world's largest Islamic country. The Prime Minister reminds all Australians that, regardless of their views on the conflict in Iraq, our Islamic community, especially those people who have family or cultural ties to the Middle East, will especially need our compassion and our support over coming weeks. All Australians should ensure that it is offered.</para><para>As the Prime Minister has said before, it is also crucial for the stability of the region to address the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel has no stauncher ally than Australia in the pursuit of its right to exist and the right to secure and internationally recognised borders. Australia also strongly supports the establishment of a secure and independent state for the people of Palestine. Australia urges Prime Minister Sharon and Chairman Arafat to embrace the road map to peace developed by the United States in close cooperation with Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. The Australian government is committed to doing everything in its power to encourage and support the Israeli and Palestinian governments to negotiate a resolution to this bloody conflict which has cost too many lives—too many innocent lives—and casts a shadow across the entire region.</para><para>But there will be no stability, no security, for the nations of the Middle East, and particularly the gulf, until Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction totally and permanently. The engagement of our defence forces will be limited to the period of the conflict and to those elements already deployed—that is, the transport ship HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, which departed from Sydney on 23 January with approximately 350 people embarked, including Army detachments providing air defence and amphibious cargo transport craft; the special forces task group, including a Special Air Services squadron from Perth and special forces combat support elements, including specialist troops to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction, drawn from the newly established Incident Response Regiment; CH-47 troop-lift helicopters; a quick reaction force drawn from the Sydney based 4RAR Commando Unit; a squadron of 14 FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft; three C130 Hercules transport aircraft; an air forward command element responsible for coordinating air operations with coalition partners; two P3 patrol aircraft currently in the gulf supporting the war on terror; a Navy clearance diving team capable of locating, rendering safe and disposing of mines; and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline> and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Darwin,</inline> which are already in the Middle East, policing UN sanctions on Iraq. </para><para>Although as part of the coalition Australian forces will be under the operational control of the coalition commander, they will remain under Australian national command at all times. Australian commanders are bound by Australian rules of engagement and separate Australian targeting directives. The government has been mindful to ensure that the ADF retains the capability to continue to service our current commitments, including our contribution to the UN force in East Timor and to respond to any short-notice contingencies that may arise. </para><para>The deployment, although modest in terms of the size of the total coalition force, is a sizeable commitment for Australia. The 2,000 ADF personnel and maritime, land and air assets currently deployed to the Middle East are not a token contribution. Every one of our service men and women is precious to their families, to their loved ones and to their nation. The government want to say to the men and women of our Defence Force who are deployed with the coalition forces that we have the greatest confidence in their abilities and their judgment. They may be part of the Australian deployment or deployed while on exchange duties with our friends and allies. Our nation admires their courage and salutes their commitment to duty. They belong to the most professional armed forces in the world, and we are proud of their reputation. Their government and their military commanders have spared no effort and no expense to try to prepare them for the terrible reality of active service. </para><para>We are under no illusion: their mission is a difficult one and inevitably involves danger. All agree that the Iraqi regime is one of the most repressive and cruel in the world. It is in open defiance of the United Nations Security Council. No-one wants Saddam Hussein to keep and expand his arsenal of prohibited weapons. The Prime Minister and the government believe passionately that the efforts of our forces are vital to ensure the long-term security of Australia and our world. The cause is just. The action is legitimate. We pray that our forces and their coalition partners will make quick progress and that soon they will be home, safe and sound, reunited with those they love. </para><para>I know that our defence personnel could not function without the support and understanding provided by their loved ones—their families, their friends. It will be a difficult time for those at home. Sometimes it can be more stressful for those who wait than for those who are in the thick of action.</para><para>We ask that all Australians, regardless of whether they support our participation in the coalition to disarm Iraq or not, show their support for those who have been ordered to undertake this mission. Give special thought to their loved ones. Do your best to support and look after them. We all have a right to protest and to register our concerns, but we ask that those who do protest or wish to register concerns direct such protests to the government, to our leadership, to those who are responsible for the decision, not to those who are given the responsibility of carrying out the orders of government.</para><para>This decision has been taken in a world environment changed forever by the events of 11 September 2001. The world faces new and previously unknown menaces. Old notions of aggression and responses to aggression do not necessarily fit our new circumstances. Yet one thing remains constant: the responsibility of governments to protect their citizens against possible future attacks, wherever they may come from.

We are not watching the breaking of toothpicks. Lethal weapons are being destroyed.</para></quote><para>Yet, in the face of this clear, public destruction of weapons, Prime Minister Howard and President Bush continue to dodge the issue of why they find the inspection process insufficient. With more time and the unanimous resolve of the United Nations, I believe, and the opposition believe, that Iraq could be disarmed peacefully. But of course any chance of a peaceful solution has been ruined. </para><para>There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator who must be disarmed. The question, of course, is: how? Labor strongly endorsed the United Nations Security Council decision in November last year to restart the weapons inspections process. We believe Saddam Hussein must be disarmed, but that should only be done through the legitimacy and the authority of the United Nations. To go to war now will damage relations with the nations of our region and weaken our ability to work constructively with moderate Islamic countries to stop terrorism against Australians. The implications of this war and the undermining of the authority of the United Nations are going to reverberate around the world. This war will make Australia less safe.</para><para>Taking unilateral action without UN authority sets a dangerous precedent for rogue states such as Libya and North Korea. It will weaken international arms control measures. It will encourage other nations to consider starting pre-emptive wars. The decision of the government to commit Australians and Australian troops to this war was made months ago. We did not need the overnight farce of a phone call from President Bush to Prime Minister Howard. The Prime Minister should just front up to the Australian people—he should have fronted up to the Australian parliament today and told the truth—and tell the truth: that the decision to go to war was made months ago. It was made months ago. It did not require the so-called emergency cabinet meetings or the phone calls from President Bush.</para><para>Over the past few weeks and months, the Prime Minister has consistently failed to tell the truth about taking us to war. Of course, this has been exposed on a number of occasions. Take, for example, the leaked memo from Mr Downer and the High Commissioner for New Zealand when Mr Downer said the troops could not be withdrawn from the gulf. Take, for example, President Bush's admission in the White House, much to be embarrassment of Prime Minister Howard, that Australia had signed up to the `coalition of the willing'. Of course, ONA officer Wilkie exposed that there is no link between Iraq and al-Qaeda.</para><para>The fact is that the Prime Minister committed Australia to war 12 months ago and work began on Australia's commitment last July. But the Prime Minister has never seen fit to say that to Australian Defence Force personnel or to the people of Australia. In signing up to this war the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has surrendered our sovereignty. Australia should never go to war just because we get a telephone call from the President of the United States. I do not care what commitments Mr Howard has made to the United States President, because his overriding commitment must be to the people of Australia. That is the overriding commitment of the Australian Prime Minister. As far as the Labor Party are concerned, we would never allow our defence and foreign policies to be determined by another country, and we never have.</para><para>Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. As I have said, the question is how. Labor has said consistently that that should be done through the United Nations. The United Nations is not perfect but, without it, the world would revert to the law of the jungle. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, clearly addressed the issue of the legitimacy of unilateral action against Iraq when he said on 12 March:</para><quote><para>If action is taken without the authority of the Security Council the legitimacy and support for any such action will be seriously impaired.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister has not addressed that issue in any of his statements. Instead he backs President Bush's unilateral first strike because, of course, they were going to lose the vote in the Security Council. What I want to know—and I think my colleagues want to know this too—is this: if the Prime Minister and all his cohorts say that a second United Nations resolution is so unnecessary, why did they campaign for it? Why did they argue for it? Why did they press for it? Why did they coerce for it as strongly as they did?</para><para>Labor set two conditions for supporting a war without United Nations Security Council backing: first, that a link be established between the September 11 attacks and Iraq and, second, that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction posed an immediate threat to Australia and her allies. Of course, neither of those conditions has been met. They have not been met by the United States, they have not been met by the United Kingdom and they have not been met by the United Nations. And, most importantly, they have not been met in any of the public statements, at any stage, that have been made by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Howard. As a result, Labor will only support action if it is authorised by the United Nations Security Council. </para><para>We maintain our strong belief in following the United Nations route, where we have a say as part of the international community. Mr Howard, on the other hand, has surrendered our sovereignty and our independence to the President of the United States. We deeply value the American alliance, but it should never be the plaything of one prime minister or of one political party. We note that article 1 of the ANZUS alliance commits both Australia and the United States of America to resolving international conflict through the United Nations. Unfortunately, Mr Howard has been sounding more and more like the governor of the 51st state of the United States. He has not been sounding like the Prime Minister of Australia.</para><para>We say that Australian troops should be brought home. We have also clearly indicated that we would never have deployed those troops in the first place. Mr Crean, on behalf of the opposition, has said that if he were Prime Minister today those troops would be brought home. But I want to be very clear about this in the Senate today. Labor will argue that the government's policy is grievously wrong, and we will do everything we can to see if we can influence the Prime Minister to change and reverse his decision. But our thoughts are with the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Labor will back those Defence Force personnel 100 per cent and we will also condemn anyone who seeks to criticise them. Our argument is with the government; it is not with ADF personnel. The ADF personnel in the gulf are obeying orders, as they must do in a democracy. One of the lessons of the Vietnam War is that opposition to a war should be directed towards the government of the day and the government only. But we say that the Prime Minister is treating Australian troops dishonourably. He did not respect the members of the ADF or the Australian people enough to tell them the truth about the predeployment or the commitment of troops to an American pre-emptive strike.</para><para>It is very valid to compare the current situation with what occurred in the Gulf War in 1991. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, understood the importance of the United Nations. In his ministerial statement to parliament on 21 August 1990, Mr Hawke said:</para><quote><para>As a self-reliant country, in the years ahead we may need to depend more and more on the principles of the United Nations Charter to protect our interests. We are not sending ships to the Gulf region to serve our allies; we are going to protect the international rule of law which will be vital to our security however our alliances may develop in the future. </para></quote><para>That statement was strongly supported at the time by the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson. We should have heard the same from the Prime Minister of this country today in this parliament. The then Labor government understood the importance of an independent foreign policy. Then Prime Minister Hawke did not pre-empt the United Nations; he defended its principles. In contrast, Mr Howard has undermined 50 years of bipartisan support for the United Nations and he is undermining our long-term security interests. Even at this stage, it is not too late for us to choose the path of peace and collective security through the United Nations.</para><para>Like most Australians, I am appalled that we find ourselves on the precipice of war—a position that Mr Howard has allowed himself to be bullied into. I urge the Prime Minister to change his mind but, of course, he has been set on war from the start and I doubt that he is interested. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The Prime Minister has misled the Australian people. He has dragged them into a war against their wishes and against their interests. As far as the opposition are concerned, we are not starry-eyed about the United Nations. It is not the most perfect of organisations, but it does provide international authority and reflect the will of the international community. What happens from now on sets a precedent. The question is: from this time on, what is there to stop other countries—other countries outside the authority of the United Nations—using force and using what no doubt will become known as Gulf War II as their precedent? This war is wrong. This war is not in Australia's national interest. I urge the Senate to support the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the opposition to the motion moved by the government. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9507</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats express our opposition to the motion moved by the government.

This is a clear indication that we have not one person amongst the coalition parties who is willing to stand up—stand up for Australia, stand up for the majority of the population and stand up against what many of them know is clearly wrong and clearly not in Australia's interests. In a Newspoll today, 71 per cent of Australians indicated they are opposed to war without United Nations sanction. This would have to be the first time in history that a government has deployed our troops in the face of such massive public opposition. The government is betraying our defence personnel by putting them in such an untenable position.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is the first time in history, undoubtedly, that Australia will have deployed troops without parliamentary support, because this motion authorising or supporting the deployment will not be supported by the Senate, in the same way that the Senate has already condemned the Prime Minister over a month ago for his appalling handling of this crucial issue. This would be the first time in history that Australia—which has a proud record of standing up and joining in support of many conflicts—has started a war and that we have been part of an aggressive invasion. That is a great shame for our nation.</para><para>The Democrats condemn the federal government's decision. We do not support the motion put forward by the Prime Minister and his representative in this place, Senator Hill. We support the amendment put forward by Senator Faulkner. To those we will add an amendment of our own that we believe will strengthen the statement of the Senate. I will speak to that amendment once I am sure it has been circulated. Australia is now one of a tiny number of rogue states starting an illegal war without justification and in the face of widespread global opposition. It is untenable for Australia to argue now about following international law, about following due precedent, about following due process or about working with the global community when we have so clearly walked away from the global community, walked away from the peace disarmament process and simply followed and been apologists for aggressive US militarism.</para><para>Despite the financial and other blackmail used by the United States against nations on the Security Council, that council would not pass a resolution authorising force. To provide a few bits of legal sophistry to suggest that it is supported by international law to deploy troops is to ignore the statements and debates made to the Security Council by global representatives, including the US ambassador. This is the level of deception and deceit that we are reduced to in the arguments of world leaders in the face of blatant commonsense. Resolution 1441 was quite clearly adopted as an alternative to military action. Even the US ambassador to the Security Council said upon its adoption that the resolution contained no `hidden triggers' and no `automaticity' with the use of force. It had no automatic authorisation for the use of force, and the United States ambassador made that clear at the time. It is that sort of doublespeak—going back and changing their position as if it is some sort of warped version of <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</inline> and just pretending that we have all forgotten what people said a month or two ago—that shows how tragic and appalling this debate is. It is no wonder that we are not able to argue credibly and win the support of the Australian people—let alone the global community—for this action, because they know that it does not stack up and is not consistent with the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister. His justifications have changed day after day as he has desperately tried to follow the ever-changing position of the United States administration. </para><para>Many, many experts in the Australian community—former defence chiefs, former heads of the defence department, former military chiefs with immense experience, former diplomats, members of the defence community, members of the security community and members of the veterans community—have displayed widespread opposition and condemnation of the approach and policy of this government. Today former Australian ambassador to the United Nations, our last ambassador to the Security Council, Richard Woolcott, called this war `a tragic culmination of a flawed policy', `a deception of the Australian people' and `an unnecessary military involvement'. He said:</para><quote><para>This is the worst and most damaging foreign policy decision in half a century or more. It is gross deceit to say this war is in Australia's national interest. Clearly it is not.</para></quote><para>The Democrats and the majority of the Australian community have consistently opposed this war for many reasons, including that it is not in Australia's national interest. We call on the Governor-General, Peter Hollingworth, to take the opportunity as commander-in-chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth to refuse to sign the order for the commitment of troops. The Prime Minister has failed to answer the many questions about the legality and morality and human and economic costs of this war. The Democrats alone have put over 100 questions to the government about the Australian and United States approaches to Iraq, but they have given no answer. We have asked questions over many months about the US and UK role in originally arming Iraq and supporting Hussein. We have asked about how they intend to conduct this war, including why they still will not rule out the use of nuclear weapons and why our Prime Minister, despite a specific resolution of the Senate, refused to get a guarantee that nuclear weapons or chemical weapons would not be used by the attacking forces.</para><para>We have asked for their figures on the war budget—we know they are drawn up—but they refuse to answer these questions. The Prime Minister's speech to the Press Club last week was about defence of US militarism, not about Australia's security. He has repeatedly made the ridiculous claim that a UN resolution authorising force would bring about peace. Yet again today he has continued with his hypocrisy in pointing out the immense suffering of the Iraqi people at the hands of Saddam Hussein whilst ignoring his own record of deploying Australia's military forces and spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars trying to prevent the victims of that regime from seeking protection here in Australia. It is the height of hypocrisy that the Prime Minister argues that the Iraqi people are oppressed by this regime and gives examples of torture yet continues to try and prevent protection for the victims of that regime here in Australia. Even today, hundreds of Iraqis are in detention in Australia with continual psychological pressure being put on them to return to such a regime.

That sort of hypocrisy is something that is impossible to stomach, and the Australian people in their millions today are feeling sick in their stomach about where this Prime Minister has led them. It is an absolute disgrace. He has failed to pursue every peaceful option. Even somebody like the Pope—who you people would love to grab hold of for your own political purposes—has quite blatantly said that peaceful options are still available and that we have a moral obligation to pursue peaceful options. But you will ignore that and go with the US militarists any day of the week and tie yourselves to their bootstraps, thinking that, somehow or other, that is in Australia's national interest. How pathetic can you get! Clearly, there are still options for peace, yet the Prime Minister has turned his back on these. He has turned his back on peace and signed Australia up, for the first time in our history, as an aggressor nation, launching an attack. It is a day of shame that we are put in this situation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also a major problem and of major significance that this government is clearly willing to act in breach of international law. We should not be surprised, because in recent times this government has clearly waived with disdain, and thumbed its nose at, UN conventions year after year, and it has come out and publicly attacked UN human rights bodies as having no say in what Australia does. So, in some ways, it is no surprise. It is the end outcome after you have allowed a government to get away with thumbing its nose at one particular UN convention, saying, `We're going to ignore that one; it doesn't matter.' Once it has set that precedent and said, `The UN's processes don't matter; the multilateral framework doesn't matter; international law and conventions don't matter,' this is the end outcome. You get nations saying, `We'll do what we want. We don't care what the conventions are, what the rules are and what the law is.'

It is clear that the United Nations resolution specifically authorised weapons inspectors to go and see if a peaceful disarmament were possible. But when they came back and said, `Yes, it's possible. Yes, we've got disarmament. Yes, we're moving forward,' it was the answer you did not want to hear, so you just ignore that and attack anyway.

It did not matter. The US did not care and did not want to wait. What a great reason for Australia to launch into war—that is, the US President got impatient. Pathetic!</para></talk.start></continue><para>In addition, this conflict is likely to cost Australians billions of dollars.

If it were only the financial cost, that would be the least of our problems. This decision has made Australia a less secure and less safe place for our children and for future generations. That is the great irresponsibility of this government's actions. Supposedly in the name of war on terror, despite no link between Saddam Hussein and the situation in Bali or September 11, undoubtedly we are now led into a situation where we will be a bigger terrorist target. We will have inflamed terrorist recruiting agents and organisations around the world, and our actions will lead to greater global instability and to a breakdown of the multilateral frameworks for dealing with issues of disarmament and global security. That is the outcome: a less secure planet, a less secure region, a less secure nation. Australians will be less secure and less safe. Brilliant policy! But George Bush likes it, so I guess that makes it all okay.</para><para>The other question is: where will it end? What happens next, if this is justified? We are now signed up lock, stock and barrel with the United States's foreign policy and military policy.

So not only is today a potential disaster for Australia, but we may be signing ourselves up for the long term. Whatever nation is next in the sights of the absolute neoconservative hawks that are running the agenda in the US, we will be there—we will be in Iran, we will be in somewhere else in the Middle East. That is where we will be. Instead of playing a role in our region, with peacekeeping forces working cooperatively with other countries, addressing real security threats to our country, we are off on global pursuits with the United States and their new world order. That is what we have signed up to. That is what our Prime Minister has signed us up to. That is why this statement and this motion by the government are so abhorrent and will be strongly opposed by the Democrats.</para><para>In addition to the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner, which the Democrats support, I move: </para><para>At the end of the amendment, add:</para><quote><para>	(f)	is of the view that the decision of the Australian Government to commit Australian troops to an invasion of Iraq is clearly being done without the authorisation or support of the UN Security Council;</para><para>	(g)	condemns and opposes the decision of the Australian Cabinet and the President of the United States of America (Mr Bush) to commit troops to an imminent attack on Iraq;</para><para>	(h)	calls for the Australian troops to be withdrawn and returned home immediately; and</para><para>	(i)	calls on the Australian and the United States governments to continue the policy of containment and disarmament through weapons inspections under the existing UN Security Council authority, as proposed by the governments of France, Germany and Russia. </para></quote><para>The policy of containment and disarmament through weapons inspections under the existing United Nations Security Council authority was clearly working effectively without causing mass death.

This is probably the most difficult decision that the Prime Minister, the government and the parliament have ever had to face. I have been here 20 years and it is the most difficult decision that I have seen. I have seen some very hard decisions having to be made, but this one is the most difficult. I certainly do not envy the Prime Minister having to make this decision. But I have said it before and I will say it again: the easiest thing to do in this world is to do nothing.

The coalition of Australia, Britain and America have bent over backwards to do everything possible to solve this diplomatically.

They have had to be rescued on two occasions by the Americans. As my friend and colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald said, they also had to rely on the Americans to get them out of Indochina, and I think he will say more on that when he speaks. Twice the Americans had to come in and save France and then later the French completely turned their backs and walked away—that is gratitude for you. The fact is, if you have the French saying that they will veto any proposal to disarm Iraq using military force, before the resolution even hits the table, you are giving the Iraqis comfort and sustenance and you are nurturing and sustaining their president, Mr Hussein. You are also saying to the smaller nations on the Security Council that there is no point taking a vote as it is just going to be vetoed. Why would anybody put their hand up in that situation? Perhaps if the French had not interfered, we would have seen more decisive action from the UN Security Council and a strong 18th resolution— we have already passed 17 resolutions. Then Saddam Hussein would have seen that the game was up and surrendered his weapons of mass destruction before the deployment of troops was necessary. That was a possibility before the French intervened and poured buckets over everyone; after that, there was no possibility of that outcome.</para><para>This conflict is nothing new. It began in 1989. I can remember speaking from the other side of the Senate when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. I remember the speeches well. The disarmament of Iraq that is going to take place over the next few days is supported and underpinned by no less than 17 United Nations resolutions dating back to the Gulf War in the 1990s. In 1991, when Saddam Hussein was in full retreat and his armies were surrendering to the press corps, television crews or anybody else they could find, Saddam Hussein agreed to disarm and to provide the United Nations with proof of disarmament. That agreement was covered by UN resolutions 678 and 687. Subsequently, there have been 17 UN resolutions to date, including the most recent and stringent resolution, resolution 1441. The Gulf War ended 12 years ago. We have had weapons inspectors in Iraq from time to time. They have continually been led on a wild goose chase around Iraq. We have seen very few results. We have seen Mr Butler, who was a weapons inspector, go in there and confidently proclaim that there were weapons of mass destruction and that they had to be found. The inspectors received no support and were, in fact, evicted from the country.</para><para>It is only when Saddam Hussein is directly under threat that he is prepared to act. He allows a dribble of information out as a public relations exercise, he obfuscates and he tries to hold the line. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has said that without the pressure applied by the United States and Britain in recent times weapons inspectors would not have been allowed back into Iraq. How long are we expected to wait? It has now been 12 years. How long are we expected to stand by and watch people being exterminated in Iraq? Saddam Hussein has become an expert at brinkmanship. He is more interested in public relations than in actual disarmament. He cannot disarm; he cannot control his minorities unless he has those weapons of mass destruction. He has perfected the art of doing just enough to keep in front of the game and keep his corrupt regime afloat while continuing to defy the rest of the world over his possession of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>There are 6,500 chemical bombs; 550 shells filled with mustard gas; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents, including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve agent VX; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, 300 tonnes of which could only be used for the production of VX gas; 8,500 litres of anthrax; 30,000 special munitions designed to carry biological agents and 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media for use in the production of anthrax which are unaccounted for. If that does not provide a threat to the whole of the world then people are just not concentrating. That is a massive storehouse of death. No-one has been able to find that material or account for it to date. Apart from the al-Samoud 2 missiles and some empty chemical warheads, nothing has been found. Where are all these missing items? Why has Saddam Hussein failed to give them up? Why have none of the inspectors been able to provide solid evidence of their decommissioning or destruction? We have not had any of those questions answered. </para><para>We have not heard what the Democrats or the opposition propose to do about this storehouse of death in Iraq—`Just wash it under the table; don't worry about it. If we don't worry about it, it won't happen.' My experience of life is that it will happen. I am a great believer in Murphy's law: it always happens, and at the worst possible time. Where are all of these missing items? No-one knows anything about them. We know that they were there—we have evidence of that—but we have no evidence that they were decommissioned or destroyed.</para><para>Every night Saddam Hussein appears on television as a smiling, benevolent dictator. He has people in Iraq so terrified that they have to give him some form of endorsement. There is no country in this world more oppressed than Iraq. Since he came to power, he has waged war on his neighbour Iran and has destroyed one million people, both Iranians and his own people the Iraqis. He has gassed his own minority groups, including the Kurdish people, and he has destroyed the marshlands and the marsh people. I understand that that was the most beautiful piece of Iraq, but he has put canals right through it and destroyed it. In addition, 200,000 people have disappeared from jails and have not been heard from again and four million people have chosen to flee the country. Yet we still stand by and say, after 12 years, that we will give him another go so that he can kill another million people, gas another Kurd or Arab minority and destroy 200,000 more people in his jails.</para><para>In the case of Kuwait, the world said, `Enough is enough,' and intervened. This is no benevolent dictator. This man has the worst record on human rights in the history of the world. Saddam Hussein has killed members of his own political party, not to mention his two sons-in-law. For those reasons alone we should want to remove Saddam Hussein, but there are more reasons. There are further implications that must be addressed. How does the world stop people like Saddam Hussein, who has such an atrocious record, if we continue to ignore them and give them 12 years to crib and cheat for a further time? What sanctions can be placed on dictators who go down this path of genocide, murder and rape if we are not able to discipline these evil people?</para><para>Since September 11 and the Bali bombings, we have recognised that we are living in a different world—a world where terrorism exists. We have learned the hard way, through losing so many young Australians in Bali, that terrorism must be addressed in all of its forms. We cannot allow terrorists and rogue states like Iraq to thumb their noses at the rest of the world by developing and producing chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction. If the world fails to address the fact that rogue states like Iraq have weapons of mass destruction, we leave the door open for the proliferation of these devastating weapons in that country and in other countries throughout the world. It becomes only a matter of time before terrorists gain access to weapons of mass destruction. How does the world rein in North Korea or any other rogue state if the authority that we have is ignored and if no-one addresses problems like Iraq? We are setting ourselves on a road to destruction. It just gives some of these small rogue states the go-ahead. It gives them a tick instead of bringing them back into line.</para><para>The defence of Australia relies on the ANZUS treaty. We have a standing army of around 75,000 people in the Australian Defence Force—that includes the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. It is not a large army by world standards. In fact, it is quite a small army. We have defence obligations to America, as they have to us. This is not the only reason for supporting America, but it is a significant one. Defence can never be a one-way street. We hope that we will never have to call on the ANZUS treaty for the defence of our own nation, but we cannot have it both ways. We cannot just let the Americans do all of the hard yards and not pull our weight. Australia has always been and is always prepared to lift our share of the load. </para><para>Unlike Mr Crean, who cannot bring himself to recognise that we need to do our share of the work, in 1998 Labor's former leader Mr Beazley supported an ADF forward deployment to put more pressure on Saddam Hussein. He recognised the importance of putting more pressure on Hussein and was prepared to bring bipartisan support for military deployment. Mr Beazley was prepared to support Australia pulling its weight when it came to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I am sad to say that it is unlikely that we will secure bipartisan support for this action. It is the first time that we will send troops into war without bipartisan support. Our troops deserve the support of the Australian people. They do not make the political decisions—they just carry them out. We know they will carry out their duties with all the diligence and skill that has traditionally been expected of and delivered by members of the Australian armed forces.</para><para>The situation is this: massive amounts of bacteria, chemicals, munitions, anthrax and other agents in Iraq have never been found or accounted for. We have one of the worst violators of human rights running the country in Iraq. Terrorism is now a fact of life. Australia has felt it, and many Australian families have felt it personally. Can we as Australians accept the threat of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists? The answer must be a resounding no. We have obligations under the ANZUS treaty. There are compelling reasons why we must stand by our obligations and disarm Saddam Hussein. In the long term, we cannot accept this threat to our way of life. Appeasement has never been successful. It did not work in Chamberlain's time and it never will work with people like Saddam Hussein. Any sign of weakness allows him to procrastinate further—it gives him strength.</para><para>There is no-one in this parliament who will get any joy out of this decision today, but I know that in the long term it is the correct decision. It would have been easier for the Prime Minister to walk away from this, but he has faced the reality of a leader and put the best interests of Australia first. It must have been the hardest decision that he has made or that any Prime Minister has to make—to deploy people into a war zone. However, it is important that we support the Prime Minister. He made the right decision, and I certainly give him all my support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>9514</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party opposes today's decision for Australia to go to war with Iraq. Labor will not support it because we believe it is wrong. We believe the decision diminishes Australia and all Australians. Many people in this chamber have argued that war is the option of last resort. What we have seen today is the taking of a option well before reaching the last resort. The rush to war on the USA timetable has rejected the chance to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein. No-one in this chamber would argue that Saddam Hussein is anything but evil. He ought to be disarmed, and successive Australian governments of both persuasions have supported the efforts of the United Nations to do so. That has been a bipartisan position, I think, across all political parties and groups inside this chamber. There is no support for Saddam Hussein or for his regime, and there is no argument that he has been a brutal dictator who has wreaked havoc on his people, but that does not mean that we must wage war on the Iraqi people.</para></talk.start><para>By taking this decision today, the Australian government has supported the pre-emptive strike doctrine that the USA has been advocating in the last year or so. It will lead to greater international instability, at the cost of Australia's national interests. This does not further Australia's national interests; it diminishes them. The response in the region to our government's actions will ensure that Australia's position—its standing— and trust in Australia will be severely diminished. Many of our neighbours are deeply concerned about the Australian government's commitment to join the USA in acting outside of the United Nations in declaring war on Iraq.</para><para>The Howard government has given up on the view of Australia having its own national interest in favour of unflinching and uncritical support for US foreign policy. We do not have an Australian foreign policy anymore in relation to Iraq; we just have a US foreign policy. I think there was nothing more demeaning for the Prime Minister or for Australia than seeing John Howard waiting by the phone for the call from George Bush to tell him what he, the USA President, in concert with the Prime Minister of Britain and the leaders of Spain and Portugal, had determined about Australia's commitment to war. When Bush rang, Howard jumped—and Australia was at war. I think that is demeaning to Australia and Australians and sets a very bad precedent that will come back to haunt us in years to come. </para><para>This decision undermines international law and the role of the UN. It is interesting that so far I have seen only five of 190 UN members actually commit to the coalition of the willing. This is not a broad based international movement; this is a very small group of countries who have determined to support the USA in its action against Iraq in the face of overwhelming international opinion against such action. We are out of step with the majority of our international neighbours who have made a decision that they would rather support the United Nations as the means to resolve international disputes. They would rather support the multilateral resolution of disputes than endorse, as this decision does, the doctrine of pre-emptive strike, the doctrine that might is right and the position adopted by Australia that its relationship with the USA is the predominant determinant of its national interests. We say that Australia ought to determine its own national interests and have an independent foreign policy and that we should have pursued that in recent months.</para><para>Having failed to pursue an independent national foreign policy, we find ourselves answering George Bush's call for war in the affirmative. The Labor Party will have no part in it. The Labor Party believe that waging war on Iraq is wrong. We do not support it and we will oppose it. A peaceful solution was possible. The work of the weapons inspectors was proving to be effective, assisting in reducing the risk, and various commentators have assessed the risk from Iraq's weaponry as being significantly less than it was at the time of the Gulf War. We still believe that a peaceful solution is possible and, therefore, Labor cannot support this war.</para><para>Like most Australians, my thoughts turn to those who are now at risk due to this war. The people of Iraq, obviously, will be most at risk, and our thoughts go out to them. We hope that the casualties are minimal and that they suffer as little as possible. Our thoughts also turn to the troops of the coalition, especially the Australian troops, and their safety. The casualties of war and the people put at risk should be foremost in our minds. I suppose they are one of the major reasons why Labor does not support this action. In particular, our thoughts turn to the 2,000 ADF personnel who have already been deployed to the gulf—2,000 mainly young Australians whose lives have now been put at risk by this decision. This is the largest combat force since Vietnam, and it has been deployed to Iraq, a country that held very little political interest for this country until recent months.</para><para>In a previous debate on this issue I covered some of the strategic issues involved in this decision and I do not intend to canvass that ground again today. I want to concentrate on those ADF personnel who have been deployed. They are highly trained and highly capable personnel who, I am sure, will do Australia proud. I think all Australians join with us in wishing them well and hoping for their safe return. Certainly as Labor's defence spokesman, I offer them Labor support. I offer them our unflinching support that we will use all our endeavours to support them in whatever way we can. They will, as all Australians will, be affected by the severe political divide that has opened up in this country on this issue. You cannot get away from it. Many Australians oppose this war. The alternative government, the Australian Labor Party, opposes this war. The Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats oppose this war. There is huge opposition in Australia to the government's decision.</para><para>I do not underestimate the stress and the difficulty that places on Australian Defence Force personnel. They would much prefer to have bipartisan support for their actions. They would much prefer to be going to an action, such as in East Timor, where they had broad based public support. They would much prefer to be going in where they had UN endorsement for their actions. So they will be impacted by the political debate in Australia and that will make life harder for them. They remember the experiences of Vietnam. They have spoken to many veterans about it. I know it is uppermost in their minds. </para><para>Like all Australians, they share a range of political views on this conflict. The ADF personnel are no different to any other group of Australians. There are Labor voters and Liberal voters—even perhaps Green voters, Senator Brown—in the ADF. They share a range of political views about the morality and the legality of this deployment. They are, I know, concentrating on the issue of UN endorsement. While many are keen to exercise their skills and regard this as a good opportunity to do what they have trained for, they also understand the personal risks and the divisions that will occur in Australia as this debate plays out.</para><para>It is interesting that previously a lot of my colleagues have assumed that all in the military would be in favour of military action. It has been helpful that people like General Peter Gration, the former CDF, Admiral Alan Beaumont, also a former CDF, Admiral Mike Hudson, the former Chief of Navy, and Major General Peter Phillips from the RSL all signed a letter in September expressing their concern about the path the government was taking us down. I quote their response to our being involved in a non-UN endorsed action:</para><quote><para>It would constitute a failure of the duty of government to protect the integrity and ensure the security of our nation to commit any Australian forces in support of a US military offensive against Iraq without the backing of a specific UN security resolution.</para></quote><para>That is a very clear statement from former chiefs of the Defence Force reflecting their view about the government's decision to embark on a non-UN sanctioned military action, and that is a view that many in the ADF share. As I say, there is a range of opinion inside the ADF. I do not pretend to speak for them or say that they are of one mind, but they are very concerned about any decision to be involved in a military action that does not have UN sanction. It is an issue many of them have raised with me. It is a function of their involvement in previous UN actions, it is a function of the extremely good training we provide them with, which stresses the need to act in accordance with international law, and it is a function of their own integrity. There will be a great deal of concern about the government's decision to go ahead without UN sanction.</para><para>The divergence in political opinion in this country represents a huge challenge to the whole Australian community and the Australian political leadership. As the Labor Defence spokesman, I personally find it an enormous challenge, because we have to conduct this political debate in Australia without undermining the support for our troops who have been deployed into what will be a very dangerous war.</para><para>The Labor Party opposes the political decision to deploy those troops to war but supports the troops. That is not an easy thing to argue or articulate. But our argument is with the government. Our argument is with the decision by John Howard taken in June last year to sign up to the American military resolve to invade Iraq. We have been locked into this for a long time—we know that—but only today do we get the formal announcement. It is a challenge to make sure that the focus of the debate is on the political decision, is on the government and not on the Australian troops who are acting lawfully. The Australian troops have been deployed in accordance with Australian law by the elected government. Quite frankly, whatever this parliament decides, that remains true. I personally will not be voting for the government motion, but the fact remains that those troops have been deployed legally, and we support them.</para><para>I am reminded that I attended the final farewell of Australian troops at the so-called predeployment at Holdsworthy base in Sydney on 14 February. It was a farewell for the 4RAR Commandos and elements of the IRR. You could not meet a more impressive group of young men and women going off to represent Australia. They are incredibly skilled, intelligent and committed. They are a credit to Australia, a credit to the ADF and a credit to their families and friends. I had the opportunity to speak to them. There was obviously a great deal of anxiety and nervousness because they were soon to be deployed. Afterwards I got to speak to their families and a number of them came up to me and thanked me for the Labor Party's support for their position because I outlined that we continue to support the troops even though we oppose the deployment. A number of the parents in particular came and expressed their gratitude because they were concerned about the impact of this debate on their family members. They knew there was going to be huge debate in Australia over the war. They knew a lot of Australians were opposed to it and were concerned about their loved ones being the subject of that debate. I tried to reassure them that the debate was at a political level, that the debate was about the government decision. It was interesting that some of those family members actually opposed the war. Some of them said that they personally opposed the war but that they supported their son or daughter being legally deployed, as they were, by the government. It was an emotional and difficult experience for me but a valuable one. </para><para>The next day, like thousands of other Australians on 15 February, I attended the peace rally. With my family I attended the peace rally in Perth, where 10,000 people marched expressing their opposition to war and their support for peace. There were a lot of impressive young Australians at those rallies too, a lot of Australians who had made the commitment to support peace, to oppose war, to say that there is a better way of resolving conflict than bombing people. It was an honest expression of their view, which I shared. I had seen two sets of impressive young Australians on successive days—one at a farewell for the troops and one at a rally opposing the war. Some people might think I am a bit schizophrenic, but I think it reflected that I was proud of both groups of young Australians and proud of our society in that we can have these disagreements and debates. Some of the soldiers have made the point to me that one of the things they thought worth fighting for was democracy, that ability for our citizens to be able to freely express their point of view. That was a very difficult period for me, and I think it reflected the division and the complex nature of what we now confront as a community.</para><para>We want to support the Australian troops, but many of us do not want to support this war. We are going to have a very fierce political debate about this. Many of us are going to be not only vehemently opposed to the government's decision—will argue for its reversal, will argue for the withdrawal of troops—but also very strenuous in ensuring that the troops, the Australian Defence Force personnel, do not become the subject of that debate. They are deployed legally and in accordance with ADF procedures. We wish them well and we hope for their safe return. Certainly, from Labor's perspective, Graham Edwards and I will be doing all we can to ensure that we support them in every way possible, because they are acting under a legitimate decision of government. The deployment is legal.</para><para>I want to touch briefly on another issue that has been raised, because I think there has been some ill-informed debate about legality around the place. There is no doubt that there is a live debate about whether or not the decision to go to war is legal in terms of international law. That is a debate that is going to be held over the next few months and probably over the next 20 years, as international lawyers and others debate whether or not going into a war without UN sanction is legal. Labor's view is that our opposition to war is not based on legality; it is based on our judgment that this war is wrong. So nothing turns on it for me, but what does concern me is any suggestion that our troops are acting illegally, because that is not the case. They have been deployed legally by the elected government. They will operate under proper terms of engagement. They will operate within the terms of the Geneva convention and they have no greater risk to International Criminal Court prosecution or any other action than if they had been sent on a UN endorsed mission. That is the point I want to make clear both to the troops and to the Australian community: there are no greater legal risks associated for our troops as a result of this decision than had it been UN endorsed.</para><para>The argument again is with the government, whether the government has acted legally in joining this war. I suspect that is an issue that will get played out quite seriously over the coming months and years, because there is a very strong body of opinion which suggests that in joining a war without UN sanction we may be subject to the charge of involvement in an illegal war. But I wanted to make it clear that the troops are acting legally. They have no greater risk than if they had a UN sanction to the action and they have no greater risk as a result of our signing up to the International Criminal Court than they would have otherwise. </para><para>Some of the ill-informed comment that has been circulating in the last few days is very unhelpful and undermines the efforts of our troops. Our troops will act legally within their terms of engagement and, as always, the only risk to Australian service personnel serving in any action is if they do not comply with those proper terms of engagement and are guilty of some sort of war crime. That is the only occasion on which they would get into any difficulty. I think it is important that we recognise that.</para><para>I think it is a huge challenge for the Australian community to focus in on the debate about the war and not withdraw or diminish our support for the Australian troops. I certainly make that commitment because I am aware of their concern, and have concern for them, as to how this debate will impact on them and their ability to do their jobs. But Labor will oppose this war. I will oppose this war because it is wrong. It does not have UN sanction, it does not have international support and we have resorted to war when peaceful outcomes were still possible. For all those reasons it is wrong. It takes us down a very dangerous path. It sets a precedent of pre-emptive strike, of a recognition of might being right, that will come back to haunt the world and Australia in coming years.</para><para>We cannot turn our back on international law, on the UN's role, merely because it suits us to please a powerful ally. We have to take a stance based on Australia's national interest. We have not done that on this occasion, and that puts Australians at greater risk and will, I think, harm Australia for many years to come. We ought to oppose this war. I urge the government to pull back—there is still time. We ought not support a war on Iraq while peaceful solutions still remain open to us. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9518</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me begin by joining the rest of the Senate in expressing the Australian Greens' support for the Australian Defence Force personnel who have been deployed to Iraq by the Prime Minister without the authority of this parliament and without the backing of the Australian people. They are in the service of this great country. They are there because the Prime Minister has directed them, and the responsibility for any outcome is therefore firmly with the Prime Minister and not with those 2,000 Australians good and true. To that end, I foreshadow an amendment to the Labor amendment which would add:</para></talk.start><para>(f)	calls on the Australian government to immediately return Australia's 2,000 Defence Force personnel home.</para><para>This Prime Minister will bear some responsibility for each drop of blood shed in Iraq in the coming months. This Prime Minister bears total responsibility for every drop of Australian blood shed on the sands of Iraq in the coming months. This Prime Minister has deployed Australian Defence Force personnel into the Iraq theatre of war at the behest of George W. Bush but without the imprimatur of the Australian people. The Prime Minister in his press conference today said on the one hand, `I speak for Australia,' and on the other, `I ask the Australian people to support me.' He cannot have it both ways, nor does he. This Prime Minister on this issue does not speak for Australia. He speaks from the office which Australians have given him but never on this issue. No Australian has voted for him to arrogate unto himself the power to deploy Australian troops into this illegal war. No Australian has been asked by the Prime Minister. There has been no reference to the Australian people and, worse, there has been no reference to the Australian parliament. He does not, and will not, have the vote of the people or this parliament for this involvement in a war which is not Australia's.</para><para>Those of us who listened to the Prime Minister this morning further heard him say, `In a democracy a government makes the decision.' Wrong, honourable Prime Minister. In a democracy, the power for the decision comes from the people and is rightfully with the parliament. But this Prime Minister has made a decision without the stamp of approval of that democratic system. If there is one thing the Greens will move to fix over the coming years it is this silence of the Constitution which the Prime Minister has abused to make this decision without the authority of the parliament. The fulcrum of democracy is the parliament; it is not the executive. The people's trust is in the parliament, not in the Prime Minister's office. The people elect members of parliament; they do not elect the Prime Minister. The parliament ought to give the assent to the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel as under the Constitution in defence of this country or the states. Without that, the Prime Minister is usurping the spirit of the Constitution, and that is what he has done today.  </para><para>Let us pause to reflect that there are no New Zealanders going to this war. There are no Canadians. There are no Japanese defence force personnel, nor any from China or France or Germany. Insofar as the Prime Minister makes out that he has made a decision which is in keeping with the community of nations he is deceiving himself, even if he cannot deceive this country. When he says that he does it with the imprimatur of law, again he is deceiving himself, if not this country. The actions of the Prime Minister in this matter, in refusing to bring forward legal authority until after the fatal decision has been made, speak for themselves. Of course, we can get a legal opinion to back almost everything but the fact remains that this deployment to Iraq does not have the imprimatur of the United Nations. It does not have the imprimatur of the Security Council. It would not have got the imprimatur of either the permanent members of the Security Council who can levy a veto—and three of the five would have—or the majority of the Security Council. This is a confined and restricted number of nations which, because it happens to include the most powerful nation on earth, has deceived itself into believing it therefore has the community of nations onside when patently it does not. A series of like nations to Australia around the world have had leaders with the wisdom of their national interest to not involve themselves at the behest of George W. Bush in the way that Prime Minister Howard has done.</para><para>What a world we are in in the year 2003, with massive advances in technology which have extended the potential for human existence on this planet in unimaginable ways compared with the lives of our forebears. But with that technology has come enormous power to change life on the planet. With that technology has come the ability to levy great evil as well as great good. The powerhouse of that technology is the rich countries of the world and foremost the United States of America. The weapons of mass destruction that are so much the key to this debate have largely emanated from that powerhouse and from other like countries from Russia through China, Italy and Britain—the wealthy countries of the world. There is a standard law here: if a weapon, a technology, becomes available to one person on this planet it will inevitably become available to all persons on this planet. If a weapon becomes available to governments on this planet it will become available to malefactors on this planet—to terrorists. There is behind these turbulent events of the moment a need for a rethink by the whole of humanity on this planet. There is a need for global governance, there is a need for global democracy and there is a need for global liberty which is governed by that democracy. The present circumstances underscore how this cannot be left with those who are wealthy, under the dictum that might is right.</para><para>Where are the cries from our leaders in this country, or in the United States, to put a bridle on these weapons of mass destruction? Where is the prohibition on laboratories around the world which are experimenting with biological, chemical or nuclear weaponry? They should be closed down, wherever they might be, because they work against the interests of humanity and life on this planet. Quite to the contrary, at the moment under President Bush there is more spending than ever before in history on weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the threat to human life on this planet—and, indeed, all life on this planet—increases, under the very president who has today de facto declared war on a so-called rogue state because it has the future potential to misuse weapons of mass destruction, the technology for which was supplied by his own country just a decade or two back to the dictator he now wants to attack and put out of action. </para><para>If there is one thing that we must learn from this, it is that we have a global and collective responsibility—and President Bush, of any person on this planet, bears the greatest responsibility—to bring in a universal, democratic system and to upgrade the United Nations or move to a world parliament which can deal with nefarious technological misuse and the spending of billions of dollars on that misuse to line the pockets of some and to give inordinate power, through the threat of cruel misuse of these weapons, to some against the welfare of the rest. If there is one good thing to come out of these terrible events, it must be a reappraisal by humanity, by the six billion of us on the planet in 2003, of the rapid spread of technologies which threaten not just part or several of the nations of this world but everybody and everybody's future. And yet there is no mention of this in the speeches of President Bush.</para><para>The Australian people do not trust President Bush, and therefore they do not like the chain of command from President Bush to Prime Minister Howard, at his leave, and therefore to our Defence Force personnel. The Australian people have a great, wonderful, long-term relationship with the American people, but that is quite different from their feeling for this administration. In this country, President Bush is not trusted, he is not liked and he is not seen as being for the good or on the side of good. He is seen to be straying away from that and to be, himself, a nidus of great danger in international relations and for the peace of all the peoples on this planet. His speech today did nothing to assuage that feeling that many people in this country and around the world have about this president who is abusing the great power and honour of the office that he has taken to become the president of the most powerful country on the face of the planet in 2003.</para><para>This year, $1.5 trillion will be spent on arming, equipping and deploying offence forces. Just 10 per cent of that sum would supply all the necessities to ensure that everybody on this planet had a fulfilling existence. Where is the moral claim of a president whose nation will spend half that money this year—three-quarters of a trillion dollars—but cannot put 10 per cent of it across to meet the necessities of all the millions of people in this world who are undergoing cruel and terrible deprivation? This president has homed in, after years of inaction, on the Butcher of Baghdad, who was supplied with weapons by the Reagan government and supported—or, at least, there was a deathly silence from the Reagan government in the 1980s—in the use of those weapons. Can President Bush not see, from his Christian standpoint, that to put this money, these billions of dollars, into armaments but not to give it to children who do not have clean water, to mothers who want to feed their babies or to people who simply want shelter, clothes and a job is a direct act of unchristianity?</para><para>Today when the President, having said that America is a country of peace—in defiance of that spending—ended his speech with `God bless America', he again showed the arrogance and the small-mindedness that he has in his pre-eminent position as an arbiter of what goes on in this world. He has usurped the United Nations and arrogated unto himself the power, through sheer firepower, to do what he and his coterie want to do in the world in their sectional interests— which God does not serve. Whatever else can be said about God, it is not the priority or the prerogative of the United States, or the President of the United States. It is an entity which gives life to everybody on this planet, is shared by everybody on this planet and has the right of protection of everybody on this planet—and has the obligation to see that none on the planet are discriminated against in the way that President Bush would have it.</para><para>Today, the Prime Minister of this country, following through on a series of adventures—most notably the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> affair—determined that he could read the mood of this nation. But he has misread it. I can tell him that, if he picked up the phone and answered the calls going to his office today and made himself aware of the tears being shed by people ringing their politicians right around the country, he would understand the depth of feeling against what he has done. </para><para>This Prime Minister has taken office, but not on this issue. This is a Prime Minister who is `Mr 22 per cent' in today's poll. Seventy-one cent of the Australian people are against what he is doing and 22 per cent are in favour. And he has asked the Australian people to get behind him! I ask the Prime Minister: is it not your job to get behind the Australian people? Who has primacy in this country—the people or the unelected Prime Minister? He is elected to this parliament as a representative, but not into that position, and he was never given that power and that authority to deploy Australians into this war, which is not Australia's war.</para><para>Throughout these trying times, the Greens will continue at every opportunity not only to support the Australian men and women who find themselves deployed to this war, but to get them home—hence our amendment to the motion. They should be brought home immediately. I expect that, until that day arrives, many people in this country—including people who voted for this Prime Minister—will not be able to rest. It is a dastardly decision that this Prime Minister has made. It is wrong in principle. It is against the interests of this nation, no matter how much and how often he says the contrary is the case. Above all, it has made those men and women in the defence forces subject to all manner of risks in the coming period which they should never have been put in a position of having to endure.</para><para>We live in a difficult and trying world. The potential for destruction is unprecedented. But until we have leadership that is prepared to make this a fairer world, we cannot expect it to become a more settled world. Until we have leadership that will put butter before guns, we are in a more dangerous and less happy world. If we are going to export democracy and liberty we should exercise it at home. It is no good having democratic leaders at home who are dictators abroad. We live on a globalising planet; we live in an age of globalisation. That does not just mean economic globalisation. In fact, it means economic globalisation least of all. This is globalisation of human history, human advancement and the search for security and happiness in the future. You do not get that by the invention of—and spending of money on—more and more weapons of mass destruction, when there are so many people in need on this planet. Today, the Prime Minister has made an egregious mistake out of his own hubris. We will do everything we can in coming times to rescue what we can from the results of that mistake. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>9521</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion before the Senate requires us to consider matters that go to the heart of international peace and security. The motion relates to matters that will have a profound effect on the shape of the world in which we live now and in the future. I note that a number of today's headlines cannot resist characterising the latest developments as `the moment of truth'. But the real truth is that, despite some last-minute cosmetic hyperactivity which falls far short of the immediate and complete cooperation required unanimously by the Security Council a little more than three months ago, Iraq continues to defy the international community, just it is has done for the last 12 years.</para></talk.start><para>Today's decision by the government to commit Australian forces to the operational control of the coalition field commander, in support of military action in the gulf region, has not been an easy or popular one. Indeed, the easy decision would have been to capitulate to the siren calls of several permanent Security Council members who in recent times have called for Saddam Hussein to be given more time to cooperate with UN inspectors. But history is replete with examples of how the soft option can make matters infinitely worse. Today's decision is not some knee-jerk falling into line with US wishes. Whilst the American alliance is fundamentally important, it is not and should not be determinative of Australia's interests. The duly elected government of the Commonwealth, alone, should make that decision, and it has. </para><para>It is also critically important to understand that such action has only been taken as a last resort after diplomacy and other efforts have failed. The government believes in the primacy of international law and the pivotal role of the United Nations. On no fewer than 17 occasions, the Security Council has considered the question of Iraq and its continued failure to comply with its disarmament obligations. As recently as November last year, the Security Council, including France, solemnly concluded that Iraq was in material breach of its Security Council obligations and should be given one last opportunity of full compliance. </para><para>As the legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, made public today, makes it clear, those actions are firmly based in international law. It also makes it clear that the Security Council has already endorsed the use of force. In the eloquent words of Professor Ruth Wedgwood, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> of 14 March:</para><quote><para>Resolution 687 is the mother of all resolutions setting out the requirements for a post Gulf War Iraq. This 1991 resolution requires in perpetuity that Iraq gives up its weapons of mass destruction and permits verification. Resolution 687 designates Iraq's acceptance of this requirement as a continuing condition of the Gulf War ceasefire. Teeth are also supplied by resolution 678 authorising the Allies to expel Iraq from Kuwait and to use force in supporting all “subsequent relevant resolutions” needed to restore regional peace and security. Resolution 1441 explicitly recalls Resolution 678 which authorised “all necessary measures” to restore peace and security in the region.</para></quote><para>It is also important to appreciate the role of the UNMOVIC inspectors. We do not start with a clean slate where certain allegations have been made that Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction and it is then up to the inspectors to locate such weapons or prove beyond reasonable doubt that they exist. On the contrary, the UN has already established that Iraq is in possession of 6,500 chemical munitions with the potential content of 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents; 8,500 litres of anthrax; 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media, which could be used to make 5,000 litres of anthrax; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical agents; 1.5 tonnes of VX; and 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals. The onus is therefore on Iraq to demonstrate that it has destroyed or no longer possesses such weapons. This it has manifestly failed to do. Indeed, Dr Blix noted in his most recent report, of 7 March, to the Security Council that Iraq knows the names of people involved with the destruction of materials from proscribed programs and therefore should have records that it could hand over to UNMOVIC, but it has chosen not to do so.</para><para>It is worth considering what has occurred since France and other Security Council nations supported resolution 1441. Has Iraq made any genuine attempts to cooperate and fulfil its international obligations? The short answer is no. On several occasions it has deliberately waited until the last moment before making gestures designed to please those who no longer want to hold Iraq to those obligations. To pretend, as France does, that the UN inspectors need more time is to ignore the reality that the inspectors will never be in a position to make definitive judgments without the full cooperation of Iraq. Indeed, its grudging cooperation to date has only been brought about by the forward deployment of troops, not because of any change of heart on the part of Saddam Hussein.</para><para>France, through its opportunistic spoiling role, has done the UN a grave disservice. Against this background it is difficult not to conclude that France is driven more by a desire to retrieve lost imperial ambitions while preserving its Iraqi oil interests than by any genuine desire to bring Iraq to account. It ought to be clear to anyone who has studied the events of the past several months that France has deliberately gone out of its way to ensure that there is no incentive for other members of the Security Council to support any second resolution. In these circumstances, the Australian government believes that it is untenable to leave forces in place and hope that Iraq will have a change of heart. Even more so, if one were to adopt the approach of the Labor Party and, of course, the Greens, and bring the troops home now, all such prospects would disappear, as anyone who has seriously studied recent events must appreciate. Many other countries share Australia's concern about the growing threat posed by Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and few, if any, argue that Iraq is cooperating as it is required to do. </para><para>It is very much in Australia's interest that the UN should as much as possible be the focal point for the resolution of international disputes. Indeed, the Security Council has a very specific responsibility in this regard. Failure of the UN system to follow through on the enforcement of its own resolutions should not mean that the UN is permanently sidelined. Indeed, those who have learnt the lessons of the failure of the League of Nations ought to appreciate that these are fragile vehicles through which we express international community views. If they are ignored or treated as political playthings then they lose their relevance and, as a result, we need then to start the process all over again. So it is very much in Australia's interests that the UN should as much as possible remain relevant. It is therefore pleasing to note that the United States and the United Kingdom both accept that, despite the attempts of others to render the Security Council irrelevant in resolving the current crisis, the UN still has a very important role to play in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq.</para><para>Australia's distance from the gulf region has led some to argue that Australia could decline to actively participate in military action in the region whilst at the same time expressing support and solidarity for our allies. This would not be a responsible attitude to burden sharing, let alone would it be in Australia's interests. We all aspire to live in a world of peace and security. It is our permanent hope that the world will be a better place once Saddam Hussein has been disarmed and the prospects of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists have thereby been significantly reduced. In reading President Bush's statement of today, I note that he uses a very telling phrase:</para><quote><para>Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety.</para></quote><para>It is very easy to lampoon these objectives and characterise the Americans as hell-bent on pursuing their own interests without for a moment considering the very significant benefits that the world derives from having a superpower that is genuinely acting in the best interests of the international community.</para><para>One only had to listen to Senator Brown's rabid diatribe of anti-Americanism to realise that not only is he trying to personalise the debate and demonise the President but he is at all times trying to distract attention from the merits of the argument. At no time do we hear any positive alternatives other than that of moral leadership being required. When, of course, the Prime Minister of Australia or the President of the United States shows moral leadership and puts, as Mr Blair has done, a very courageous position forward—knowing, in Mr Blair's situation, that very many members of his own party are opposed—one has to say that that is a high degree of moral courage and admirable political leadership. And yet, the Greens and their fellow travellers would simply demean and decry those attempts without suggesting any other alternative.</para><para>It is simply not good enough to ignore the current realities. We are not dealing here with adversaries who are prepared to be reasonable. We are not dealing with someone who has been misunderstood or is in a desperately poor situation and has no choice but to respond in ways that are unacceptable to us. The fact is that by every assessment Saddam Hussein is not only a tyrant of the greatest magnitude but someone who is acting maliciously towards his own people, let alone towards the rest of the world. When someone has been given 17 opportunities to comply—not only voluntarily but also under the threat of force—and still refuses to do so, it is simply preposterous to argue that somehow more time will bring them to their senses. It ought to be abundantly clear to anyone who has an open mind on the subject that Saddam Hussein is not susceptible to any sort of logic or persuasion.</para><para>It is very easy to attribute base motives to other players, but does anyone seriously doubt that Australia's fundamental values and beliefs are not closely aligned with those of our major allies in this dispute? It is certainly not in our interest to see such value systems overthrown by militant fundamentalists who will resort to the use of chemical and biological weapons, and any other means by which to wreak maximum havoc upon the West. If there were a lesson to be learned from September 11, I would have thought it was that you have to be prepared. In this new world of uncertainty you cannot simply wait until you are attacked before you take action. Quite clearly, the Americans have a fairly high degree of preparedness, yet they were totally unable to do anything to anticipate that sort of catastrophic attack on their value system—let alone, of course, on the thousands of people who died as a result of that act. I think that tells us that if you were simply to wait until such time as Saddam Hussein decided to change his mind, or until other terrorists were to acquire weapons of mass destruction or chemical and biological weapons, you would be a sitting target. That is not the responsibility of a government; a government's responsibility is to do its very best to anticipate and pre-empt any reasonable apprehension of danger. That is what we are doing in this instance. It is of no consolation at all to wait until you are directly attacked and then wonder after the event why you did not take action. That is what royal commissions are all about—the benefit of hindsight and asking, `Why didn't you do these things?' We are doing them now, when it can make a very real difference. </para><para>In these circumstances Australia is determined to play its part in helping to make the world a safer place for all its inhabitants, despite the natural aversion and apprehension of many in the community to embarking upon military activity, especially when our own country is not directly and immediately under threat. I believe the Australian public does understand that the Prime Minister and the government are motivated only by a desire to act in the country's best interests and to achieve an outcome that not only will be of benefit to the rest of the world but particularly will assist in alleviating the suffering of those who have experienced the most extreme violence and invasion at the hands of the Iraqi regime. Much careful thought and reflection have gone into this decision, and I believe that the Australian community will very much appreciate that it is not the result of any capricious action on the part of the government but rather a reflection of a deep desire to do the right thing in the best interests of us all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>9524</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner. Clearly this government has decided unilaterally and without bipartisan support that the time for diplomacy is over. I find it difficult to accept that diplomacy can end simply because a non-military solution has not been found or the effort to find a better way has not been made. I have heard no suggestion from this government that Dr Blix was not doing his job or was not doing it well. There was certainly no suggestion by Dr Blix that he had finished his job. I hope that the other side of politics gets sick and tired of us saying that Australia should not be involved in this war against Iraq. The war is wrong and prosecuting it is clearly not in our national interest. There is a better way to disarm Iraq. As I said the last time this matter was before the Senate, Labor believes that, in the absence of an agreed UN Security Council resolution authorising military action against Iraq, there is no basis for military action to disarm Iraq. The war is wrong. This government has provided no justification for its action. Do not confuse this with any debate about us not being supportive of our alliance. As I said clearly last time, I support the alliance with the US. However, it does not mean that you follow them blindly on every issue; it does mean that you can be critical and supportive at the same time.</para></talk.start><para>Let us be clear that this government committed our troops not now but, in truth, many months ago. However, Mr Howard has only bothered to tell us today that our troops will participate in action against Iraq. I make it absolutely plain that my views about the troops themselves remain clear—I remain, as always, committed to them. The Australian government has directed actions in respect of this war, and as far as I am concerned the troops are acting appropriately and in accordance with the government's wishes. But that does not stop this from being a silly and reckless act by this government. My argument is against the actions taken by this government in respect of the pre-emptive war against Iraq. </para><para>The common agreement in this parliament on the debate about Iraq is in regard to Iraq's disarmament. Nobody disagrees that Iraq should disarm. We all agree that resolution 1441 issued by the United Nations Security Council should be adhered to, along with previous existing resolutions 687 and 1154. In themselves, those resolutions do not authorise individual member states to use force against Iraq, but they do contemplate further consideration of appropriate action by the Security Council. The Labor Party disagrees with the position taken by the Howard government when presenting their arguments to the public—a position which could only be taken to incite fear and mistrust in the community. Yesterday, the Prime Minister indicated during his media conference that it was likely Australia would enter into a conflict with Iraq. He said that Australia was morally correct and legally obliged to participate in military conflict to disarm Iraq, irrespective of a mandate being issued by the UN Security Council. In citing his reasons for moving forward without further debate, the Prime Minister said he based his decision on the assumption of what he believed to be in the best interests of the Australian people. I think he has got it very wrong.</para><para>The Howard government believe the UN lacks the collective will to force Iraq to disarm. They also believe that Iraq's weapons, both biological and chemical, could be used by terrorist organisations against other countries. The Prime Minister's statement has something for everyone. He even attempted to put forward the idea that there is a moral case for Australia to invade Iraq on human rights grounds and that the Iraqi people have been suffering under the force of a dictator, so it is time we stepped in to correct the problem. There we have strong words that are full of sentiment but not the real reason that Mr Howard has supported the coalition of the willing.</para><para>The UN is clearly capable of acting to address these issues. Many people throughout the world have suffered and continue to suffer at the hands of dictators, but we do not see Mr Howard stepping in on all occasions. This is not the real reason that the government have chosen to enter into a conflict. It is unbelievable and aimed at trying to win support from those people who have true human rights as a priority. If the Howard government are going to use that as a reason, they should at least be sincere and constant in their comments. For the past four months, the Howard government have tried to frighten, intimidate and coerce the general public into believing that it is in Australia's best interests to seriously consider the need to enter into a conflict specifically designed to disarm Iraq. The Prime Minister has chosen to ignore the efforts of the United Nations and to forge ahead. When the Howard government predeployed our troops, the Prime Minister sent a clear message to the Australian people that he would do what he thought best irrespective of possible diplomatic solutions, irrespective of what was good for Australia and without bipartisan support. </para><para>Without a further resolution by the United States, the Howard government has, firstly, willingly sent 2,000 Australian troops to war; secondly, actively undermined attempts by the United Nations to negotiate a peaceful solution; thirdly, ignored the pledge its predecessors made in 1945 to support the efforts of the United Nations to maintain peace and ignored concerns expressed by the Australian public, dismissing their comments and stance as ignorant and misinformed; and, finally, condemned many innocent people in Iraq.</para><para>The world has trusted the United Nations with maintaining peace and security. The United Nations has deployed a total of 54 peacekeeping forces and observer missions. It has been able to restore calm in areas of contention to allow the negotiating process to go forward while saving millions of people from becoming casualties of conflict. In Iraq, the peacekeepers did not fail; they were making progress. I believe it is immoral to go to war when Iraq could have been disarmed peacefully. Australians chose to become a member of the United Nations. We have a solid and proud history representing the interests of the United Nations in our peacekeeping duties. Australia pledged to follow the dictates of the United Nations when we became a member back in the 1940s. In doing so, Australia did not say, `Only if we like what you're saying at the time,' or `If it is politically expedient, we will ignore it,' but that is what we are doing at the present time. </para><para>The Labor Party has been clear on the subject of supporting the United Nations in its efforts to have Iraq disarm peacefully. Nobody wants to go to war. Labor has been consistent on the situation in Iraq since last April. The Labor Party has clearly articulated its position. Iraq is a matter which must be prosecuted through the UN Security Council. Over the past several months, the government has made vague references in an attempt to link Iraq with the tragedies of 9-11 and the Bali bombing. When called upon to expand on those views, the government has back-pedalled, cited national security or ignored the request altogether. The government has simply failed to make the case for war and failed to make any of those connections. This government is not intent on maintaining peace; this government is intent on stirring up fear and mistrust within our community. The Howard government is clearly wrong in respect of Iraq.</para><para>The United Nations Security Council was dealing with Iraq diplomatically on the basis of the continuation of a policy of containment based on an enhanced weapons inspectorate and continued sanctions against the importation of proscribed military components. If containment is not an option, then it is a matter for the UN Security Council to determine what form of collective action, including military action, is appropriate in achieving the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The government says, however, that it can proceed with a military attack on Iraq in the absence of the Security Council passing a second resolution containing the council's conclusions on whether or not Iraq has exercised its final opportunity to disarm as required by Security Council resolution 1441.</para><para>Labor fundamentally disagree with the government's approach to the UN process. Labor believe that a second Security Council resolution is fundamental to the authorisation of any military action against Iraq. In truth, without a sanction, it lacks moral legitimacy and international support. We do not believe it lies within the discretion of individual states to decide which resolutions should be militarily enforced and which should not. The difference between Labor and the government on this question goes to our disagreement on the importance it places on the processes within the United Nations.</para><para>The government chose to give lip-service to the UN process because, on the issue of Iraq, the government has seen the UN as being politically useful in providing it with the potential international legal cover behind which it has hidden since last September. As of last week, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the Attorney-General began saying explicitly that Australia required no further legal fortification other than the existing Security Council resolution 1441 to proceed with military action against Iraq. In other words, for the government, the path to war is now clear and, for the government, that path appears now to be a unilateral one or at least one with a coalition of what are regarded as the willing. But the coalition is not made up of a huge community of international identities. It includes Portugal, Spain, the United States and Australia. Their actions are not endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The political significance of the last week is that Prime Minister Howard has signalled that he has now dispensed with the United Nations. He clearly states that he believes the UN does not have the capacity to deal with Iraq. Prior to September last year, the Howard government advocated a unilateral solution. It even accused Labor of appeasement for suggesting that the war was a matter for the UN. Subsequent to September last year, in response to domestic opinion poll reactions to its policies, it advocated a UN multilateral solution. In January this year the Howard government predeployed troops to the gulf while still hiding behind the camouflage statement that no final decision on military action had been taken nor had Australia finally signed up as a fully-fledged member of President Bush's coalition of the willing. Mr Howard now appears to be finally and formally telling the Australian people of the decision he privately took nearly nine months ago when in Washington—namely, that Australia would be in this war with or without the United Nations. </para><para>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for our troops. I think they have a difficult enough time without any suggestion that they do not have our support. Clearly, they have our support. War is an option of last resort. However, it does not seem to me that we have arrived at a position without any options. The repercussions of this decision by Australia will reverberate around the region. The position Australia has adopted causes me great concern for peace and security within our region. We are out of step with the international community on this issue. The international community have not joined in this action. As I have said, only four countries have taken the unilateral step and that is not representative of the wider community feeling about this issue. The international position is one of looking for options. The last resort has not been reached.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>9527</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in response to Senator Hill's motion in the Senate today. Within 48 hours Australia will be at war with Iraq— that is, real war. The lives of our 2,000 troops serving in the gulf region will be in peril, along with the lives of other allied forces and millions of Iraqis. One Nation believes that a referendum should have been held for the Australian people prior to deciding whether or not to go to war. Let the people decide, not the executive government. Iraq has not committed any act of war against Australia, the USA or the UK. Under international law the provisions for self-defence are not met. In the last Gulf War, military intelligence reported that Iraq had invaded Kuwait. This time there is no aggression. Iraq has not invaded any country. In the last Gulf War, there were 33 countries acting as a coalition under United Nations authority. This time there will be only three countries involved in direct military combat.</para></talk.start><para>Australia's allies have not delivered convincing evidence against Saddam Hussein's regime and his weapons. Even the report presented to the UN Security Council by Colin Powell was called into question when parts of it turned out to be a 1991 thesis copied from the Internet by a British intelligence agency. Legal opinion is divided on whether there is any UN authority at all for the war. As a member of the International Criminal Court, could Australia's Defence Force personnel be tried at The Hague for war crimes if there are civilian casualties and possibly crimes against humanity? In my speech opposing the International Criminal Court legislation, I pointed out some of the perils which may actually come to pass. Let me add that we fully support, without exception, our brave men and women who have been deployed to the gulf region. Few politicians sitting here today would know what it is like to live inside a chemical or biological protective suit. Very few senators in this place would have spent any real time with our defence forces during their time as senators. To face the enemy on shifting sands and to kill another human being is a big ask. Let our prayers and our hearts be with our forces that have been deployed.</para><para>The war raises implications for Australia as a nation and for geopolitical stability across the globe. The Western alliance is rapidly deteriorating. So far, not a shot has been fired but the casualties are NATO and our Cold War allies France and Germany. Relations are badly strained. The future of the transatlantic alliance is in jeopardy. If the impending war ends with Saddam gone, there will be even greater American pre-eminence, along with greater contempt for multilateral institutional constraints on American power and even less willingness to consider the views of anyone except the few allies who stood with the US before and during the campaign. In other words, the results will be precisely those least desired by America's critics: the UN could go the way of the League of Nations, perhaps even to the point of America withdrawing, and the US, instead of being a mere policeman, would become the global policeman.</para><para>The firing of weapons is the ultimate challenge to national security. If Saddam Hussein had any intention of using biological or chemical weapons then an attack would make him utilise them. There is a lot of animosity towards the United States, Britain and Australia—the coalition of the willing. It would be naive to believe that terrorist groups or foreign armies would not be spurred into launching retaliatory attacks here on our own soil. The United States have planned to mobilise as many as 5,000 FBI agents to guard against terrorist attacks and monitor or arrest suspected militants. They are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. Here in Australia we cannot afford to adopt the `she'll be right' attitude. Biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, as well as other abominations, may be unleashed upon the very soil we stand. Are we prepared to take this risk? </para><para>With most of the Western media now ensconced in relative safety in Jordan, Australians will not see the real war on TV or read about the real war in the newspapers. Anthony Cordesman, from the esteemed Center for Strategic and International Studies, has observed, `This is going to be a really hard reporting job, particularly because most US and UK reporting will be necessarily vague for security and psyops reasons, and there will be a flood of Iraqi and Arab exaggerated claims about how many military survive and how many civilians are killed.' Modern newscasts are edited so that nothing too unpleasant is shown to what are now often paying viewers. The world may see all kinds of footage about success, but there are not going to be many reporters embedded at Iraqi targets, and there may be exaggerated US, British and Australian claims. With all of the advances in technology, there is still no way to instantly measure or verify lethality and civilian casualties and the collateral damage. The real war is hidden from us.</para><para>While discussing the role of the media and this war in Iraq, I would like to comment on an incident which occurred last month. One Nation were the first to call for a referendum on the Iraq issue. We actually asked for that referendum in January, and I reiterated that call in my speech in this place on 4 February. I note that the Greens practically plagiarised a section of my speech and used it on ABC Radio and in various television interviews two weeks later. It makes you wonder what sort of accuracy we can expect from the media in reporting on this war, when they cannot even give credit where it is due.</para><para>There are many factors to consider as the troops take their place. I want to elaborate on some of these, as it seems that the media and the public will only be briefed on this aspect after the war commences. Allied ground troops attacking Baghdad from Kuwait will have to cross the mighty Euphrates and Tigris rivers, the muddy Mesopotamia region between them and a vast latticework of irrigation canals and farm paddies that Iraqi troops can flood at will. Saddam Hussein could blow up three dams around Baghdad and send a wall of water rushing down the southern approaches to the capital city, where he has entrenched his elite troops for a final stand. Anthony Cordesman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has speculated that Saddam could flood southern Iraq by destroying the Lak al Milh dam, south-west of Baghdad, and two others on the Tigris and Euphrates.</para><para>Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and missiles are a wild card, and no-one likes to talk about it. Although the US and Britain think we have weapons that can take out most of their CBW systems and burn them or limit their effects, they know very well they largely failed to successfully hit such targets in the last war, and they underestimate the danger that they are. In the last Gulf War, allied troops were reportedly contaminated by sarin and VX nerve gases when allied bombs fell on Iraqi chemical weapons facilities. In the last Gulf War, coalition forces used depleted uranium radioactive weapons against Iraq's armed forces, particularly their armoured and mechanised units. Contamination as well as long-term incidences of cancers, congenital diseases and foetal deformities have plagued the Iraqi people.</para><para>A combination of factors has affected defence personnel and many now suffer from what is termed `Gulf War syndrome'. One Nation notes with interest that a Gulf War Veterans Health Study, conducted jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Monash University, was due for release last year and that has now been rescheduled, perhaps conveniently, for late March, well after this Gulf War commences. Will depleted uranium weapons be used again in this war? Will the government come clean and tell us of the implications for our men and women in the gulf? </para><para>This war is bigger than Iraq. There are wider implications for the failing world economy, which is now showing signs of regressing. The signs are similar to those that heralded the Great Depression of the 1930s—corporate collapses, company mergers, spiralling household debt, unprecedented margin trading and a speculative property boom. While many analysts believe the world economy may recover if there is a war, just as many see a massive collapse, particularly if oil hits $45 or $50 per barrel. Quite clearly, we are hedging our bets; a war will either provide great economic gain or colossal economic ruin.</para><para>The world community of nations is not with us, but against us. Other countries are not convinced that there are offensive threats, only perhaps deliberate deceptions. Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged—but for the last 12 years he has been contained. It can be argued that this containment should continue and the UN inspectors allowed to do their work and dismantle his weapons of mass destruction. Equally, we could argue that Saddam must be disarmed—at any cost. Let us not forget, though, that the destruction of chemical weapons is a complex and lengthy process which cannot be achieved overnight. By way of example, the chemical weapons convention entered into force in 1997 and nations have until 2007 to eliminate their stockpiles. The convention's implementation is slow, particularly in Russia where financial resources are limited. Destruction sites need to be built and there must be stringent planning to protect the environment and the personnel involved in the destruction process. I would like to add that the US chemical weapons destruction facility at Pine Bluff, Arkansas was built in 1999 and will not complete destruction of US surplus chemical weapons until 2007.</para><para>If we go to war then we will get a reaction that may have long-term consequences. Whatever we do to others, we do unto ourselves. The risks of this war are tyranny, revolution and instability across the Middle East and danger for Australia. The consequences of real war are terrible. Opposition to this war comes not only from political parties and individuals but from veterans' organisations, religious groups, the intelligence community and even from within the ranks of the Defence Force itself. Will the government choose to ignore this opposition at its peril? Why won't the government allow people to have their say? What is the Prime Minister afraid of? In conclusion, there is no right way to do the wrong thing. A war on Iraq is not freedom's finest hour. It could well be the beginning of its own destruction.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FIRST SPEECH</title><type>First Speech</type><page.no>9529</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Before I call Senator Humphries, I remind honourable senators that this is his first speech and, therefore, I ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>9529</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>1</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand here today with a sense of pride, of responsibility and of awe. Doubtless these feelings imbue every senator who enters this place for the first time. Although this is my first or maiden speech, it would strain credulity for me to claim to be a parliamentary maiden. I have served in the legislative assembly of this territory for almost 14 years, years of which I am very proud and which I hope will provide me with a backdrop of experience useful to my time in the Senate. Service at the second tier of Australian government is principally about the delivery of basic services such as health, education and the maintenance of public order to the community. But every state and territory parliamentarian thinks about national issues and the national interest. It is an honour, therefore, to be able to face those national issues on a day-to-day basis in this parliament. And so by the miracle of parliamentary convention my long-lost maidenhood is restored. In preparing my remarks today I went back to the maiden speeches of my two Liberal predecessors, Senator John Knight and Senator Margaret Reid. Senator Knight said in 1976, and I fully adopt these words today:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I want to contribute to national policy and to debates on issues which go beyond my own electorate. However, my first responsibility is and must be to the electors of the Australian Capital Territory and their families. It is to them that I will give my attention first. </para></quote><para>These are illustrious footsteps in which to follow. Senator Knight was of course the first person to represent the people of the ACT in the Senate. In turn, Senator Reid was the territory's longest serving representative and rose to become the first woman to lead the Senate as its President. Indeed the ACT has long been in the habit of placing women in positions of leadership. Only once has the ACT electorate chosen a male chief minister at an election—unfortunately it wasn't me! I am conscious that with my election here I have ended a period in which, uniquely in Australia, half the electors of the territory were represented in the federal parliament exclusively by women.</para><para>It is my privilege to represent in this place a special community. Canberra is the child of Australian nationhood, the city that Federation built. It should and does encapsulate in its layout and institutions the achievements and aspirations of this country. It is a truly beautiful city. It is also—although some who see it only fleetingly do not appreciate this— an immensely livable city. All this, of course, is by design. Sir Thomas Denman, Governor-General in 1913, hoped that Canberra would eventually bear `some resemblance to the city beautiful of our dreams'. I believe that governments, planners, architects and gardeners in the succeeding 90 years have delivered on that goal.</para><para>The ACT has come a long way over the past 20 years or so as we have established our own system of government in the context of the Australian Federation. Many people will still remember the vigorous debates over many years about the ACT assuming responsibility for its own affairs. The inauguration of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT in 1989—with full executive powers—marked a significant point in our evolution. For the first time there was a separation between Commonwealth and ACT government responsibilities. On the whole, the system seems to have worked well, despite misgivings in some sectors of the community. In particular, the financial arrangements for the territory—a matter of considerable concern at the time of the self-government referendum in 1978—appear to be working satisfactorily. What works less satisfactorily is the delineation between the respective roles of the National Capital Authority and the legislative assembly. This has created, on occasions, a disjointed approach to the planning of Canberra—a matter that must be addressed.</para><para>I said earlier that I represent a special community. In saying this I do not mean to suggest that it is an artificial or elite community. In fact, the energies, the talents, the ambitions and the creativity of the people of this city are purely Australian in character, different only from the qualities exhibited by other Australians, perhaps, in the concentration in which they are encountered here. It follows that, if we are proud of Australia, we should be proud of Canberra, the showcase of a young nation. Canberra is the extraordinary achievement of ordinary people.</para><para>The test of these propositions came only very recently when Canberra was ravaged by a natural disaster on a scale not previously thought possible anywhere in urban Australia, much less in the national capital. The bushfire of 18 January and subsequent days was an extraordinary test of the character of this city. By any measure it passed that test, and in doing so gave rise to a new appraisal of the city and its inhabitants by those outside it. As Matt Price writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 20 January put it:</para><quote><para>Canberra is often accused of being a soulless place, too full of transitory types less interested in the local community than the large national institutions that give the compromise capital its bad reputation. The weekend put an end to that lie.</para><para>Practically everyone in Canberra knew someone whose property was lost or seriously under threat. They responded superbly. Stories abounded of suburban heroics; residents remaining in danger areas to tend absent neighbours' homes, endless offers of food, shelter and assistance for traumatised victims.</para><para>Death seemed almost inevitable but when confirmed there was barely time to comprehend this loss of life as fire raged through the night.</para></quote><para>The rest of Australia saw that Canberrans, when cut, did indeed bleed. It also saw that the finest Australian tradition of mateship was honoured in suburban courage and heroism all over the city. The stream of mattresses and blankets to the evacuation centres on that Saturday night was very moving. I heard of one elderly lady who gave away her late model car to a family that had lost theirs, but she was embarrassed by the fact that it had only six months registration on it left to run. </para><para>Of course, if it takes a major event such as a war to define a state, then the bushfire disaster in January could be considered to have been such an event for us. The intensity and speed of the fires themselves, the destruction they caused, the loss of four lives—all these things will leave a mark on the consciousness of this city. The bushfires, like no other event, have seen the people of the ACT draw together in an incredible spirit of community. And so I ask—no, Mr President, I demand— that honourable senators fix in their minds that image of this city, that image of a city afflicted but unbowed, when next they refer to it in far flung corners of this country. I hope that they think and talk of Canberra in the terms this city was conceived—that is, as a place to be proud of, as a repository of the best achievements in the Australian way of life. I take this as my task in this place, to defend that vision of the national capital. I know that it is commonplace for people, especially politicians, to use the term `Canberra' to refer to anything about the federal government that they disdain. But in doing so they can stigmatise and belittle those Australians who live here, many of whom work for the national government but have no more say in its decisions than those who criticise it.</para><para>The generosity of spirit towards this city which I ask for was abundantly evident among those who fought the fires and their aftermath. The emergency services of Canberra—professional and volunteer—were superb in circumstances no amount of training could have prepared them for. Whatever might be said about the causes of this disaster, let nothing detract from this fact: courage and selflessness abounded in Canberra on those terrible January days and, but for that, the destruction wrought in our streets would have been much, much greater.</para><para>Mr President, let me describe the contribution I want to make to the life of this country through membership of the Senate. Change is an immutable feature of our lives. Politics for me is thus an exercise in managing and directing change. If to be a conservative is to resist or defy change, then I am not a conservative. Indeed, the work of this government—work I want to carry forward—has been about managing and directing change in a modern Australia: change in the workplace; change in Australia's international competitiveness; change in access to quality health care; change in our education and welfare systems.</para><para>I am here to argue for the enduring relevance of Liberal values as tools in facing up to the problems of this nation and indeed our world: the values of independence, self-reliance, tolerance, the pursuit of excellence, choice, equality of opportunity and individual freedom. In turn I reject as bankrupt the socialist alternative. That alternative fails to appreciate that people who have no incentive to work and invest will not create wealth. It thinks that collectivism and standardisation in the workplace are a substitute for hard work and innovation. It sees government as a better solver of people's problems than they are themselves.</para><para>I am proud of the achievements of this nation, and I am proud of the role my party has played in shaping the kind of Australia whose citizens could bring forth those achievements. I have no truck with those who elevate Australia's shortcomings above our successes. Although I acknowledge the need to accommodate improvement and change, I refuse to be apologetic about the kind of country we are today.</para><para>I am particularly proud of the role my party has played in the building of Canberra. Almost every major institution and monument gracing this city has been the legacy of a decision of a coalition government. This was underscored when, after years of Labor chest-beating, it was in fact the government of Prime Minister John Howard that actually placed brick upon brick to build the National Museum of Australia. Long after the nitpicking has subsided, that important national symbol will stand testament to his and his government's commitment to Canberra and to preserving our heritage. </para><para>I come to take my place in the Senate with an agenda for what I hope to achieve. My agenda is unashamedly Canberra-centric. It can be summarised as valuing and building up the physical and human assets of this city in the service of a national interest. For example, it would be hard to overstate the importance of the Australian Public Service to the future of this city and, indeed, to the welfare of the Australian community generally. </para><para>The business of our Public Service is nation-building, nothing less. It has undergone many changes in recent years, but I believe its professionalism and worth have never stood at a higher level. A quality bureaucracy will be efficient, innovative, constantly in pursuit of best practice, and apolitical—a test our Public Service meets entirely. We must be prepared to nurture and develop this resource if we are to match the relentlessly growing expectations of Australians for service delivery from government.</para><para>The physical location of component parts of that Public Service is an issue that has long been of concern to Canberrans. Government functions should not be moved around the country for short-term political advantage. On the other hand, in pursuit of an efficient and innovative Public Service, it is difficult to argue against a departmental relocation that enhances the integrity of that department or agency's mission. But, if that test is not satisfied, this senator's voice will be insistent and clear.</para><para>Valuing the Public Service and valuing public servants are one and the same thing. We must never allow the market to put high-quality public servants beyond our reach, at any level. We should also honour those who have served in the Commonwealth bureaucracy. I am aware that the position of Commonwealth superannuants has deteriorated relative to other pension recipients in recent years, and I commit myself to doing something about that problem.</para><para>I have heard it said that, with the advent of the National Museum of Australia, the task of building Canberra is nearing completion. That view is nonsense. The work of creating a national capital like this is the work of many generations. Just as we have ambitions for the growth and development of Australia, so too we should have ambitions for the growth and development of its symbolic centre. That work will never be complete, whilst ever Australians remain a dynamic and forward looking people. National institutions need to be expanded to showcase the inexhaustible creativity and accomplishments of our countrymen, and new institutions, such as an air and space museum or a national centre for the performing arts, deserve consideration amongst our national treasures. The ACT also desperately needs a new convention centre.</para><para>There are other issues. The task of bedding down and taking advantage of Australia's steps towards tax reform a few years ago must not be overlooked. These reforms have the potential to invigorate Australian competitiveness as a range of other taxes disappear in the wake of the GST. We need to take determined strides to end the seemingly perpetual brawling and buck-passing around the long-range health policy of this country. When the Commonwealth and states slug it out on health funding issues, the only sure losers are the sick.</para><para>In education, vigilance over standards needs to be matched with an awareness of the increasing mobility of Australians, and the need therefore to find opportunities for children and adults to carry credit from previous study with them from state to state. And work beckons on a national savings strategy, to counter the fact that 99½ per cent of Australians' weekly income is spent and not saved.</para><para>Our relationship with Indigenous Australians commands our attention. This parliament, built on the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal people, has taken steps in recent years to create a legislative framework for recognising traditional land ownership rights. That process has, it seems to me, a great distance yet to go to shape a relationship of trust and respect with Aboriginal people that is vital to our society's future health.</para><para>Australia's security needs confront us all at present. As a democratic and affluent nation, Australia quite properly has a role to play in defence of the human rights of others elsewhere in this world. I am an internationalist. I reject the notion—suddenly very fashionable among the Australian Left—that human rights outside our region no longer have the compelling merit they once did. </para><para>I also hope to contribute to continuing the important work of this government in facing up to our massive environmental problems, such as growing salinity and greenhouse gas emissions. I know that the record of my party stands proudly on protection of the environment. It was coalition governments that established the first federal environment ministry, declared the Kakadu National Park, the Uluru National Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, enacted legislation to protect the Antarctic, and banned whaling. Perhaps my time here might also contribute in a small way to attacking the decline in trust as a given in so many public relationships. Charles Moore, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator</inline> last year, said this:</para><quote><para>Church, school, army, police, parliament, surgery, court, bank used all to be words that had only to be deployed to put the honest citizen's mind at ease. Now there is the implication that they all represent institutions with their own agendas (a characteristic coinage of modern debate), their own selfish interests, their own dirty secrets.</para></quote><para>He wrote about Britain, but his words could apply equally in this country. On the subject of trust, I put on record today my appreciation to the membership of the Liberal Party in the ACT for choosing, among a very strong field of candidates, to place their trust in me. It is, however, the citizens of Canberra whose trust I need to win. I am conscious that I sit here as an appointed, not an elected, senator. In setting out to win that trust, I will take as my model the energy and dedication to serving this community that my predecessor Margaret Reid exhibited over her years in this place—a magnificent example. I hope that my wife, Cathie, and my sons, Felix and Owain, will not begrudge me the many hours away from home that that commitment will represent.</para><para>I also want to thank sincerely the many friends and supporters who share some of the mission I have outlined today, some of whom are present in the gallery. I wish to thank especially Tim McGhie, who has now assisted in the preparation of all three ACT Liberal senators' maiden speeches over a quarter century. Finally, Mr President, I wish to thank you and honourable senators for allowing me to proceed with this speech today, accompanied by the usual courtesies, despite other important business pressing down on this place. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>9533</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

I am quite sure that, with the experience he has already had in the ACT parliament, we will see many more contributions by Senator Humphries and we certainly look forward to working with him in the future.</para></talk.start><para>In moving to support the motion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, I could not help but reflect on a couple of the contributions already made by senators in this debate. I think particularly of the contribution by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Bartlett. He made what I consider to be one of the worst speeches—one with an extreme point of view and filled with illogicality—that I have ever heard in this place. I could not but notice that one of the things he said was that we should give peace a chance and let the weapons inspectors do their work. The question which Senator Bartlett should really ask is: how long do you give a regime—how many years and how many months—to rid themselves, by peaceful means, of weapons of mass destruction? We are talking about a country which has had more than 12 years to comply with a United Nation's resolution. It was not until the United States put pressure on the Iraqi regime and Saddam Hussein, through putting a military force in the Persian Gulf, that Iraq let weapons inspectors back into Iraq. Since that time, we have seen incremental moves by Iraq—doing as little as possible—to try and satisfy the whims of the United Nations, which over the past 50 or so years has had some successes and some terrible failures. </para><para>It is the United Nations and the role of the Security Council and its member states that I want to discuss briefly now. Like at least two or three other members of this chamber, I had the opportunity to spend almost four months at the United Nations only a couple of years ago. That experience taught me that the United Nations does some things quite well. I can say that, since its inception, the effectiveness of the United Nations in attempting to maintain international peace and security has been challenged by the need to balance two of the key principles underpinning its existence in the international system—that is, how does the United Nations system balance the sovereign equality of nation states with the protection of human rights within those nation states? The challenge of balancing these principles again presented itself to the United Nations on the question of Iraq and how best to respond to its blatant disregard for Security Council resolutions and human rights violations. How the United Nations has responded may have dramatic ramifications for the future of its role in the international system.</para><para>I said that the United Nations has a history of doing some things very well. I can tell you from my time there that there are some things which it does very well. It is very good in the area of world health and getting countries to cooperate in delivering better health conditions, particularly for some of the Third World countries. We have seen its role in the eradication of polio, smallpox and a whole range of other deadly diseases which have afflicted this world over a period of time. The United Nations has been very good at that. The United Nations has been very good at helping emerging democracies, where there has been no democracy for years, and teaching those countries how to develop a democracy and set up democratic institutions. The United Nations is very good in some areas of education. For example, in many countries it has helped in the education of young people and the education of those previously deprived of that opportunity. But, historically, the United Nations has failed abysmally when situations have arisen that fundamentally question the legitimacy of regimes that continually perpetrate human rights violations against their own people. That is where the United Nations has failed abysmally, and it has failed abysmally for years.</para><para>In 1992, Bosnian Serbs in the former Yugoslavia began a murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing against Muslims and Croats. The United Nations took over eight months to send a deployment of troops, and by this time Bosnian Serb forces had taken over 70 per cent of Bosnia's territory and delivered enormous suffering and human casualties. That sort of delay by the United Nations has caused human rights violations and casualties to occur and the United Nations has a lot to answer for as a result. Furthermor, there was a distinct lack of United Nations action in the Kosovo crisis of the late 1990s. To all of those people who demand that there should not be any military involvement in Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations—or without a further 18th resolution to make sure that the United Nations is totally in support of what might happen—I say: where were you in the mid-1990s when the United States and NATO decided that they would go into Kosovo without United Nation sanction to free those people who were being so terribly treated in Kosovo at that time?</para><para>The opposition was noticeably silent on the need for a United Nations resolution in that case. Perhaps opposition speakers to follow can include in their contributions to this debate some of the reasons why it is so necessary today to have a United Nations resolution or an 18th resolution passed by the Security Council when, in Kosovo, there was no need for any resolution at all and they supported what took place at that time. Terrible human rights violations were being perpetrated in Kosovo through ethnic cleansing. What is the difference between the situation there and the situation in Iraq today, where we know the sorts of human rights violations that are being perpetrated against the people of Iraq? </para><para>It was the threat of a veto by China and Russia that prevented a Security Council resolution on military action in Kosovo, despite growing humanitarian concerns in the wake of systematic ethnic cleansing. It was the threat of a veto by France in this instance, in exactly the same way that China and Russia threatened to use that veto in the late 1990s when action was taken in Kosovo, that has caused action to be taken without a special Security Council resolution. What is the difference between the situation then and the situation now? I will be interested to hear what members of the opposition and the Democrats have to say about the situation then and the necessity right now, in this situation, for there to be an 18th Security Council resolution. The role of stabilising the situation then was left to NATO, under the leadership of the United States and with strong support from the United Kingdom. Exactly the same two countries have shown strong leadership in this situation in the face of the threat of a veto in the Security Council. From 29 March to 9 June 1999, in the absence of a United Nations mandate, NATO took military action against Serbia to stop the persecution of civilians. NATO was successful and Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic agreed to NATO demands.</para><para>A similar pattern has presented itself in Iraq. Saddam Hussein has a proven record of terror, just like the terror that was being inflicted on the people of Kosovo and on Bosnian Serbs earlier in that decade. Many blatant acts of brutality against civilians and the neighbours of Iraq have occurred systematically since Saddam Hussein's rise to power in Iraq. There are still over 600 cases, representing 14 nationalities, of missing gulf prisoners of war or people missing in action and only four of those cases have been resolved. According to the United Nations, Iraq remains the country with the highest number of disappearances in the world. Yet we hear senators opposite and Democrats senators saying, `Let the weapons inspectors have more time.' In fact, they have had 12 or 13 years. Let us not forget that, during the Iraqi government's so-called Anfal campaign against the Kurdish people in northern Iraq, an estimated 100,000 Kurds died or disappeared. That is a statistic that we should never be allowed to forget.</para><para>Saddam Hussein became the first leader in the post Second World War era to systematically and aggressively gas his own people. This is the sort of person that the Labor Party and the Democrats want to give more time to. Should he be given more time to systematically gas or inflict human rights abuses upon more of his own people? Thousands of people have been executed. Torture has been extensively documented, through techniques that have been described in detail on many other occasions. The United Nations should not have sat back and waited as Saddam Hussein continued to persecute his own people and to threaten both his neighbours and the stability of the international system with his continued pursuit of a weapons of mass destruction capability. If the United Nations cannot reach agreement and simply sits back and does nothing, should we as international citizens sit back and watch those Iraqi people suffering? We have international responsibilities. I am delighted that the Prime Minister and the government have today decided to exercise those international responsibilities.</para><para>Can I say to those people who march in the streets for peace that peace is something we all want. There is not one person in this chamber who would not prefer peace as an option. Those who oppose any unilateral role outside of a United Nations mandate did not mind the role outside of a mandate when it occurred in Bosnia or in Kosovo. It is only in Iraq where they consider a mandate is required. There are those who are worrying about the possibility of civilian casualties. Where were those people when the UN failed to respond to the massacre of millions of men, women and children under the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia or to the many other human tragedies—such as that in Rwanda or, currently, in the Sudan—in our recent history? None of those countries possessed weapons of mass destruction. We know that in fact Iraq does possess those weapons.</para><para>The Labor opposition seem to want to have their cake and eat it too. They do not deny that there are weapons of mass destruction. They agree that weapons of mass destruction must be gotten rid of. If the United Nations Security Council had voted to get rid of those weapons, they would have been quite happy to support military action against Iraq. On the Security Council, some of the African countries like Cameroon and others were to make the decision as to whether or not there should be a majority. </para><para>The strange thing is that, if those weapons of mass destruction still exist, if they are still in Iraq, and even if the opposition think they should be got rid of, they say, `It is okay if the United Nations says you can get rid of them, but if the United Nations doesn't give you a specific mandate in the 18th resolution of the Security Council regarding Iraq then it is quite okay for Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime to keep them. In the absence of a specific United Nations mandate, it is okay for Saddam Hussein to keep those weapons.' That is a logic that I and many others in Australia simply cannot follow. If weapons of mass destruction are wrong, they are wrong with or without another mandate from the United Nations for military action to get rid of those weapons.</para><para>I join my colleagues in wishing those serving in our defence forces well. They serve our country with pride in a faraway country with families at home who no doubt worry. It is easy to understand how the families of servicemen can be deeply affected by deployments overseas, as has been the case with other overseas deployments. I would cite East Timor, Bougainville and all the other more recent activities in which we have taken part, where our defence forces served with pride their government and their country overseas. I certainly wish them well and hope that any conflict will be short.</para><para>I also express my admiration for the strength of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I did not think I would ever see the day that I would stand up in this place and speak with admiration of a Labour Prime Minister. He has served his country so well and has shown such strength of character—a strength of character which, I am sorry to say, we have not seen in the current Leader of the Opposition in Australia, nor in the contribution made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Tony Blair, in the face of all the information that has been provided to him, has chosen the path that he believes is right for his country, even though he knows there is opposition within his own party and within his own country.</para><para>It is a fact that nobody other than those in executive control of a government can be fully informed of all the facts that are available. Many times we have heard people in Australia say, `Just give us some more information. Tell us what you know, and then maybe we'll support you.' It is in fact impossible for the executive arm of any government to release to the public every piece of information they have. Much of it is intelligence. Here, much of it is garnered from our intelligence organisations and from intelligence organisations overseas. Much of the information that is given to us by other intelligence organisations cannot be given to the Australian public. It is only given to us on the understanding that it remains intelligence information for the government of the day, the executive or the other intelligence organisations within Australia. If you told the Australian public or anybody else all your intelligence, you simply would not get intelligence anymore.</para><para>There is a limit to what the Australian public and the public anywhere in the world can be told. Members of the Labor Party who were members of the government back in 1991, the last time there was a war in the gulf, would know that there are certain pieces of information that simply cannot be provided to the public. The executive must make that decision, and they will be judged on that decision by the people of Australia at some stage in the future. We know that, and I think it was a very bold decision of the Prime Minister to accept responsibility knowing that his actions will be judged at some stage in the future by the Australian people because, fortunately, unlike Iraq, we live in a democracy where the people of the country can choose their leader—something that is denied to the people of Iraq.</para><para>My final point is that strategic alliances are very important to Australia and to Australia's future. We on the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are in the middle of an inquiry into maritime strategies. One of the questions people often ask is, `Should we be self-reliant?' or, `Is it feasible to look at self-reliance as a strategic objective in this current day and age?' My personal view is that it is not feasible. A country our size cannot be self-reliant. We need strategic alliances. The United States has been our longest and strongest ally for a number of years. It is not just now that we need this strategic alliance with the United States, the world's only superpower; we also need a strategic alliance that will provide safety and security for the future. I am quite sure that anybody who has been involved in the decision making that has gone on in the last month or two knows how important that strategic alliance with the United States is for our future and for the safety of our children and, as time goes by, their children. </para><para>I fully support the motion moved today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. We are not looking forward to the events of the coming days, but we do hope that the events that we are now committed to can be concluded quickly, with a minimum of casualties both in the civilian population and in the defence forces. We hope that at the end of the day a tyrant who has been in power for years, committing human rights violations on a scale not unprecedented but certainly as large as those we have seen in other countries in recent times, will no longer be there—and neither will his weapons of mass destruction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>9537</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—History, I believe, will remember today as the day Australia betrayed any sense of independence and signed up to starting a war which was not in this nation's national interest.

Put aside all that rhetoric we have heard from government senators and from the Prime Minister. Put aside the words `strategy' and `alliance' and every other like word and just think about what we are actually doing today. We are committing Australian lives to war. We are jeopardising lives from around the world, but the decision we are taking today is to commit Australian forces to a conflict from which many of them will not return. It is so much easier to commit other people's lives when we camouflage it all in strategies, alliances and such rhetoric. But I ask the Senate to stop for a moment and think of some of the footage that we have seen in recent weeks of soldiers and their young kids and families, of the photographs we have seen in the press of people who are just barely 20 or so, whom we are committing to a conflict far away from here in the knowledge that a lot of them will not come back. Just think of the human cost.</para><para>When we went into Vietnam it was just a small number of special advisers. Thousands of Australians lost their lives there. I wish this government showed a lot more humanity and sensitivity. Sadly, we can reasonably predict that there will be Australian casualties. We can reasonably predict that this Prime Minister will have blood on his hands out of this conflict. And we should not forget his shameful dereliction of the responsibilities of national leadership which demand of him, which demand of any prime minister and which demand of any minister representing the Australian people that they put the interests of the Australian people before the interests of the great superpower, the United States of America in this case, not vice versa as they have done in this instance.</para><para>This debate is a grave and serious one. But I sadly reflect on the potential human cost of not only Australians but other allied forces, and not only allied forces but the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis—men, women and children—who will suffer and who may lose their lives. When Senator Ferguson says that under our system of democracy the Prime Minister will face his judgment, sadly a lot of those people whom we are committing today will not be here to pass judgment on this Prime Minister. As I say, it is so much easier when we are sacrificing other people's lives and not those of our families. I wish this Prime Minister took seriously the job of representing these people when they feel and they say very loudly that it is not in this nation's national interest to start a war in another part of world when we have so many other priorities in our national interest closer to home. </para><para>In speaking in this debate, I draw some background knowledge from my membership of the Hawke government's first Gulf War war cabinet committee. That experience has led me, like many of my colleagues, to more accurately appreciate the real challenges involved in the current ambitious US plans. I also come to this debate as someone who is not opposed to the US alliance. I believe it still has relevance and importance to Australia. However, I do not believe that this alliance demands that Australia cede national sovereignty and decision making to a group of extreme right-wing Republican politicians who, for the moment, control the White House.</para><para>Australians and Americans share many values and experiences. In this current crisis war is supported and opposed by many people in both countries. In fact, much of the most powerful antiwar material is at present being generated in the USA. Under alliance treaties, Australia has a legal right to say no to US demands. In this instance, I believe we also have a moral right to say no, as we have in the past and as an Australian Labor government did in respect of the conflict in Vietnam.</para><para>It is clear that this Prime Minister does not have the courage to stand up and tell G.W. Bush what the Australian people are thinking and think is in this country's national interest. Not only does he not have the courage to front President Bush but we are in the unfortunate situation where our Prime Minister does not even have the courage to front the Australian people. While he sends our soldiers off to Iraq to fight his war, he cannot even summon the courage to go to the suburbs of Australia—Leichhardt, Thebarton, Balwyn and Lower Templestowe, for instance—to argue and fight for his decisions. He does it from the comfort of a TV or radio studio. He is not prepared to go out and meet the people. This is a Prime Minister who is so charged with ego that he struts around the world thinking he is Winston Churchill, when the truth is anyone who sees him believes he is Captain Mainwaring.</para><para>This is a difficult situation, and this is a war that did not have to start. The UN process was achieving an enormous amount—a lot more than I am sure the American administration thought it would achieve when they embarked down the road of the UN. There is enormous opposition to this war. For me, one of the main reasons that public opinion worldwide is so solidly against the war is that people are deeply concerned at the competence and motives of those who lead us into it. People worldwide are concerned that the US administration behaves as if it were reliving a Ronald Reagan B-grade movie. They see all too transparently the exercise of might over right by what is increasingly coming to look like a group of latter-day Texan oil claimjumpers.</para><para>Despite the comprehensive and consistent efforts of the world's media, people are seeing right through the US administration and they are expressing their fears. The war, we are told once more, is about to happen, and it is happening without real debate and understanding of the consequences and impacts. What debate, for instance, have we had in this country? What discussion have we had? What understanding is there of the regional and global consequences of what the USA proposes? What are the implications for global stability of the numbers of victims and refugees? What do we really expect the invasion to achieve? How long will it take? What are we really seeking to establish by so-called regime change? What are the implications for the international rule of law and the status of the United Nations? Importantly for Australia and Australians, what are the implications for our national security? All these questions remain unanswered. They should have been critical issues in a genuine debate before it reached the point that we have reached today, but they have only been given cursory attention.</para><para>The Prime Minister, John Howard, is not leading this country into war with any sense of dignity and honesty; he is misleading this nation into war. We are being misled, as we have been asked to believe over the last few months the fiction that this government had not made a decision to commit—it had not made a decision, so a decision was not up to scrutiny. Further, we were told just a few weeks ago that the PM, when he went overseas on a peace mission, was advocating peace when all he was doing was advocating a war. </para><para>This nation is being misled because the Prime Minister wants to go to war outside the rule of international law as embodied in the UN Charter. I believe we are being misled because the case for war has not been made. We are told an invasion into Iraq is an important step in the war against terror. Yet short of a plagiarised and inadequate UK government document, no case has been led to prove the link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Instead of evidence, the world has been subjected to a two-pronged campaign from the USA—a campaign that spied on states that were not part of the coalition of the willing, a campaign that sought to buy votes. It was a campaign of spy and buy, and the campaign did not work because such a campaign was not a good enough substitute for the real evidence that was needed.</para><para>We are being misled into war because the judgment to go to war is, I believe, fundamentally flawed. For instance, in 1996 former President Bush, the current President's father, said:</para><quote><para>To occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab world against us, and make a broken tyrant into a latter-day Arab hero.</para></quote><para>Around the same time, Dick Cheney, who is now the Vice-President, said:</para><quote><para>To have brought the Gulf war into the populous Iraqi capital of Baghdad ... would have put large numbers of Iraqi civilians and hundreds of thousands of our troops at risk of being killed.</para></quote><para>That is a reflection on the earlier Gulf War— one that is quite pertinent when we assess the judgment that our leaders have taken in respect of this one. Cheney also added that if the US were to engage in another war with Iraq and try to remove Saddam Hussein from power, the international coalition `would come apart'. We are now doing what both Bush Sr and Cheney warned against—and we are on the verge of paying the price that they predicted. We are being misled because not only Australia but indeed the whole world has for a long time not been told the real purpose of this invasion. What was the end game to be? What is the end game to be now? Was it the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction? Is it to be regime change, or is it, as many right-wing US think tanks demand, cultural dominance of the region? In this context Australians have been asked to give President Bush and Co. a blank cheque on this central issue.</para><para>Increasingly, more and more Australians think that we are being misled because they are concerned that the Howard government's commitment and rhetoric are not in our national interest. Australians can see that their government is making them and this nation a target. Howard, by his misguided leadership, is inviting and inciting action against Australia and Australians both at home and abroad. Australians can see, for instance, that of all the countries which form part of the coalition of the willing we alone are surrounded by countries with large Muslim communities, each with their own domestic challenges to contain extremism. Our action does not assist them in their efforts—we make it harder for them. In this context, Australians see the potential dangers from North Korea as being a priority over a war in another region—and they are asking why this government, their government, cannot see the obvious.</para><para>I believe we are being misled because Australia, under John Howard, has picked this fight. We were presented with two options: the UN and its rule book—the course that I and the Labor Party favour—or the unilateralism offered by the US. We chose to reject the international rule book and the protection it offers. Saddam Hussein does present a real problem. He needs to be addressed and the problem needs to be addressed, but the issue has always been: how do you do this most effectively? How do you contain Hussein without giving oxygen to terrorists and terrorism world wide? For me, the UN is the only option. It is empowered to do so; it is on the way to doing so. Blix is achieving results, and his process should have been given the extra time needed. But John Howard and this government have never really given Blix a chance. The Prime Minister has chosen to protect the international rule book by scrapping it, and I do not think that is a legitimate approach. </para><para>It is going to be extremely hard to predict, and anything may eventuate from the invasion, but as we embark upon the last stages of this process I think we should consider some of the direct consequences and implications of US led action outside UN authorisation. Firstly, we do turn on the taps of oxygen to potential terrorists world wide, particularly in the Middle East and in our region. Lord Hurd, the former Conservative foreign minister, recently asked, `Do we help or do we hinder the war against terrorism by invading Iraq?' He further asked:</para><quote><para>Would we thus turn the Middle East into a set of friendly democratic capitalist societies ready to make peace with Israel, or into a region of sullen humiliation, a fertile and almost inexhaustible recruiting ground for further terrorists for whom Britain is a main target?</para></quote><para>In other words, what Lord Hurd was saying was: even if we win, do we lose? And in so doing, do we destabilise moderate Arab regimes, further undermine the security of Israel and breed more terrorists for the world to handle? Particularly for Australia, do we ignite the embers of terrorism in our region and make ourselves a target? In Iraq itself, how do we handle a potential Kurdish state in conflict with Turkey—a continuing conflict which still has not, in the preparation for war, been accommodated in any sense at all? How do we handle the Shia entity in the south, united with Iran? Indeed, what will happen to leaderships in the region—such as those in Turkey, Iran and elsewhere—in the aftermath of these events?</para><para>Unfortunately, you do not find these questions addressed in our media—a media which wants us all to believe that we are about to embark upon a high-tech, quick and victimless war. It is almost like a computer game. It is the same media who told us some 10 months ago that the US would get an all-empowering resolution through the Security Council in a matter of days and that the war would be over by the end of September. As I said earlier, my position is that the UN, the body which has been empowered with the authority in these matters for over 50 years, should be trusted in respect of what further action is necessary. And it looks like it will not be.</para><para>I would like to address a couple of other issues that I believe will have some longer term consequences. Whatever happens over the next few weeks, there is probably one relationship which needs close attention— and that is the one between the USA and Europe. Tension between these two entities is not new. Under the Bush administration, there have been deep divisions over a number of issues such as privacy, Kyoto and regulation of the tobacco industry—just to name a few. Iraq comes on top of these issues and could very well lead to a lasting disconnection between former NATO allied countries.</para><para>European leaders can see that this US administration has failed the test of leadership. They have seen Bush's proposal being frozen by the world community for some 10 months in the Security Council. They have seen Prime Minister Blair do the President's bidding when the President was not up to it. They have felt the sting of personal abuse from the US administration and its media outlets and they can see a potential for themselves to take a more critical role in world leadership. I am not saying that this is a definite turning point, a return to bi-polarity in world affairs, but at least for the moment G.W. Bush has done what 50 to 60 years of Soviet leadership could not—and that is to put distance between important European nations and the USA.</para><para>Whatever happens, there will also be one lasting issue of concern for Australia. We are still defining our role within the region. We had a blemished history with our White Australia Policy. We were working to overcome that. Now we are developing an identity as the deputy sheriff of the USA. In this context, being one of a handful of countries prepared to go it alone against Saddam Hussein threatens our national security. I think we can fairly predict that Australia and Australians will be at greater risk at home and abroad, given the presence of terrorist cells so close to our shores. In the next few weeks, therefore, there will probably be a change in international politics in a manner which was not anticipated by the Republican White House when it embarked on this high-risk strategy. There will be bruised egos and bruised national prides, although it is hard to identify where they will be. To repeat the words of former Minister Hurd, there will be at least one `region of sullen humiliation'. It is hard for us to predict which of a number it will be—USA, Europe, the Middle East, Asia. Whatever one it is, it is going to have enormous repercussions for this country. </para><para>In closing, I repeat the point I made at the start: my real feeling and sentiment and priority on a day like today is for the people and families who will be affected by this particular conflict. In a sense, we are far removed from it and we can—although we should not—look at it in a dispassionate way, as has been reflected I believe by some of the government speeches this afternoon. The fact is that we are sacrificing the lives of Australian soldiers and their families in this conflict—a conflict which, to be honest, is not our fight. It is not one that we planned. It is one that we have been dragged along to because this Prime Minister initially thought that there would be domestic advantage out of it but who probably now thinks he has to follow the President of the United States whoever that President is—particularly this one, a President who strokes his ego from time to time and has done so over the last couple of years. It is the wrong reason to go to war. It is a decision that should not have been taken. It is a decision that the Australian people do not support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>9541</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a speech that I certainly did not want to be standing here today giving.

Indeed, the latest opinion polls tell us that some 71 per cent of Australians are opposed to our involvement in this war.</para></talk.start><para>To start at the beginning of the motion, at paragraph (a), yes, we should certainly condemn Iraq's initial refusal to abide by the resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council. But ultimately the question of whether or not it has complied is an issue for the United Nations and not for the United States. When did America appoint itself the head of the world's police force when there was no conflict? There is no actual conflict; there is only a potential for a conflict. Why are we, Australia, joining now in the posse? Apart from the fact that this war is not even America's call, where has the US been on the 32 occasions when Israel has refused to abide by UN resolutions? Or Pakistan? Or India? Or the Palestinians? The list goes on—all of those countries refusing to abide by UN resolutions. Why is this government so willing to follow the lead of a country whose argument is so illogical and riddled with inconsistencies, self-interest and hypocrisy?</para><para>Article 42 of the UN Charter sets out that it is the Security Council that is delegated to authorise military action. Without a second resolution, an act of aggression against Iraq could well be illegal. New precedents for dispute resolution in the years ahead are being set by what we are now agreeing to, by what we are now being a part of. The reason the US would not put another resolution before the UN is that it would most certainly fail. The United Nations is far from unanimous that Iraq is a major threat. Basically, the US decided that it would go for cover, that it would twist around previous resolutions and try to justify what it is doing on that basis.</para><para>Moving to paragraph (b) of the motion, by their own admission and in their very detailed reports the UN weapons inspectors have found very few weapons and those that they have discovered Iraq has been progressively destroying. Some have already been destroyed; others were in the process of being destroyed at the time America decided that it would not wait any longer. America basically has built its argument on a sea of sifting sands. The reasons change almost daily. It did start arguing that Iraq had to disarm and if Iraq refused to let the weapons inspectors in then that was a case for war. The weapons inspectors went in and Iraq started to disarm, albeit slowly. Iraq was complying with UN resolutions, allowing the weapons inspectors access and then starting the destruction of those 70 al-Samoud II missiles and, I understand, some 42 warheads so far. Ploy or not, Iraq invited the UN inspectors back to discuss new evidence of accelerated disarmament. But now the US has shifted the goalposts: not only now does it want Saddam Hussein out as a necessary condition to prevent war but also today it has decided that his sons are added to the list and they too must leave the country in order to avoid war. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Such good boys!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran, I will take that interjection.

To address the interjection through the chair, which I will cover further and later in my speech, I am not suggesting one way or the other the likelihood that Saddam Hussein and his sons are of a benefit to the country; I am simply arguing strongly that the US should not keep changing the goalposts and keep raising the bar as to what Iraq needs to do in order to prevent war. The US is obviously determined to go to war regardless of what Iraq does.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us look at what some others who know what is happening in Iraq have said. A former UK cabinet minister, Robin Cook, has said that following the first Gulf War, as a result of all the destruction and devastation of the country and as a result of the sanctions that were imposed after that, Iraq has largely been crippled, economically and militarily and that it is not therefore a serious, immediate threat either to the region or to world peace. All the evidence suggests that the international pressure has largely contained Saddam Hussein and his sons. If Iraq is such a threat to the security of the world and if it really does have these weapons and is intent on using them, then why is America letting us know, step by step, everything it is planning to do? Successful military action has in the past relied on secrecy, stealth and surprise. None of these have been put into play this time. The military plans of the US and its few allies have been well telegraphed in advance. Why? Because there really is no substantial threat.</para><para>Paragraph (b) of the motion mentions potential damage to Australia's security. How will it be damaged? Perhaps future speakers would like to pick up on this issue. How is Iraq a danger to us? I would suggest that, in fact, it is the war that is likely to damage our security. Australia's unwarranted participation in this war is likely to anger our neighbours, and while, as Senator Hill mentioned, some presidents have expressed their belief that they are not in any way opposed to Australia and, indeed, want to remain friends, much of their populations feel otherwise. It will give terrorists in this region yet another reason to pursue their campaigns. Obviously, we must continue to fight terrorism. But the deliberate terrorising of an entire nation is hardly a sensible strategy. There is no logic in the argument that, by launching a war against Iraq, global terrorism will be reduced. In fact, it is highly likely that by attacking Iraq and generating antagonism and anger, particularly towards the US and its allies, across the Muslim world the risk to us will actually increase.</para><para>The UN, the organisation trusted by the world for the past 50 years to work for peace, has clearly set out two scenarios in which war might be justified. The first is in self-defence and the second is for humanitarian reasons. America can hardly argue self-defence in the case of Iraq while it also confidently claims that this war is going to be over in a couple of weeks—at an absolute maximum, 90 days, according to today's press. Given that Iraq is such a huge threat, it seems that the war is going to be very short! How can America argue on one hand that Iraq is so ill-prepared but, on the other hand, that it may have these weapons that pose such a terrible risk that we therefore have to go to war against it? It simply does not make sense. </para><para>Paragraph (c) of the motion mentions Iraq's continued support for international terrorism. There is no link between Iraq and either the events of September 11 a couple of years ago or last year's Bali atrocities. A number of other countries have been linked to these events, but so far Iraq has not. Paragraph (c) also refers to the abuse of the Iraqi people. Yes, Saddam is a tyrant. He has little regard for anyone who opposes him or, indeed, anyone who hints they may be capable of opposing him. Saddam Hussein is a cruel and ruthless leader; we are not debating that. But arguably he is no worse than many other dictators around the world, and I give Zimbabwe as just one example. And what are we doing there? We are off to play cricket.</para><para>Australia is about to take part in a war with a country where half the population is under the age of 16 and where international sanctions over the last 12 years have taken a devastating toll. Malnutrition is widespread. Cholera, hepatitis and typhoid are common, malaria and dysentery are rampant and 4,000 children die every month from starvation and preventable diseases. Paying attention to the sanctions is one way of dealing with some of these issues, and that is certainly a road we should be taking before we consider bombing this country.</para><para>This morning, the Prime Minister said that this war is not in Australia's interests but is necessary for humanitarian reasons. Someone needs to explain to me how bombing a country with so many children, deliberately trying to destroy roads, infrastructure, bridges, communication facilities and electricity-generating facilities, cutting off millions of people's access to food sources and, very likely, creating a cholera epidemic thanks to the backup of raw sewage in the streets can be necessary for humanitarian purposes. The UN estimates that direct civilian casualties of the war will be up to half a million people, of which between 10 and 50 per cent will be deaths. How can such carnage and destruction be justified on humanitarian grounds?</para><para>With regard to paragraph (f) of the motion, we must continue to fully support the service men and women who are to be a part of this conflict. We hope and pray that the Australians who are there will come home safe and well. I am questioning the need to send them to fight in the first place; I will never support that. I hope our troops, when they return, will not meet the negative response that troops coming back from Vietnam met, and I hope that everyone in this place works for that end. I hope that they will be fully supported through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, that their health needs will be met and, if necessary, that their other needs, such as for retraining, will be adequately met. What we have seen in the past, from this government and previous governments, has been little more than penny pinching. The troops are running huge risks over there, particularly if they do end up actively involved in this conflict. The impact of the previous war is still there in southern Iraq. Following the first Gulf War, large areas of Iraq remain contaminated as a result of the use of depleted uranium weaponry. For those people who have gone back and resettled those areas, that has resulted in huge increases in the rates of a number of cancers and also a very significant increase in birth defects. We must all understand that these troops are running enormous risks, and we must be prepared to fully support them on their return.</para><para>I find paragraphs (g) and (h) of this motion particularly difficult. To suggest that we extend our sympathy to people while we bomb the hell out of them—to say that we should have sympathy because it is us who are going to be part of this destruction—I find quite extraordinary. Talking about committing to help them afterwards, obviously they will need an enormous amount of help. But wouldn't it be far better, rather than undoing the damage, if we did not cause it in the first place? It is clear that what the US really wants is regime change in Iraq, and there are a whole lot of other reasons they are giving us for going to war. But regime change is not a justifiable excuse—certainly not if we are still trying to abide by United Nations standards.</para><para>Australia should not be a part of this. Indeed today is going to be another of those dates on Australia's calendar. The date 18 March 2003 will go down in history as the day Australia stepped well outside the UN processes when we went to war against a nation that is not an actual threat simply because we wanted to be with the United States and go to war against a potential threat, a possible threat, well aware—and this motion proves it—of the damage that we are going to do to the Iraqi people. </para><para>I will conclude by looking at the Labor Party's amendment. It effectively guts this motion and replaces it with something I would much prefer to support and will be supporting. But I would like to go further. The US has used a long list of tactics to try and get other countries onside. It has tried bribery, it has tried cajoling and it has tried threats. Still it does not have enough support to be confident about putting a second motion before the United Nations. It has threatened to remove aid, it has promised to give aid, it has talked about trade—it has used all sorts of carrots and sticks to get people to line up behind it, and they still have not.</para><para>Even if the US had been successful in this campaign, I still could not have supported the motion. Basically, the US have polluted international relations by using these tactics to get people onside. But all the bribes and threats have not done it and Australia should not have fallen for it. Given the strength of the world's opposition, we should now be calling our troops home. That really would have shown strength on the part of our Prime Minister, because that was the most difficult decision. The US have been scratching around, like chooks in a chookyard, looking for an excuse for month after month after month. They have failed to get a decent excuse, but we are off to war with them anyway. I stand here today saying that I could never support what this government is doing in sending our troops into this war against Iraq.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>9544</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to support Senator Hill's motion in support of Australia's commitment to assist the coalition of the willing to remove Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. What is our aim? Our aim is to disarm Iraq. Why are we doing it? Because it is correct, it is in the best interests of Australia, it is in the best interests of the international community and because the UN is not prepared to act. No-one wants this war, but no-one can continue to tolerate the price of inaction. The future of collective responsibility for international conflict resolution is very uncertain. Why is it uncertain? Substantially, it is because of French opportunism.</para></talk.start><para>I was interested in Senator Ferguson's contribution for a number of reasons, but particularly because of his comments about what the UN does well and what it does not do well. I was interested in his comments about Kosovo and East Timor, both of which were given very belated UN support. But, in this problem, we have had 12 years since Saddam Hussein agreed to disarm at the end of the Gulf War, 17 months since September 11 and six months since President Bush went to the UN and insisted that the UN make Saddam Hussein comply with existing UN resolutions. We have also had five months since resolution 1441 which called on Saddam Hussein to disarm in line with original resolution 678 and subsequent resolution 687 after the completion of the Gulf War.</para><para>This is not a game. Disarmament is not a `catch me if you can' situation. Saddam Hussein has systematically cheated and retreated—that is the best way of looking at it—over the last 12 years, playing this game where he thinks he can get away with his approach and hide his weapons of mass destruction from an apparently divided world. Disarmament is not about process, it is about substance. Clearly, Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. The evidence suggests that he needs to answer questions on what he has done with the 6,500 chemical munitions with potential contents of 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent; 8,500 litres of anthrax; 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media, which could be used to make up to 5,000 litres of anthrax; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical agent; 1.5 tonnes of VX and 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals. Saddam Hussein admits in the last few days that he has had these weapons. We would like to know what he has done with them. I suggest that he probably still has most of them. </para><para>He has used these weapons on his enemies, both internal and external. He has used them on the Kurds, on the Marsh Arabs and against his external enemies, namely, the Iranians. The time for talking is over. The containment imposed by the US, virtually alone, is not a long-term option. It is not the option that was so successful during the Cold War, between the former Soviet Union and the US, where mutually assured destruction meant that both countries virtually contained each other. This is not one of those situations. For the US, with Iraq it is not a long-term option. The time for moral pressure is over, but perhaps if we had had some moral support from France it might have worked. The time to act has arrived, and even now at the eleventh hour, the US has given Saddam Hussein a 48 hour-option to leave and comply with the requirements of his disarmament undertakings. </para><para>This is a very tough call for the government. Tough calls are easy to avoid—you just do not make them. But I support John Howard and the government because it is right and courageous and, most importantly—it needs to be put on the record again and again—so does the whole coalition. If you could sum up the mood within the government it would be as both sombre and resolute. None of us are warmongers and none of us have a gratuitous view about our right to take this action in support of the United States and the British—it is because we believe it is right. I want to reassure the Australian people, including a number of people who might wonder about our decision and have legitimate differences of opinion with us, that their government is dedicated and has resolved to make this decision in support of the United States and Britain to disarm Iraq and remove the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq's arsenal.</para><para>Judgments will be passed on us at a future time and we do not shy from that. We do not shy from people having an alternative view to the government's. Why do you think we have this unity of purpose? It is because we are doing what is both morally and legally correct. It is because over 12 years of diplomacy Saddam Hussein has ignored the 17 resolutions requiring him to disarm and destroy his acknowledged cache of weapons of mass destruction. This is a challenge for all of us, especially the United States, which has shown great leadership in this new phenomenon of dealing with rogue states who have weapons of mass destruction. The second challenge is dealing with those terrorist organisations and other people or states which pose an asymmetrical threat and may wish to use those weapons and who would be quite capable if they had them of using them totally indiscriminately against nations of the West, particularly against nations like Australia. These people dislike intensely the United States and the West generally. They are arbitrary in their violence and unfortunately must be confronted. Bullies and terrorists are in the same boat. Appeasement just does not work; it has not worked and it will not work.</para><para>What is the legal advice for our support for the United States in this compliance action? Firstly, the government is acting on the best advice it has available to it, and this comes from the best range of international lawyers available. I am not quite sure whether the Prime Minister has released that advice but he intends to. The United States and the United Kingdom, I understand, will also release their legal advice. We have other supporters, including some who might come from the other side, such as the former leading ALP apparatchik, Michael Costello, who is quoted in the media as saying that Australia has the legal grounds to act.</para><para>But we also believe that, pursuant to existing Security Council resolutions and treaty obligations, our legal position is secure. When I was a student at law school a long time ago I took a pretty jaundiced view of international law, mainly because, in my simple view, the rule of law and the exercise of the rule of law is about laws being enforced and unfortunately international laws are not frequently enforced. You cannot make a valid comparison between the regimented rule of law in countries like Australia and America and international law; it just does not work that way. Before the Gulf War, resolution 678 authorised military measures to eject Iraq from Kuwait to `restore peace and security' and to give effect to `all subsequent resolutions' on Iraq, which included 687, calling for its complete, immediate and unconditional disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction. That is a pretty clear indication to me of what was required. </para><para>That is why, in passing, I have to say that the French have been so duplicitous and opportunistic. This is a nation that can never be relied upon. It must be remembered that in order to appease the French the United States negotiated Security Council resolution 1441, which was to further endorse the previous Security Council resolutions which France has thoroughly trashed over the past 12 years and which has delayed US action for months recently. France is not doing this to contain Iraq; France spent the 1990s weakening sanctions through its self-interest in the Middle East. It seems that France sees this as an appropriate opportunity to weaken the United States and build itself a new international relevance. Its decision to pre-emptively announce that it would use its veto fundamentally weakened the containment option which it espoused and continues to espouse. Its final act of treachery was to announce that it would never sanction force against Iraq. Quite bizarrely, it even rejected the British compromise position—the most recent compromise position—before Iraq did. I have to say that perhaps the French have never recovered from the fact that French is no longer the language of diplomacy—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Australian wines are better—</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—Yes, certainly better than the French wines. It will take a very long time before people start learning French again for that reason. Apart from anything else, the United States has saved France's face on a number of occasions. They were failed colonialists in South-East Asia and in World War I and World War II. This needs to be put on record: they were given a seat on the Security Council after World War II in the fraudulent and embarrassing attempt to give them the status of being part of the victorious allies over Hitler's Germany—nothing could have been further from the truth. We all know that from learning modern history at school. They have always threatened veto against any exercise of force against Iraq. Because the United States has made a decision not to seek the 18th resolution which would allow them to have their veto, they will not have their opportunity to exercise it, but in doing so they have fundamentally weakened the moral and, I dare say, military option to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to say something of our deployed members of the ADF and to their loved ones who are in Australia. These troops are outstanding. They are well trained; many have seen active service already in East Timor, Afghanistan and other activities in the war against terror; they are very well led and they are very well equipped. They are a credit to this nation and they go with all our support. I am very heartened that we have had expressions of support from our political opponents who do not support their deployment. Any beef people have with the government's decision is to be directed towards us and not our troops. Senator Lees was absolutely correct when she said we would never like to see another occasion of returning troops not having the gracious and appropriate reception that they will have when they return— hopefully with no casualties or very few casualties amongst them. I also hope that they return to this country very soon.</para><para>Our aim is to disarm Iraq, but if Saddam Hussein is removed then so be it. His human rights record and political dictatorship have brought havoc to a potentially very wealthy nation. Unlike a lot of other countries of the region, Iraq has the capacity to feed itself in addition to having eight per cent to 10 per cent of the world's known oil deposits. It has the area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which in biblical and mythical times was the Garden of Eden. That area of Iraq is substantially degraded now, but it has the capacity to feed itself. Before the Gulf War in 1990 it did so, and did so well, and in fact exported food.</para><para>After the disarmament of Saddam Hussein, Australia must and will—and I am pleased that it is in the motion—play a part in the humanitarian effort to rebuild Iraq. Iraq, of course, is an important market for our wheat, has been for a number of years and has increased in importance over the last few years. Iraq also owes Australian wheat growers a large amount of money—around half a billion dollars—which after the Gulf War it was not able to repay, not because it did not want to but because the oil for food program did not permit Iraq to meet debts that had been accrued prior to the Gulf War on the basis that it may be repaying debts that were inappropriate and may have been to various countries for arms and various other matters. But there is a debt there to the Australian Wheat Board, and hopefully that will be paid in due course. </para><para>I am heartened in a geostrategic sense by the US announcement of the so-called road map for the Israel-Palestinian conflict resolution possibility. Let us hope that we shall see a couple of very good strategic outcomes come from the disarming of Saddam Hussein. I am also confident that the strength of our relations with the countries of our region exceeds any differences we might have over Iraq.</para><para>The Prime Minister visited our most important regional neighbour, Indonesia, just the other day. He reassured President Megawati that our approach in the Middle East has nothing to do with Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam or Islamic countries. He says— and I believe him—that she accepted his explanation and said that she would make that very clear to her colleagues in the government of Indonesia. We share with them a regional concern in the Asia-Pacific region to avoid the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to share the common threat that we all have from modern international terrorists that have no particular victims in their sights and are most indiscriminate in the way they exercise their terror.</para><para>The performance of Tony Blair is admirable. For him the stakes are very high but he, like our Prime Minister, is doing what he knows is right. I have been very concerned in this debate about the degree of anti-Americanism. You might expect it from the uninformed or the plain crazy like some of our Democrat colleagues, but you do not expect it from the Labor Party. Their criticism of the US is made somewhat hollow when the Blair government has taken the very strong position that it has.</para><para>These are difficult days. This has not been a decision taken lightly by the Prime Minister or by the government, but there is a sombre and resolute commitment to the decision made by the government. I share that. I feel very privileged to be part of this debate. I also feel very worried and concerned about our troops serving a long way from home. Like all senators, I hope that they return shortly and that they return safely to their homes having done a job that needs to be done. That is the way that Australian military personnel have consistently exercised their role over the last 100 years and I hope it is the way they will consistently exercise their role into the future. We are represented by very talented and capable ADF personnel. They are doing a job that the government knows needs to be done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id></name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Having listened to Senator Sandy Macdonald in this debate, I acknowledge that this is one area where we will depart from agreement. Senator Sandy Macdonald and I, as members of the defence committee, have agreed on a number of matters over a long period of time. In my own mind I clearly believe that what the government have undertaken is simply a mistake. Senator Sandy Macdonald and others in this debate have mentioned disarmament. Disarmament is important because of what is happening not only in Iraq but elsewhere throughout the world. In this specific case, of course, in which we are dealing with Iraq, it is important to disarm Saddam Hussein and his regime. But it seems to me that the argument has shifted to regime change. If this is about regime change—which now seems to be gathering momentum—then one needs to be very concerned about the path that this debate is proceeding down. One cannot help but admit that the regime that Saddam Hussein overlooks is murderous, barbaric and cruel. No-one is going to get into that debate with anyone on this whole issue. But I am worried, if we go down the path of setting this as a precedent, what other regimes which are equally contemptuous are going to be subjected to exactly the same treatment.

There are many contemptuous regimes that are held in great disrespect throughout the world. I believe that, as is being portrayed currently by the Americans, this is about regime change. It is not simply about the disarmament of Saddam Hussein and his acolytes in Iraq. How did all of this arise? It arose in the first instance because of terrorism, the spread of terrorism and the war against terrorism and because of weapons of mass destruction. At this stage, any reasonable person would agree that there has been no convincing evidence to link Iraq with either terrorism or weapons of mass destruction.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Where pressure has been applied, the regime under Saddam Hussein has now started to bow. One might say that that is taking a hell of a long time, and so it may be. But it does not mean that one has to drop everything and go off to war to achieve the aim of disarmament of this regime. For me, war is always the last resort—it is the very last thing that should be attempted or engaged in—because of the complete difficulty that I have with war in my own conscience. That does not mean that I am a pacifist or that I am anti-war, but it should be the last resort. I do not believe that at this stage it is the last resort. I believe that it suits some timetable and strategy that America has put in place over a period of time.</para><para>The other concern I have is that the action that is currently being advocated by the governments of the United States, Britain and, of course, Australia will set a bad example to other world powers who will take this as an endorsement for them to act pre-emptively in their own right where they have international quarrels. I do not want to list where those quarrels are, but you do not need to be Einstein to work out where they are, where the flashpoints are and where the tensions are throughout the world. If the justification on this basis is to go in and change the regime in Iraq, what would be standing in the way of other nations throughout the world doing the same? They see this lead being given through the Americans, British and Australians and say, `If it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander. They can do this, why shouldn't we?' That poses a real cause for concern because, when one thinks about the potential conflicts that exist throughout this world, there are some real, striking flashpoints.</para><para>I believe that what we are seeing is an abandonment of the UN as a peace conciliator. Peace is always far preferable to war. Peace is far preferable to conflict. It seems to me that the pressing and urgent need for a second resolution to go before the UN Security Council has been abandoned. The processes at the UN have been abandoned. For me, the difficulty is that the last resort has not yet arrived; one does not need to go the next step yet.</para><para>We on the Labor side of politics have been consistent in our approach on this issue since April 2002. However, as I said in a previous speech on this debate, the government have moved backwards and forwards on the issue; they have vacillated. They have got themselves caught out and then tried to redeem themselves, but all the time without being honest with the Australian public that they were committed in the long term to going to war if needs be; in other words, without seeing that the last resort—that is, the resolution by the United Nations of this issue— could take place.</para><para>To me, the government's action does not warrant any support at all. They have provided no justification, at this stage, which any reasonable person can accept. I feel sorry, though, for our defence personnel. Our defence personnel merit real support in what is taking place at this time. We on this side of politics wish them a safe return, as do those on the other side. We will also keep in mind the hardship that their families will confront over the period of time that any war might take place. But the fact of life is that we have engaged too soon. We have committed too soon. These problems should not be confronted by the service personnel of our defence forces and by their families. </para><para>As Senator Sandy Macdonald said quite correctly, there are a lot of very good men and women who serve in our defence forces. They are well trained, they are loyal, and they are not a rabble such as one would find in some of the less desirable defence forces. They are very forthright, upright human beings and individuals. They too have different views and opinions on this issue but, acting under the command of a democratically elected government, they have gone to do their job and we have a basic and fundamental responsibility to respect them and the role that they will perform. The fact that we do not like the war that they have been engaged in by this government is another issue, but those people deserve our respect and support. If nothing else is said in this debate, it needs to be said over and over again that those people should not be the subject of criticism by anyone throughout this land. If any group is to be the subject of criticism, it is the government, because it is the government who—whilst democratically elected— have taken the decision to commit our forces to the war in Iraq.</para><para>The government, along with a number of other governments, were adamant about the second resolution appearing in the United Nations. That of course has not come about and we now see the decision to go in without any real consultation with the Australian government. It was simply a matter of the President of the United States picking up the phone and asking the Prime Minister of Australia to send forces in. How demeaning that is—after no consultation with the Australian government, picking up the phone and saying: `We're ready now. Please send the forces in'! It is a little bit rich.</para><para>The other issue that was touched on by Senator Sandy Macdonald—and I have not, because of other commitments, listened to too many other contributions this afternoon—that needs to be taken into consideration in all of this is the issue of our Asian neighbours. Whilst Senator Macdonald referred to the consultation that has taken place with Indonesia, there are far more neighbours in this region than just Indonesia, many of whom follow the Islamic faith, many of whom are not—whilst we are basically a multicultural society in Australia now—basically an Anglo-Celtic society. One wonders what the government have been doing in terms of consultation with our Asian neighbours.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Japan, Singapore, the Philippines?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—When I last spoke in this debate, it was very poor indeed. I hear a bit of chirping coming from the other side, but that leads no-one to believe that there has been any real consultation with our neighbours, with whom we have to live. The only consultation that this government have been involved in has been picking up the telephone to talk to Mr Bush.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I agree that terrorism must be stopped— there is no argument about that—and that those who sponsor terrorism must be stopped; but, when all the avenues have been thoroughly explored and exhausted, then and only then should force be considered. I do not believe—and this is where I will be at odds with my good friend on the other side Senator Sandy Macdonald—that every avenue has been explored. Whilst Senator Macdonald and others will allude to the 12-year period, one can say that patience is a virtue. I am sure, Senator Macdonald, if we were a bit more patient, with more pressure and appropriate pressure applied from the appropriate sources, then disarmament could be achieved without the need for force and violence.</para><para>There are people out there in the community who are pacifists by nature and would say that there should never be force used under any circumstances. I understand that sentiment. Whilst I understand the sentiment, I cannot necessarily subscribe fully to it. As I have said—if one follows logically what I have said—if there is no other avenue open, if it is the last resort that is available, then one must consider it, but consider it in the gravest of moments. I do not believe the Australian government had reached that position. More consideration should have been given to the action of committing our troops to a war with Iraq. Sometimes force will be necessary and at other times it may be necessary, but this is certainly not the time to use force. </para><para>I want to briefly comment on the US alliance, because, again, that was referred to by other speakers in this debate. The US alliance is deeply important to Australia—there is no doubt about that—but it does not require Australia to kowtow, on every occasion, to the will of the United States. If one thinks of any mature relationship in life, that relationship does not mean that you jump every time a friend or ally asks you to do things. It would be a sad world indeed if that were the basis of any relationship or friendship. I think the importance of the relationship between America and Australia is that it has been marked by a range of governments over a long period of time, particularly since the Second World War. We have been an integral partner with the United States in many activities over a long period of time. One does not have to be anti-American to say to the United States on this occasion, `You are going too soon. Your actions on this occasion are wrong. Your actions need not be taken at all.' It is not difficult to say that. One would think, if the United States were mature in their attitude towards us then they would accept that view in a reasonable manner.</para><para>A mature relationship—not only with the United States but with any government—is one where our view is sought. This did not happen on this occasion in our relationship with the United States. Our view should be sought; it should not be a case of the Australian Prime Minister hanging around the telephone waiting for a call from the President of the United States. At the end of the day, that impresses no-one. This is really about how ordinary, average Australians perceive what is going on. Average Australians do not want war; that is a natural reaction. Average Australians also want fairness and justice to apply in our international relations, and that is not happening. Ordinary, average Australians want to see that international diplomacy, through the likes of the United Nations, is absolutely exhausted before any thought of a last resort to war occurs. We have upheld the principle, over a long period of time, that the role of the United Nations is to provide the base upon which peace can be founded. But, on this occasion, the United Nations has been cast to one side and that is a cause for grave concern.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to say that I do feel for the families and for those service men and women. I know that our service men and women will serve our country proudly and I want to make the point once again that they are deserving of our respect. The fact that they are there legally and legitimately should not be challenged. What needs to be constantly challenged, though, are the maverick actions of this government in committing us to a war we should not be involved in.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>9550</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe that today is a tragic day for our nation and, like me, many Australians are angry and saddened. I know that there are many hundreds of thousands of Australians who are frustrated by a prime minister who is not paying attention to them, a prime minister whom they perceive as taking orders from or listening to the President of the United States rather than listening to the voices of thousands upon thousands of Australians, those very Australians he was elected to represent. Today, the Prime Minister has committed our country to be an accomplice in an unjustified and immoral war. He has made this commitment against the will of the majority of Australians. Fifteen men and two women have committed Australia to war, sending young Australian men and women potentially to their deaths. On that note—because there are only two women in the cabinet—I am glad to be the second female speaker so far in this debate.</para></talk.start><para>This decision to deploy troops to support the US with such alacrity—as we have seen in recent months—has been made without the support of opposition parties in this place, without a UN mandate and in the face of the overwhelming opposition of the Australian people. How dare the Prime Minister claim today that we risk undermining our relationship with the United States by not committing troops to this potential conflict. How dare that be used as an excuse. What about the risks in undermining our relationship with the international community, not to mention those vital multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations? </para><para>How dare the Prime Minister in some way interpret this as an attack on our troops. The voices of opposition to this war were loud and clear a long time ago, before troops were predeployed. We do not have a beef with the troops. We have a beef with the decision of the Prime Minister and this government because today we abandoned the processes of the United Nations. Our Prime Minister has subscribed to the rhetoric of the President of the United States, George W. Bush, that if the United Nations does not agree with the United States it is irrelevant. That is not democracy. The United Nations was not intended to be the puppet of the United States. How can we now accept George W. Bush's claim that he wants to bring democracy to the Iraqi people when he is abandoning democracy to bomb them?</para><para>We are constantly, almost daily, being told by the President of the United States and by our own Prime Minister that the world has changed and that we live in new and different circumstances. I think that many of us acknowledge, particularly in light of recent terrorist attacks on our nation and on other soils, that we do face different challenges and that we do live in a different environment. Indeed, the terrorist attacks have alerted us to a new and very serious security threat. But in his speech last week the Prime Minister failed to provide any evidence of a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. Clearly he has no evidence—if he did I am sure that he would have presented it—and, in the absence of any evidence, the Prime Minister continues to use terrorism as a justification for war. The Prime Minister is basing the gravest decision of his prime ministership—of his premiership—on misinformation. War against Iraq will not diminish the threat of terrorism. As we know, at least one senior intelligence analyst—along with many other voices in the community, of course—has said this. The analyst was prepared to sacrifice his job and his career in order to expose this very deception.</para><para>In 1945, nations around the world joined together to establish the United Nations. They signed a document outlining their desire, which was:</para><quote><para>... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind ...</para></quote><para>We must not let the threat of terrorism cloud our memories of the past. We must not forget the great tragedies that led to the formation of the United Nations. This generation and all generations must not forget that untold sorrow. We must do all we can to avoid the mistakes of the past.</para><para>As I said in the other debate on this issue, war is not about leadership. It does not demonstrate leadership or success. War represents failure, because it gives up on those things that characterise decency, democracy and civilisation: negotiation, rational discussion, persuasion, the use of international goodwill and the offer of help in return for cooperation. These are the characteristics of a civilisation and of a democracy. If the combined brains of the international community cannot avoid war, then we have all failed desperately.</para><para>When the international community is calling for peace and for the peaceful disarmament of a dictator, I would have thought that this marks the maturation of a global world. Does this not demonstrate a civility among citizens of the world? Should we not be using those aspects that democracy and civilisation have to offer us—our intelligence in negotiation, compassion, diplomacy and debate—for a peaceful outcome? Instead, some leaders hark back to atavistic notions of la gloire. They continue to perpetuate the notion that war is success and that the outcome of war is success. The tragedy of the failure with which we are faced today is that Australia is among a group of nations that has prevented the international community from succeeding in its efforts and endeavours to disarm Iraq peacefully. The so-called coalition abandoned the United Nations when it became clear that its position was not supported by the international community.</para><para>To put this in context, for weeks—indeed, for months—our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, campaigned for a second UN resolution. They implied that resolution 1441 did not authorise military intervention. They stressed the desirability for any military action to occur under the auspices of the United Nations. Our Prime Minister flew all the way to Washington to make this point to the President of the United States. We certainly supported him in making that specific point. At that time I quoted Churchill, who said: `To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war.' Yet today our Prime Minister has told us that there was never really any need for a second resolution. How are the people supposed to believe our Prime Minister when he changes his position at the request of George Bush? When was he being sincere? When was he being open with the Australian people? When it became clear that the Security Council would not support military action at this stage because it believed that Iraq could still be disarmed peacefully, the coalition did not abandon its misconceived plans for war; it abandoned democracy. </para><para>I imagine that a number of people in this place are familiar with the story of Sadako Sasaki. It has been widely reported, so they may have read the story or seen it online. Sadako was two when the United States dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima. She fled with her family and, while doing so, was drenched with the radioactive black rain that fell throughout the day. She appeared to be a perfectly normal, healthy girl—apparently, she was the best runner in her sixth grade class—until the age of 12, when she suddenly developed leukaemia. As she lay in hospital Sadako attempted to fold 1,000 paper cranes. She believed that, if she did this, it would heal her. Before her death she said to the cranes, `I will write peace on your wings and you will fly all over the world.' But Sadako did not have the strength to fold 1,000 cranes. She died on 25 October 1955, having folded 964. Her friends made up the 1,000 cranes and placed them in her coffin with her when she was buried. Since that time origami cranes have symbolised peace.</para><para>Yesterday, in my home state of South Australia, a beautiful sight graced the steps of our Parliament House. People had gathered there to fold 1,000 paper cranes for peace. Their wish was that we do not go to war. Today our Prime Minister crushed their hopes for peace, but I will ensure that their message gets through to him. I will deliver to the Prime Minister those 1,000 cranes that they have so carefully prepared. I will join with those who are committed to ensuring that Sadako's story is not forgotten, like the children in her school who started the national campaign to ensure she was remembered.</para><para>I believe we can actually learn a lot from the children of the world at this time. In the midst of this debate, let us contemplate for a moment what happened in Port Augusta yesterday when young asylum seekers were embraced by fellow schoolchildren on their first day of school. By demonstrating their compassion—by offering strangers life, not death—these children showed the way to their elders. They had the courage to reach across the barriers of culture and race and the stigma that some of their elders have inflicted on asylum seekers. Those Australian kids did our nation proud. They continued Australia's strong tradition of embracing and accepting other cultures. They showed kindness to strangers.</para><para>As a South Australian I was proud of them all. I only wish I could see their values and their actions reflected in the actions of this government. To think that war is about to be waged in their names is a disgrace. To think that young people just a little older than these kids will have to fight a war and inflict death and destruction is disgraceful. Our young people are building peace and understanding. Our young people could tell you what the United Nations stands for and how vital it is in our troubled world. Unfortunately, they will now inherit a world in which the United Nations has been undermined by the actions of some vigilante governments.</para><para>Tonight I take this opportunity to address two particular groups of Australians. Firstly, like my colleagues, I would like to say to the Australian servicemen and servicewomen who are over in the gulf that our thoughts are with you and your families at this time. I respect your courage and your commitment to this country, and I acknowledge that you are acting on the instructions of your government. Secondly, to the many thousands and thousands of Australians who were aggrieved by the Prime Minister's decision today, my message is: don't give up now. We need to hear your voices more than ever before. We cannot let the Prime Minister dissuade us from standing up for what is right, because I believe that persistence can turn this situation around. After all, it was the community's strong opposition to the Vietnam War that eventually brought that conflict to an end. </para><para>While the Prime Minister purports to speak on behalf of the Australian community, it is really important for us to show the international community that he does not speak for all of us. We need to unite with others around the world to make it clear that we do not support this war. We want our people to live peacefully, without the deaths of thousands, maybe millions, on our conscience. We want to face the problems that we have as a nation, not create new ones. We want to write our history. We want to say sorry, not create more and more reasons for being sorry.</para><para>Many Australians can only see the faces of Iraqi women and children at this time, afraid of us now instead of Saddam Hussein—Iraqi children who may never celebrate another birthday and who will witness horrors, no doubt, that no child should see. These children should be playing in the parks, not hiding in bomb shelters. The Iraqi community no doubt is a community now gripped by fear, a community facing the military might of the world's superpower for crimes that they have not committed. This is not liberation; this is potentially death. And Australia will be complicit in these horrors, not because we want to but because we have been taken against our will down a dangerous and unjustifiable path.</para><para>I ask the Prime Minister to reconsider. We have one last window of opportunity—48 hours to turn around and do what is right. If we do not act now, I think irreversible and unimaginable damage will follow. I ask the Prime Minister to ring the United States President, George Bush, and tell him what the Australian community really thinks about this war. I ask him to withdraw the commitment that he gave without the authority or the mandate of the Australian people or the United Nations. I ask him to bring the troops home. I ask the Prime Minister to listen to his country men and women and act like a statesman, a leader, a visionary, and bring our troops home.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>9553</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been listening very carefully to the contributions made by the honourable senators who have spoken before me. I want to summarise what the Labor Party, other apologists and fellow travellers have been saying about Australia's leading role in confronting Saddam Hussein. I will summarise the points and then address them one by one. Basically, they are saying that Iraq and Saddam Hussein do not have weapons of mass destruction; if Saddam had them, he would not use them; a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda has not been proved; the coalition of the willing is a small and isolated group of nations; we are damaging our relations with our regional neighbours and if we fight we will only make that worse; it is all about the United States getting its hands on Iraqi oil; we have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of another sovereign state; we are lackeys of the United States; our policy on Iraq exposes Australia to a much heightened risk of terrorism; an invasion of Iraq without a new United Nations approval would be illegal; an invasion of Iraq without a new UN approval would be in breach of the statutes of the International Criminal Court; and what we are doing can be, and is being, construed as anti-Islam.</para></talk.start><para>That is basically the argument being put in this chamber and the other place and across our community by those who are opposed to the course of action that our government has committed us to. I respectfully submit that these are great untruths being spread around our nation and in this place. It is a fallacious fiction that is being put about. I want to answer, as I have indicated, all of these points and to make some other ancillary but important points.</para><para>It is said that Iraq and Saddam do not have weapons of mass destruction. We went into Iraq originally—the United States together with the allies—to liberate Kuwait and we stopped. When we stopped, an agreement was made with Saddam that he would disarm and destroy all his weapons of mass destruction. We know that Saddam has the deadly nerve agent VX. He denied that he had it but only on Saturday he allowed weapons inspectors to destroy some stockpiles. That was a lie; that was a breach of trust that became obvious only last Saturday. We know that he has missiles that break the UN rule imposed on Iraq in 1991 after he was thrown out of Kuwait. He has had a token few destroyed—no-one outside the Iraqi military yet knows where the rest are—despite claims that they have all been destroyed. We know that he has 10,000 litres of anthrax and the capacity to use it as a weapon—and we know that he has the capacity to produce more anthrax. We know that he has gas and nerve gas weapons. We know—as do his Kurdish fellow citizens on whom he has used them—that he is quite capable of using them as a weapon of mass destruction. In fact in 1988, 5,000 Kurds were gassed by Saddam. Those people who say that he does not have weapons of mass destruction and those people who say that he will not use them are clearly very wrong. I submit to them that they should just abandon that particular form of attack on the governments of Australia, Britain and the United States. </para><para>There are people who say that a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda has not been proved. The Prime Minister has argued that to wait for absolute proof in circumstances like this is to risk a Pearl Harbor style surprise attack. President Bush put it succinctly in his address to the American people today. He said that a policy of waiting to retaliate against terrorists who could be armed with weapons of mass destruction was not self-defence; it was suicide. We know, for example, that Iraq supports Palestinian terrorism with money and training and pays the families of suicide bombers up to $25,000 each for every suicide bomber. We know that Osama bin Laden has said that Saddam, whose secular regime he abhors, should be supported in his defiance of the world.</para><para>Another argument says that the coalition of the willing is a small and isolated group. Again that is simply not true. It is true that only America, Britain and Australia have committed war-capable military forces to the region. However, the gulf states of Kuwait and Qatar are providing material assistance in terms of bases. Poland has a small number of specialist troops in the region, plus a logistics ship. Hungary is providing training for members of the Iraqi opposition. Turkey now looks set to agree to US troops using its soil to reach northern Iraq. Including Turkey—which has now signed up—Australia and Britain, there are 29 countries in the coalition of the willing. The others are: Albania, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. That certainly is a very strong coalition of the willing. I submit that over the next few days the coalition of the willing will grow, not shrink, as a result of the strong leadership shown by America, Britain and Australia. The world knows that Saddam must go. None of the 15 members of the Security Council who voted last November for resolution 1441 believe Saddam is anything other than a dangerous and vile tyrant. None of them believe he has given up his deadly ambitions.</para><para>The other line in relation to the coalition of the willing that is being peddled is that we are damaging our relations with our regional neighbours and that, if we fight, we will only make that worse. That is not true—except perhaps for Dr Mahathir in Malaysia. Indonesia's President Megawati particularly understands our position, thanks to the efforts of our Prime Minister, who visited her on the last leg of his recent and very important trip to the United States and Britain. More than most regional leaders, she would understand how the horror of Bali has focused Australian minds. But of course there are other countries who support what the United States and Australia are doing in Iraq—including Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the Philippines.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>9555</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>9555</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That there be laid on the table, no later than 4 pm on 20 March 2003, the letter dated 2 December 2002 from the Minister for Health and Ageing to the European Commission on the matter of the European Union's decision to phase-out tobacco sponsorship of formula one races in 2003.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	the press coverage for the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 8 March and 9 March 2003 again provided tobacco companies with unparalleled advertising opportunities, and</para><para>	(ii)	this will be the eighth year that the race has made an operating loss, and again Victorian taxpayers will underwrite the event;</para><para>	(b)	urges the Federal Government to:</para><para>	(i)	bring forward the removal of the exemption for tobacco advertising at the Grand Prix from October 2006 to January 2005, in line with the recent decision of the European Commission,</para><para>	(ii)	progressively tighten conditions on tobacco advertising up until the removal of the exemption, and</para><para>	(iii)	ban incidental advertising of tobacco products outside the confines of the Grand Prix from 2004;

People of my generation remember the Vietnam War mainly from the grainy black-and-white television images we watched as children and teenagers. Later, many of us studied those events as university students, and read about them in books like David Halberstam's <inline font-style="italic">The Best and the Brightest</inline> and Neil Sheehan's <inline font-style="italic">A Bright Shining Lie</inline>. The consensus of opinion—not just on the Left but also, I think it is fair to say, among the political middle ground at the time—was that the Vietnam War was a grave error of American policy; that Vietnamese communism was, in truth, merely an expression of Vietnamese nationalism; that the war was a civil war in which the Western powers had no interest.</para></talk.start><para>With the passage of the years, that 1970s view of the Vietnam War has come to be more and more discredited. Increasingly, thinking people have come to realize that the people of South Vietnam were betrayed by a weakness of will among the West—a weakness made fatal by the disgrace of Richard Nixon. Had the American government not been immobilized by Watergate in late 1973 and 1974, would North Vietnam have violated the Paris Peace Treaty? Would it have succeeded, had it tried?</para><para>In his memoirs published in 1994, General Colin Powell, who was a commander in Vietnam, lamented the policy of American administrations in the 1960s and 1970s— both Democrat and Republican—by which American soldiers were sent into battle with one hand tied behind their back: constrained from finishing their task by weak political leadership, itself intimidated by hysterical and wrong-headed domestic public opinion. Had the West demonstrated the will to prevail in South Vietnam, how different would the history of our region have been? And, in particular, how different would have been the lives of the South Vietnamese people? Perhaps South Vietnam would have developed, under the benevolent influences of democratic government and free enterprise, into another South Korea.</para><para>But we know that did not happen. To this day, the people south of the 17th parallel have not known democratic government. They have not known civil liberty. They have not known free enterprise. It is not to the point to say that the government of the Republic of Vietnam was corrupt and illiberal. Perhaps it was. But it was a government from which healthy liberal democratic institutions could have evolved, as they did in South Korea. The communist government of Vietnam is a government from which liberal democratic institutions can never evolve, under which fundamental human rights and freedoms will never be protected.</para><para>This evening Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Payne, Senator Mason, Senator Santoro and I had the privilege of welcoming to Parliament House Mrs Jackie Bong-Wright, the President of the Vietnamese- American Voters Association; Mr Trung Doan, the president of the Vietnamese community in Australia; Dr Phuoc Vo, Chairman of the Vietnamese Physicians of the Free World; Mr Henry Dang, Secretary-General of the Buddhist Federation of Australia; and Miss Dang Lan of Vietnamese Community Radio. I acknowledge their presence in the President's gallery tonight. Mrs Bong-Wright is visiting Australia to raise public awareness of the political persecution of Vietnamese citizens. I am glad also to acknowledge the role of Amnesty International in agitating on behalf of Vietnamese prisoners of conscience. As well, I wish to acknowledge the work of my good friend Dr Cuong Bui, a greatly respected leader of the Vietnamese community in Brisbane and Australia, in advancing this issue.</para><para>Tonight, Senator Mason and I will speak about the persecution of adherents of the Buddhist and Catholic faiths by the Vietnamese government. I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Santoro, who also spoke in this place, on 3 March, about other Vietnamese prisoners of conscience.  </para><para>The cases which I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate are those of two leaders of the Buddhist church in Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang and the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do.</para><para>Thich Huyen Quang is the leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The Venerable Quang is currently held under house arrest and in internal exile. He has been in this situation since 1981. Although he is now an 83-year-old man who requires daily medical attention, he is denied the medical care which he needs. The Venerable Quang's current circumstances are the latest episode in a long tale of political persecution, which began two years after the communist conquest of South Vietnam.</para><para>And what was his crime? In March 1977, he wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pharn Van Dong, protesting at 85 instances of repression of Vietnamese Buddhists. He did not publicly agitate. He did not stage protest rallies. He wrote a letter! And for this `crime', he was arrested on 9 June 1977, together with five other prominent church leaders, and charged with the crime of `opposition to government policy'. He was, of course, convicted and given a two-year suspended sentence. In October 1981, and again in February 1982, the Venerable Quang was arrested for defending the rights of his church. On the latter occasion, he was placed in internal exile, the civic no-man's-land from which he has never emerged.</para><para>A similar fate has befallen the Secretary-General of the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do. He was one of the five other Buddhist leaders arrested with Thich Huyen Quang in February 1982. In Venerable Do's case, he was sentenced to 10 years internal exile after a sham prosecution and a process of interrogation during which he was tortured. In August 1994, Thich Quang Do wrote a 44-page document, directed to the General-Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Do Muoi, outlining the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam. For that act, he was arrested on 4 January 1995. He was subsequently prosecuted for the `crime' of `sabotaging government policies and damaging the interests of the state'. Apart from the August 1994 document, the particulars of the charge against him included the allegation that he had attempted—presumably, without the sanction of the authorities—to organize an emergency food convoy to flood victims in the Mekong delta. He was sentenced to imprisonment for five years. After his release, Thich Quang Do was periodically harassed, interrogated and detained. In June 2001, he was placed under house arrest, where he is currently detained by a 24-hour police cordon.</para><para>Both Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In the former's case, the nomination was signed by two Nobel laureates; in the latter, by some 200 members of parliament from the United States, Canada, Australia, France and Belgium. The persecution of these two distinguished spiritual leaders is symbolic of the persecution of the Buddhist religion by the government of Vietnam. The church was banned in 1981, and the government declared the practice of the Buddhist religion by adherents of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam to be illegal. In the years since, Vietnamese authorities have confiscated the church's possessions and records, invaded its pagodas and holy places—in particular, by the seizure of the Hoi Phuoc Pagoda in December 1994—and systematically harassed its leaders and adherents. Its two principal spiritual leaders, the holy men of whom I have spoken—Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do—remain under house arrest and in internal exile to this day.</para><para>When we read of the events which led to the Vietnam War, we read of the persecution of Vietnamese Buddhists by President Diem's government in the early 1960s. It was a cause of justifiable outrage, and it was used by many on the Left as a moral foundation for criticism of the American policy of support for the Diem regime. But the persecution of the Buddhist religion by the communist government of Vietnam for more than a quarter of a century has barely raised a whisper of complaint in the West. We see yet another example of a phenomenon upon which both I and Senator Mason have commented before: that selective morality, which condemns with abundant vehemence the illiberal acts of governments in open societies, but is blind to the much more serious and systematic abuse of human rights by the closed societies of the communist world. </para><para>As we speak, in the imprisoned land of Vietnam, two venerable old holy men are suffering tonight. They have been suffering for a quarter of a century. The Western democracies failed the people of South Vietnam 30 years ago. We cannot avert our eyes from the consequences of that failure today.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title><page.no>9559</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>9559</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak tonight about the subject matter of a petition that I will present to the Senate tomorrow on behalf of 1,600 South Australians in relation to the detention of David Hicks, an Australian citizen, in a United States military facility in Cuba. The petition I will present calls on the Senate to ensure that Hicks's rights are met under the guidelines of the Geneva convention as it applies to prisoners of war, to send a deputation to George W. Bush asking that David Hicks be returned to Australia and to ensure that David Hicks be entitled to an Australian trial if he is charged with any crime. This petition has been signed by over 1,600 South Australians who feel that the government has let down one of its own citizens in relation to the protection of his fundamental human and legal rights.</para></talk.start><para>As many senators will know, I come to this chamber with a specific professional interest in the law and in particular in human rights and international law. I view the case of David Hicks with a particular interest— not because I know whether he is innocent or not; in fact, I have no knowledge of this at all. My concern is that his detention without charge in a United States military facility amounts to a breach of the fundamental legal and human rights of an Australian citizen.</para><para>South Australian David Hicks is currently being detained in Guantanamo Bay United States military base in Cuba. Hicks was captured by the US military in Afghanistan in November 2001. As I said, he is presently detained in Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Also detained there with him is fellow Australian Mamdouh Habib. Both David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib have been detained in that facility without charge for over a year. Let me say first and foremost that David Hicks must be brought to justice. He must be tried and convicted of any crimes he has committed. However, to date David Hicks has not been charged with any crimes. His fate, it appears, is to perpetually rot in a military jail cell. This is a fundamental breach of human rights. Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states quite clearly:</para><quote><para>No-one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile ...</para></quote><para>It also provides in article 10:</para><quote><para>Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.</para></quote><para>It is clear that in the case of Hicks no charge has been brought. He has not been brought before any court. He has not had access to a lawyer and he has not had access to consular assistance. He is not permitted visitors except US and at times Australian military and intelligence interrogators. The only Australian contact he has had has been with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO. The only contact between Hicks and Habib and their families in Australia has been through the International Red Cross. </para><para>What concerns me is that this government has accepted this and publicly acknowledges that this is acceptable. It appears to accept that it is for the US government to decide what rights Hicks is entitled to. The Labor Party has been pushing for the Australian government to take action in relation to this situation for more than a year. Daryl Melham, the shadow minister for justice, has asked questions of the government and raised the issue in the media; however, the government has defiantly and stubbornly failed to act. This is an issue that goes beyond the individual case in question. It shows the government's inability to balance human rights with the war on terror. All citizens of Australia, even if they are guilty or even if they are terrorists, deserve to have their case heard. All citizens are entitled to the protection of the rule of law. </para><para>It is obviously tempting in an age of uncertainty and heightened danger to abandon the principle of procedural fairness and the rule of law, but we cannot allow these to be recklessly sacrificed during such times. We would not accept the denial of legal rights for even the worst alleged offender caught by Australian police. Simply because the United States military made the arrest of Hicks and Habib does not negate the serious failure of justice here. To be a citizen of Australia should mean more than it apparently does to this government. While Australia intervenes to secure the rights of drug smugglers and murderers who are apprehended in other countries, it seems that when one of our own is captured by the United States under suspicion of crime related to the war on terror then the government does not see fit to intervene. One of the fighters for the Taliban captured in Afghanistan was an American citizen. Unlike David Hicks, he received a trial, he plea bargained and has now been sentenced. Unlike the process for treating its own citizens, Australian citizens it seems are forced to wait until the United States decides that it is time for it to take action to bring them to justice.</para><para>The United States has declared that it is under no responsibility to comply with the Geneva conventions in regard to the prisoners detained in Cuba. The Geneva conventions would provide Hicks with the right to humane treatment, the right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention, the right to the prompt access and assistance of a lawyer and the right to be informed of the reasons for his detention. The US argument that the Geneva conventions do not apply has been challenged, including by eminent human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC. The Geneva conventions appear to completely contradict the view of the United States. The convention says that it applies to:</para><quote><para>... armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.</para></quote><para>The United States did take part in armed conflict with the former government of Afghanistan and therefore is bound by the Geneva convention. The words `armed conflict' were specifically chosen to encompass military actions, such as the war on terror, which a country could describe as a police action. The United States apparently views the Geneva conventions as not applying to Hicks because he possibly does not belong to a category enumerated for protection. However, the convention makes clear that every individual should enjoy the protection of the Geneva convention until a competent tribunal has determined whether or not a person is part of a protected group.</para><para>Due process of law is a principle that both Australians and Americans value and rely on. However, in the case of the detention of David Hicks, we see it come under threat. This government has been complacent—if not oblivious—about the legal rights of an Australian citizen. It has endorsed the practice of the United States and has raised no objection. In Senate estimates in February this year, the Attorney-General's Department acknowledged that the government believes that the welfare of Hicks is a matter solely for the United States military. Government officials said:</para><quote><para>It is really a question of whether the United States is prepared to let other countries have any role at all. It is their detention facility. We have access to it on the basis that they permit us to, which has been for the purposes of law enforcement and security investigations, and on limited terms. They are the bases on which we have access to those facilities.</para></quote><para>The detention of Hicks raises some complex issues of international law to which I do not purport to have all the answers. But his detention without charge and inability to access legal advice and consular assistance is a matter that should concern all Australians. It is of concern that the government accepts a situation where Australian citizenship provides only a second-class passport when an individual gets themselves into trouble overseas for an activity that can be related to the war on terror.</para><para>Until now it has been thought that there was little public sympathy for David Hicks in the community. But the large number of petitioners named in the petition that I will present to the Senate tomorrow calling for the recognition by this government of Hick's legal rights shows that discontent in the community is growing. The government claims that it is conducting an investigation into the Hicks case, although this has been going on for a year now and it seems, so far, to be a fruitless exercise. It is a disgrace that the first law officer of the Commonwealth, Attorney-General Darryl Williams, would allow and condone such a denial of legal rights to an Australian citizen. Australian citizens suspected of terrorist offences should be charged and dealt with under appropriate judicial processes. I do not know whether David Hicks is guilty or not. If he has committed a crime, he should be charged in an appropriate jurisdiction and given access to legal advice. He should not be left in the legal limbo of Guantanamo Bay. He may well be guilty. The point is that he should at least be offered the opportunities to defend himself that America once insisted should be offered to the worst Nazi war criminals. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Fringe Benefits Tax</title><page.no>1</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Fringe benefits tax on employer-provided motor vehicles currently encourages people to drive further and discourages people from using public transport. It is an environmentally harmful tax. The National Transport Secretariat estimates that 40 per cent of cars on the road during peak hour are company cars and that, overall, company car trips constitute 18 percent of total car trips. As an example of how fringe benefits tax encourages further driving, consider Fairfield Council in NSW. Fairfield Council offers its staff cars as a part of their salary package. It requires its staff to travel 25,000 kilometres each year in order to reach a lower tax rate. So Fairfield Council sets out the monthly mileage that a staff member has to travel to reach the annual 25,000 kilometre target. It works out at about 2,000 kilometres a month, or 67 kilometres each and every day, which is the equivalent of travelling from Parliament House to Queanbeyan and back three times a day. If a staff member is having difficulty reaching that amount, usually because they live close to the workplace, they swap their car with someone who lives further away in order to reach the required monthly mileage.</para></talk.start><para>Employees seeking to reduce their fringe benefits tax repeat this situation around the country, a situation which is clearly ridiculous. It arose out of an attempt to save smaller companies from having to estimate how much of their company car use was business use and how much was personal use by filling out time-consuming logbooks. The obligation to fill out the logbooks was removed, and it was simply decreed that the more kilometres you travel, obviously, the more you are driving for business and the fringe benefits tax payable should therefore be lower. So, the more you drive, the less tax you pay. If you drive less than 15,000 kilometres, 26 per cent of your travel is considered to be personal and you pay fringe benefits tax on 26 per cent of the value of the car. If you drive between 15,000 and 25,000 kilometres, the amount reduces to 20 per cent—and so on, until we have people who are driving more than 40,000 kilometres paying fringe benefits tax on only seven per cent of the value of the car. As we have seen with Fairfield Council, employees will go to extraordinary lengths to push themselves down into the lower tax bracket on these issues.</para><para>So how much tax is the government forgoing because of this formula? The Commonwealth government produces an annual tax expenditures statement that sets out the amount of tax that has been forgone by the government through favourable tax treatments. For the year 2001-02 it is estimated that charging fringe benefits tax on the full value of cars would have raised an additional $910 million in tax.</para><para>Employer-provided car parking is also exempt from fringe benefits tax, despite the clear financial benefit that it provides to employees. If public transport tickets or bicycles are offered as fringe benefits, they are taxed at the full fringe benefits tax rate of 48.5 per cent. If you contrast this with the seven to 26 per cent rate applied to cars you will see that it is clearly inequitable. The government is encouraging driving and discouraging cycling or public transport use. </para><para>We understand that last year the federal government directed the Australian Greenhouse Office to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of exempting employer-provided public transport from fringe benefits tax. To date, this report has not been released. A similar study was carried out in Canada, and it found that on a community wide basis there would be a net benefit flowing from the reduction in required road maintenance, air pollution and traffic congestion. It is good to see the Labor Party picking up on the Greens' call to have the Greenhouse Office report released. But we need much more than just the release of the report; we need to see this followed through with action. The Greens are calling on the federal government to encourage greater use of public transport by exempting public transport from fringe benefits tax.</para><para>In contrast to Australia, other nations use their taxation system to encourage environmentally friendly transport use. The United Kingdom has recently amended the way that its fringe benefits tax applies to cars. The UK previously used the same method that we do, where the more you drive, the less tax you pay. But now fringe benefits tax is calculated on the amount of carbon dioxide that the car emits. The more carbon dioxide emitted, the more tax levied. This is a much more sustainable approach. In the United States, employers can give their employees tax-free public transport vouchers, passes or fares valued at up to $100 each month.</para><para>These are far more sensible measures. Any studies completed on fringe benefits tax, company cars and public transport should be released and presented to the parliament so that this environmentally unsustainable tax can be amended. It is time that Australia caught up to world leaders in sustainable transport. The Greens look forward to the support of the Senate tomorrow for our motion calling on the government to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to encourage a more sustainable transport use.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Vietnam</title><page.no>9562</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>9562</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My memories of the Vietnam War are not strong, but one of my strongest recollections—indeed, nearly a searing memory—is that of Buddhist monks setting themselves alight to protest at the religious persecution by the then South Vietnamese government. Many will remember those events and those pictures. There were many who condemned the South Vietnamese government for its shortcomings, and many who claimed that, somehow, the communist North Vietnamese government would provide greater religious freedom. Oh, the 1960s! Oh, the romanticism! There were those that thought that communist governments would provide for religious freedom and, as always, many individuals fell for the great lie. Perhaps it is time that they opened their eyes.</para></talk.start><para>Today, of course, there is religious persecution in Vietnam—religious persecution founded on the incapacity of communist governments to recognise any authority other than their own tired and irrelevant orthodoxy. The biggest single difference between liberal democracies and communism is that the communists believe that any civil rights that individuals may have are a gift of the state— a scrap off the table, thrown to the undeserving masses by the high and mighty government. Liberal democracies, on the other hand, believe those rights are inherent and self-evident. Many in our liberal democratic tradition believe that such rights ultimately come from God.</para><para>While freedom of religion is one of mankind's most precious freedoms, it is far from universal. That is why I rise tonight, along with Senator Brandis and Senator Santoro, to voice my strong concern at the ongoing violation of religious freedoms in Vietnam. No-one, except the Vietnamese government, knows how many religious prisoners there are in Vietnam today. Some of these people have been imprisoned, others are under house arrest and still others are subject to restrictions on their movements.</para><para>To highlight the wider problem of religious persecution in Vietnam, I intend to place on the record the plight of two very brave men: Father Nguyen Van Ly and Father Phan Van Loi. Both are Catholic priests and both have been persecuted for nothing more than practising and preaching their faith. Father Ly was ordained in 1974 and served as secretary to the late Archbishop Dien. In September 1977, Father Ly was arrested for distributing essays that were critical of the government's religious repression. Father Ly was immediately sent to a labour camp, but was released several months later with instructions prohibiting him from engaging in further religious activities. </para><para>Father Ly continued religious teaching and was again arrested in May 1983. He was subsequently sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and four years probation. Following his release in 1992, Father Ly was again banned from conducting religious activities and was placed under police surveillance. Despite continued harassment, he continued, as he saw it, to work for God. In late 2000, Father Ly produced a number of papers detailing the government's violations of religious freedom. He followed that, in early 2001, with written testimony for a hearing by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. Then, in May 2001, more than 600 security police stormed Father Ly's parish to arrest him. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and five years house arrest. He is currently being held at Nam Ha prison camp in Nam Ha province, Vietnam.</para><para>I now turn to Father Phan Van Loi. The persecution of Father Phan Van Loi began in 1976, when the Vietnamese government refused to permit his ordination as a priest on completion of his seminary studies. It was not until May 1981 that Father Loi was secretly ordained by the then Archbishop Thuan, who was himself living in exile. In September of that year, Father Loi and several colleagues wrote and performed a short play portraying the government's harassment of Father Nguyen Van Ly. For this five-minute performance Father Loi was sentenced to four years in jail. While Father Loi was in jail, the authorities discovered that he had been ordained without government authorisation, and his sentence was extended by a further three years.</para><para>Although Father Ly was finally released from prison in October 1988, he has continued to suffer persecution for his religious devotion. He is currently under de facto house arrest, with security police stationed continually outside his residence to monitor anyone coming or leaving his home. At a time when Vietnam seeks to modernise and to embrace the international community we can only hope that the issue of religious freedom will be addressed as a matter of urgency.</para><para>Australia is in a unique position to stress the importance of this issue to the government of Vietnam. This year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations. Australia's bilateral relationship with Vietnam is politically, strategically and economically important. Australia is the third largest donor of aid to Vietnam, with a commitment of over $72 million this financial year. Australia is also home to a Vietnamese-born community of close to 200,000 people. I would like to acknowledge in the Senate tonight some of the most distinguished Vietnamese Australians: Mr Trung Doan, President of the Vietnamese Community Association of Australia; Dr Phuoc Vo, Chairman of the Vietnamese Physicians of the Free World; Mr Henry Dang, Secretary General of the Buddhist Federation of Australia; and Miss Dang Lan of Vietnamese community radio. I only wish my old friend, Dr Cuong Bui, could be with us here tonight. I acknowledge their presence in the President's gallery tonight and also note the presence there of a distinguished visitor to Australia, Mrs Jackie Bong-Wright, all the way from Virginia in the United States, who is the president of the Vietnamese-American Voters Association.</para><para>I acknowledge that progress has been achieved in this area. May 2002 saw Australia and Vietnam hold an inaugural dialogue on human rights issues. I welcome this initiative and hope that it will facilitate progress in the future. But we must use these strong links to help people like Father Ly and Father Loi, for these are brave men whose strong sense of moral purpose and unbending determination make them unwilling to live their lives on their knees. Their struggle is a constant and necessary reminder to us all that the great work of liberation and liberalism has not ended with the close of the 20th century. Their struggle continues to inspire us and their determination against all the odds is a triumph of the human spirit. </para><para>Almost three years ago I spoke in this chamber about another remarkable Vietnamese human rights campaigner, Father Andrew Nguyen Huu Lee. I said then:</para><quote><para>I have visited Vietnam on several occasions. Everywhere and often I have been stopped by locals. Careful not to be overheard by agents of state security, they have told me of the failed promise and hardship of Vietnam's socialist experiment. For them and for those fortunate enough to escape from Vietnam, the war has continued for the past 25 years. The good news is that democracy and free enterprise are winning. I am looking forward to coming back to a united democratic Vietnam that has rejoined the family of nations. As Jewish people used to say to each other throughout the centuries of their exile and the centuries of their wandering, `Next year, Jerusalem,' so do I say to all my Vietnamese friends `Next year, Saigon.'</para></quote><para>Three years on, I remain hopeful. Australia's approach to highlighting human rights issues in Vietnam has often been described as quiet diplomacy. In the 30th year of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, maybe it is finally time for all of us to speak rather more loudly.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>World Conference on Doping in Sport</title><page.no>9564</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>9564</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 5 March 2003, at the Copenhagen World Conference on Doping in Sport, 50 countries, including Australia, signed up in support of the adoption of the World Anti-Doping Code. A further 23 countries asserted their support and will sign up to the code in the near future. This was a momentous occasion for all the sporting organisations and their athletes who place their ethics ahead of sporting success and continue the fight against drugs in sport. The challenge ahead is the successful implementation of the code and its subsequent adoption by all sporting organisations in Australia. This can only occur through education of the whole sports community and the establishment of a cohesive model to administer the code. What is needed is an independent national antidoping tribunal to do this job. This is what national sporting organisations want and it is what our athletes want.</para></talk.start><para>Support of the World Anti-Doping Code came at a time when Australia faced what for many—particularly cricket fans—was a crisis in sport. The positive testing of cricketer Shane Warne on the eve of the World Cup cricket sparked an unprecedented debate across Australia. In fact, Warnie and his diuretic was probably the only issue which could have pushed the war with Iraq off the front pages of our newspapers at the time, and it did so for a number of days. What resulted was a general recognition that there was a need for greater consistency in the way athletes have their cases heard and their sanctions determined in the event of a positive drug test. I am not saying this because there was a problem with the way the ACB dealt with Warne, but the issue highlighted how much pressure national sporting organisations are placed under when deliberating on such matters with respect to their own employees. </para><para>At the moment, each sport has its own policy on hearing cases and applying sanctions. This often leads to inconsistencies—or at least the perception of inconsistencies—in findings and places an enormous amount of pressure on the time and resources of sporting organisations, not to mention the huge public pressure and media frenzy associated with a high-profile athlete having a positive result. So it is time to begin the implementation of the code and use this opportunity for the establishment of an independent national antidoping tribunal, providing the sporting community with a fantastic opportunity to work proactively towards a more coherent and fair approach covering all sporting organisations.</para><para>Once again, the importance of the Australian Sports Drug Agency—ASDA—is highlighted. With this independent tribunal comes the heightened role of ASDA, which is a world first and a leader in the fight against drugs in sport. The Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in 1990 by the Labor government and is one of our proudest achievements in sports policy. Today, ASDA is the envy of many other sporting nations. The establishment of ASDA occurred at a time when no other country had yet come up with a solution to the rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs, and its model was subsequently used as a template for drug testing bodies around the world. These bodies emulated the success which ASDA had had against the use of drugs from athletes at all levels, regardless of stature. </para><para>ASDA continues to adhere to international best practice in all its antidoping activities. The importance of education and testing programs is more important than ever if we are to maintain our excellent record in keeping sport free of drugs. Unfortunately, ASDA, which operates independently very effectively, is being hampered through a continuing reduction in funding from the government. ASDA funding from this government has been declining since 1998, with forward estimates indicating the proportion of government funding as opposed to fee for service funding will have decreased from 78 per cent in 1998-99 to 67 per cent in 2003-04, effectively forcing ASDA to be increasingly dependent on fee for service funding.</para><para>Government funded tests from the period 1989-90 to 2001-02 have decreased from 85 per cent of tests down to only 56 per cent of tests. The rest are covered by user pays. What should be occurring is not a replacement of government funded tests by user pays tests but a trend towards increasing the number of tests conducted. If the government are committed to getting tough on drugs then, Minister Kemp, I am afraid you are going to have to show me the money. The budget is a little too far away, though, so it has to be soon if you are going to preserve your credibility or the credibility of the government in their commitment to being tough on drugs in sport. Given the rhetorical commitment of this government to get tough on drugs in sport, how can we take them seriously when ASDA does not even have a commitment to maintain their current levels of research and testing in the next financial year?</para><para>The coalition have again and again emphasised the importance of their tough on drugs stance, which was reiterated at the Our Sporting Future forum held last week in Melbourne, opened by Minister Kemp. I commend the Australian Sports Commission for convening such an excellent professional development opportunity for national sporting organisation officers and sport and recreation departments to come together to discuss a broad range of issues related to all levels of participation and better governance of national sporting organisations. The minister, however, while stressing the importance and growing relevance of grassroots participatory sports seems to have forgotten the damage that the coalition has done to Active Australia—the key government body charged through the Sports Commission with development of grassroots and community sporting links—through a reduction in their budget. Is it any wonder that we are left doubting just how high the fight against drugs is on the coalition's agenda? Nonetheless, the progress made at the World Anti-Doping Agency meeting augurs well for a positive future, so let us hope the coalition do their bit in this regard.</para><para>Regretfully, I have to finish on a negative note. Once again I find myself compelled to defend the role and work of ASDA in the face of another inappropriate attack by the deputy chair of the Australian Sports Commission. Alan Jones has previously used his position as a talkback radio host to carve up ASDA in defence of Warne and other athletes. Instead of criticising the work of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, Mr Jones should be defending our world-class drug testing agency. I said at the time of the Warne controversy that as a senior member of the Sports Commission Board and a prominent figure in Australian sport he has a responsibility to allow due process to occur. I am disappointed that the government have chosen not to publicly admonish Mr Jones for his undermining of ASDA. The government must now put their money where their mouth is and support the pursuit of drug-free sport in Australia. The role of ASDA is crucial to the successful implementation of the code, as is the establishment of an independent national antidoping tribunal.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Flag</title><page.no>9565</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>9565</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I noted with interest and with very strong support the remarks made by my honourable friends Senator Brandis and Senator Mason about Vietnam and Vietnamese links with Australia. Like them, I would like to welcome to the Senate chamber tonight Mrs Jackie Bong-Wright, the President of the Vietnamese American Voters Association; Mr Trung Doan, the President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia; Dr Phuoc Vo, Chairman of the Vietnamese Physicians of the Free World; Mr Henry Dang, Secretary-General of the Buddhist Federation of Australia; and Miss Dang Lan of Vietnamese Community Radio. As honourable senators have heard Senator Brandis say, from the remarks that I made in an adjournment speech earlier this month, I too have a very close interest in the Vietnamese community in Australia. Along with this I have a determination to assist with the process of liberalising life in Vietnam. These aims are entirely consistent with the multicultural emphasis of our society today and, I venture to suggest, consistent with the historical willingness of Australia and Australians to stand up and be counted when the going gets tough, not just in this country but in other countries also. </para></talk.start><para>Tonight is a night to focus on national unity. We are at a difficult moment in our history as the events of today and the debate in this chamber this afternoon demonstrate very clearly. As with national unity, that crucial commodity, so with national symbols: tonight is a night to pay homage to the flag. The Australian flag has been our flag for more than a century. It was a unifying force when it first flew on 3 September 1901. It is still a unifying force a century later in a new millennium. For this reason we must always treat it with respect. Sadly, in recent weeks the flag has been the object of vandalism and desecration. However trying the times, whatever the level of provocation, that act is shameful. In my view, burning the flag is a crime, albeit not an offence that is on the Commonwealth statute. At this crucial time in Australia's history I want to speak about our flag and the duty we owe to ourselves and our country to honour it.</para><para>One of the finest aspects of a liberal democracy such as the one in which we as Australians are fortunate to live is that we tolerate behaviour that in less liberally inclined states would probably get people locked up or worse. We tolerate opponents of our own form of government being gratuitously—not to say grossly—rude about the person who occupies the proud and historic position of symbolic head of our nation. We tolerate political expression of opposition to a vast range of our national symbols, long and dearly held precepts and ancient customs. We do so because not to do so would undermine the very ethos on which our liberal democracy—the heir to ancient European, principally British, tradition—is based.</para><para>But I believe that there are limits to the tolerance that we as a community should afford to expressions of ill will or even plain ignorance. Our flag is precious. It is, with the Crown, the highest symbol of our nation. It is not a political banner. It is not a plaything. It must never be desecrated. It has been suggested elsewhere in another legislature that desecration of the national flag should be made a criminal offence. Specifically this proposal has come forward from your own state, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot. The Western Australian Leader of the Opposition has proposed it.</para><para>Under the legislation that is envisaged, a person who burns, damages or otherwise physically mistreats the flag would be guilty of an offence. Destruction of a flag printed on a T-shirt or poster could also fall within the scope of the envisioned legislation. Without canvassing the merits or otherwise of the envisaged Western Australian legislation, I have to say that the principle of protecting the flag from desecration is sound. In particular, the burning of the flag for political protest purposes is completely deplorable. There have, regrettably, been recent incidents in which such action has been taken, and this is completely unacceptable. I believe that those who show disrespect for the symbols of our nation show disrespect for themselves.</para><para>I share the view of my honourable friend the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs on that front, as I do on many others. The minister recently told a constituent who had written to complain about flag burning:</para><quote><para>Freedom of speech does have boundaries and I am sure that most Australians would find it abhorrent to burn our flag.</para></quote><para>In my view—and in the view I am sure of the overwhelming majority of Australians— the flag should be deeply honoured and flown at every opportunity. On that score I should like the Senate to note that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane—this Labor luminary who is about to run out on his electors a year ahead of being tossed out by them at the 2004 local government elections—does not think that way at all. He thinks it is too much trouble to fly the flag in a special location on a special day. This year, as on previous occasions, Lord Mayor Soorley refused to consider flying the national flag from Brisbane's landmark Story Bridge on Australia Day. He said that he would have had to pay overtime for the bridge crew to put it up and take it down again. He also said that it just was not worth the effort. In the council chamber last month, when the Liberal civic opposition raised the matter of his consistent refusal to scale the heights of visionary policy, he said: </para><quote><para>Whether we fly the flag on the Story Bridge or not, it's not going to have a transforming effect on the City of Brisbane.</para></quote><para>The Flags Act 1953 confirmed our century-old national flag. That was an historic act and not simply because it was an act of this parliament to which Her Majesty the Queen personally assented while on Australian soil.</para><para>At this troubled time for our nation, with the shadow of war across the land, it is a pleasant interlude of duty to note that on Friday we celebrate Harmony Day—another great initiative of this government to celebrate the rich diversity of our country and general goodwill of Australian citizens of whatever background towards each other and the world. My honourable friend the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has been very active in promoting both citizenship and multiculturalism. One of the things the minister has most recently done—and it was done under the flag—is to launch the Australian National Dialogue of Christians, Muslims and Jews.</para><para>He did this in the context of the certain fact that, while our eyes are focused on international events, it is important to bear in mind that national security begins with domestic harmony. When 23 per cent of us were born overseas—and I am among that number—we do indeed have a pluralistic society with few if any peers. And when you add those with at least one parent who was born overseas, that 23 per cent soars to 43 per cent. That is an astonishing figure. It is all the more astonishing for the fact that together we make up a successful, cohesive and multicultural society that is genuinely the envy of the world. We share common values. We share a language. We share a great love for Australia. We are reminded daily of the essential truth of our lives in a great democracy: that there will forever be more that unites us than will ever push us apart.</para><para>One of the things that symbolises the benefits of being Australian is the flag. It flies over this place in a way that quite properly dominates the Canberra skies. And what a magnificent sight that great banner is, atop the huge flagpole over this people's parliament. How could anyone fail to be moved by the sight of it and the inspiration that it brings? Let us always and unfailingly be proud of our flag and honour it.</para><para>There is one group of people at home in Queensland who certainly do all of that and more. I refer to and congratulate the Australian National Flag Association of Queensland. For nearly 20 years ANFA has sought to promote appreciation of the history and significance of our chief national symbol— the Australian flag. Tonight I acknowledge in the Senate the efforts of founder Dr Rupert Goodman AM. He is a great Australian, a Rat of Tobruk and a distinguished author, educator and worker for his community. His appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day honours list in 2001 was well deserved. Unfortunately, Dr Goodman has not been enjoying the best of health recently, but I know that he still takes a very keen interest in matters to do with our flag. Thanks in part to the efforts of Dr Goodman and other dedicated members of the ANFA, this government took the initiative to have 3 September officially proclaimed Australian National Flag Day to commemorate the day in 1901 on which the Australian national flag was first flown.</para><para>Further, the Flags Act has been amended so that our current flag cannot be changed without the prior approval of the Australian people. Dr Goodman has been ably assisted by his wife, Win, and other longstanding members of the ANFA, among them Beth Morrison, Ruth Finnigan and Merv Clarke. Current councillors Austin Wilkins, secretary; Ruth Lines, treasurer; and Michael O'Connor, membership officer, have devoted countless hours to the service of the flag association. I should note that Austin Wilkins also is a volunteer worker for several days a week at the Multiple Sclerosis Society. The person who has been the driving force of the ANFA in the Far North Queensland city of Mackay—Len Hansen, another Rat of Tobruk—is stepping down from his position in the branch this year. He deserves congratulations for decades of dedicated service that he has given. I honour all of these people and all others throughout Queensland and, indeed, throughout our nation who sustain the magnificent, historically valuable and nation-binding symbolism that the Australian national flag provides for all Australians. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Greens Policy</title><page.no>9568</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>9568</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are currently in the middle of a row in New South Wales over the Greens policy on drugs, which has emerged as one of the most controversial issues of this election. When the Greens vote was incredibly low, no-one took any notice. Now that their support is a little higher, people are putting under the spotlight, under greater scrutiny, the loopy policies of the Greens party. I want to spend a bit of time this evening going through these, particularly the ones relating to drugs. Senator Lundy is grinning on the other side. Do you really support the Greens drug policy, Senator? I would really like to hear you support that, after I have gone through exactly what is involved here.</para></talk.start><para>Let us have a look at this. The Greens approach emphasises drug use as a health related rather than law related problem. This diversion from the criminal justice system is advocated when, according to the Greens, `It can justifiably be avoided.' The word `justifiably' here is of interest, and I will be come back to it a bit later. The Greens believe that the regulation of drugs should be moved outside the criminal framework. They believe that most drugs should be more freely available. They believe in allowing a regulated supply of cannabis at appropriate venues. So what do they mean by the terms `justifiably', `regulated' and `appropriate', and who is going to measure the yardstick? I wonder if it is going to be Mr Cohen and Ms Hale, who are the Greens in the New South Wales upper house; or perhaps Senator Nettle and Senator Brown might measure these things in this place.</para><para>In the last election, the Greens had a long list of rather loopy policies in addition to their policies on drugs. The release of caged birds was one of these policies. Bird owners would be very concerned about that. The removal of shark nets was another policy. Swimmers would be a little bit worried about that in the Australian summer. Routine disarming of police was another policy, and seems to be an incredibly loopy one. They go on with a whole lot of other loony ideas that are put forward quite seriously by a party in our democracy, and they really deserve the spotlight. We thought that the Democrats were the fairies at the bottom of the garden! They have nothing on the Greens.</para><para>I will look briefly at some of their other policies before I go back to the drugs policy in greater detail. The Greens propose social security reform which would allow unemployed people to receive pensions without the need to seek work. They are proposing legislating for shorter working weeks but retaining the existing pay structures. This would create an economic disaster. The Greens say that they are committed to the immediate cessation of the use of helicopters for the general detection of drug crops, because they believe it creates—wait for the reasons—a high level of noise pollution, involves potentially low-altitude manoeuvres and creates damage to agricultural crops. If you get the helicopter low, it will damage the wheat. And it will scare the livestock. It would not have anything to do with their supporters perhaps being growers of these crops? That might be the real motivation.</para><para>So we have a party with a number of very unusual ideas. I would like the parents of Australia to think very carefully about the loopy drugs policies. I mentioned a few of the other policies, but let us come back to the drugs policies. The Greens are trying to convince the parents of teenagers in New South Wales and across Australia that the message that it is wrong to do drugs will be heard, when the Greens are advocating selling drugs across the counter. Greens policies equate to not only economic disaster but social disaster. </para><para>I see, though, that the ALP in New South Wales seem to be taking these policies seriously by giving preferences. Where are the ethics of the Labor Party? They are giving preferences to this loopy party in Maitland— my area—and in other marginal seats. Both Mr Brogden and Mr Carr have denounced the Greens drug policy which proposes the controlled availability of heroin, marijuana and other drugs, but despite this denunciation it is Mr Carr who is proposing to give preferences to the Greens. John Brogden has come out and is now treating the Greens—on the basis of this drug policy—as the pariahs they really should be. He said that in no way and in no seat will the Liberal Party preference the Greens. We challenge the Labor Party to do the same, but, no, they will not. They are into grubby deals with the Greens and they will get into bed with a party that is absolutely advocating the use of recreational drugs.</para><para>This should scare the parents of New South Wales witless. If they get enough votes on Saturday, the Greens will work towards the decriminalisation of drugs, leading to the eventual legalisation of cannabis cultivation, and possession for personal use, while monitoring the effects of this—`monitoring', note—in relation to the health of young people. The word `monitoring' seems a relative term. How exactly do the Greens plan to monitor the effects of drugs—cannabis in particular—on young people? So far, they would be monitoring regulated available use of recreational drugs at appropriate venues. There is no word as yet as to how the Greens plan on being this omnipotent force when it comes to drug control in New South Wales. Make no mistake about it: the Greens, in relation to drugs, have a dangerously irresponsible policy.</para><para>Yesterday, the body of a young Newcastle man lay in a morgue after he was found dead in a Sydney hotel. It is believed the man died after the use of the recreational drug called fantasy. Fantasy is one of the drugs the Greens want to make available on the open market, from licensed outlets, to people over the age of 18. I am sure this is a comforting piece of policy for the family of that 35-year-old Newcastle man! If the Greens get the numbers on Saturday, I challenge Senator Brown and Senator Nettle: will you really support the regulation of a drug like fantasy? We are also amazed that the Greens would consider giving free heroin to heroin addicts—another one of their policies. What kind of message would we be sending to our children—that it is okay to take harmful and addictive drugs?</para><para>On Monday this week, the findings of a study by a British team of psychologists were revealed, relating the use of ecstasy to long-lasting brain damage that can in turn lead to depression. The psychologists found that people who had tried ecstasy only a few times had depression levels four times higher than those who had taken a range of other drugs but not ecstasy. This study has suggested that even small doses of ecstasy can destroy brain neurones that produce the chemical messenger serotonin, which is linked to mood.</para><para>There is now a mass of scientific research available pointing to the correlation between excessive drug use and mental illness. Evidence pointing to regular cannabis smoking by teenagers and its links to depression in young adults should surely mean that this drug should be taken very seriously as a danger to public health. This is not a minor issue in the Greens policy—legalisation of marijuana and its free availability is actually at the core of their policy.</para><para>In 2002, a seven-year Australian study of 1,600 teenagers proved that, when young people smoke cannabis, it creates a predisposition towards depression in later life. It was discovered that young women who smoke cannabis are twice as likely as non-smokers to suffer from depression or anxiety if they smoke cannabis on a weekly basis, and eight times more likely if they use it every day. In young men, the trends are similar. Cannabis can trigger more severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia and other psychoses. </para><para>We should be delaying and preventing young people's experiences with drugs, not encouraging them by sending out messages that it is okay in a controlled environment. That is exactly what the Greens are saying. Cannabis cannot be perceived as an innocent drug with no long-term effects. It has far-reaching implications for mental health. In an effort to supposedly minimise harm, the Greens drug policy would dramatically increase harm. I challenge the candidates for the Greens in New South Wales, Mr Cohen and Ms Hale—and Senator Brown and Senator Nettle—to try and justify these totally irresponsible policies that will create enormous harm to our society and particularly to our children. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>9570</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>9570</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— This afternoon Senator Hill introduced a motion into the Senate setting out Iraq's serial defiance of United Nations resolutions and setting out Australia's position regarding a coalition to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. There has been a debate in the chamber on that motion in which many opinions have been expressed, some passionately and some well reasoned. I have little to add to the reasoning in this debate, but, over the period since the United States first drew the world's attention to the danger of leaving Saddam Hussein to continue his possession of weapons of mass destruction, we have heard the expression, both in the community and in this chamber, of various opinions on how this matter should be dealt with. I would like to share a number of observations about these various opinions and comments, particularly with my Labor Senate colleagues. Many of them, unlike their Democrat and Green colleagues, still consider the term `irresponsible' one of insult rather than one of endearment.</para></talk.start><para>Over the last few months, we have seen much public expression of opinion, especially the expression of aversion to war against Iraq. We have seen marches, we have read opinion pieces and we have heard talkback radio. In these expressions of opinion we have seen demonstration with various degrees of civility. In my view, the public expression of opinion—especially the aversion to war—is a hallmark of a civilised and democratic society and is something which we should accept. Australia is certainly one of the foremost civilised and democratic societies in the world today. The important thing is that the expression and nature of this opinion need to be balanced, rational and considered. I have observed much of this expression of opinion. I have received more than 2,000 emails and letters from various people. Most of them express this aversion to war; that is fine. However, if you read through them you see that some of the bases on which they object to war are really quite questionable. One of the pronounced themes that runs through this is anti-Americanism. Anything that America proposes, they are against. Anything that America is concerned about must be a conspiracy for world domination. This anti-Americanism, unfortunately, seems to have also crept into Labor Party thinking.</para><para>For many years in Australia we have enjoyed a bipartisan foreign policy stance, particularly regarding our close relationship with the United States of America, with whom we share many of our values and much of our culture. Yet I can see that the Labor Party has actually been seduced by this unreasoned anti-Americanism. In a lot of the messages I also get the statement made in various forms, `I'm ashamed to be Australian because Australia is following America's example.' I have to say to the people who say this that I am not ashamed of being Australian, because I think that Australia is a great country and that Australian society is a great society. We are a caring and considerate society. We have values which we should be proud of. We treat other people and other nations in the way which we hope they will treat us. That is nothing to be ashamed of.</para><para>The other thing I found extremely strange about all these people who are anti-American is that they have adopted as their totemic hero the French President Chirac. This is the gentleman under whose administration the French tested atomic bombs in the Pacific, regardless of world opinion, at Mururoa Atoll, which France actually does not own— they hold it under colonial power. He is the person who gave the order to blow up the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior</inline>. He is the person who recently shook the hand of and welcomed to a state dinner Mr Robert Mugabe, leader of Zimbabwe, when the rest of the world, particularly his European colleagues, hold Mr Mugabe in abhorrence. President Chirac— together with our own Senator Bob Brown— is a hero of the Saddam Hussein protection association. This is something which I find extremely difficult to understand. </para><para>When a number of senators spoke earlier, they drew a parallel between this war on terrorism—the proposal to disarm Iraq—and Vietnam. It is a very good parallel. Vietnam is a perfect example of where a democratic society loses resolve and direction, pulls back from the task they should have carried out and gives a country away to dictatorship—to one of the most corrupt governments you could find in the world today. However, I believe that the hysterical demand to leave Saddam Hussein alone draws a more relevant parallel with the appeasement era of the late 1930s and the fate of the League of Nations, from whose ashes the United Nations was built.</para><para>The Labor Party is taking a curious position on the question of Iraq. This afternoon, when speaking after Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government, Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition, proposed amending the motion to, amongst other things, insisting that Iraq be disarmed under the authority of the United Nations. The Labor Party's position is that the war on Iraq is both morally and legally wrong—it would be legally wrong without United Nations sanction and it would be morally wrong as well. However, if the United Nations were to vote for a war on Iraq, it would become legal internationally and the Labor Party would be very happy to go along with it, whether it was morally right or not. This is the curious position that the Labor Party has taken. I ask my Labor Party colleagues to really think, as Australian senators, about whether you could actually describe a war as morally wrong and then, if the United Nations sanctions it, carry through with it. The reality is that Saddam Hussein has defied the United Nations for 12 years. There have been 17 resolutions ordering Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations wish that he disarm, yet he has defied them all along. So there is already a perfect legal basis for it. Labor must choose where it stands on this.</para><para>One other argument that one runs across all of this is that there is no proven link between Iraq, al-Qaeda and terrorism. Yet the argument is that, if we go to war against Iraq, we will be in danger of terrorist attack. How can that be? If they are not linked, how can we be at risk? Where would the danger come from? The reality is that, if we leave Saddam Hussein alone, it will enable him to pursue his aim of dominating the Middle East. His ambition is to take over the Arabic-speaking part of Iran, to take away Kuwait and, finally, to destroy Israel. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Entitlements</title><page.no>9571</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>9571</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on the adjournment tonight to speak briefly about the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements, which was released by the government, almost three months late, on 13 February this year. By way of background, this review was an election promise by the government in response to pressure from a wide range of veteran interests who were either dissatisfied with the level of benefits they were receiving or wanting access to new benefits available to others under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</para></talk.start><para>The government, it seems, had three options leading up to the last election: firstly, it could agree to some or all of the claims in the same way it always had—that is, by making a political choice based on which group was most worthy; secondly, it could reject all claims out of hand; or, thirdly, it could buy some time by commissioning a review to examine the relative merits of all of the claims, by which time the election would have been passed, veterans would be satisfied with a large consultative process and life would go on as before, relatively unchanged. So the review was commissioned to stall veterans' demands, but with the stricture that there would be no additional expenditure. As veterans immediately recognised, this was an empty process.</para><para>Three eminent gentlemen were appointed to consult widely, as they did, and to come up with recommendations. The terms of reference were narrowly written but were broadly interpreted by the government to include anything whatsoever affecting veterans. For 15 months every ministerial letter dumped veterans' problems into Justice Clarke's basket. There were several interest groups which drove this government weakness. First, there was the T&amp;PI Federation which, following a change of leadership, began campaigning for an increase in the special rate as they believed it had fallen behind the economic standard enjoyed by the rest of the community. Next there was a wide range of interests who simply wanted access to the gold card and who believed that their contribution to the defence effort was sufficient to justify their claims. These submissions in fact dominated the 3,000 plus who approached the review seeking additional benefits. </para><para>Then there were some who simply wanted their service upgraded, whether it be peacetime or operational service, the goal being access to the VEA. This is stimulated by the act's more beneficial compensation and health care as well as the benefits attached to qualifying service, namely the service pension at age 60 and the gold card. Primary among these groups were those who served in Japan in the British and Commonwealth Occupational Forces, known as BCOF; those ex-service personnel who were present at the sites of the atomic testing program in the early 1950s; veterans from British, Commonwealth and Allied forces resident in Australia; and former members of the Special Air Services.</para><para>Many others made submissions too, including war widows, organisations like Legacy on behalf of disabled children of veterans, civilians and ex-prisoners of war who were held in Korea and Europe. Briefly, the case for each of these groups was difficult, as it would have entailed overturning a longstanding policy of many and successive governments. It is probably fair to say that most of the submissions were based on notions of equity and fairness, which have never been features of this jurisdiction, or perceptions of risk and danger, which are indeed comparative, ill defined and inconsistently applied. Hence the view that I put forward very early that the review was nothing but a stalling device, that any government in power for six years should have known the answers and that overall it would be nothing but a cruel hoax. Predictably, this has been the reaction of most of the veteran community who have made their views known to date.</para><para>In the broad, reactions to the report's recommendations have been subdued. Most of those who made submissions will be disappointed, which was always the government's expectation. In many areas, the committee endorses the policy status quo. There have, however, been some recommendations for enhanced benefits. BCOF personnel have been recommended for qualifying service on the basis of a fresh and retrospective judgment of their history whereby, after 50 years, service in Japan was deemed to satisfy the test of `warlike' and, hence, qualifying service. Fifty years of government assertion that exposure to radiation or any other risk was minimal have been swept away. Likewise, after 40 years of government denial of risk, with only some new evidence and without a cancer and mortality study being completed, hazardous service under the VEA for ex-service personnel who were at atomic testing sites has been recommended—the first time ever for peacetime service. This is indeed a major precedent.</para><para>War widows too have had their arguments recognised. Ex-prisoners of war who were held in Korea succeeded in making their case too, but through the same flawed approach of impossible comparisons of privation. Ex-prisoners of war in Europe during World War II miss out on the $25,000 grant previously made only to ex-POWs who were held in Japan. Finally, there are some who served after World War II who benefit from a retrospective assessment of facts in having their operational service recommended for upgrade to allow the benefits of qualifying service to flow. All other arguments, however, were rejected by the review committee.</para><para>First among those rejected were those who wanted the gold card. The committee recommended against the extension of the gold card to any other group and went further, recommending that it be means tested. Effectively, this was an objection to the government's rationale for the most recent extension to those over 70 with qualifying service, regardless of need. Naturally, the government rejected that recommendation, as it was inconsistent with current policy. The most dissatisfied group was the TPIs, who saw their claim for an increase to the special rate unceremoniously dumped. Instead, the committee recommended the complete restructure of T&amp;PI benefits in line with a fresh approach to policy which separates the non-economic aspect of the special rate—that is, compensation for pain and suffering—from the economic aspects, which are essentially income support for being unable to work. </para><para>As I have said, the origins of this review were, I am afraid, a stunt. From a policy point of view, there is very little of note, except for the dramatic changes recommended to the structure of the special rate. With respect to the many submissions seeking access to qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the report seeks to establish a new framework against which any particular deployment can be assessed, following an in-depth analysis of the judgment of the courts in the Thompson case. The `incurred danger' rule flowing from this case was criticised, and recommendations were made to amend it to make greater provision for perceptions of danger. Notwithstanding the difficulties arising from the Thompson case, it is doubtful that the committee's recommendations will improve things at all—in fact, the criteria may become even more vague. The likelihood is that a fresh flow of reconsiderations will be sought by those previously rejected, in which case the government is unlikely to accept the recommendation.</para><para>As I have mentioned in the Senate before, retrospective assessments of past service against new impressions of risk and danger are difficult, as they lead to further perceptions of anomalies. As we can see in this report and in its predecessor by Justice Mohr, such judgements made on the facts against new criteria or changed values are not convincing. In the case of both the Mohr and Clarke reports, it has been said that the standard of qualifying service has been diluted. As referred to by Clarke, the Department of Defence is critically aware of this mess and is now in the final stages of drawing up a new matrix of criteria against which future and contemporary assessments of risk can be made for the purposes of the ministerial declaration of `warlike' and `non-warlike'.</para><para>This is long overdue, and it is interesting to note that Defence sees this as its responsibility, going to conditions of service, -rather than one for the Repatriation Commission, which is severely criticised in the Clarke report for its management of qualifying service in the past. With the consideration of numerous peacetime activities claimed to be as dangerous as those required for qualifying service, the committee takes the same approach but is not convincing in its assessment. In fact, it is quite contradictory. Many ex-service people will simply disagree with the distinction drawn in favour of some and against many other peacetime exercises. Again, the government could have predicted this dissension before it started.</para><para>The only other policy issue of note, as mentioned, concerns the special rate <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> of compensation for those unable to work due to the nature of their war related injury or illness. I have spoken to the T&amp;PI Federation on this matter and detailed my views in a recent newsletter to the veteran community, so I will not go into detail here. Suffice it to say that, while the new policy formula is very rational and has some attractive features, it simply will not work. Basically, the Clarke committee model sets additional income for TPIs against a new benchmark of 75 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, MTAWE, plus other attractive benefits, but at the cost of their post-65 compensation and pension, which drops dramatically against the existing arrangements. As the new scheme is optional for all existing TPIs over 50, there will few takers. The trade-off, which for a single veteran with qualifying service is a rise of $111 before 65 but a reduction of $295 after 65, is not very attractive, to say the least.</para><para>In a nutshell, the proposal is dead and the T&amp;PI Federation have clearly said so. They have now put the government on notice of continuing protest, including a national rally here at Parliament House on June 16. This is to some extent a pity, because there are some attractive features in Clarke's proposal both in policy terms and in the interests of veterans and their families. The model addresses full square the complaint that the special rate does not provide enough for modern families, prevents partners from working and is in fact a poverty trap with few incentives to escape. </para><para>Most importantly, the distinction between economic and non-economic compensation leads directly to the other important recommendation that the latter be exempt from the means test at Centrelink. This is a proposal that has been put to the Senate by way of amendments to the Social Security Act on a number of occasions already. We can only hope that the government might at least accept this as good policy, as we have on this side, and agree to the amendments as a matter of priority.</para><para>In conclusion, the Clarke report has been a predictable disappointment for veterans and is backfiring on the government, as it deserves to. It was always a cynical exercise. It is difficult to see what the government can do simply because, despite its own stricture about neutral cost, the committee has made numerous recommendations entailing hundreds of millions of dollars. Predictably the government will select a few spending proposals with the maximum of spin and then consign the report to history. If it ignores them again, veterans can confirm their conclusion that on veterans' affairs the Howard government is not fair dinkum.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title><page.no>9574</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>9574</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is quite ironic that I rise on this issue today, which is of course a very sad and dark day for all Australians. As a nation we face a war against Iraq outside the authority of the United Nations Security Council. This, I would suggest, is morally wrong. Mr Howard's war will make Australia less secure from terror rather than more secure. It is with this inconceivable notion in mind that I rise to speak tonight on not only the fear of the consequences of this war but also the certainty that it will overshadow the plight of the families and victims of the Bali bombings that occurred last year on 12 October. The Prime Minister in his efforts to convince Australians that Australia should go to war has taken the opportunity to exploit the tragedy in Bali. Mr Howard said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We lost 88 Australians in Bali because of the wilful act of international terrorism, and we all had to grapple with that.</para></quote><para>Despite this, he has presented no evidence to link al-Qaeda with Iraq, and the terrorist attacks on America and in Bali have not been in any way linked to Iraq. Yet the Prime Minister persists.</para><para>Adelaide magistrate, Mr Brian Deegan, the father of Bali bomb victim Josh Deegan, commented that linking the war against Iraq with the Bali tragedy was cynical and that linking the war against Iraq with the Bali bombing to justify an invasion on Iraq was wrong. Mr Deegan has been actively lobbying the federal government to do more for the victims and co-victims of the Bali bombing. In his efforts to gain compensation for the victims he met with the Hon. Alexander Downer and amongst the topics discussed was compensation for the Bali victims. Apparently this issue fell on deaf ears. It has been asserted that the Hon. Alexander Downer refused to consider compensation.</para><para>Currently no compensation scheme exists at the federal level. The Commonwealth says that this is a matter for the states. However, the federal government is failing to encourage a sense of equality for Australian victims between the states and territories. It is evident that the Prime Minister has taken the moral high ground when referring to the victims of the Bali bombings but has failed to take the same moral high ground by providing compensation to these victims and their families. John Howard's moral conundrums do not end there.</para><para>The Howard government has provided $10 million to assist United Nation's agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare for a humanitarian relief operative in Iraq. The purpose of this money is to provide contingency planning to address possible humanitarian concerns of the Iraqi people. The Howard government is not yielding that its foreign policy is directly putting Australians at risk. Therefore, as an extension of this and to keep with a sense of moral consistency, compensation should be provided federally for Australian victims of terrorist attacks. Compensation should be provided for the victims of the Bali bombings. </para><para>In 1985 Australia, along with over 150 other countries, endorsed a United Nations resolution in favour of the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. Article 12 states:</para><quote><para>When compensation is not fully available from the offender or other sources, States should endeavour to provide financial compensation to:</para><para>(a) Victims who have sustained significant bodily injury or impairment of physical or mental health as a result of serious crimes;</para><para>(b) The family, in particular dependants of persons who have died or become physically or mentally incapacitated as a result of such victimization.</para></quote><para>Article 13 encourages `the establishment, strengthening and expansion of national funds for compensation to victims'. Since the mid-1980s the states and territories have been left with the task of giving effect to the UN declaration. In 1993 however, Australia's attorneys-general, including the federal Attorney, endorsed a national charter on victims' rights which acknowledges that where `compensation is not available from the offender the victim of crime involving sexual or other personal violence should have recourse to a criminal injuries compensation scheme provided by the state'. It is in this context that `state' means any self-governing group of people, such as a sovereign power like the Commonwealth as well as our states and territories.</para><para>The US federal government used its legislative power to force states to compensate their citizens who are injured or killed by a terrorist attack while visiting a foreign country. The US federal government also provided up to 40 per cent of the funds for state based criminal injuries compensation schemes.</para><para>In its interim report of 1980 titled <inline font-style="italic">Sentencing of federal offenders</inline>, the Australian Law Reform Commission commented on the establishment of a federal criminal injuries compensation scheme for victims of Commonwealth offences. Despite this report, the federal government has failed to provide support to the victims of the Bali bombings. Had this recommendation been pursued, we can only speculate what the implications would have been now that the federal government has enacted legislation to punish in Australian courts the perpetrators of murder overseas.</para><para>The Bali bombings were disastrous occurrences which affected civilians. The victims of this tragedy suffered horrific injuries—a large percentage have lost both legs and suffered significant burns to their bodies. With these injuries there will be ongoing costs and major medical costs for the rest of the victims' lives. The South Australian government have taken a commendable stance on this front by becoming the first state in Australia to offer compensation to the South Australian victims of the Bali bombings—tragic incidents which occurred outside the state borders. The South Australian Attorney-General's Department has invited South Australian victims of the Bali bombings to claim compensation from the state's victims of crime fund. This followed a decision after the federal government failed to provide compensation to the victims and to the families of the 88 Australians killed in the Bali bombings.</para><para>Under the state's Criminal Injuries Compensation Act, payments can range from $1,000 to $50,000. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Act was repealed on 1 January 2003, and the Victims of Crime Act came into operation. This new act has the same provision for ex gratia payments which are payable from the victims of crime fund. At least now, through the benevolence of the South Australian government, those injured in the Bali bombings might be entitled to some recompense for the pain and suffering they have endured, and their immediate families to some recompense for their grief. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> To track down and even declare war on those who supposedly would terrorise the Australian people will not at the end of the day be of assistance to the victims of terrorism and other victims of crime. As a result of the announcement made today, my prayers go to the Australian troops in the gulf and to the many innocent adults and children living in Iraq. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Military Involvement in Iraq</title><page.no>9576</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9576</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to speak for 20 minutes in the adjournment debate.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—As a result of the actions of the Prime Minister today, this country now faces grim times, and I am concerned for the families whose loved ones are now at risk. As I have said in this place before, for centuries leaders have committed young men and women to fight for noble causes on their behalf. Leaders have said such wars are inevitable, necessary or just. And sometimes war is all of those things, but not in this case. Unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is neither necessary nor just. The Prime Minister argues that such action is in Australia's national interest. It is not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Tomorrow I will address the outrage the Howard government has dragged this country into, but tonight I want to go to the actual and potential impact this conflict will have on regional economies in the short to medium term. It is clear that a by-product of the impending war is the current enthusiasm of the Bush administration to further pursue bilateral trade negotiations with Australia. I say `current' because these negotiations are not scheduled for conclusion until the end of next year. I think we will have outlived our political usefulness well before then. The clear linkage between our commitment to a war and these negotiations is a dangerous and explicit connection between Australia's security and trade policies.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—It is not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—The government now seeks to deny that linkage, as does Senator Macdonald, but there is evidence there for all to see. Let me use the words of the foreign minister, Mr Downer, in a speech entitled, `The Strategic Importance of a Free Trade Agreement to Australia-United States Relations'. The speech was delivered in Canberra on 29 August last year. Mr Downer said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>An FTA would fulfil extensive commercial as well as long term strategic interests for Australia.</para></quote><para>Those are his words. So keen is President Bush for Mr Howard's unqualified support for a war with Iraq he has even managed to quieten the US beef lobby, if reports in today's press are to be believed. There is little doubt that the US beef lobby is aggressively opposed to any changes to the current quota arrangements. There is even less doubt that opposition from US beef producers is muted due to the impending conflict. It is difficult to see how this silence will last for another 21 months. At best it will last until the end of the conflict.</para><para>Senators would recall the question I asked of Senator Hill about what this country might offer up as part of these trade negotiations. Specifically, I asked him about claims by Mr Truss that Australia's quarantine system and our single desk for wheat were not up for grabs. I asked whether he was aware of advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on 13 February:</para><quote><para>The government's consistent position in relation to the FTA negotiations with the United States has been that no sector or issue would be excluded from the scope of the FTA negotiations.</para></quote><para>I asked:</para><quote><para>Given these completely contradictory statements, who is telling the truth on this matter—the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry?</para></quote><para>Senator Hill told the Senate that, as he understood the situation:</para><quote><para>... no sector has been explicitly excluded. However, we have interests that we would obviously wish to preserve during the negotiations. </para></quote><para>That means we are going to put our quarantine standards and export marketing arrangements on the table as part of these negotiations and then argue to take them off. The United States now has our quarantine system firmly in its sights. The Bush administration's special trade representative, Mr Robert Zoellick, wrote to the US Senate on 14 November last year. He said:</para><quote><para>We recognize that an FTA with Australia is of particular interest and concern to the U.S. agriculture community. Making progress on a number of issues of concern to U.S. agriculture will be essential for the successful conclusion of these negotiations. </para></quote><para>Mr Zoellick specifically identified our quarantine system as a target, again saying:</para><quote><para>... several US agriculture interests have raised serious concerns about Australia's use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as a means of restricting trade.</para></quote><para>The clear intention of the United States in relation to our quarantine regime is there to be seen. However, the final position of Australia's trade negotiators on this key issue is not. I am concerned, and a number of major rural industries are also concerned, that, while the principle might be preserved, the integrity of the process built around the principle will not. </para><para>I told the Senate recently that I had been advised that the government is placing pressure on Biosecurity Australia to release a draft import risk assessment for uncooked chicken meat to fit in with the trade negotiations with the United States. No-one rushed to this chamber to correct me so I think I can fairly assume that my advice was correct. This means that the government is prepared to set deadlines for key import risk assessments based not on a considered and proper scientific process but based on a political imperative. Most of us have an understanding of the threat to our domestic industries from introduced diseases. Australia is free from many of the diseases that afflict our international competitors. Taking shortcuts in an import risk assessment process is a dangerous move that may risk our disease-free status and put at risk billions of dollars in production, hundreds of thousands of rural and regional jobs and a trade advantage once lost never recovered.</para><para>As I told the Senate, I understand that the informal discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and industry representatives have raised the outcome of a number of import risk assessment processes. In particular, import risk assessments concerning chicken meat, pig meat and citrus have been identified as matters that may be of interest to the US free trade negotiators. Any attempt to collapse the current process will compromise it. Again, it is clear that, from the government's point of view, a free trade agreement between Australia and the United States is this nation's key trade focus. It is also clear that there is now a confusion of economic and strategic motives and doublespeak from Howard government ministers about these free trade negotiations. This confusion of objectives is creating considerable uncertainty and concern, particularly within rural communities. This uncertainty and concern is, may I say, well placed. It is becoming increasingly likely that, if the government is able to negotiate an agreement, Australian farmers could pay for any gains.</para><para>We do not have to look beyond the recently released report by the respected economic consultant ACIL. The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Free trade agreements: a bridge too far</inline>, finds the economic impact of a US free trade agreement on Australian farmers is likely to be negative. This would especially be the case if domestic political considerations in the United States prevent genuine free trade in key industries such as sugar, dairy and meat.</para><para>I repeat my earlier point that the pre-conflict US enthusiasm for Australian interests is just that: pre-conflict. The ACIL report says that even modest gains for agriculture will require the US administration to unwind the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act—that is, the farm bill. It further finds that difficulties in negotiating agriculture with the United States, leading to the exclusion of Australia's farmers from any FTA, would damage our credibility about being serious on agricultural free trade—that is, our position in the very important Doha negotiations would be compromised.</para><para>The report also cites possible friction with Japan and China, saying a free trade deal could hurt beef and wool exports to those key markets. The Senate should be aware that, for the financial year 2000-01, Australian beef exports to Japan were valued at $1.3 billion, while China bought about $1.3 billion worth of Australian wool from Australian growers in the same year.</para><para>The WTO Doha Round negotiations have faded into the background as the Howard government has turned its full attention to the proposed free trade agreement with the United States. So skewed has the Howard government's focus become that the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, has signalled that he has just about given up on success through the WTO. According to Mr Vaile: </para><quote><para>... we cannot discount the possibility that the WTO round will not deliver a result—in agriculture, or in any other sector for that matter.</para></quote><para>In Labor's view, the Doha Round should be the focus for the government's efforts. This round will be crucial for Australian exporters, particularly exporters of agricultural commodities. My colleague in the other place Dr Craig Emerson has made it clear that we on this side of the chamber believe Australia should put the World Trade Organisation negotiations first. If the government gives up on Doha, as Mr Vaile suggests it will, Australian farmers will pay the price.</para><para>Senators from rural and regional Australia and those with an interest in trade will know that Iraq has been a key market for Australian wheat for many years. It has been a major market for our wheat. Today, the United Nations announced that it had suspended its oil for food program, halting our wheat exports to Iraq. This aid program has been the vehicle through which Australia has been exporting wheat to this country, and the contract is worth around $800 million a year to growers. AWB Ltd now have two shiploads of wheat stranded in the Persian Gulf.</para><para>I note a story on the ABC at lunchtime today about increasing problems for exporters seeking to gain access to the Middle East. Ships are facing more precarious waters and massive insurance cost increases. As a consequence, shipping costs have also jumped dramatically. There is now an additional problem because of the introduction of what is called `the US manifest rule'. According to the United States, this rule has been introduced because of an increased threat of terrorism. It has slowed the movement of containers, reduced cash flow and increased costs. It is clear that the American led war has blocked Australian farmers' access to Iraq. I note the optimism of AWB Ltd that the suspension will be short lived, but I am afraid I do not share that optimism. My concern—and it clearly is a concern of AWB Ltd chief executive, Mr Lindberg—is that in a postwar Iraq our share of grain exports will be further cut because of US led aid programs. So far, the Howard government has done nothing to protect Australian farmers from such consequences of this unnecessary conflict.</para><para>Comments from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Ian Macfarlane, on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program last weekend are enlightening indeed. It is important to remember that Mr Macfarlane is a former president of the Grains Council of Australia. Before entering politics formally, he was active in agripolitics for many years, and I suspect he knows the grain industry well. Mr MacFarlane told the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program:</para><quote><para>When we went with the Americans into Vietnam, while they stole our wheat markets in different parts of the world, they did exactly the same thing in the Middle East when we went into conflicts with them there.</para></quote><para>So there is form for you. That is the view of a senior Howard cabinet minister about our past experiences with the United States at times of conflict. And I fear history will repeat itself when it comes to postwar Iraq.</para><para>We are about to be swamped by 24-hour saturation coverage of a war in which we should not be involved. There will be no coverage, I suspect, of key domestic issues, such as the ongoing plight of farmers and rural communities battling against the worst drought in 100 years. The lack of any media coverage does not mean the worst drought in 100 years has gone away. While many areas have enjoyed rain, many others have not, and the prospects for many farm families will deteriorate rapidly without rain by the middle of this year. The confused mix of drought assistance packages announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has actually compounded the anxiety that comes with drought.</para><para>The exceptional circumstances program has become a dog's breakfast. We have urban areas in and rural areas out; rainfall deficiency test results varying from a one in 25-year phenomenon to a one in 20-year phenomenon; some farmers subject to full EC criteria, including rainfall deficiency and income; and some with special tests of their own. It is not fair for some farmers to be denied full exceptional circumstances relief for no reason beyond the exercise of the prerogative by Minister Truss on any given day. Nor is it fair that some farmers are discouraged from applying for assistance because they cannot understand the rules. Income support to all those areas picked up by the 9 December drought package is scheduled to end on 9 May, just six weeks away. That package covered large areas of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia and all of New South Wales. Without a successful application for exceptional circumstances funding, the income support in these areas will be turned off. So much forMr Truss's claim about the government being in it for the long term and the importance of the recovery phase. </para><para>It is our view that Australian farmers are going to be hit hard by this conflict. They will either lose access to key markets in the Middle East or face prohibitive costs in accessing those markets in the short term. They will also face problems in the medium term, as the US may give its domestic industries priority in the provision of aid into a postwar Iraq. The government's obsession with negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States is unlikely to deliver any real gains for Australian farmers, and the downgrading of the multilateral Doha Round by Mr Vaile will inevitably compound losses with any losses caused by Australian concessions made under the free trade agreement.</para><para>Finally, it is clear that the drought and the recovery from that drought where good rains have been received are off the Howard government's priority list. The announcement at the recent ABARE Outlook Conference of a summit to be held by Mr Truss some time in the future says it all. The Howard government may see the drought as yesterday's issue, but the Labor Party does not. This government has given up on drought and, as with the Howard war, farmers will carry much of the burden.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.16 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>9580</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Quarantine: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title><page.no>9580</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 798)</subtitle><id.no>798</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9580</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 15 October 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) staff directly involved in the procedures of X-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage were posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002.</para><para>(2)	How many AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of X-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage were posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para><para>(3)	How many passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002.</para><para>(4)	How many passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para><para>(5)	What percentage of passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined of by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2002; (b) July 2002; (c) August 2002; and (d) September 2002.</para><para>(6)	What percentage of passengers had their luggage X-rayed or otherwise examined of by officers of AQIS at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of the following months: (a) June 2001; (b) July 2001; (c) August 2001; and (d) September 2001.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9580</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The number of AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of x-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of June, July, August and September 2002 was 314 per week.  </para><para>(2)	The number of AQIS staff directly involved in the procedures of x-raying and otherwise examining passenger luggage posted at Kingsford Smith Airport during each week of June, July, August and September 2001 was:

If the decision is made to list bumblebees as a key threatening process, a Threat Abatement Plan may be put into place if it is proven to be “a feasible, effective and efficient way” to abate the threatening process. I am aware of two independent studies on the impact of bumblebees in Tasmania and the results of these studies will be taken into account by the Committee in its assessment.

No record has been found of a State or local government `total fire ban' being issued for the period of concern.  However, Total Fire Bans do not preclude use of LDTA.  One fire ignited within LDTA and was extinguished on 14 January.  This fire re-ignited on 15 January and was contained and extinguished well within the boundaries of the training area.  No further fires occurred during subsequent practice bombing.</para><para>	(a)	The cause of the fire is not known though it may have been due to one of the practice bombs (containing no explosive ordnance) released during the initial USN flights. </para><para>	(b)	Minimal.

No active sonar testing was conducted, apart from routine ship systems operational checks.</para><para>(3)	Yes. </para><para>	(a)	Royal Australian Navy (RAN) vessels conduct Daily Systems Operability Tests of all onboard systems, which include a check of sonar system functionality.  Such tests are conducted in accordance with promulgated mitigation procedures.  RAN vessels occasionally participate in Defence active sonar testing and trials sponsored by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) or the Defence Material Organisation.  These trials include investigations of new sonar systems for possible Defence acquisition, and performance/upgrade investigations of existing ship systems. All such trials and experiments are assessed through an Environmental Clearance Certificate, to ensure that any potential environmental impacts are minimised in accordance with the Defence Environmental Policy.  Where sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the level of environmental impact, the activity is referred to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for consideration under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.   The RAN does not operate, nor does it have any intention to operate, any low frequency active (LFA) sonar systems such as the SURTASS LFA tested by the US Navy in the North Pacific.</para><para>	(b)	DSTO has an active program of research into whale distribution and the impact of noise from human activities, including the use of military active sonar, on marine animals.  Current Defence research expenditure on this matter amounts to more than $2 million over the next three years, and involves extensive collaboration with universities, museums and whale research organisations in Australia.</para><para>(4)	Yes.  The results of research into effects of underwater noise on the marine environment are widely published and freely available.
