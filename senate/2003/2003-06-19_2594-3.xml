The Act establishes a system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect health, safety and the environment and to provide for registration of certain persons proposing to introduce industrial chemicals.</para><para>The proposed changes relate to the commercial evaluation permit system and company registration.</para><para>The commercial evaluation permit system allows the chemical industry to introduce new and innovative industrial chemicals to Australia, for the purpose of commercial evaluation. The provisions under the Act allowing this faster and less costly pathway to introduce new chemicals were first introduced in 1992. </para><para>The commercial evaluation permit allows companies to introduce new industrial chemicals at a specified volume and over a defined time. Companies provide information about the chemical and the commercial evaluation process to the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS). NICNAS conducts a health and environmental risk assessment and establishes conditions for safe use of the chemical under the permit. The NICNAS Director can refuse to grant a permit if not convinced that the volumes are needed for commercial evaluation. In addition, there are penalties for companies that contravene the permit conditions. </para><para>The change to the commercial evaluation permit system is to increase the volume of chemical from the current maximum of 2000 kilograms to a new maximum of 4000 kilograms, to be introduced over the existing maximum time period of two years. A volume change was considered following informal representation from chemical companies, and formal representation from industry members of the NICNAS Industry Government Consultative Committee to NICNAS in July 1999. The chemical industry maintained that the volume limit of 2000 kilograms was too low and that not all industry sectors could access this fast track mechanism to bring in new and innovative chemicals. The alternative mechanisms under NICNAS have longer assessment times and fees and require more industry resources and chemical data. Consequently, Australia was missing out on some new and innovative chemicals and technology. </para><para>The NICNAS Industry Government Consultative Committee endorsed reform of the category to meet the changing needs of the chemical industry, starting with a survey of industry practices concerning the use of the commercial evaluation permit system. A strong prerequisite for the reform was that worker and public health and environmental standards were not to be compromised. </para><para>The survey of industry practices confirmed that an increase in the volume of chemical available under the commercial evaluation permit was needed, with twenty-eight percent (28%) of those surveyed indicating that the current maximum of 2000 kilograms is too low to complete the process of commercial evaluation. NICNAS analysed the data and concluded that an increase in volume under permit to a maximum of 4000 kilograms would enable industry to access this permit in most circumstances. </para><para>In moving to the higher volume, there are additional responsibilities for NICNAS and industry in maintaining community standards for chemicals introduction. Applicants are to provide a summary of health and environmental effects of the chemical for NICNAS to use in the risk assessment. NICNAS is to upgrade its guidance on the use of the commercial evaluation permit system. In addition, it is introducing a raft of administrative changes to help ensure that companies understand and comply with permit conditions, including the requirement that they report back to NICNAS on any adverse effects experienced during the commercial evaluation, and the success or otherwise of the commercial evaluation process. NICNAS is to compile this information and provide feedback to the public.</para><para>These changes are not expected to lead to a change in the NICNAS assessment fee.</para><para>The changes made to the company registration provisions in the Act were developed in response to an independent review conducted in 2000 in relation to the company registration program. These aim to streamline administration, deliver reform and enhance regulatory compliance.</para><para>One area of change relates to the renewal of registration, with the aim of encouraging timely renewals. The company registration year runs from 1 September to 31 August in the following year. Currently a registered company has to renew its registration with NICNAS by 1 August, 30 days before the registration actually expires. Since the inception of the company registration scheme in 1997, the compliance rate with this renewal date has been persistently low (around 50% each year), and this is despite vast administrative improvements to enable a smoother renewal process. Furthermore, an average of 10 per cent of the registrants failed to renew by the start of the new registration year. NICNAS has had to allocate significant resources to pursue outstanding renewals, and this has added substantially to compliance costs. Although an urgent handling fee is in place, it is not mandatory and cannot be used as a means to encourage compliance.</para><para>One reason for the large number of late renewals is the renewal deadline itself. Feedback shows that an early renewal date has caused confusion among industry. Companies cannot understand a renewal deadline which precedes expiry of registration by a month, since most other licences and registrations have up until the expiry date for renewal. The second reason is that some companies take the view that payment will only take place on final demand knowing NICNAS cannot apply late fees under the Act. </para><para>To address these issues, this bill will align the deadline for the renewal of registration with the expiry date of registration, i.e. 31 August. The bill will also abolish the urgent handling fee and put in place a late renewal penalty for renewals received after this date. Any compliance costs in pursuing late renewals will be shifted to the late registrants.</para><para>If a company has not renewed its registration by 31 August for the following year, its registration lapses until the application fee, the registration charge for renewal and the late renewal penalty have been paid, whereupon the registration is deemed to have been re-instated from the beginning of the registration year. A company runs the risk of committing an offence if it introduces relevant industrial chemicals without a registration being in force, and where charges have been laid against the company for such an offence, the company is precluded from paying the applicable fees and charges to retrospectively re-instate its registration to avoid the offence.</para><para>Parallel to these changes, the bill also specifies 31 August as the date by which a registered company has to notify NICNAS if, for any reason, it is not renewing its registration for the next registration year. Currently no deadline is specified for such notification, and when a renewal is not received by 31 August, NICNAS cannot tell if the renewal is late or registration is no longer required.</para><para>Measures are taken to ensure the late renewal penalty is viable. This bill stipulates that if a company is registered for one year and seeks registration in the following year, that registration in the following year is treated as a renewal and not as a new registration. This is to prevent companies from using new registrations to avoid the late renewal penalty when their renewals are late.</para><para>The other area of change relates to the fee setting mechanism for company registration. Currently company registration fees and charges are prescribed in the Act. This is an exception rather than a rule as all other NICNAS fees and charges are placed in regulations. This has resulted in an inflexible fee system which cannot readily respond to cost recovery needs. This bill moves company registration fees and charges out of the Act. They will become part of the regulations and will allow for the application of consumer price indexation. Any changes to fees and charges will require due consultation and Ministerial approval.</para><para>In summary, the changes proposed in this bill are aimed at streamlining administration and delivering reform to the NICNAS scheme. The change in maximum chemical volume allowable under the commercial evaluation permit will enable the faster introduction of new and innovative chemicals and technology, while retaining safeguards to protect human health and the environment. The combined measures taken for company registration will encourage timely renewals and strengthen regulatory compliance. They will improve the collection of cost recovery revenues for the health and safety and environmental regulation of industrial chemicals in Australia.</para><para>âââââ</para><para>AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</para><para>The purpose of the Amendment Bill is to facilitate the integration of two major cultural agencies in accordance with the Government's announcement in the 2003-04 Budget. Following recommendations from the review of cultural agencies within the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio, the Government has decided that ScreenSound Australiaâthe National Screen and Sound Archive and the Australian Film Commission (AFC), should be integrated into a single statutory agency.</para><para>In taking this decision the Government has taken into account the implications for the cultural objectives of the agencies, the need for appropriate governance arrangements and relationships with key stakeholders. Accordingly, the Government considers that integrating the AFC and ScreenSound Australia, a current program of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, will provide real benefits and opportunities for both organisations.</para><para>The AFC is the Commonwealth's primary agency for supporting film, television and interactive media production and distribution and their creators. The AFC also supports activities and events that provide the wider Australian community, including regional Australians, with access to Australian audiovisual product. ScreenSound Australia is the national institution responsible for preserving, documenting and interpreting the Australian experience in audiovisual media. </para><para>The proposed amendments will, for the first time, give clear recognition in Commonwealth legislation to the important work of collecting and preserving the nation's sound and visual heritage. Specifically, the amendments will articulate a broader cultural role for the AFC by conferring on it express functions and powers in relation to the development, maintenance and exhibition of a collection of film and/or sound recordings, supporting documentation such as scripts and artefacts such as original film posters.</para><para>This bill amends the Australian Film Commission Act 1975 to enable the transfer of administrative responsibility for ScreenSound Australia to the AFC. It will ensure that the AFC has the functions and powers that will enable it to properly manage, maintain and exhibit the national screen and sound collection and it facilitates the transfer of relevant Commonwealth assets, liabilities, contractual rights and obligations, and records to the AFC. ScreenSound Australia staff are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1999. To ensure no disadvantage to staff, the bill also provides the AFC with the power to employ staff under the Public Service Act. This bill establishes a Chief Executive Officer position within the AFC to support these arrangements.</para><para>The synergies created by combining the resources of ScreenSound Australia and the AFC will expand the scope and focus of national screen culture activities and enhance co-ordination. Links between Australian audiovisual heritage resources and the broader sound, film and television industry will be improved as will educational and exhibition activities. Combining ScreenSound's extensive collection of screen and sound material with the AFC's ability to support national exhibition programs will ensure that more Australians than ever, particularly in regional areas, are able to enjoy the unique audiovisual resources in ScreenSound's collection. The combined agency will therefore be in a stronger position to provide national leadership in enhancing access to, and understanding of, audiovisual culture.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate on the Australian Film Commission Amendment Bill 2003 be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>11944</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>11944</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reports</title><page.no>11944</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>11944</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPursuant to order and at the request of the chairs of the respective committees, I present reports from all legislation committees except the Economics Legislation Committee and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in respect of 2003-04 budget estimates, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of all proceedings and documents presented to committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the reports be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROTECTING THE LOW PAID) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11944</page.no><id.no>R1743</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee</title><page.no>11944</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>11944</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, Senator Tierney, I present the report of the committee on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11945</page.no><id.no>R1763</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11945</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 18 June.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that government amendments (10) to (12) on sheet RA231 be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11945</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCould I ask that the government outlines again the amendments we are dealing with?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11945</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese amendments that I moved yesterday relate to the role of prescribed authorities. It was stated that it was unnecessary to prescribe three-year terms for the prescribed authorities because of the sunset clause. The provision that required that ministers keep a list of those persons who had consented to being appointed as prescribed authorities and that outlined the procedure for removing a person's name from that list is to be removed as a result of these amendments. This is because such an administratively complex scheme is inappropriate for legislation that will cease to have effect in three years. Finally, the provision that sets out how prescribed authorities are to be remunerated is unnecessary because the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 will provide a basis for ensuring that a person acting as either an issuing or prescribed authority under the bill will be appropriately remunerated. These provisions are really somewhat mechanical due to the effect of the sunset clause. That was basically the reason for government amendments (10) to (12).</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>11945</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe minister might enlighten us as to how many of these prescribed authorities, the faceless judgesâor ex-judgesâas we established yesterday, there are in Australia.

The other issue is that this applies to both former judges and to current judges. That needs to be spelt out.

Has there been a survey of the judges who would be prepared to take part in such a process? I suspect not all of them would be prepared to do that.

To my knowledge, we have had no reaction from the judiciary or from former judges saying that they are not going to serve or that they are not willing to serve. I am aware of no such reaction. I think it is inappropriate to survey people before you have legislation in place. It is certainly not something that we have done in the past and I do not see it as appropriate in this case. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>11946</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me reinterpret that: not one judge in the country has indicated to the government that they are prepared to serve in this processânot one. That is very interesting indeed. It is interesting also that no assessment has been made and presumably there has been no approach to the judges, `fraternal and sisternal', to see whether anybody out there is prepared to take part in this process. I will say this because it is logical: you will have a body of judges who are the pool from which will be drawn those who are prepared, in a faceless and secret capacity, to watch over a process which removes the rights of innocent Australians. Innocent Australians do not end up in courts but in this case they will end up in this secret star chamber and they will be interrogated by unqualified ASIO officers, in terms of the law, without their legal representatives being present under many of the circumstances in which this legislation can be applied. The judges who do not like this dramatic removal of the rights of citizens will not take part in the process and they will be eliminated, but those who believe that it is okay will be left on the list. They are the very people who will not ensure that the rights of citizens are protected from, to quote what the minister said yesterday, `cruel and unusual treatment' under this procedure. They are going to be the ones who are self-selected into this process. Do you see what I mean? It is a very dangerous process. There is no requirement here that judges will take part in this activity or that they will sit in turn, rostered, at the bench because there is no bench there. Judges who do not mind presiding over a secret arena where people's rights are suspended will be self-selected. They will become the ones who function as the prescribed authority. It is a process which is invidious to say the least.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>11946</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am compelled to comment, and particularly for the record, that if Senator Brown is saying that the judges who are more willing to participate in this exercise are those who are more likely to transgress or not protect the rights of the individual, and those who do not want to participate are more likely to protect the rights of the individual, the government finds that offensive and it is an unfair reflection on the judiciary of this country.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11946</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is exactly what I am saying. Judges are human beings. If the government finds that offensive, it is getting to see why the Greens find this whole process offensive. There are many examples in not too distant history of exactly this process taking place, where the establishment of a police state left some people, a minority of the judiciary, in place simply because they did not mind taking part in police state operations. We of course are talking about no individuals in particular at all. I am saying the process here is corrupt and corrupting, and it reaches right into the judiciary. It is aimed at a process which is going to self-select judges who do not mind what is going on here, who do not mind citizens having their rights and privileges ripped awayâinnocent citizens brought into an interrogation process in secret, with all their protections removed and without even a lawyer there. These are judges who are asked, by the way, to adjudicate on whether this personâthis citizen who has been hauled off the street, who is known to be innocent but whom ASIO wants information out of, and who says, `I want my lawyer'âshould have the lawyer of their choice. </para></talk.start><para>Guess the process. No, do not guess it; we dealt with it yesterday. The process is that this judge who is prepared to take part in the process begins at that stage by hearing evidence as to whether or not the lawyer should be allowed to take part in the process. Evidence from whom? What balance of evidence does this judge get? None at all. He or she simply hears from ASIO as to why this lawyer, who does not know that the process about him or her is taking place, should not be allowed into the secret court to defend this innocent Australian citizen. The lawyer gets knocked out by this faceless judgeâit is his or her decisionâhearing one side of the story only. No defence is allowed.</para><para>Should a lawyer be brought inâshould the judge say, `Notwithstanding ASIO's objections, this lawyer is allowed to appear'âthe first thing they are going to say is: `Why has my client been brought in here off the street? She or he is innocent.' What happens then? Under this government and Labor Party legislation, the lawyer is refused the right to have that information. You cannot be told why this citizen has been arrested under this Liberal-Labor legislation. What a repugnant situation this is. The minister might say he is offended by my implication that this process will self-select judges. It does not call in a cross-section of judges and it does not roster them; it self-selects. That is an offensive part of this offensive legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11947</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to say something on this issue of the prescribed authority because I do think it is an important issue which warrants some comments before these provisions are voted upon by the committee. The prescribed authority does play a crucial role in the questioning regime because, of course, they are the person before whom questioning must take place. The prescribed authority supervises the questioning and can give a wide range of directions to manage the process.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition is pleased that, despite the bluster of last December from the government about our model for the prescribed authority being unworkable and unconstitutional, the government has now accepted the model. The government wanted lower-level legal officers to supervise questioning. The opposition has insisted upon that regime being supervised by former or current judgesâthat is, by experienced judicial experts who are independent of ASIO, independent of the government of the day and not vulnerable to political pressure or prime ministerial displeasure. I would commend to the committee the arguments that were presented by Mr Bret Walker SC on behalf of the Law Council of Australia. Mr Walker arguedâcorrectly, in my viewâthat the prescribed authority `must not become engaged on anything which sees them lining up with the institution which is doing the questioning'. He likened the role to that of a chaperone. He said:</para><quote><para>... as I understand the role of a chaperone, it is not to run interference on things but, by their simple presence and by the nature of the person, to perhaps instil a sense of propriety that might not otherwise happen ... The idea is that if you have got a respectable retired judge ... then the chances of the security services misbehaving are hugely reduced, I would have thought. People do tend to behave better when they are in the presence of people whom they cannot control. </para></quote><para>I think the evidence also of Dr Stephen Donaghue is worth remembering as we deal with these provisions about the prescribed authority. Dr Donaghue argued, like the Law Council, that a judge would be most suitable in this role. I would like to quote him. He said:</para><quote><para>The questioning is not being conducted by the prescribed authority ... it is being supervised by them. It seems to be desirable to have someone acting in that position who would ... make sure that the process takes place appropriately ... I would submit that a sitting Supreme Court judge, or a retired judge of any court, is less likely to be in a position to be pressured by the executive in the way that they exercise that function than an AAT member, who is likely to have had a less distinguished legal career and is likely to be dependent ... it is a ... safeguard in my view. There are certainly a great many Supreme Court judges or retired judges who would exercise that function very vigorously.</para></quote><para>I think the question raised by Senator Brown in relation to the numbers of available judges or retired judges to fulfil the role of the prescribed authority is an important one. I, too, am disappointed that that information cannot be provided to the committee. After all, it is now some time since the good sense of having a senior judicial officerâthat argument that was presented by the oppositionâwas accepted by the government. I think it is reasonable for that information to be provided and I am disappointed that it is not able to be provided as the committee deals with these provisions.</para><para>Using a retired judge as a prescribed authority was well received by agencies. It was well received by lawyers and community groups who appeared before the Senate inquiry. I note that the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Richardson, said that he thought using retired judges was well aligned to the current bill. But I thought the point he made that he was supportive of whatever model instilled the greatest community confidence in the regime is also a very important point. I am glad he said that. I am sure other senators would share that sentiment. I think the question of ensuring community confidence in these provisions and new powers is very important.</para><para>The opposition is pleased that the government has accepted the model for the prescribed authority that the opposition has argued for for a very long timeâa model that, I might say, was pressed by this Senate, insisted on by this Senate, as the most appropriate model for the prescribed authority. It is essential that we have a high level of judicial officer being present as the prescribed authority. I do not believe the original proposal of the government, that this responsibility be handed to magistrates or AAT members willy-nilly, would have instilled an adequate level of community confidence. It is such an important role that these changes, in the view of the opposition, are essential.

The point I have been making here is that you cannot have a judge presiding over a situation which strips away the time-honoured rights of citizens brought before a court which, for the first time that I know of, is a court where innocents will be effectively interrogated and tried, with their rights suspended and without legal advice. You cannot have that situation and expect, even in the words of Mr Bret Walker of the Law Council, that the prescribed authority, the judge, must not line up with those doing the interrogation.</para></talk.start><para>The judge is going to have no alternative because this law is going to state that he or she is taking part in a process where the citizen brought before them has their rights suspended in terms of legal representation and a good many other things. They do not have the right to have been charged first; they do not have the right to bring any witnesses in self-defenceâextraordinary circumstances. So under those circumstances, any judge, retired or otherwise, who appears in this process is part of a corrupting process as far as our belief in a citizen's rights under the open law of the Commonwealth of Australia. </para><para>According to Senator Faulkner, Dr Donaghue has said that it is important that the prescribed authority be a person like a judge so that they make sure the procedures take place appropriately. Well, they cannot. The very essence of this law is that it is inappropriate if you judge it against the fundamental rights of citizens of Australia. Those rights are removed. The appropriateness of these proceedings falls down at the outset. A prescribed authority judge who takes part in that process is going to be taking part in a process which is totally inappropriate compared to what we know and what we value in our usual courts of law and judicial proceedings.</para><para>We get into the area of humbug here, saying, `Getting judges involved is going to make this okay.' It is going to do nothing of the sort. As I said earlier, it will be self-selecting. There will be judges who find this legislation so repugnant that they will not take part in this process. They are the very people who would be most likely to do what they could to defend the interests of an innocent Australian caught up in this process. The judges who do take part in the process and who are even going to be keen on it will be less likely to see a citizen who is brought into that secret chamber for interrogation as having a need for their rights to be looked after.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>11949</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrat amendments (R1) and (R3) on sheet 2923:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(R1)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 9 (after line 34), after paragraph (3)(a), insert:</para></quote><para>	(ab)	that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence; and</para><quote><para>(R3)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 12 (line 21), at the end of subsection (1), add:</para></quote><para>	; and (d)	the issuing authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence.</para><para>The amendments relate to what we argue is the most serious of our range of objections to the legislationâspecifically, the issue of suspects versus non-suspectsâand they underpin our strongest underlying objection to the legislation. In its present form the bill enables the detention and questioning of any individual citizenâany Australianâwhether or not they are suspected of involvement in terrorism. That means that if there is a chance that someone has some information that is useful to ASIO, that person can be detained against their will for interrogation. As we know, there is no right to silence and only a limited right to legal representation. If you do not have the information ASIO is looking for, you will have to prove itâthe same kind of double negative we have seen, interestingly, with looking for weapons of mass destruction. If ASIO does not believe you, it can keep you locked up for at least a week and can continue to interrogate you, and all under the ongoing threat of five years in prison for not cooperating in those circumstances. </para><para>This bill will enable the detention of teachers who have had terrorist suspects in their classrooms. It will enable the detention of journalists who have been investigating terrorist offences, people who happen to live next door to a terrorist suspect, or even 16-year-old students who are researching terrorism for school projects. As many have previously noted, this legislation goes much further than that in comparable jurisdictions, particularly the United States, the UK and Canada. It is worth noting, of course, that in those three countries there exists a bill of rights. I seriously doubt whether legislation of this nature within Australia could do what it proposes to do if we had a bill of rights in this country. We Democrats believe that the government must be vigilant in protecting the security of Australians but at the same time it must ensure that antiterrorism measures are properly targeted, and in our view the bill does not do that. Antiterrorism measures should be aimed at terrorists, not law-abiding citizens. </para><para>It is worth noting, too, that several members of the Labor Party have spoken very strongly on this very point. In his speech in the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, Mr Melham said:</para><quote><para>Terrorist suspects must be identified, hunted down and arrestedâbut only terrorist suspects. Labor is determined to protect law-abiding Australians from grievous infringements of their rights.</para></quote><para>Ms Tanya Plibersek echoed that, observing that in her view the legislation:</para><quote><para>... still ignores the fundamental principle that in Australia we do not drag non-suspects in off the street for questioning. Remember that these people are not people who are suspected of crimes; they are people who are suspected of knowing something that might help ASIO.</para></quote><para>Regrettably, the Labor opposition does not seem as concerned about this fundamental point now as it did previously, now that the deal has been struck with the government to pass the legislation. I regret that principle appears to have been sacrificed for politics in this case. Even at this 11th hour, I urge the ALP to hold to its previously espoused principles by supporting these amendments. The legislation ought not apply to non-suspects.

That is something which may be applicable in the criminal jurisdiction but, when you are dealing with security, you need to gather intelligence. That can often come from sources who are not suspects but who are associated with suspects in some form or another. You might be dealing with someone who might even have a relationship with a suspect and you need to get that information from the person. You need to ask them questions about what they are doing, because this is an intelligence-gathering exerciseâa very serious exerciseâin gaining intelligence, which goes to the heart of national security. We have said that throughout this debate and we have made that absolutely clear in the legislation that we have put forward and in relation to other legislation which has been passed with regard to counter-terrorism measures.</para></talk.start><para>We are about prevention as well as detection. Of course, you can only prevent if you have the necessary intelligence. Security operates on information, on intelligence. Therefore, it is very important that ASIO has the ability to question people who might be able to give information as to another person's activities. Certainly, if you go to that person concerned, you might not get anywhere in any event with them but, importantly, the mere fact that they are being questioned might raise the alarm in other sectors which are involved in the threat which you are investigating. It is just a fact of dealing with national security that intelligence is essential. In trying to gather that intelligence, you need to be able to question people who are not necessarily suspects. We recognised the issues that brings with it and we have built in safeguards, as we have gone over at length in relation to this debate. We do not resile from the seriousness of this legislation in many respects. It touches on the rights of individuals and the security of the nationâyou can really get nothing more serious than that. But we do say that if ASIO are to have the tools they need to do the job in serving the security interests of this country they need the ability to question people who are not necessarily suspectsâpeople who could well be able to give them information which they might not realise is necessarily important but nonetheless is very important to our intelligence agencies. On that basis, the government cannot support these amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11951</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do oppose these amendments and I do so on principle. There really is a very important principle involved here. I do not believe that ASIO should become a secret police force. The Labor Party has never believed that and I would hope this parliament would never accept amendments that would move that agency in that direction. That is, of course, the impact of these amendments that we are considering. I am sure that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens would be dead against making ASIO a secret police force. The truth is, if these amendments were to be carried, we would have taken a bigger step towards that eventualityâmaking ASIO a secret police forceâthan almost anything else the government has suggested from the earliest days of March last year.</para></talk.start><para>I accept that the intention of these amendments is good. I absolutely accept that they are well motivated. But, despite what I think are the best of intentions, the amendments will not make this regime safer for the community or our democracy. In fact, they would confuse the role of ASIO and make ASIO take a very police-like approach to any information it receives about terrorist activity. It would confuse the roles of and the relationship between ASIO and the Australian Federal Police. It is essential that we in this committee understand the different roles of ASIO and the AFP. Police handle criminal matters and are part of the criminal justice system whereas ASIO deals with intelligence and does not collect information for the purposes of prosecutions or law enforcement.</para><para>This bill is not about obtaining prosecutions; that may happen through other processes. This bill is aboutâand, indeed, what ASIO should be about, specifically in relation to this billâcollecting intelligence to ensure public safety from terrorists. If these amendments were to become law, ASIO would have to undertake what is squarely a policing function. They would have to compile evidence and determine if someone was a suspect before they could request the issue of a questioning warrant. That initial assessment is the job of police professionals, not intelligence officers. The fact is that the person being questioned may not even know the quality or the significance of the information that they possess. That is what we are dealing with.</para><para>The amendments would mean that ASIO could not question people who may know some critical information but are not necessarily suspects. That is the issue and that is the problem with the amendments. But having said that, it is also true to say, with any piece of legislation like this that deals with suspects and non-suspectsâat least in the case of adults; those over the age of 18 yearsâthat, because it might deal with non-suspects and because non-suspects may be questioned by ASIO, you have to ensure there are more than adequate safeguards and protections in place. I absolutely accept that principle, and that is certainly what the Senate and the Committee of the Whole have tried to achieve. But I think that when we look at all these amendments we have an absolute responsibility not to turn ASIO into a secret police force. That would be the worst possible outcome. I do not say that is an intended consequence of the amendments before the chair. I accept the good intention of the amendments and I accept the good motivation of the amendments but it is absolutely essential that this parliament always has uppermost in its mind the distinction that I am drawing. For those reasons the opposition would never countenance passing such amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>11952</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat a parcel of poppycock! Let me reverse the patronising that comes out of what Senator Faulkner just said, the well-meaning but pie-eyed nonsense coming from the Labor Party, which has got into bed with the government on this legislation. Senator Faulkner says, `The police are there to arrest terrorists and terrorist suspects; this legislation is about dealing with those citizens who are non-suspects.' Please tell that to somebody else. If you follow the logic of what Senator Faulkner is saying, then we have a piece of legislation here which turns ASIO into a force which is able to arrest and the logic is that you would end up with a force that is able to arrest and question only people who are not suspected of doing anything. That, to me, is the ultimate definition of a secret police force, with a police state being brought in. With this legislation there is no blurring. There is a seamless transition here which allows ASIO to question both those who are considered to be planning terrorist attacks and those who have nothing whatever to do with it who innocently happen to have some information. That is the whole problem with this legislation. That is why these amendments from the Democrats and Senator Nettle's amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens are so essential. They are trying to curb ASIO from the open slather which is enabled under this legislation for them to go and arrest people whom they think might have information.</para></talk.start><para>Let me get back to basics. This wonderful country of ours is not a police state, and there is nothing to prevent ASIO from going up to people and saying, `Look, we think you might have some information. Would you please give us that information?' and the average AustralianâI am certainly in this categoryâis going to say, `Yes, I would.' ASIO can do that any day of the week, and anybody else can go and gather information from people by asking them. No, that is not what this legislation is about. This legislation is about those people who say no or who it is thought might say no or who might tell others that they have been questioned by an ASIO operative. This is very much about coercing people who are suspected of not being willing to give information into giving up that information. That is where the problem is.</para><para>The government and the Labor Party say it is all right to get innocent people in and have them put into this secret court with their rights removed and extract information from them on the basis that if they do not give it they will go to jail for up to five years. We are saying that if you have people who are engaging in terrorist activities that may well be okay, but when it comes to innocent Australians if you are going to put them in that process give them their legal rights. Labor says take away their legal rights, the government says take away their legal rights and, moreover, both parties say, `Let us remove this whole process out of the public domain and put it into a secret court system.' Senator Faulkner says, `Labor's arguing here that the police are there to deal with criminals. Basically, the thrust of this very law is to get at non-suspects'âinnocent peopleâso he sees the thrust of this law as having secret courts for innocent Australians. What an extraordinary inversion of everything I thought Labor stood for! I can certainly understand the Howard government heading in this directionâit always has doneâbut when Labor gets in the saddle with it you have to wonder what the role of this parliament of ours is in defending people where this abrogation of their rights is concerned. </para><para>It is a very fancy concoction that Senator Faulkner came up with: let us have this secret police system, effectively, deal with innocent Australiansânon-suspects. When he thinks about that he will realise that he has in fact outlined what is so wrong with this process. There is no line drawn here. There is nothing in this legislation which says ASIO can only get a warrant out on citizens under suspicion if this work has been done. It allows ASIO to get a warrant out on people who are non-suspects who may have information. They are not suspected of doing anything wrong; they have information which might be to do with other people who potentially are doing the wrong thing. It is very precious indeed of the Labor Party to join with the government to say, `The Greens and the Democrats have got it wrong,' and that they want to protect those innocent citizens. The very thrust of this legislation is to grab those innocent citizens of Australia, remove their rights and put them into this secret court system. Tell that to somebody else.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11953</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese amendments and the following amendment by the Greens really do go to the core and the heart of what is wrong and what is rotten about this legislation. This legislation is far more draconian than what we have seen in other Western democracies. It is the sort of legislation that the CIA and MI5 would love to be able to enact, because this legislation deals with giving ASIO the power to lock upâfor a weekâinnocent people. That is something that MI5 and the CIA would love to be able to do, but their governments, George W. Bush and Tony Blair, have said, `No, that is not acceptable; we're not prepared to let those civil liberties go.' But the Howard government and the Australian Labor Party have said, `No worries; bring it on. Innocent peopleâlock them up, we don't care, that's okay.'</para></talk.start><para>That is not the sort of Australia that we want to be living in. That is not the sort of Australia that the Greens think is acceptable, and that is not the sort of Australia that I believe the majority of Australians want to be a part of. That is not the free and democratic society that people have fought world wars for and that people have argued for long and hard in the streets, campaigning for civil rights, liberties and political freedoms in this country. It is not to allow innocent citizens to be locked up and interrogated by ASIO for a week that those people for decades, for centuries even, in this country have been fighting for their freedoms and their democracies here. These amendments are the very core of this legislation, and of what is fundamentally wrong with the secret deal done by the government and the Labor PartyâI will not call them the opposition I will call them the Labor Party, because we are not seeing opposition from the Australian Labor Party on this bill. This is a secret deal done by the government and the Labor Party to allow this country to have a secret police force. </para><para>Let us have a look at the international comparisonâthe overseas comparison. Let us have a look at the PATRIOT Act which was introduced into the United States. I would like to read from an article which appeared earlier this week in the <inline font-style="italic">Washington Times</inline>: `PATRIOT Act of 2001 casts wide net'. This is an article that looks at the impact of the PATRIOT Act in the United StatesâGeorge Bush's response to September 11 in terms of antiterrorism legislation. What has been the impact of that legislation since it came in in 2001? The Justice Department in the United States has done a report about the impact of that legislation. The article says:</para><quote><para>Long-sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terrorist provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act were applied in nonterror investigations ...</para></quote><para>What we are seeing hereâand I will expand on thisâis how the PATRIOT Act is being used, not for terrorists but for other people who are caught up in the net of the PATRIOT Act. To put that back in context, let us remember that what we are doing here, what the Labor Party and the government are proposing here, is the putting together of a bill that goes far wider than the PATRIOT Act in being able to bring in, detain and interrogate innocent people. You cannot do that under the PATRIOT Act. But the Labor Party and the government here think that is okay for Australia. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Washington Times</inline> continues:</para><quote><para>Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals even when obtained under extraordinary anti-terrorism powers and information-sharing between intelligence agencies and the FBI.</para></quote><para>Senator Faulkner talks about wanting to ensure that the intention of this legislation is not about securing criminal prosecutions. That is the same argument that we saw in relation to the PATRIOT Act. Two years on, the report by the United States Justice Department tells us that that is exactly what is happening.</para><para>There are other examples. The Internal Security Act in Malaysia was introduced to allow people to have access to a lawyerâsomething that this government did not do when they introduced this piece of legislationâand the argument put forward at the time was that the Internal Security Act in Malaysia was about armed communist guerrillas. That was the argument put forward by the Malaysian government at the time to say that they needed that internal security legislation. Several years since the introduction of that legislation we are still seeing in Malaysia hundreds of people being detained under this legislationâand they are not armed communist guerrillas. In fact, I do not know of any armed communist guerrillas that have been caught in the Malaysian Internal Security Act. The people who are held now in the prisons of Malaysia under this legislation are the trade unionists, the civil libertarians, the political activists and the student activists who have worked on campaigns here in Australia and are now back in Malaysia. They are the people who have been caught by the Internal Security Act in Malaysia. And now we are hearing that in the United States under the PATRIOT Act exactly the same thing happens.</para><para>It actually does not matter what arguments the government brings up in this parliament now about who they intend to catch with this legislation. The record, the clear facts of what happens with this style of legislation around the world, is that it is not used for those people whom, the government is arguing to us now, it wants to catch. It is not used for the terrorists. This sort of legislation, when introducedâand it does not matter where; it could be Western democracies like the United Statesâis used to catch people far outside the net. It is those people that the Labor Party purports to representâthe trade unionists, the progressive activists and the campaignersâwho get caught up by this style of legislation. In those countries, you cannot lock up innocent people. This government and the Labor Party are proposing to be able to extend that power. We have not seen in overseas comparisons that ability to lock up innocent people. </para><para>Let us go back to what we are seeing in the United States. Key objections are about authorising FBI agents to monitor mosques. We have had a lot of discussion about what is going to be the impact of this particular legislation on the Islamic community. Senator Brown and I have read into the public record several times comments from the Islamic community about how this legislation is going to impact on them. I would like to read some comments from a civil liberties union in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union said:</para><quote><para>It's clear that the problems of 9-11 were the result of not analysing information we had already collected. Creating more hay to search through the haystack is not an effective way to find the needle.</para></quote><para>This is the message from the United States about the problems with the approach that they have taken to gather more information. It does not help us. There is no way that we can say that is how we are going to solve terrorism in this country or that is how we are going to solve terrorism around the world. It is not by bringing together more information and it is not by infringing on the civil liberties and political rights of innocent citizens around the world that we are going to solve terrorism. The Australian Greens have talked on many occasions in this chamber about the need to deal with the root causes of terrorism rather than the symptomsâthat is, poverty and inequality, which this government does not speak up about in the international arena. I will not go into the discussion now, but let us just be reminded that gathering more information from innocent civilians is not what we need to do to get rid of terrorism in this country or anywhere else around the world.</para><para>Some of the objections that are being raised in the United States to the PATRIOT Act are not coming from outspoken civil liberties groups such as I quoted earlier; they are coming from Republican senators who are raising these doubts, these questions and these concerns about the implementation of the PATRIOT Act. They have been some of the strongest voices that have forced the Justice Department review, two years on after the PATRIOT Act, to have a look at who is being impacted on by this legislation. I quote again from the article:</para><quote><para>... recent revelations showed that information gathered under the lawâby secret warrant or compulsory disclosuresâwill be used for nonterrorist prosecutions as well.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>Among other things the DOJ revealed that it obtained 113 secret emergency search or electronic-surveillance authorizations in the year after September 11, compared with 47 in the 23 years before that attack. The law lowered the standard for such intrusions from terrorism being `the purpose' to being only `a significant purpose'.</para></quote><para>Rather than this legislation ensuring that the surveillance and searches were focused on terrorism after September 11âwith that dramatic increase to 113 searches in the year after September 11 compared with 47 in the previous 23 yearsâterrorism has been watered down, from being the main purpose to being just a significant purpose. That is what we are seeing with the impact of the Patriot Act. I think it is important that we remind senators here today that, in relation to the legislation they are proposing to enact in this parliament, the record overseas shows us that it is not being used to catch terrorists. The net is being thrown far wider, and it is the innocent peopleâthe progressive trade unionists and social activistsâwho will get caught up in this legislation. </para><para>One of the things we were talking about yesterday was the fact that this legislation requires the prescribed authority to make determinations based on information provided to them by ASIO. In the United States, only one of the 15 requests to seize material without notifying the owners was refused. I do not know the figuresâperhaps the minister could enlighten usâbut I wonder, when ASIO requests the ability to go in to carry out a search and gather information, how many times the prescribed authority would say, `No, actually I do not think that is appropriate,' when all they have before them is an argument by ASIO? I would be interested to know that information, if the Minister could enlighten us.</para><para>Let us talk a little bit about the community opposition we are seeing to this bill. As I mentioned, we are not seeing that from the so-called opposition in this chamber; instead we are seeing it from the community. I would like to quote from Steve Mark, who is from the International Commission of Jurists (Australian Section), when he appeared on the <inline font-style="italic">Insight</inline> program last week. Amongst the many comments that Mr Mark made on that forum, in describing the legislation he said:</para><quote><para>What this does is allows not only for the `terrorist' or the suspected terrorist to be put in detention to be questioned, not arrested, and that's exactly right and a very important point, these people are not arrested. It's a tenant of English law and Australian law that you are not taken in to be questioned without being arrested or charged. This actually does away with that basic tenant of criminal law and what we end up with is a situation where anybody can be taken in that has nothing to do with the terrorist act and may have information. So we have teachers, nurses, doctors, social workers, members of the community that could actually be taken in because of information they might have.</para></quote><para>That takes us back to what we are dealing with in these particular amendments. Mr Mark also said: </para><quote><para>This legislation cannot be fixed. It must be abolished. The reality is that it deals with individual fundamental freedoms we have and without those freedoms we have a different type of society. It's going too far.</para></quote><para>He continued:</para><quote><para>There is plenty of powers that already exist. I don't think we need legislation at all. What this legislation does is it allows ASIO, as we've heard, a non-accountable body to pick people off the streets, theoretically with the help of the police, and put them incommunicado. Their spouses, children won't know where they are for up to seven days. And even that can be extended.</para></quote><para>That is a change to what the government is proposing now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11956</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf, according to Senator Faulkner, the worst possible outcome of intelligence mechanisms to deal with terrorism were for them to result in legislation that applied only to suspects and not to non-suspects, we would have to argue that the legislation in Canada is the worst possible outcome, we would have to argue that the legislation in Britain is the worst possible outcome and we would have to argue that the legislation in America is the worst possible outcome. If that were the case, you would have to seriously question why every legal organisation and civil liberties group in the country is calling for this parliament to model our legislation on those overseas jurisdictions and not to progress the legislation that we have before us. </para></talk.start><para>If, according to Senator Faulkner, having the legislation apply only to suspects and not to non-suspects is anathema and something that Labor would never support, I question why Mr Melham and Ms Tanya Plibersek, among others on the Labor back bench, have called for the very amendment that I am moving. No, the worst possible outcome would be to introduce legislation that applied to non-suspects in an environment where we did not have a bill or a charter of rights. The worst possible outcome would be arguing this legislation in that vacuum. I argue that the reason the United States, Britain and Canada cannot have the draconian legislation that is before us is that their citizens are protected by a bill of rights. </para><para>The government has confirmed, I believe, that terrorist suspects can be interrogated within the current criminal justice arrangements. Therefore, the main application of this legislation would really be to non-suspects. We are talking about neighbours, journalists, family members, teachers and so on. You would have to ask: why does the government believe that Australians, who clearly are committed to preventing terrorism in our community, would not come forward voluntarily and provide any information they might have to the authorities? If the government proposes to collect intelligence by dragging Australians in off the streets to interrogate them, again, we have to ask why it spent $20 million on a campaign encouraging them to provide information voluntarily. </para><para>If Labor's fear is that the Democrat amendments before us at the moment would see ASIO become a secret police forceâan argument I rejectâthen it stands to reason that the Democrats could rightly expect Labor's support for our amendments to ensure that individuals detained under the act will be protected not only by use immunity but also by derivative use immunity being attached to the information that they provide. That would truly ensure that, with the legislation before us, ASIO would be an intelligence regime and not a secret police regime. Labor's hypocrisy on this is galling. </para><para>By all means, let us have appropriate legislation to deal with terrorism. In his opening remarks, Minister Ellison described elements of my speech to the second reading debate. He said it was `incredulous' that the Democrats would argue that legislation was not warranted. I never said that. My argument all along has been that appropriate legislation is warranted. The particular fundamental flaws of this legislationâmost essentially around its application to non-suspects and the fact that it reverses the onus of proofâensure that it is unacceptable to the Australian Democrats, unacceptable to credible legal organisations, unacceptable to every civil liberties group in the country and unacceptable to those countries that share comparable jurisdictions. No, the worst possible outcome is the legislation we have before us, and one of things we can do to alleviate that is to support the amendments before us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>11957</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to continue to let the Senate know about the community opposition to this legislation that we have heard.

They are the questions I would like to hear answered by the minister and by the Australian Labor Party in particular. Why do they think it is appropriate that we should introduce this tough regime that goes far further than overseas comparisons and that has been shown over decades when it has been introduced overseas to be used on innocent people, not on terrorists?

Firstlyâand these are matters really for the minister to deal withâthe committee may care to examine the detail of the United Kingdom and the Canadian legislation, which set up a regime of offences. But of course the threshold was extremely low. For example, in the United Kingdom it is an offence not to come forward to police with information. That means that, if the United Kingdom police force think you have information but you have not come forward, they can arrest and charge you. </para></talk.start><para>I do think the committee needs to examine whether compulsory questioning regimesâand that is what we have here undoubtedlyâare unprecedented in terms of Australian law. The truth is there are other organisations that can by warrant under current Australian law compel witnesses, not suspects, to provide information. That includes the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the state crime commissions, royal commissions and the National Crime Authorityânow of course the Australian Crime Commission. One of the issues for this parliament is this: why should the parliament give ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the power to compel people to provide information about corporate crime, with safeguards of courseâand I think they are strong safeguardsâand not allow such powers in relation to terrorism? </para><para>That is a threshold issue, a fundamental issue, for us to consider when we look at these enhanced powers for ASIO. I have said and will say again that from the outset the opposition has insisted that with enhanced powers to ASIO there must be key safeguards and adequate protections. That of course includes legal representation, a high-level judicial authority as the prescribed authority, a sunset clause, the provision that nothing a person says can be used against them and very strong review mechanisms in the act. They are the sorts of issues and balances that this parliament and this committee have to deal with.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11959</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHere we see another furphy from Senator Faulkner. I would never doubt Senator Faulkner's understanding or knowledge of ASIC and the various royal commissions and questioning regimes that we have in this country, but it is a complete furphy to compare legislation allowing the questioning of innocent people with what we are seeing here. Please correct me if I am wrong, Minister Ellison, but nowhere in legislation does ASIC or any royal commission have the power to detain people for seven days for an interrogation and questioning regime. Yes, it is true that they can bring innocent people in and ask them questions and, where those people do not want to come in and answer questions, they can compel them to do so. But in no way should that be compared with what we are discussing here: the ability to detain those people and interrogate them for seven days. If Senator Faulkner is suggesting that we should give those powers to ASIC then he needs to put that proposal to the chamber. But, if that is not the case, it is simply not appropriateâand Senator Faulkner knows it is not appropriateâto compare the powers of a royal commission or ASIC with what we are seeing in this legislation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>11960</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are dealing with a secret police operation here, not an operationâas with ASIC and royal commissionsâwhere the full glare of publicity is brought to bear in an open and public democracy.

You do not find that with ASIC and royal commissions. The opposition was going so far on that matter that it took the government and the crossbench to knock out that amendment.

We have covered well enough the reasons for this legislation and I do not wish to repeat what the government have said. But a number of different issues have been raised that need to be addressed, and I will do so briefly. In relation to the question of international precedence, the government reject any assertion that this legislation is out of step with international precedence. What we say is that, in developing this legislation, consideration has been given to provisions in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The UK Terrorism Act 2000, the Canadian Antiterrorism Act 2001 and this bill all provide that a person may be detained and questioned for up to 48 hours. The UK Terrorism Act 2000 also contains a provision to allow for the further detention of persons for up to seven days in some circumstances. That detention is being considered at the moment in the United Kingdom with a view to extending it to 14 days. This bill is all about gathering intelligence, which we have reiterated time and time againâthat is, intelligence that is needed to deter acts of terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>Of course this bill extends to people who are not suspected of being terrorists or of committing a terrorist act but who may have information that is relevant to the security threat that I mentioned earlier. This bill contains more safeguards than laws in other countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada. It contains a detailed warrant procedure that must be followed before a person can be detained and questioned and the procedure requires the agreement of the Attorney-General and a federal judge, federal magistrate or other authority. In other countries, the warrant procedures are very different. In Canada, a person may be detained for 24 hours before a warrant is sought. In the United Kingdom, a police constable may arrest a person suspected of being a terrorist without a warrant. In the US, the PATRIOT Act 2001 provides that a certified alienâthat is, a non-citizenâmay be detained for up to seven days if the Attorney-General certifies that the person endangers national security.  </para><para>The Senate needs to remember that these are provisions in other jurisdictions overseas. In this bill we have a number of safeguards, including the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, which I have gone over at length, the role the prescribed authorities play, and the warrant procedure, which I have mentioned. The government reject totally that, firstly, we have ignored overseas precedent in the drafting of this legislation. Secondly, the government reject that in some way overseas legislation in this area affords a greater protection of civil rights in those countries. I have pointed to some aspects of overseas laws that we would argue are more draconian than this bill.</para><para>I also want to touch on the area of innocent people. I remind the Greens that according to Australian law all people are innocent until proven guiltyâsomething the Greens are conveniently forgetting. They have two categories of people here: an innocent person and then a suspect. If you are going to be correct in this issue, you should acknowledge that everyone in Australia is innocent of any crime or offence until proven guilty. What they are trying to do in a very misrepresentative way is say that there are two classes of people in Australiaâinnocents and suspects. I point to other areas of the law. Senator Faulkner touched on the ASIC legislation, and it was not a bad example. </para><para>I think another example that brings this into focus is the powers of the new Australian Crime Commission, which carried forward the powers of the National Crime Authority that had been in existence for many years in this country. We did not hear a squeak out of the Greens in relation to that. That legislation provided that someone could be brought in for a compulsory examinationâthat is, a compulsory examination that could be designed to gather intelligence in the prosecution of criminal activity. That had, and does have, a sanction. We have increased the sanction to a period of imprisonment of a maximum of five years in jail if you do not cooperate. The Greens might say, `That's different because you don't detain them for seven days.' I will tell you right now that having the threat to be brought in for a compulsory examination and having this threat of five years jail hanging over your head if you do not cooperate is indeed a strong measure. In fact, let us picture the scene where someone does not cooperate and is charged and then arrested and taken into custody with the possibility of being denied bail. The Greens really miss the point by saying that those provisions are simply not relevant.</para><para>Under the former National Crime Authority for many years in this country we have had powers of compulsory examination, not only on a suspect basis but also for the purposes of intelligence gathering. The NCA, and more particularly the Australian Crime Commission, are about gathering intelligence in the prosecution of organised criminals in this country. There is no provision there for a period of detention of seven days for questioning, but I point out that that legislation has some very powerful provisions that relate to someone who does not answerâthey can cop five years jail if they do not answer. If you try to say that you cannot compare thatâand the Greens said that to Senator Faulkner when they said that was a furphyâlet me just say that five years jail if you do not answer a question is no furphy. We have had that in the criminal law for some time and it has operated satisfactorily in this country for many years with strict safeguards and to the good of the community because of the job the NCA did in fighting organised crime and the job the Australian Crime Commission is doing in fighting organised crime. </para><para>What we are about here is deterring terrorism and fighting terrorism. We need the tools to do the business and that is what this is about. However, we also have a balance with that. I reject totally that we are out of step with precedents set overseas or that we are more draconian than the measures overseas. There are differences overseas which the Greens have not pointed to and they choose to ignore our provisions in relation to the criminal law and the point that Senator Faulkner made, and which I am making, in relation to the ACC. </para><para>When the Greens attack this legislation and try to say that it is an attack on innocent people, they have to remember that everyone in this community is innocent until proven guilty. This encompasses an exercise which may be directed at a person suspected of being a terrorist or a person who, although not suspected of being a terrorist, may have essential information which could lead to detecting or deterring terrorism.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>11964</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat an extraordinary intervention that was. The minister said that the Greens and the Democrats are trying to create two classes of peopleâthe innocent and the suspect. The government and the opposition do not want two classes of people; they want all Australians to be suspects. That is what this legislation is about. Every Australian will become a suspect to this faceless ASIO and can potentially be brought before this faceless judge to be interrogated by this unqualified ASIO operative without legal representation. That is the problem. Surely the minister and the Labor Party can see that. That is the definition of a police state; all citizens are suspects. We believe in a democracy where all citizens are innocent and have their rights defended. </para></talk.start><para>To develop the extraordinary admission that that is what the government is about, seeing everybody as suspects, it is clear that the age of fear is here. The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. John Howardâand now the opposition has joined inâsees 20 million Australians as suspects. But to alleviate the need to explain this, because that ends up being impossible in a democracy, the minister cites the extravagances or incursions on freedoms that are occurring in other democracies. Senator Nettle gave a very good exposition as to why we should not be supporting this legislation. What is happening here is a process of leapfrogging. </para><para>Look at what has been happening in similar jurisdictionsâand New Zealand has not been mentioned here. Behind this is a weight of legal representation from our secrecy and intelligence organisations which says, `Look what they've done in Britain.' Forget about the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. They say we should look at what they did in Britain and what they are contemplating. Let us forget that there is a court process in Canada. At least it is in the open there and is not subterranean like this legislation. They say, `If they can do it in court over there, let's make it underground here.' They say we should look at what they are doing to aliens in the United States and that that justifies us going some way towards that for all citizens in Australia. </para><para>I have not heard the opposition advocating the New South Wales arrangement. That is a Labor jurisdiction under the Carr government in New South Wales which has brought in the most extraordinary abrogation of civil rights we have seen in this country yetâthe ability to hold people without a warrant and strip searches which involve children. In some ways that is election fodder. Fear is in the air and politicians can capitalise on fear. The government is now saying here today in defence of this legislation that every citizen should fear that they are a suspect. That is what is written into the minister's words. The government is saying, `Let's go one step further than other comparable democracies elsewhere in the world.' We will leapfrog them and no doubt the intelligence agencies here will immediately signal this to their counterparts in the United States and Britain. They will be saying, `Now we've got away with this and our political representatives in the Australian parliament allowed us to go much further than your legislation, you can justify that when arguing in congress, in the House of Commons or in the legislature in Ottawa for going one step further still.' It is a dangerous process. There are increasing voicesâunfortunately, most of them are extraparliamentaryâagainst what is happening here. That is why we are taking such a strong stand on it here today in Australia. Not only does it affect 20 million Australiansâit is inimical to themâbut it potentially has a flow-on effect internationally, and we are very well aware of that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11965</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet us not forget that, in terms of questioning of detainees by ASIO, the onus of proof is reversed. So, contrary to the claim of the minister that all Australians are innocent until proven guilty, under this legislation you are effectively guilty until proven innocentâor at least guilty until you cannot prove anything, because it is up to the person being questioned to prove that they do not have the information that ASIO says they have. This is much like the bizarre situation where it was up to Saddam Hussein and/or his regime to prove that they did not have the weapons of mass destruction that America and others said they had.</para></talk.start><para>That is one of the key fundamental objections by the Democrats to the legislation. The reversal of the onus of proof is a fundamental undermining and overturning of long-held established legal principles. So it is not true to say that all Australians are innocent until proven guilty because this legislation challenges that. This legislation questions that, and it flips over our legal understanding of citizenry and their being brought before questioning authorities.</para><para>If, as Labor says, we must take steps to ensure that ASIO does not and cannot become a secret police force then it is essential that, amongst other things, the onus of proof for detainees is not reversed. As I understand it, Labor has an amendment to address that, which is commendable. However, as Senator Faulkner made very clear in his speech in the second reading debate on this legislation, if the government were to oppose any opposition amendment that they present in this debate, Labor will not insist on it. So it is another example of the tokenistic response that Labor has to this debate the second time around. It is not the case that Australians are innocent until proven guilty under this legislation.

As we debated the first time around in this legislation, we believe that that foreign national ought to have the right to ensure that their embassy is informed of the fact of their detention. This, we would argue, is consistent with article 36(1) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which deals with a person's right to contact their consular post if arrested, committed to prison or to custody pending trial, or detained in any other way.</para><para>I think it should be acknowledged that article 36 has not been incorporated into domestic law pursuant to the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act like some other articles of the Vienna treaty. However, granting detainees the right to contact their embassy is clearly consistent with the spirit of the Vienna treaty. I draw the attention of senators to the preamble of the Vienna treaty which reminds us that peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents and that the treaty was entered into:</para><quote><para>Having in mind the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nation concerning the sovereign equality of States, the maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of friendly relations among nations ...</para></quote><para>This bill has been touted by the government as an importantâeven essentialâ antiterrorism measure, but the ultimate objective of all antiterrorism measures should be to maintain international peace and security. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, a world in which human rights are respected and protected is a world better equipped to combat the threat of terrorism. </para><para>It is also important for Australia to work together with other countries in its efforts to combat terrorism. As the Vienna treaty recognises, diplomatic missions play an important role in the promotion of friendly relations amongst nations. The international community must take a united approach in dealing with terrorism, and if Australia detains a foreign national for interrogation relating to terrorism it should, we believe, advise the person's embassy of their detention. Australia would expect the same from other countries if Australians were dragged away for interrogation by their intelligence agencies.</para><para>It should be noted that the amendment contains an important limitation to address security concerns, and rightly so. Specifically, if the minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that advising the person's embassy would pose a serious threat to Australia's national security then the obligation to inform the embassy does not apply. That safety mechanism is contained within this amendment, and I commend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11967</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe may be coming to this but, for the record, I ask the government if it is still the case that persons detained under this legislation for the purpose of getting information cannot have the circumstances of their detention identified to their next of kin or some other person?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11967</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is no guarantee that the whereabouts of a person being questioned will be advised to the next of kin.

This is one of the three major changes that the government has proposed. A warrant would now allow a total of 24 hours questioning in eight-hour blocks over a maximum period of seven daysâthat is, 168 hours. There are a number of other changes to the regime. The main ones are, firstly, that the proposed amendment provides for the issue of one warrant allowing for a total of 24 hours questioning only, rather than the existing regime that allows for the possibility of rolling warrants. Secondly, the proposed amendment provides for a questioning regime that allows questioning in eight-hour blocks, rather than each warrant being for a period of 48 hours during which questioning can take place for any period provided it is consistent with questioning protocols.</para><para>While warrants are issued by the issuing authority for a total period of 24 hours, the prescribed authority will control the number of eight-hour blocks during which a person may be questioned under each warrant. Initial questioning under a warrant is for eight hours. This can be extended twice for further blocks of eight hours each, up to a total of 24 hours. Any extension of the questioning period must be permitted by the prescribed authority, who must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that continuing would substantially assist the collection of intelligence and that the persons questioning are conducting the questions appropriately. This permission may be revoked. These are important safeguards. Similar to the current regime, the amendment also contains offence provisions in the event that it is established that authority under a warrant is inappropriately exercised. Those are very careful amendments which go to achieving a balance in relation to this questioning period.</para><para>There is a third aspect of this proposal, and that is that a person cannot be questioned for a total of more than 24 hours. The entire period, however, in which a person can be detained for questioning to occur can extend over a period of no more than seven daysâthat is, 168 hoursâbecause the amendment allows for dead time in questioning blocks. But a person must be released immediately after this period has expired or after the prescribed authority has revoked or not provided permission for the questioning to continue. In effect, this means a person can be detained under one warrant for a total of 168 hours as opposed to the rolling warrants situation which could total 168 hours. This amendment is in addition to existing safeguards in the bill.</para><para>Among other things, the bill provides that at all times questioning would take place before a prescribed authority. Depending on the circumstances, a prescribed authority may be a former judge of a superior court, a current judge of a state or territory supreme or district court, or a president or deputy president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We have gone through that at length but I remind the committee as to the judicial status of the prescribed authority. A person also has the right to complain about their treatment under a warrant to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. There are also offences in the bill for officials who contravene the safeguards. These are important provisions. A number of aspects of the billâfor example, proposed section 34Dâdeal with the time when questioning starts, but no doubt in the ensuing debate we will go through all those details. I commend these amendments to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11971</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is another part of the objectionable legislation relating to people who are known to be innocent but from whom information is wanted. I ask the minister: is there any written impulsion on ASIO or the other intelligence organisations to look at the alternative of simply asking a person whether they have the information or phone number they want? How is that process sorted out before we get into the position where somebody, through police action, is forcibly carted away and held secretly in detention under the provisions of the warrant system we are now dealing with? The minister has outlined that you can be held secretly for a week, questioned intensively by this unqualified interrogator for 24 hours, in three blocks of eight hours or in single blocks of four hours, without a break, without the intervention of your legal representative, and indeed without a legal representative being there at all. Hidden in what the minister has just said is the provision for it to go beyond 168 hoursâthat is, a week.</para></talk.start><para>The next question I put to the minister is: at what stage do ASIO operatives get in the Federal Police to arrest a person?

At the other end of this processâwe will get to the middle, I am sure, in this debateâwhat is the absolute time limit on somebody being questioned if the faceless judge gives permission without regard to their legal rights and in this secret situation?

The absolute time limit for one warrant is 168 hoursâthat is, seven daysâand that cannot be extended. Any other period of questioning or detention would have to be the subject of another warrant. In relation to ASIO simply asking someone whether they can provide a telephone number, that is always open; they can ask people for that information and whether they can be of assistance. Importantly, proposed section 34C(3)(b) states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Minister may, by writing, consent to the making of the request, but only if the Minister is satisfied</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>(b)	that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective ...</para></quote><para>That is an important aspect because we are talking about the requesting of warrants. There firstly has to be satisfaction by the minister that they have not exhausted other methods. I mentioned the ACC earlier. Certainly, before the ACC can use those powers, they have to demonstrate to the board, for instance, that these special powers are the only way to get the information.

Could you spell those out to the committee? By denying my supposition, the minister has actually confirmed it.

On the issue of ministerial discretion, it is stated very clearly in the legislation that the minister must be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. When you are dealing with a ministerial discretion the protocols will not cover that, for a start, and I would argue that, in any event, there is no need for them to, because it has been spelt out fairly clearly that the minister has to be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. The only way you could drill down into further detail is to say to what standard of proof the minister would need to be satisfiedâhow he would be satisfied.</para></talk.start><para>Across the board in Commonwealth legislation, it is not normally spelt out where you have ministerial discretion. In fact, there are many instances of ministerial discretion which do not have that level of detail that we have here, which is spelt out in the legislation itselfâthat the minister has to be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. Senator Brown has raised the issue of why we do not spell out further this discretionâthe criteria for the exercise of it. The government's view is that it is spelt out. What is more, it is in the legislation, not in a protocol, and really you cannot take it much further than what you have already in the legislation. It is much more particularised here than in many other pieces of legislation in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. I am not saying that it should not be particularised. It should be and it has been because of the importance of this, but the onus is then on the minister, and of course the minister is accountable to the parliament. Senator Brown looks as though he will comment on this matter. Whilst he is doing that, I will get the answer to the other question he raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11972</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI certainly will comment on it. This is not usual legislation; this is legislation in which we know that 20 million Australians are suspects, because that is what the argument was just a moment ago, according to the government. Earlier on, the minister was arguing that it was offensive for me to be saying that there are judges and then there are judges; they are not all the same, they are not all beyond reproach. We have a self-selecting situation here in which those judges who are less worried about civil, political and legal rights are less likely to be worried about being involved in this process than those who have an enormous concern for them. Ditto for politicians.</para></talk.start><para>I asked the minister: what are the parameters for determining whether a warrant and the other processes are legitimate? By crikey, you would want to think that every other possible alternative had been looked at and considered, not just by ASIO but also by the minister, in coming to the point where an innocent Australian is secretly carted off the street for seven weeks for interrogation. But the minister says, `There is no protocol; we have established that,' and, I think, is indicating that it is going to be wide open to the ministerâthat is, the government of the dayâto determine who of the 20 million Australian suspects is selected in this process. It is very dangerous. I ask the minister: is the minister of the dayâand we are presumably including future governmentsâabove political bias in making this decision? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>11973</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a couple of issues. The first is if the maximum period of seven days can be extended. As I said, it cannot. A fresh warrant would have to be issued. I think it is important that we remind the committee at this stage of the process of issuing that warrant. Firstly, ASIO must seek the consent of the Attorney-General to apply to an issuing authority for a warrant. In order for that consent to be obtained or granted, the Attorney-General must be satisfied:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(a)	that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant ... will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and</para><para>(b)	that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective ...</para></quote><para>So there are some hurdles there for the Attorney-General to negotiate in agreeing to that application by ASIO. Of course, the bill provides additional safeguards for young people between 16 and 18. A warrant will only be able to be issued in relation to a young person if the Attorney-General is satisfied that they have committed, will commit or are committing a terrorism offence. So there is an additional criterion in relation to those people aged between 16 and 18. The issuing authority may only then issue a warrant if it has been requested in accordance with the proper procedureâthat is, the procedure I have outlined; it goes via the Attorney-Generalâand it is satisfied:</para><quote><para>(a) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that ... the warrant ... will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence ... </para></quote><para>That warrant can relate to the detention of a person in order for them to be questioned, or to request that the person appear before a prescribed authority for questioningâwe have dealt with what the role of the prescribed authority is in relation to the questioning that takes place. But when you look at the issuing process, it is not a streamlined one. It is one where ASIO has to satisfy the Attorney-General, who then consents to the application. It then goes to the issuing authority who, in turn, has to be satisfied.</para><para>If you just had the detention of someone for seven days, by the very nature of that process there would be time taken in satisfying that criteria. If you have had a detention of seven days, I would put it to the committee that there would have to be a gap of some time before a fresh warrant could be obtained. Senator Brown will jump up and say, `What is to stop them from applying during the seven days for a fresh warrant?' I think that would be very difficult because you would have to be satisfied that it was necessary and that the means at the disposal of ASIO, namely the current warrant, was not appropriate and was not able to fulfil their needs. You would not know that until the end of the time of detention. So my strong point here is that the very nature of the procedure of the issuing of the warrant is one which provides that protection. I mentioned ministerial discretion and the question of the minister's discretion being subject to judicial review. That is reviewable, I am advised, under section 39B of the Judiciary Act. So any exercise of discretion by the minister is subject to judicial review, which is an added safeguard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11974</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat we have here is wide ministerial discretion when it comes to civil libertiesâWMD on civil liberties. I go back to a situation which I think will arise during the course of the detention of people under this legislation and I ask the minister how ministerial discretion would work in this circumstance. A person who is thought to be involved in a terrorist organisation or to have information about terrorists and to be in contact with them, wittingly or otherwise, is arrested and detained for questioning under the provisions of this legislation. ASIO submits very strongly that the disappearance of this person will lead to her or his contacts wanting to get in contact with him or her again and that a phone call coming from those contacts is going to lead to the discovery of an actual terrorist plotter. So their mobile phone is being detained with them or indeed they are arrested in their own house with ASIO operatives and the faceless judge there, which is possible under this legislation, and there is an all-important phone call to come which is going to give connection to a terrorist plotter. Under those circumstances, is there not going to be a rolling warrant issued here? Would you, as the person with ministerial discretion, not issue another warrant? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>11974</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen you look at the situation of the issuing of the warrant, what I stated earlier was that the minister has to be satisfied that the warrant will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective. In that exercise of jurisdiction, you would have to have in mind what was going on in relation to the questioning under the current warrant and what progress was being made. As I said earlier, that would prove difficult if you had not reached the conclusion of the questioning, because it does provide for those blocks of questioning and a maximum time for detention. In the exercise of your discretion, you have to go through this afresh and ask if there are other means, and the other means are: have you exhausted the current warrant? Of course you have not because there is still time to go, and it may be that the questioning will still bear the result that ASIO was about. I think it is really pre-empting to a great extent the outcome of the questioning under that current warrant. </para></talk.start><para>The decision of the minister is reviewable and, if a fresh warrant was issued whilst there was one in operation, one would think that the scrutiny of the minister's decision would be all the more intense, because you do have a warrant in place. I cannot pre-empt hypotheticals to the committee. I cannot dictate as to what an outcome would be. I can only say that, under the proposal in the way that it is set down here, there is a detailed process and detailed criteria for the minister and I think that a current warrant in existence makes the exercise of the discretion in fact all the more subject to scrutiny. I think that is as far as I can take it in relation to Senator Brown's question, because I cannot comment on the hypothetical case as to what I would do or not do and what the Attorney-General would do or not do. I think that is as far as I can take it in relation to his question.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11974</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSo there we have it: it may not even be that the questioning of the suspect for their information is what is going to lead to the next warrant; it may simply be that the detention of that person will lead to the flushing out of others. They can answer all the questions but they can still be detained on a series of rolling warrants, one after the other, and there is no limit to that process. The situation will arise where ASIO is going to successfully be able to say to the minister that this is a serious situation, the minister is not in a position to have any independent investigation of the matter and a person could be kept for weeks in secret and out of contact under this legislation because ASIO thought that would, in some way or other, flush out other people. Remember that the person who is being kept can be innocent of the reasons for ASIO holding them. It is not just a matter of who is being questioned; it is a matter of intelligence gathering that utilises a person and the detention of a person to facilitate intelligence gathering. That is wide open under this legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The minister says the ministerial discretion is appealable. Could the minister describe a situation of appeal here: a person being held has come to the end of seven days, ASIO is seeking a fresh warrant and has got that before the minister, the person does not know about it and they do not have any legal advice or if they do their legal advisers do not know why they are being held and they have no knowledge that a new warrant is about to be issued.

This information must be provided when the person is first brought before a prescribed authority and, as I said earlier, at least once in every 24-hour period. That application can be made to either the High Court or the Federal Court. Regarding the time lines, I am not sure how quickly the courts deal with applications these days, but I can take that on notice and try to give you an idea. I know they have duty judges who are available outside normal hours and over the weekend and that affords a person with an urgent application the opportunity to get before a judge very quickly.

Where is the guarantee in this legislation that a person is counselled on their rights and the reasons they have under this legislation to make an appealâthere is no legal adviser thereâand then have the appeal instigated? This is nonsense, just nonsense. The government knows it and the opposition knows it too. We have a situation where people's rights are suspended, including their right to legal advice. It might sound nice for the minister to say, `You can go to the High Court on this.' Can you really? You are held secretly in a place, nobody knows where you are, you have no legal advice and there is a faceless judge there who is not necessarily going to think well of you as a person because you are caught in those circumstances.

There is a range of things that they know, because they have been watching you, that you do not want brought out into the open. People's ability to access the legal system, particularly if they have no legal advice, and their will to do so collapses.

I mentioned that just a moment ago. That is something that is essential. I think I mentioned that it is repeated every 24 hoursâthis right to legal representation. The person says, `Look, I want a lawyer, but I do not know who to get.' The prescribed authority says, `I can get you one.' That lawyer is obtained and the person can then make an application that can be dealt with very quickly by either a High Court or a Federal Court judge.

I want to be clear on that and I am going to deal with this at a later stage. The opposition will be proposing amendments to the 168-hour period. That 168 hours of course starts when the person is brought before a prescribed authority under the warrant. You can call it 168 hours or seven days by another name. As far as the opposition is concerned, that maximum period should be 72 hours, or three days by another name, and I will be moving amendments at a later stage to address that issue.</para></talk.start><para>However, I want to come to the issue that is currently being debated before the committee. I think it is absolutely clearâit is certainly my understandingâthat, in relation to the warrant period, at the conclusion of that warrant period a person is either charged or released. I am not going to make the government's argument for it; I have made it clear. I think the seven-day period is too long. The opposition believes it should be three days. Those amendments currently are not before the committee; they will be at a later stage in this debate. I take it at face value and I have accepted the spirit with which the government has made changes in relation to the detention regimeâthat is, the issue of there being one warrant and not, if you like, rolling warrants, which is being canvassed. I am absolutely clear on this. I do think we have to have this clarified and I suspect we cannot do that at this point in this committee debate but, if we can get it clarified satisfactorily in a positive way, I will be satisfied. I want to take the committee to the conclusions of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in relation to this matter. I want to read a very small amount of that report into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. The committee drew the following conclusions in relation to this key issue of the length of time a person could be detained or questioned: </para><quote><para>2.38	The provision for indefinite detention proposed in the legislation is an issue of some concern. A person who has not been charged with an offence should not be detained for an indefinite period of time.</para><para>2.39	The committee therefore proposes to introduce a maximum limit for detention of 7 days (168 hours). Therefore, a person could not be detained for longer than 7 days under the committee's amendment.</para></quote><para>The committee draws another conclusion, and I will include it for the completeness of the record:</para><quote><para>2.40	In relation to ASIO's powers to seek warrants, ASIO indicated that the Director-General may only seek a warrant `if the Attorney General consents to this.' The EM in relation to proposed subsection 34C(5), states that `if the Director-General is seeking a further warrant in relation to a person who has already been detained under two consecutive warrants, the Director-General must seek the warrant from a Deputy President of the AAT.' It is not explicit that, in seeking a further warrant, the Director-General has first requested the need for a further warrant from the Attorney General. This should be made explicit in the Bill.</para></quote><para>Let me go to recommendation 3 of the committee, which I believeâand I say this in good faithâthe Attorney-General has depended on to come forward with this current provision. The opposition is going to try and amend the current provision from seven days to three days. But the Attorney-General has depended on recommendation 3 from the report of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DST, which says:</para><quote><para>2.41	The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 be amended so that the maximum period of detention of a person is no more than 7 days (168 hours), and at the expiry of that period a person must be charged or released.</para></quote><para>I am satisfied that that is the government's intention, but I do not believe that the explanation the minister has given the committee on this is adequate.

I am totally satisfied that the intention that has been outlined to the committee is not the Attorney's intention.

I think that is a sensible way of dealing with it because it would actually save time for the committee. So I request that of the minister, through the chair. That might be a sensible way of dealing with this. We only have a short time for debate for further committee consideration. I am quite satisfied that this will be able to be sorted out.

Section 34E is aimed at ensuring that a person who is detained is advised of important information as soon as they are brought before the prescribed authority. Amongst these matters the person must be advised of their right to seek a remedy from a court relating to the detention. It does seem strange for there to be an obligation to inform a person of this right without any obligation to inform them that they can access a lawyer to assist them in exercising that right. </para><para>Access to legal advice has been one of the primary issues of concern in relation to the bill. It was an issue that was raised in most of the submissions that came before the committees inquiring into this legislation. The Labor Party has indicated that it would not accept significant restrictions on a person's right to a lawyer, and that has resulted in the government's substantial amendments on the issue. Given the cross-party acceptance that a person's right to a lawyer is imperative in these circumstances, I would hope that the government and the opposition would acknowledge the importance of the person being informed of that right so they are able to exercise it.</para><para>The lack of any obligation to inform a person of her or his right to a lawyer is just another example of how nonsuspects particularly are entitled to less protection after the regime than are suspects under the criminal law. In order to exercise the right to a lawyer it is fundamental, therefore, for a detained person to be aware of that right. The prescribed authority should have an obligation to inform them accordingly. Again, I call on the opposition in particular to support this amendment, an amendment that we moved previously under the first round of this legislation. Indeed, I would argue that it would be inconsistent with Labor's stated position on access to legal advice to oppose this particular amendment. </para><para>Democrat amendment (5) simply seeks to ensure that a person detained for questioning under the act is advised of their right to an interpreter as soon as they are brought before the prescribed authority. In order to exercise that right to an interpreter, it is important that a person is aware of that right similarly for legal representation.</para><para>Finally, Democrat amendment (7) is a minor amendment which addresses one small aspect of the practical arrangements themselves for detention. The amendment seeks to make it clear that a person detained under the act must be provided with facilities to contact a family member or any other person whom they are permitted to contact pursuant to the warrant. In its present form subsection 34F(9) requires that the person must be given access to facilities for contacting the inspector-general or the Ombudsman for the purposes of making a complaint under the bill should they have one. This amendment simply extends that requirement to facilitate contact with other persons specified in the warrant.</para><para>While it is arguable that the obligation to provide facilities for contacting family members is implied by the current terms of the act, this amendment seeks to put that obligation beyond doubt so that there is no ambiguity. The fact that there is an obligation to provide facilities to contact the inspector-general or the Ombudsman but not to contact persons specified in the warrant does raise some doubt about the existence of an implied obligation. Clearly, the right to contact a family member or other people specified in the warrant is pretty meaningless unless the person is actually provided with the facilities that they need in order to make such a contact. We Democrats believe that this should be an expressed obligation rather than an implied one, and that is the content of amendment (7). I encourage senators and the committee to consider Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7), which we believe go some way to enhance the rights of those detained in the detention regime that we are currently giving consideration to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11980</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think Senator Greig does make a strong case in relation to Democrat amendment (4). I think it is an important amendment that has been put forward. It will ensure that a prescribed authority notifies a person being questioned of their right to contact a lawyer of choice.

I think that the effect of the amendment, if it is passed, will be to make section 34U on the involvement of lawyers work more effectively. </para></talk.start><para>Section 34U(1) is dependent on a person knowing that they are entitled to a lawyer. I think the amendment that Senator Greig proposes ensures that a person is told about that entitlement. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is logical. It is a matter that should not be controversial. I think it is a sensible step forward and a sensible safeguard and it will have the support of the opposition. When these questions are put, to facilitate the passage of Democrat amendment (4) I ask that perhaps Senator Greig's amendment (4) be put separately to amendments (5) and (7). </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11981</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government has no problem with Senator Faulkner's suggestion. I will briefly address Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7), as moved by Senator Greig. In relation to the right to a lawyer, I think we have canvassed that enough. We have made it very clear what the government's position is and we do not believe that that needs any amendment. In relation to the right to an interpreter, certainly there is provision for an interpreter. We have agreed that an interpreter will be provided for the person being questioned if necessary. The bill also provides that an interpreter may be provided at the request of the prescribed authority or at the request of the person being questioned, unless the prescribed authority has reasonable grounds to believe that there is no need for an interpreter. The government have made it clear that a person is entitled to an interpreter if one is required and that questioning will cease until the interpreter is present, if the prescribed authority determines that an interpreter should be present. The provision does not exclude the person being questioned from requesting that an interpreter be present.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats' proposal, however, appears to be designed to enable a person to insist on an interpreter as a matter of right, even if it is clear that such a request is simply a delaying tactic. That is the main issue with this amendment. I can understand that the Democrats are concerned about someone having an interpreter, as are the government. We have a provision for that. What we are concerned about is that this proposal by the Democrats could be usurped by someone who wants to demand an interpreter as a right simply as a delaying tactic. We believe that there should be some regulation of that. The prescribed authority certainly should have some say in that. We do not believe that it should be available to a person who, for instance, has a perfect command of the English language. Quite obviously, there is a potential for it to be abused.</para><para>Amendment (7) deals with permissible contacts. The government has already moved an amendment to allow the prescribed authority to give a direction permitting a person to contact an identified person. Such persons include someone who has a particular legal or familial relationship with the person. Again, we believe that this is adequately covered. On that basis, the government would oppose Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7).</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Peter (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cook)</inline>âThe question is that Democrat amendment (4) on sheet 2923 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question now is that Democrat amendments (5) and (7) on sheet 2923 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>11981</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 2953:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 18 (lines 13 and 14), omit the note.</para><para> (5)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 18 (lines 30 and 31), omit the note.</para></quote><para>The right of a person to be presumed innocent of a criminal offence until a court has determined beyond reasonable doubt that the person is guilty of that offence is a basic principle of common law. However, under section 34G of the ASIO bill, as it stands, the person who is being questioned bears an evidential burden to establish that they do not have information relating to a terrorism offence. So, by reversing the onus of proof, the ASIO bill potentially undermines a common-law principle. It is also of concern that these provisions would unduly impact on vulnerable detainees, including those with language difficulties and, for that matter, 16- and 17-year-olds. By removing the requirement for the authorities to build a prima facie case against a detainee and shifting the burden of proof onto the person held in detention, the reverse onus may violate the principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But, given that whatever is said cannot be used against the person themselves, this potential violation is of course diminished. </para><para>Notwithstanding the fact that it is within the ambit of knowledge of the person being questioned to determine whether or not they have information relevant to an investigation, the burden should remain with the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence and the existence of the requisite intention. The amendments that are now before the committee have the effect of amending proposed section 34G to remove the evidential burden placed on the person who is appearing for questioning under the warrant to show that that person does not have the information sought, or possession or control of the relevant record or thing. This is consistent with the Senate committee recommendation. I commend the amendments to the Senate.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11982</page.no><id.no>R1821</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11982</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>11982</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak briefly to the <inline ref="R1821">Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The main purpose of the bill is to change the leadership and governance of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the HIH Royal Commission. I make it clear that the Democrats support the bill. Nevertheless, we believe it requires amendment in a couple of respects, and I will be taking those amendments on the voices later in proceedings.</para></talk.start><para>Every Democrat senator has at one time or another called for an end to jobs for the boys. Wherever appointments are made to the governing organs of public authorities, whether they are institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi-government agencies, the processes by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. One of the main failings of the present system is that there is no empirical evidence to determine whether the public perception of jobs for the boys is correct, as these appointments are not open to sufficient public scrutiny and analysis. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of ministers with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regulating the procedures for the making of appointments. Perhaps most importantly there is no external scrutiny of the procedure and merits of appointments by an independent body. </para><para>Democrats have put up amendments designed to compel ministers to make appointments on merit on well over 20 occasions over the last few years and every single time Labor and the coalition have combined to block reform. So why do we keep doing it? We do it because it is a principle that should be accepted. We are committed to ensuring that appointments to the governing organs or public authorities are based on merit and that the processes by which these appointments are made are transparent, accountable, open and honest. An independent body should be given the responsibility of scrutinising government appointments against a set of established criteria. </para><para>This system works well in the United Kingdom after Lord Nolan headed the 1995 Nolan commission and managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments should be based on merit. This process will go a long way to ending the privilege and patronage associated with government appointments. Lord Nolan set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments: a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selections on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified.</para><para>In response to the committee's recommendations, the United Kingdom government subsequently created the office of Commissioner for Public Appointments, which has a similar level of independence from the government as the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. We have in fact used the Nolan committee's recommendations in our amendments for the last five years because they are tried and tested. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. Until this notion of jobs for the boys or girls is nipped in the bud, there is not that much moral difference between our system and the political patronage that is prevalent in countries where nepotism and favouritism run rife. In the bill before us I have circulated amendments on sheet 2968, of which I will seek to have amendments (1) to (3) moved together. We seek to insert a section requiring that a code of practice be determined for nominations or appointments in respect of the appointment of full-time executive members to replace APRA's current non-executive board, the purpose of the group being essentially to resemble a regulatory commission structure. It is recommended that the process of appointments be based on merit and have independent scrutiny, transparency, openness and probity. The bill in its current form has no provision at all for this process.</para><para>In my opinion it would be negligent to ignore this matter, especially on such a topical issue. We do need to establish a workable system to ensure that appointments on merit always occur. This amendment does that. The public needs to be reassured that there is an adequate system of transparency and independence where favours are not exploited and mates are not rewarded. In making those remarks, of course I cast no aspersions on the likely people who are going to be appointed and cast no aspersions on the ministers who will make those judgments. I trust that they will exercise the care they should. Nevertheless, I am arguing that the process needs to be transparent on its face. We all know that political patronage is corrupt and corrupting. In another minister's hands you might not get the same outcome you may get in the hands of somebody who is trustworthy. We think political patronage needs to be reined in. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>11984</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1821">Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> implements important recommendations of the HIH Royal Commission in respect of governance arrangements for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The government does not support Senator Murray's amendments. The bill already establishes parameters for the appointment of APRA members and, in particular, section 17(1) of the bill requires that an APRA member be `qualified for appointment by virtue of his or her knowledge or experience relevant to APRA's functions and powers'.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also directly addresses the issue of possible conflicts of interest in selecting APRA members. For example, section 17(2) of the bill provides that a person may not be appointed as a member of APRA if they are employed by a body regulated by APRA. Finally, the processes outlined in the amendments could delay the appointment of APRA members for many months. This could delay the implementation of an enhanced corporate governance structure for APRA which was an important objective of the HIH Royal Commission's recommendations. I thank honourable senators for agreeing to expedite the passage of the bill thus enabling it to commence on 1 July 2003 and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11984</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole. </para><para>Senator MURRAY (Western Australia) (12.53 p.m.)âby leaveâI move amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 2968:</para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 20, page 8 (lines 10 to 22), omit section 17, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">17  Procedures for merit selection of APRA members</inline></para><quote><para>		The Minister must by writing determine a code of practice for selecting and appointing APRA members and acting APRA members which sets out general principles on which selection and appointment is to be made, including but not limited to:</para></quote><para>	(a)	merit, including but not limited to appropriate superannuation industry knowledge;</para><para>	(b)	independent scrutiny of appointments;</para><para>	(c)	probity, including but not limited to:</para><para>	(i)	preclusion of a person for selection and appointment as an APRA member if the person is a director, officer or employee of a financial body regulated by APRA;</para><para>	(ii)	preclusion of a person for selection and appointment as an APRA member if the person is a director, officer or employee of a financial body which is not regulated by APRA, if the absence of any conflict of interests cannot be or is not established; and</para><para>	(d)	openness and transparency.</para><quote><para> (2)	Schedule 1, item 20, page 8 (after line 25), after subsection 18(1), insert:</para><para>	(1A)	In making an appointment in accordance with subsection (1), the Governor-General is to have regard to the merit selection processes described in section17.</para><para> (3)	Schedule 1, page 9 (line 7), after âmayâ, insert â, subject to section17â.</para></quote><para>Question negatived. </para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator TROETH (VictoriaâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.54 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a third time. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT (COURT PROCEDURES) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11985</page.no><id.no>R1829</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through it remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11985</page.no><id.no>R1760</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 16 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>11985</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition supports the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline>. We in opposition have consistently supported improvements in the regulation of maritime safety. We are all obliged to ensure that adequate standards established internationally are set in concrete in Australia. However, as Mr Ferguson told the other place, our opportunity to demonstrate bipartisan support in this important policy area has somewhat been limited under the Howard government because of its policy of inactivity.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government has a dismal record with respect to the ailing Australian shipping industry. Changes made by this government have always been at the margins and almost always in response to international action or in response to a disaster. There is therefore no leadership at a national level. Policy work initiated by this government unfortunately is virtually nonexistent and it is telling in the industry day by day. There is no record from the government of active encouragement and interest in the Australian shipping industryâor, in fact, in having one. Until recent times Australia, as we appreciate, has always been at the leading edge of maritime policy development and reform and an active participant in organisations such as the ILO and the IMO. The problem is that under the Howard government that important leadership role has been undermined and we no longer command the same respect in the international maritime industryâbe it in government, employer or union circles.</para><para>Under the Howard government the Australian fleetâas is well known in the Australian community, not just in our coastal towns and cities but also in inland Australiaâhas unfortunately been hung out to dry. We have a government that not only is going out of its way to undermine the Australian shipping industry but is putting our environment at risk and undermining our capacity as a nation to defend itself and to give proper assistance to the regions.</para><para>The bill seeks to amend four acts and to repeal the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement of 1984. I go firstly to the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 and the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Act 1993. Passage of this bill willâ rightly soâsignificantly increase the amount of compensation payable in respect of damage from ships by oil spills. There is a two-tiered international scheme to provide compensation for pollution damage from persistent oils discharged from oil tankers. Persistent oils are oils that do not evaporate readily such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil. The first tier of the international scheme is set out in the civil liability convention. It applies a strict liability on tanker owners for damage resulting from the escape or discharge of persistent oils. The liability is generally limited depending on the size of the tanker. </para><para>The second tier of the scheme is set out in the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damageâthe fund convention. I note that that convention established the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in order to supplement compensation when the full amount is unable to be obtained from the tanker owner. The IOPC fund is rightly financed by a levy on parts of the industry. The current limit for an owner of a 40,000-tonne tanker is approximately $42 million. The current limit for the IOPC fund is approximately $320 million less the amount contributed by the owner. This bill applies a significant increase to those limits consistent with the International Maritime Organisation resolution. As a result, the liability for an owner of a 40,000-tonne tanker will rise from $42 million to $63 million and the combined maximum will now be $480 million as against $320 million.</para><para>Labor clearly supports these changes, not because they strengthen the role of the maritime industry but because they make sure that, when damage is done to our environment, there is the capacity to cover the clean-up costs and to correctly fine those responsible for inflicting that damage on our pristine coastline. It is vitally important that these provisions are updated to ensure they continue to provide for reasonable compensation for oil damage. It is also important that they are kept at a significant level to deter careless behaviour.</para><para>Labor strongly endorses policy action to require that polluters pay the maximum payment for any damage caused. While the International Maritime Organisation and workers organisations such as the International Transport Workers Federation work hard to enforce international standards, we have a situation where, as I have clearly stated on a number of occasions, not all operators comply. That is un-Australian and it is unacceptable to any decent community.</para><para>It is for that reason that historically Australia has sought to comply with most international obligations, but in recent years the Howard government has actively gone out of its way to encourage many operators in our region to operate on noncompliant registers. This is just plain wrong with respect to what is right for Australia, not only in decent employment conditions but also in defence and environmental termsâissues which are of major national importance and in Australia's national interest. The correct role of the government, on behalf of the Australian people, is to protect the Australian public and its territories.</para><para>The objectives of schedules 1 and 3 of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill are: firstly, to expand the definition of plastics so that there is an absolute prohibition on the disposal from ships into the sea of incinerator ashes from plastic products which may contain toxic or heavy metal residues; secondly, to allow garbage disposal placards which are required to be displayed on a ship to be written in Spanish as an alternative to the existing requirement of English or French; and, thirdly, to convert penalties that are currently expressed in monetary terms to the equivalent in penalty units, which is something that has been attended to on an ongoing basis in a range of transport bills, and especially maritime bills, over recent years. </para><para>These provisions go forward today with the clear support of the opposition. That support is given because we are internationally driven to increase the protection afforded to our ocean environment. The provision for the Spanish language as an alternative to English or French has been endorsed by the IMO. The changes to penalties are only a technicality and actually make it easier to amend the value of penalties in various acts. </para><para>I now go to the amendment to the Trade Practices Act, schedule 2 of the bill, which will amend part X of the Trade Practices Act to make it clear that stevedoring operators are not permitted to collude when setting stevedoring charges. This amendment clarifies for the ACCC a concern about earlier amendments to the act.</para><para>Finally, I go to the repeal of the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Act. Schedule 3 of the bill will repeal the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Act, which no longer has any application. So it is simply a tidying-up exercise. Labor supports the repeal of the act as all requirements in the agreement have been met. The opposition has confirmed this with the office of the Tasmanian Minister for Infrastructure to make sure that there are no difficulties between the Commonwealth and the state governments.

The Murray-Darling agreement was made in June 1992 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and replaced the River Murray waters agreement. The state of Queensland became a party to the agreement in 1996.</para></talk.start><para>The agreement concerns the management of the basin's land, water and environmental resources. In short, this bill gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin amending agreement signed by the Prime Minister and the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002. The basis of the amending agreement is a deal between the Commonwealth and the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to allocate an additional 70 gigalitres per annum in environmental flows for the River Murray. This deal is also designed to deliver improved environmental outcomes for rivers in the Kosciusko National Park. </para><para>The New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments have agreed to a staged return of 28 per cent of average natural flows to the Snowy River. To do this, these two Labor governments have committed $300 million to the task. A key element of the arrangement is the absence of adverse consequences for irrigators' water entitlements, South Australia's water security, water quality or existing environmental flows.</para><para>The Murray-Darling Basin covers one million square kilometres and comprises about 14 per cent of Australia's continental landmass. It extends across four states and includes Australia's three longest rivers: the Darling, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. The basin incorporates 75 per cent of Australia's irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. The health of the basin is critical to the Australian economy and the prosperity of the regional communities that depend on it. About one per cent of Australia's farmland is under irrigation, yet it accounts for 26 per cent of the value of agricultural production and 96 per cent of the water used in rural Australia. The extraordinary growth of the Australian wine industry, which is now exporting $2.5 billion worth of product a year, has been driven by irrigation.</para><para>The building of irrigated agriculture in the basin is largely the result of the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. It must be remembered that it was the Labor Party that had the vision in the 1940s to make this a reality. Of course, for vision like that there is only one party to look to, and that is the Australian Labor Party. It was Ben Chifley, as Treasurer and later as Prime Minister, with advice from Bill McKell, who created the Snowy scheme, which in turn allowed Australian and immigrant farmers with initiative to grow crops under irrigation where once those pieces of land were all but useless. Hand in hand with this project was Ben Chifley's assisted immigration program, which delivered not only workers to the scheme but a boost to the postwar economy of Australia, a home to tens of thousands fleeing the destruction in Europe and a lasting positive impact on Australian society as a tolerant and open nation able to respect people of all cultures and religions. How sad it is to watch the way in which the Prime Minister, with the loyalty of the Liberal deputy leader, has worked to undermine the tolerance in our community. How much sadder to see the Treasurer speak of tolerance only as a political device to differentiate himself from Mr Howard now that his loyalty and patience have been so sorely tested. But these are issues for another debate</para><para>Just as the Curtin and Chifley governments, based on the economic need and science of the day, delivered the Snowy scheme to the people of Australia and all the good things that came with it, so it is in that same tradition that Labor, under Simon Crean, displays a vision for our rivers and our nation. In this year's budget reply speech, Simon Crean announced a new deal to save the River Murray. A Crean Labor government will deliver 450 gigalitres of environmental flows within the first term, enough to keep the mouth of the Murray open; it will deliver 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows within 10 years, the minimum required to restore the health of the river; it will create Riverbank to fund the river's restoration and make an initial capital injection of $150 million; and it will establish the Environmental Flow Trust to manage environmental flows.</para><para>That fourth point is very important. The establishment of the Environmental Flow Trust is proof that Labor knows that there is more to saving the Murray than simply putting more water into it. Labor knows that the water must be managed within the riverâsent to the right parts of the river and at the right timeâto ensure that we get the maximum environmental return for that water, and this will be the task of Labor's Environmental Flow Trust. Labor understands the intersection between water property rights, sustainable agriculture and delivering environmental flows. </para><para>Our opponents claim that, for them, water is a key third term agenda item. In their 2001 election document, entitled `Putting Australia's interests first', those opposite claimed that they would `ensure the protection of the legitimate property rights of farmers'. They also said:</para><quote><para>There must be a clear understanding that compensation should be paid where individuals give up property rights ...</para></quote><para>Of course, that is no revelation regarding compensationâit is a constitutional surety. They go on to say:</para><quote><para>The Coalition will ensure that the next COAG meeting addresses definitions of property rights, including water rights, and mechanisms to deliver just compensation for the loss of these rights.</para></quote><para>Two COAG meetings have come and gone since this bold statement. In April 2003, water was talked about but no ground was made. In November, the premiers realised that Mr Anderson was not interested in moving the public policy agenda forward and, attempting to draw some leadership from the Prime Minister on this issue, asked that Mr Anderson not be present at that meeting. All through 2002 and into this year, we have had it hinted and then blatantly stated by this government that competition policy payments to the states would be in jeopardy if the states did not fund the Howard government's election promises on water rights. In effect, this government's solution to the most difficult of problems is to take money out of the systemâthe standard big stickâand take the `blame the states' approach so favoured by the tories. Contrast this with the approach taken by Simon Crean and Labor.</para><para>Labor have done the hard yards on policy development when it comes to saving our rivers, Labor have the money on the table and Labor have the track record of working with the states, which are pivotal to any outcome to deliver environmental flows to our rivers and certainty to our farmers. Labor know it can be done because we have done it before. It must be remembered that when Simon Crean, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, developed the national drought policy seven of the states and territories were in conservative hands. But they signed up to the plan because it was the right policy for the nation and Simon Crean negotiated in good faith.</para><para>We can contrast Labor's record on dealing with the states with that of this government. Where Simon Crean was able to build a national drought policy, this governmentâlargely due to the ineptitude of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Trussâhas been unable even to negotiate reforms to the current exceptional circumstances system with the states. Where we can build a scheme from nothing, the minister can only play politics with the worst drought in 100 years. And where Simon Crean couldâand certainly can in the futureâwork with the state governments to deliver for our rivers and for the certainty of farmers, this government can only threaten competition payments to the states unless they kick the can for the Howard government's promises. Clearly this debate is beyond Mr Truss and beyond Mr Anderson. The Prime Minister must take leadership on this issue and work cooperatively with the states where his ministers have failed so miserably to date. </para><para>Manyâand I include among them the leader of the once great National Partyâfail to understand why Labor would want to save the Murray. Two words would sum it up: sustainable agriculture. Labor knows that the Murray-Darling Basin accounts for 75 per cent of Australia's irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production and that the one per cent of agricultural land under irrigation delivers 26 per cent of the value of agricultural production. On this most critical of issues the Howard government are all over the place. The National Party, through Mr Anderson, have expressed a view about water trading, Senator Heffernan another. This is, I suppose, symptomatic of two things: their lack of a rigorous work policy on water and the deeper tension that exists between the Liberal and National partiesâtensions that we saw flare in this chamber during yesterday's discussion on the report into the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill.</para><para>Unlike the Howard government, Labor are united in our desire to deliver healthy working rivers and therefore a sustainable future for farming families who rely on irrigation. That is why Labor, and only Labor, bring to this debate the vision to save the Murray and the method with which to do it. Labor support the bill and commend its passage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>11990</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to say at the outset that the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is a very important piece of legislation. It amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 and represents an agreement between the various states and the Commonwealthâand between the states themselvesâas well as implementing the corporatisation of the Snowy Hydro.</para></talk.start><para>Very importantly, the bill establishes a process to recover environment flows, in this case mainly for the Snowy River. It will return to the Snowy River some 28 per cent of its natural flow over a 10-year period at an estimated cost of around $300 million. The two states have again cooperated, with that cost to be shared between the two state governments. It also establishes additional mechanisms for water accounting and notification as well as for consultation and modelling with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</para><para>There are a number of conditions. Firstly, allocations of water to the environment must not adversely impact on irrigators. Secondly, allocations must not adversely impact on South Australia, which I am very pleased to note. Thirdly, the commercial viability of the Snowy scheme will be maintained. Fourthly, water for environment flows will be sourced principally from verified water savings. Lastly, water for environment flows cannot be consumedâit must flow through the river system to the sea.</para><para>While this bill is about returning flows mainly to the Snowy River, it is also about returning some flows to the River Murray. It addresses the environmental degradationâthat is, the long-term consequences of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme and all the irrigation associated with it. The scheme was built at a time when, I believe, we did not have an adequate understanding of the environment into which we were putting these very large volumes of water. While it was mainly intended for industrial purposesâfor use as hydro powerâthe impact of the changes to the water regimes and the use of water has been very significant.</para><para>This bill is of particular significance because it sets out a model of how to achieve environment flows over a long period. It gives rise to the development of a strategy to recover environment flows for the River Murrayâbeginning with 70 gigalitres and hopefully moving to at least the 1,500 gigalitres that need to be left in the river at the point where the Murray River joins the Darling River. It indicates that water reform will only proceed if money is injected into the reform process by state and federal governments. This is a very important point because, rather than just millions of dollars, I think we are going to be talking in the billions of dollars. It is estimated that it could be around $1.5 billion just for that first 1,500 gigalitres of environment flows. </para><para>I do have a few concerns, which I will list very quickly. Firstly, I am concerned that, as we move to finding this water, governments will be tempted to simply buy water on the market. While there is no problem with doing some of that, clearly it becomes very risky if those also interested in buying water realise that it is in fact the government that it is planning to acquire this waterâcosts will escalate enormously. Also, as has just been mentioned by Senator O'Brien, it is not just a matter of letting water flow down the riversâeither of them. If we really want to improve the habitatsâparticularly looking at restoring ecosystems and riverine habitatâwe have to look at issues such as the temperature of the water, channel maintenance and flushing flows, particularly for the River Murray, the health of the Coorong and the health of wetlands such as Chowilla.</para><para>We need to look at issues right down as far as the eastern Mount Lofty Ranges and at those tributaries which for the first time, in many cases, have stopped flowing this summer. That had very little to do with the drought and more to do with excessive extraction. Up and down the river, we have to look at fish spawning and at specific degraded habitats. I would point to the report recently released on the death of the old red gums and the huge amount of devastationâ not 20 per cent, but 60, 70 or 80 per cent in placesâparticularly in places like Chowilla. It is going to take a lot more than simply finding the environment flows. It is going to be a management process. It is going to mean, in many cases, that when we finally do have rain we will have to try and top up the small floods to get them out over the banks and into those wetlands. It is going to be a long-term process and time is certainly of the essence.</para><para>I note that there is very little mention of property rights and compensation. Water reform will stall entirely if these issues are not addressed. There is very little here that addresses how we are going to pay in the longer term for the repair of the landscape. We could look at levies or at a consumer pays systemâin other words, substantially increasing the cost of waterâbut one way or another we are going to have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to be a very expensive operation.</para><para>As I said, the history of the Murray-Darling is one of water being extracted for agriculture, building on the back of the water that was stored for the Snowy hydro scheme. It was simply assumed that the rivers would remain healthy with what was left in them. Unfortunately, we now know that there is little, if anything, left. In fact, we cannot even meet entitlements at the moment. But we are still taking more water out. The Clare Valley pipeline is going ahead as we meet today. While it is needed for the small towns in the Clare Valley, we surely should not be allowing additional irrigation to proceed. We should not be opening up new irrigation schemes at a time when we have such enormous stresses on the whole Murray-Darling Basin.</para><para>This is not a scheme that is going to be using water that is bought from anywhere else; it is supposedly, according to SA Water, new water, available waterâwater that is at the moment within SA's entitlement. I argue very strongly that it is not and that South Australia does not have any spare water. Last year and this year are a very good example of that. Not only do we have the problem for the Murray of taking more water out, and taking it right out of the Murray catchmentâ in other words, there will be no chance of any seepage, leakage or anything coming back into the riverâbut that entire volume of water will be lost to the Murray. </para><para>The problem is also what it is going to do to the Clare Valley. Salinity is already a problem in pockets of the valleyâa very significant problem in one area. We are putting into that valley, along this pipeline, quite salinised water, particularly at the moment. It effectively in parts does not have anywhere else to go. So I believe we need to take a fresh look at this pipeline, at the impact on the Murray as well as the impact on the viticulture in the Clare Valley.</para><para>When I visited there last week, they were already putting out the initial spacings and measurements for enormous numbers of plantings all along where this pipeline is going to go. Initially, the pipeline was never intended for irrigation, but SA Water is out there selling water, actively encouraging growers, who in some cases are now going to have to go and look for extra plantings to use it. They have even talked to places like Martindale Hall, which is a historic property that has no vines on it at the moment, about putting in vinesâ`You will have the water. How about you invest in some vines and make some money?' They are even looking at putting in grapevines.</para><para>I close by saying that, while we do see some positives in this bill, every time we seem to take a couple of steps forward we have a couple of steps backwards facing us as very bad decisions are made in other parts of the river. While I commend this bill to the Senate, I call on the government to take a closer look and for the Commonwealth to take some far stronger action when it sees states making decisions that will not only harm their own patchâin this case the Clare Valley, I believe, will be significantly harmed by extensive, unpoliced use of this waterâbut certainly harm the Murray-Darling Basin for everyone.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11992</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their comments and commend the bill to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11992</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.24 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>11992</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Travel Advice</title><page.no>11992</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11992</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Is the minister aware that at least three of these warningsânamely, a written ONA report of September 2001, a verbal ONA report direct to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in June 2002 and a written ASIO report in July 2002âwarned explicitly of terrorist attacks in Bali and made specific reference to nightclubs, hotels and airports? In light of these very explicit intelligence agency warnings, why then did the Minister for Foreign Affairs fail to change the public warnings about travel to Bali, which continued to state throughout this period: `tourist services in Bali operating normally'? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11993</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government does rely on experts to settle warnings to tourists, and it does so on the basis of the best advice of other experts within the bureaucracy, within our intelligence services, who obviously make assessments on information that is available to us and also have the opportunity to peruse the assessments of experts in other agencies. Taking all that into account, travel warnings are settled and publicly released, as they were for Indonesia during the course of the year in question. I think everyone knew that there was a heightened state of alert within Indonesia, and I can remember speaking on a number of occasions of the intended attack by Jemaah Islamiah within Singapore, which was believed to have been intended to include Australian targets.</para></talk.start><para>I can remember one speech in particular in which I talked about an arc of instability within South-East Asia and the role being played by Jemaah Islamiah, the association of it and other terrorist organisations within the region and the particularly worrying aspect that there appeared to be associations between such organisations and al-Qaeda emanating from the Middle East. These were matters that were being discussed on the public record, as I have just indicated, and there is no secret in that regard. It seems to me that there has been nothing revealed in the last few days that goes beyond the assessments that were made by Mr Blick when he did his study of these very same issues after the attack in Bali.

Late yesterday the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ Bank both announced cuts to their fixed interest home loan rates. Home buyers can now obtain home loans at fixed interest rates below six per centâfixed interest rates that are now at their lowest point in 20 years. This translates into significant savings for Australian home owners.</para></talk.start><para>Australian families have enjoyed sustained low interest rates under the Howard government. Of course, we remember Labor's record of economic incompetence, which led to record high interest rates that devastated so many Australian families and crippled so many small business operators. We will never forget that, under Labor, home interest rates soared to a high of 17 per cent. In the darkest days of Labor's high interest rates regime, Australians with an average home loan of $150,000 were being hit with a monthly interest rate bill of $2,125. Compare that to today, when there is a variable interest rate of 6.5 per cent, and the alternative interest rate bill is $812. Under the Liberals, as opposed to Labor, the home loan cost has been reduced from over $2,000 a month to under $1,000. That is a saving of more than $1,300 a month to Australian families.</para><para>That is the sort of benefit that this government's responsible approach to managing the Australian economy can bring. This government has delivered a strong economy, where businesses are prepared to invest and to employ more Australians. We have delivered six budget surpluses and record job levels. We have delivered low interest rates and also a low-inflation environment which has benefited both employers and workers. We have done this at the same time as reducing Labor's appalling legacy of $96 billion worth of debt. We remember Senator Cookâwho unfortunately cannot be with us todayâone of Labor's senior economic ministers, who told us that the budget was in surplus when it was actually $10 billion in deficit. We should remember that every measure we took to tackle that mountain of debt has been opposed by the Labor Party.</para><para>So now, after seven years of sitting idle in the opposition benches, what is the Labor Party's alternative? Not surprisingly, looking to their history, it is to spend more money: to spend more on Medicare, on health, on the environment and so it goes on. Where is the money coming from? It is coming from putting up taxes and borrowing more againâexactly what it did before, which led to that disastrous situation of 17 per cent interest rates for ordinary Australian families. After seven years in opposition, Labor has learnt nothing. They have no policies to deliver sound economic management, only policies to spend more and more, and end up in the same mess as they ended up in before. The contrast after seven years remains stark. The alternative is the government that tackles the difficult economic issues, that delivers low interest rates, low inflation, high job rates and is an alternative to Laborâspend more, borrow more, and 10 more to the bankruptcy courts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Properties</title><page.no>11994</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>11994</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is also directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence.

I suppose they would say that, given the deal they did on Centenary House, where they have caused the Australian taxpayer to pay far over the value of the asset, that is the way that we should operate as well. Is Senator Evans saying that the Australian taxpayer should miss out both waysâfirstly, because of incompetent economic management, Labor would drive up interest rates and lead to the disaster of their previous administration; and, secondly, they would take a bit more back from the taxpayer to help pay for the internal administration of the Australian Labor Party? Is that the alternative that the Labor Party, after seven years in opposition, are putting to the Australian people?

Previously I informed the Senate that L.J. Hooker Commercial was advertising a sublease at Centenary House on the ANAO's behalf. As senators are aware, the original leasing arrangements for this Labor property were undertaken by the then Labor government. The lease has allowed Labor to gouge an unjustifiable rent out of Australian taxpayers since 1993. Labor contrived a 15-year lease with a minimum nine per cent rent increase per annum. This means that, as at September this year, taxpayers will be paying $871 per square metre into Labor coffers. </para></talk.start><para>I can inform the Senate and Senator Mason that the top floor of Centenary House has now been sublet. And what was the best commercial rate for the sublease on the top floorâthe best floorâof Centenary House? It was a mere $314 per square metre. That is right, the best market price that they could get was only $314 per square metre, yet the Australian taxpayer is still being forced by Labor to pay $847 per square metre, or 270 per cent above the actual market rate. This means that in 2003-04 ordinary taxpayers will have to pay $3.5 million more than they should for Centenary House. Over 15 years of the lease, Labor's sleazy and unconscionable rental rort will cost taxpayers $36 million above market rates. </para><para>Senator Mason asks, `Does this represent value for the Commonwealth?' No, it does not. It is a Labor Party rip-off, as described by Senator Mason in his question. No-one can argue that this rental deal is fair, that it is reasonable or that it is proper. But do Labor care? No, they do not. Each and every attempt to renegotiate the lease to get a better deal for taxpayers has been stonewalled by the Labor Party. Why would they do that? Perhaps it is the ever-shrinking union membership base that they are confronting. But I think the answer is somewhat simpler: sheer unadulterated greed.</para><para>Senator Cook, who is absent, Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray, who also is absent, and Senator Bolkus were ministers in that Labor government when this rort went through.

Mr Crean says that he is policy focused. So what is his policy on Centenary House? Mr Crean seems to be taking the Beazley small target approach on this one. The Australian people are angry at Labor's rort. What Labor needs to do is to pay back the money that rightfully belongs to the Australian taxpayer. This is a test of integrity, character and, dare I say it, leadership. We know that Mr Beazley never had the ticker to fix it.

It is, of course, absolutely simplistic to add up the interest rates over the next 20 years and then to apply the figure against the capital sale price and reach a simplistic outcome. You need to determine the value of money and determine which is the best way to goâ to keep or to sell the asset. We do not make an ideological choice in that regard; we take advice from economic managers who have the runs on the board. We make those decisions and we deliver good outcomes to the Australian people. That is what we are all about.</para></talk.start><para>Contrast that with Labor: Labor hold the property, they borrow more and more money, they put taxes up and they accumulate a debt of $96 billion. When they are finally thrown out of office, they hand over a deficit of $10 billion when they claim they were actually in surplus. That is the sort of economic mismanagement that this country suffered through 13 years of Labor government. What is more important is that they delivered such bad outcomes to peopleârecord high unemployment, record high interest rates and a great deal of miseryâthat were directly related to economic incompetence. Of course, the Labor Party do not come up with any policies that talk about savings and sound economic management. The only policiesâand there is scant detail in that regardâthat they can now come up with involve the same old recipe: you borrow more to try to buy your way back into government. When you run out of borrowing capability, you put taxation up as well, you drive small business into the ground, you achieve record high unemployment rates and families suffer the agony of record high interest rates. That is the misery that is delivered by Labor's alternative. When Labor come up with some sensible, rational economic policies, perhaps they might be justified in re-entering the economic debate. But, until they at least make an attempt to do so, I would suggest that they forget this line of questioning, because all it does is invite a reminder of what an appalling effort Labor made in managing the Australian economy over 13 years. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11998</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The government has a policy that it should utilise its capital assets in the most efficient economic way, and in some instances the determination is made that they should be disposed of because you will get a better return through such disposition. When that occursâand, as I said, we adopt formulae, which I think were actually used by the previous government as well but they have probably been improved and refined since thenâand when a decision is made to dispose of a property, there is then a comprehensive study as to how the highest price can be realised. Sometimes that requires rezoning or remediation work in case it was a factory, for example. We take whatever steps are needed to maximise the return because, as I said, we are sensible economic managers and very proud of it. When we are able to dispose of assets, where it is unnecessary for the Commonwealth to hold those assets, to give a better return to the Australian people we do so, and the timing of the end of the financial year does not really make a lot of difference in that regard.

Under the government's sale of property principles, we then sold that property for $28 millionâonly recovering what we have spent on it in the last three or four yearsâbut we are going to spend $60 million renting back that property. This is the Australian Defence College, where we train our senior officers. It is a central part of Defence Force training, but we have sold the property at a low rate and we are going to spend twice as much to rent back that property over the next 20 years. We are still responsible for keeping the premises up to standardâthe maintenance et ceteraâbut we have this ludicrous proposition where the Commonwealth is spending millions of dollars to rent back properties it owned until recently. </para><para>In total, of the six or seven properties that Defence have sold in the last year or so, they have reaped $440 million in revenue from those sales, but we are going to spend $960 million renting them back over the next 20 years. This is the economic logic that Minister Hill tried to defend in question time. This is madness. As the Auditor-General's office have pointed out, this is a crazy decision. It is driven by the budgetary position of this government. They have insisted that Defence, in return for money put into Defence for increased defence expenditure, return a dividend to the Commonwealth through forced property sales. This year they have been required to provide $560-odd million in property sales as revenue back to the Commonwealth. They were even going to sell Russell headquarters, the Defence Headquarters of Australia. Finally, after a bit of public pressure, the government dropped that ludicrous proposition. Even they realised that selling the equivalent of the Pentagon made no sense at all.</para><para>But everything else is up for sale. As a result, the government is forcing Defence to sell these properties. They have to sell them by the end of the financial year to meet the government's budget bottom line. In the last little while, we have seen over $400 million worth of property being rushed to sale in the last couple of months of the financial year. Up until March this year, Defence had received only $180,000 worth of revenue from their property sales so far. But they still say they are on track to reach the $560 million target by the end of the year. The vast majority of the properties are going to be sold in the last days of the year at bargain basement prices because it is a fire sale to meet the budget bottom line that Defence has to return to Finance.</para><para>As a result, Australian taxpayers are going to be paying coming and going. They are not getting value for the sale and they are going to have to pay more, year after year, to rent the buildings back. These are not surplus buildings or properties in most instances. These are properties that Defence are going to use for the next 20 years. This is our Defence College; this is where we train our senior officers. But we have a situation where Defence have been forced to sell at low prices and then rent back. It is economic madness, it is at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer and it is another sign of the terrible financial management that is occurring inside Defence. There is a qualification on their accounts from last year, but they have been driven by this government to fund the budget bottom line by selling Defence properties for whatever they can get in order to get the revenue in by the end of the financial year. This fire sale is costing Australian taxpayers millions of dollars. It also means we will be paying rent for the next 20 years. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">An incident having occurred in the galleryâ</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âYou are out of order, Sir!</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>12008</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy President, I heard Labor senators during question time, and now we have heard Senator Evans, talk about a lease scandal and an overvalued asset and refer to the Australian National Audit Office. I thought, and I think all government senators thought, that at last they are going to fess up to the real lease scandal in Canberra today, and that is the sorry story of Centenary House. It is the 10th anniversary this year of the Centenary House lease. Let me remind the Senate what the terms of that lease are. The terms of that lease provide that the landlord of Centenary Houseâthat is, John Curtin House Ltd, which is wholly controlled by the Australian Labor Partyâescalates the rent by a minimum of nine per cent per year, every year for 15 years, regardless of market conditions. </para></talk.start><para>Over the last several years, in questions in estimates pursued by Senator Ian Campbell and more recently by me, we have heard evidence that this commercial lease is unique in Australia. There has never been such an uncommercial lease disguised as a commercially viable lease in the history of Australian commercial property. Now, as was disclosed in estimates three weeks ago, we learn that the top floor of Centenary Houseâapproximately 25 per cent of the gross lettable floor areaâhas been subleased to an engineering firm called Kellogg Brown and Root Pty Ltd for a rental of $314 per square metre per annum. As the Audit Office testified at Senate estimates, that is the market value of that tenancy. It is the best floor of Centenary House, by the way, so it could be expected to achieve the maximum rent achievable in the market. The market value is $314 per square metre per annum. But do you know how much the taxpayer, through the Audit Office, the head tenant, will be paying from September this yearâthe 10th anniversary of the lease? The taxpayer will be paying $871.07 per square metre per annum. Senator Abetz, in an answer to a question from Senator Mason, said it was $847 per square metre per annum. It is in fact $871.07 per square metre per annum.

This program has been one disaster after another for the Howard government and, all the way through, Australian taxpayers have been footing the bill. Australian taxpayers will continue to do so in a constantly growing capacity over the years to come because of this government's failure to adequately manage the Defence portfolio and because of its short-sighted ideological push to prop up its budget bottom line.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government is wasting hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing with its economically irresponsible sale and lease-back program for defence properties. So far, six defence properties that used to be owned by the public, in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong, have been sold and leased back. Defence is now locked into 20-year leases under which taxpayers are forced to pay $960 million in rent for buildings they used to own. How ridiculous is this situation? The Australian taxpayer and future governments have been locked into poor deals in which they will be forced to fork out money hand over fist for the next two decades for the utilisation of defence properties that we used to own anyway.</para><para>In 2001 a highly critical Audit Office report on Commonwealth property sales found that the sale and lease-back of Commonwealth property was financially irresponsible. The Audit Office found that in most cases taxpayers start to lose money less than halfway through the 20-year leases. This report raises the question: why has this government continued with its short-sighted economically irresponsible program? Just recently we have learned of the fortunate news that the Howard government has failed in its efforts to sell and lease back Australia's defence headquarters at Russell offices in Canberra. This was a victory for commonsense as the sale would have been the equivalent of the US administration selling the Pentagon to the private sector. However, just as it looked like the government had come to its senses over this policy and program, it has turned again and continues to press on with other sale and lease-back deals.</para><para>The latest example, that of the defence college, again makes a mockery of the Howard government's guidelines for asset sales which are supposed to ensure that the government's financial interests are protected at all times. The government has sold this property for $28 million despite having spent that much on redevelopments at the site since 1999 alone. According to the current Canberra property market, the land itself stands to be worth $15 million. Taxpayers now have to pay $60 million so that Defence can continue to use the college facilitiesâthe same facilities that it used to own. In a classic example of how wasting taxpayers' money is of no concern to the Howard government, Defence will still have to fork out for all maintenance and upkeep costs of the site. Where are the benefits in this deal? </para><para>Property investors are rubbing their hands together with glee at the prospect of getting a piece of the defence property fire sale action. They do not know what the Commonwealth stands to gain from the fire sale but for them it is basically a licence to print their own money. On the other hand, taxpayers have cause to be alarmed. Labor demands that the government call an immediate halt to its costly sale and lease-back program until an independent audit of the program examines the long-term viability of each project. Taxpayers ought to be assured that for the government to continue with this program the economic outcomes will be to their benefit and not to their costly detriment, as the situation seems to be for those properties already sold and leased back. </para><para>On top of this, the whole program is shrouded in secrecy. While none of the information is classified, it is not provided openly to the public. There is no transparency and there is no accountability to the public. The defence department does not provide a comprehensive list of the properties it has for sale; it does not provide a sale price and it does not issue a lease-back price. However, one division within the defence estate is provided with all these figures, so why then are these statistics not publicly available? Surely the Australian taxpayer has a right to know how much they stand to lose by this government's program. The minister may argue that if a member of the public so desired to find this information they could do so, but surely it is in the public's best interests for the minister to enable them to do so in an easier and more accessible way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>12012</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOnce again we have heard everything.

Senator Brandis proffered no defence of Senator Hill's statements at all. In fact, Senator Brandis, even with prompting, did not seem to be able to keep to the topic itself. It leaves Senator Hill with very little protection in relation to this issue. Senator Johnston's lacklustre performance also allowed Senator Hill's defence to be no defence. Here are some of the reasons there is no defence for Senator Hill.</para></talk.start><para>The minister needs to explain why taxpayers are being asked to pay an additional $1.1 billion in defence logistics when they are clearly forcing them to spend that money on properties they used to own. Let us use one as an example. Take, for instance, the Defence Plaza located in Pitt Street, Sydney. The government sold this property and shoved the money gained into consolidated revenue, not back into the Defence Force. The revenue then has to come out of the pocket of the defence department because they are expected to pay for the lease of the property they ownedâa neat trick. If we look at this lease to see what they then have to pay, the first year of a 10-year lease cost Defence over $8.5 million. Written into the lease was an indexation arrangement of three per cent over two years, totalling an additional $258,000 on the leasing arrangement, which then had to be found, with an expected increase every two years. </para><para>You would think that it would stop there. But they are being asked to put their hand in their pocket again because there is an agreement to review the rent based on market value on 1 July this year. Of course, we are talking about market value in Sydney. It was not going down at last report. The defence department is then simply in a world of hurt after this review, with the rent being linked to market value and being ratcheted up. The government is selling critical defence properties to hold up the budget line. That seems to be the only legitimate reason, but neither Senator Johnston nor Senator Brandis would even put up a defence so we are left to surmise that that is the only defenceâand it is no defence. Senator Hill knows better than that. Senator Hill avoided the question completely and wanted to talk about other issues.</para><para>Our troops are committed to defending our country. They could have used this money for better webbing. They could have used this money for things like a fibre-optic cable jointing machine to fix the fibre-optic cable that they use, because they do not have a jointing machine. I hope Senator Hill understands what a fibre-optic cable jointing machine is. If you do not have one, you cannot join cable that has been broken, so if the defence department then try to use it for signals, to be able to communicate, they cannot. Look at something simple like webbing. What we have is of old design that needs updating. They could use that money to update the webbing.</para><para>I suppose the Prime Minister yesterday took the opportunity to congratulate the men and women of the Defence Force for a job well done. Of course Labor shares that sentiment, but what we would like this Howard government to do is not only stand by them and applaud and thank them for their duty but also give them something in returnâprovide them with the means and the ability and ensure the defence budget is not hacked apart. Labor is not prepared to accept that moneys from the sale of defence properties should go to consolidated revenue whilst our troops have to spend their own money to access their own webbing or materials or other things to support the defence department. Senator Hill should take heed of that and ensure that there is proper webbing, that there are fibre-optic jointing machines, that there is sufficient provision of materiel for our troops.</para><para>Of course, when asked the question on why moneys from the sale of defence properties do not return, this is the answer that you should have given, but you failed to be able to provide it from the other side. The Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, said that the money will be spent on social opportunity benefits and in social areas.

We have seen over the past week just exactly how disjointed they are. I would suggest that perhaps the Labor Party could see Senator Hill to see whether you can get one of these fibre-optic jointing machines and maybe you will be able to communicate faction to factionâand perhaps we can even give one to Mr Beazley and Mr Crean so they can talk to each other. I am surprised that Senator Ludwig did not get up to say that I was not being relevantâbut still.</para></talk.start><para>Only about two minutes into this debate, the Labor Party must have realised that they had decided to tackle the government on the totally wrong issue. When you start to think about talking about economic management and the way we handle our assets in Australia, the only people with a clean record are the coalition government, and the only people who have a record that cannot be considered clean right now are the Labor Party. We had the sight of Senator Marshall getting up and saying he wanted to take note of the answers given by Senator Hill when in fact he came in with a prepared document that was written before he came into the Senateâbefore Senator Hill even gave the answers. That is how much he was taking note of the answers. </para><para>We had Senator Ludwig, because he was being pressured on a very sensitive point with the Labor Party by my colleagues Senator Brandis and Senator Johnston, rise to take points of order in order to try to draw the subject matter away from where the Labor Party is most sensitive. Senator Marshall, in his taking note of answers, said thisâand I carefully wrote it down: `Surely the public has a right to know how much this lease-back arrangement is going to cost the taxpayer.'</para><para>I can tell you how much one of those leasing arrangements costs the Australian taxpayer. It costs them 240 per cent above market value, it has a nine per cent increase each year, and that lease-back arrangement is from the Australian taxpayers to the Labor Party. Here they are trying to lecture us and Senator Hill's department about the sale of a defence property where we are trying to put some of the capital that is tied up in the defence property to good use in the Australian economyânot good use to the Labor Party, not good use to the Liberal Party, but good use to the Australian taxpayerâand Senator Marshall says `Surely the public has a right to know.'</para><para>The public has a right to knowâand this should be made more publicâthe lease arrangement that was gained by the then Labor government back in 1992 or 1993 and is supported by the current Labor opposition. The lease arrangement was put in place by the Keating government to make sure that the Labor Party coffers were filled to the tune of some $36 million over the lifetime of that leaseâ15-year lease with a nine per cent increment every year. If we are going to talk about credibility in economic management, about truthfulness in economic management and what is best for the Australian people and the Australian taxpayer, look no further than the leasing arrangements on Centenary House, which this Labor Party supports and which is dudding the Australian taxpayer to the tune of an enormous amount each and every year for a total 15 years.</para><para>Senator Ludwig says this government has no credibility. What sort of credibility does the Labor Party have when you sit there and continue to support this rorted lease, this nine per cent increase every year, when all the Labor Party has to do is ring up the government and say: `We got it wrong. We are screwing Australian taxpayers for an enormous amount of money. It is going into our Labor Party coffers and we want to renegotiate that lease because we realise it is totally out of kilter with the marketplace arrangements that are governing Canberra's rental properties today.' The Labor Party should be ashamed of itself. It should cease trying to criticise the good economic management of this government which has seen the Australian taxpayers in a better situation than they have been in for more than 20 years.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>12015</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>12015</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>12015</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present five government responses to committee reports as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>, as well as the government's response to the final report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Rebooting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service</inline>.

Accordingly, it agrees that it will comply with the spirit of the latest amendment to the Order proposed through Recommendation 17 of this report (subject to the Senate's passing of this amendment) under the same terms contained in its response to the original Order of 20 June 2001 and the subsequent amendment of 27 September 2001. In particular, it will comply with the spirit of the Order on the basis that:</para><para>Â·	agencies will use the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet guidelines on the scope of public interest immunity (in Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees) to determine whether information regarding individual contracts will be provided;</para><para>Â·	agencies will not disclose information if disclosure would be contrary to the Privacy Act 1988, or to other statutory secrecy provisions, or if the Commonwealth has given an undertaking to another party that the information will not be disclosed; and</para><para>Â·	compliance with the Senate order will be progressive as agencies covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 refine arrangements and processes to meet the requirements.</para><para>Consistent with the response to Recommendation 11 of this Report, the Government does not support the extension of the Order to cover Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) bodies from 1 January 2004.

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pursue in ARMCANZ matters requiring action arising from the Mid-Term Review Committee's recommendations.</para><para>Accepted. In August 2001, ARMCANZ Ministers considered a progress report prepared by AHA on implementation of the NOJDP Mid-Term Review recommendations. Ministers noted there has been substantial progress in implementing the recommendations from the Mid-Term Review and that AHA was preparing a revised NOJDP Business Plan for the period 2001 to 2004. The revised Business Plan incorporated key changes as reflected in the Mid-Term Review and the Senate Inquiry.</para><para>In light of a further reappraisal of the NOJDP in early 2002 AHA prepared a Two Year Transitional Program Plan 2002-2004 to further revise the NOJDP Business Plan. The Primary Industries Ministerial Council (PIMC), that replaced ARMCANZ, considered further progress reports on the NOJDP from AHA at its meetings in May 2002 and October 2002.

The Committee recommends that:</para><para>Â·	in the short to medium term, the management priority for infected properties in high prevalence areas should be on disease management rather than eradication; and</para><para>Â·	the long term goal be the eradication of OJD from Australia, until and unless the disease is determined to have become endemic in significant parts of Australia.</para><para>Supported in part. Outcomes to date from the research and development component of the NOJDP indicate that eradication of OJD is not feasible in the short to medium term given current technology, and that as OJD is endemic in parts of south-eastern Australia, the focus will need to shift to on-farm control and management of the disease, including the use of vaccine, supported by a coordinated cross-border approach to disease control.</para><para>Efforts to reduce the instance of disease in low prevalence areas are being pursued in the short term to lessen the risk of spread of the disease. In the high prevalence areas, the emphasis is on the gradual reduction in prevalence via modified sheep husbandry practices and the use of vaccine over a longer time frame.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>3.	The Committee recommends that, subject to appropriate vendor declarations, trading between the Control Zone and the Residual Zone be permitted and that this proposal be placed before ARMCANZ as a matter of urgency.</para><para>Supported in principle.

Trading of sheep is currently permitted between zones subject to appropriate disease control requirements. </para><para>In August 2001, the National Veterinary Committee endorsed a substantial revision of the Standard Definitions and Rules for OJD incorporating enhanced control measures arising from an April 2001 National Control Strategies Workshop, including wider use of vaccine in NSW, and a model OJD vendor declaration. </para><para>In September 2002, PIMC endorsed the 4th edition of the OJD Standard Definitions and Rules containing significant additions providing guidelines for the development of individual property management programs, including the use of vaccine, epidemiological investigations of infected flocks, pathways for infected flocks and surveillance requirements for maintenance and progression of zones.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>4.	With a view to making vaccine available to producers at the earliest possible time, the Committee strongly supports all necessary steps being taken to facilitate discussions with the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals for revision of the current NSW permit to extend the use of Gudair OJD vaccine, while recognising the importance of expediting the completion of the necessary trials for registration. </para><para>Agreed. On 4 July 2001 the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) issued a new permit for the use of `Gudair' vaccine in Rural Lands Protection Boards approved by the NSW Department of Agriculture. This enabled the vaccine to be used in sheep on properties that are quarantined on account of the presence or suspected presence of OJD. </para><para>On 16 April 2002 the NRA granted registration of the âGudairâ vaccine for use nationally. The availability and use of vaccine is now a matter for each state to determine. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para>5.	The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government initiate the establishment of a national sheep disease fund to which all sheep producers should contribute and which can be used by producers in every State. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia should place the establishment of this proposed fund before ARMCANZ for assessment and decision by the end of 2001. If ARMCANZ and industry decide not to proceed with the fund, the Committee believes that commercial reality should prevail and that producers should be permitted to decide whether to vaccinate their flocks on the usual commercial basis governing such stock management options.</para><para>Supported in principle. The government supports the provision of financial assistance to affected producers. The government also supports the view of the Mid-Term Review that the national sheep industry, as the prime beneficiary of disease control, should raise funds via a national levy to assist affected producers. </para><para>However, the initiative for establishment of a national sheep disease fund rests with the national sheep industry. Under the Government's levy principles and guidelines industry is required to demonstrate national industry support for any levy proposal.  </para><para>The government has worked closely with the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and Wool Producers to examine mechanisms, including a national levy, to provide funding for financial assistance to affected producers. The national sheep industry has been unable to obtain support from all member organizations for a national levy to fund assistance programs for affected producers. </para><para>Under the proposed Two Year Transitional Program Plan 2002-2004 for the NOJDP some Commonwealth (and national sheep industry) funding will be redirected to assist producers to maintain traditional trading patterns in light of recent changes implemented to OJD zones. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the appointment of a full-time manager for the NOJDP to manage national program delivery, budgets, accountability of outcomes and to ensure a co-ordinated national focus on the Program be a matter of priority.

The Committee recommends that a mandatory vendor declaration scheme be established for all sheep transactions as a matter of priority and that the Government pursue this recommendation so it is fulfilled by the end of 2001.</para><para>Supported in part. The Government supports the use of vendor declarations in the implementation of a risk-based approach to the management of OJD. The mandating of the use of vendor declarations is a matter for industry and state/territory governments to consider.</para><para>The national sheep industry has developed a national vendor declaration form for use by sheep producers when trading sheep.

States are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of staffing to deliver trace-forward/trace-back activities under the program. In August 2001, ARMCANZ agreed to provide sufficient resources to the NOJDP in line with Recommendation 33 of the Mid-Term Review, to meet agreed commitments under the existing Deed of Agreement. Recommendation 33 addresses government responsibility for funding appropriate staff levels for NOJDP activities. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline></para><para>10.	The Committee recommends that the co-ordination and management of OJD Research and Development be strengthened through:</para><para>Â·	appointment of a national Research and Development Co-ordinator by Animal Health Australia to be responsible directly to Animal Health Australia, and</para><para>Â·	a new management agreement with Meat and Livestock Australia for their administration and budget control of approved Research and Development trials.</para><para>The Committee recommends that this should be in place by the end of 2001, or if not practical by 1 July 2002.</para><para>Supported in principle. AHA is responsible for the overall management of the Research and Development (R&amp;D) element of the NOJDP. The required strengthening of R&amp;D coordination and reporting has been dealt with in a revised contractual arrangement between AHA and Meat and Livestock Australia, including the establishment of a technical advisory committee for research and development.

The primary report, From Phantom To Force: Towards A More Efficient And Effective Army was tabled in September 2000, prior to the publication of the Government's Defence White Paper, Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force. </para><para>To take account of the White Paper, and the community feedback regarding From Phantom to Force, the Committee released the supplementary report, A Model for a New Army: Community Comments on `From Phantom to Force' Parliamentary Report into the Army, (delivered in September 2001).  </para><para>While the performance of the Australian Army since its birth 101 years ago shows that it is certainly no phantom, there is scope for the Army to be more effective than it is today. Both reports comment on Army capability in isolation. However, in developing the White Paper, the Government considered the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as a group of capabilities rather than on a Service-specific basis. This means that guidance for Army capability development is provided under the umbrella of land force capability, which also includes elements of the Airforce and Navy whose principle task is to deploy and support the Army. Therefore, the aim of achieving an integrated, balanced joint force is central to the consideration of all Army capability planning.</para><para>The following section addresses the specific recommendations contained in both of the Committee's Reports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1. We recommend that the Government develop and maintain a national security policy. This policy should, amongst other things, guide the Defence Forces on their role in an integrated national concept for promoting and achieving international prosperity, peace and security.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">We further recommend that the Government explore the feasibility of creating a National Security Council to oversee the development and maintenance of a national security policy.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Agreed, with qualification.</para><para>The Government notes the Committee's recommendation that a national security policy and a National Security Council be developed. However, the Government believes that the two elements of its national security framework, comprising formal national security policy statements and a machinery of national security committees, has demonstrated its effectiveness and suits the constitutional system of Australia. </para><para>Upon taking office in 1996, the Government established two high-level mechanisms for coordinating national security: the National Security Committee of Cabinet (NSCC) as one of Cabinet's standing committees, and the Secretaries Committee on National Security (SCNS). The NSCC is the Government's highest decision-making body on Australia's national security. It considers strategic developments and issues of long term relevance to Australia's broad national security interests. It also oversees federal intelligence and security agencies. The NSCC is chaired by the Prime Minister, and consists of the Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Defence Minister, Treasurer, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney General. Other Ministers, Departmental and Government Agency heads and the Chief of Defence Force are invited to attend depending on the issues under consideration. This Committee oversees the development of Australia's Foreign and Defence policy, ensuring that Australia maintains a coordinated policy approach on national security issues.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2. We recommend that the Department of Defence:</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Enhance and maintain a highly effective and regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability.</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Develop and maintain plans, processes and institutions to enable the defence force to expand to meet significant threats to Australian territory within a warning period of no more than two years.</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. This force should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region, including Australia. This force-in-being should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Agreed, with qualification.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Enhance and maintain a highly effective and regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability.</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the need for highly effective regional surveillance. This need was also highlighted in the White Paper as a priority for Australia's defence capability. As such, information capabilities have been addressed as a separate capability grouping in the Defence Capability Plan, which details the funding and timing for capability projects originating from the White Paper. Additional funding of $34 million has been allocated for intelligence enhancements in 2002-031. This funding commitment will enhance Defence's regionally focused intelligence and surveillance and maintain this highly effective capability. </para><para>Developments in technology are expanding the potential for sustained, 24-hour surveillance of our northern approaches, particularly through the Jindalee Operational Radar Network and other systems. Defence plans to acquire Airborne Early Warning and Control capability and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, while upgrading the AP-3C Orion aircraft. When combined with the ability to fuse data from JORN and other sensor systems, these capability enhancements will help to provide an integrated national surveillance picture. </para><para>Similarly, the Army has continued to emphasise its regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability. Its three Regional Surveillance units deployed across northern Australia form an important part of the total surveillance capability. Their local knowledge and continuous presence within many remote communities is invaluable. In addition, Army's intelligence capability in support of operations has been enhanced with the establishment of the 1st Intelligence Battalion in 2000. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Develop and maintain plans, processes and institutions to enable the defence force to expand to meet significant threats to Australian territory within a warning period of no more than two years.</inline></para><para>The Government believes that the ADF size and capabilities prescribed in the White Paper provide suitable options for managing credible contingencies. The Government remains confident that the White Paper adequately identifies the range of most likely ADF operations in the near future and provides for capable forces to conduct these operations. The development of any new threats will be taken into account through regular strategic reviews, to ensure that the ADF force structure is appropriate for the current and foreseeable future strategic environment.</para><para>White Paper recognises that warning for credible operations may be short. It underlines the need to maintain ADF operational readiness, and also recognises that it is not realistic to assume that there would be sufficient warning time to allow for major new capabilities to be acquired, or for existing ones to be significantly enhanced or expanded.</para><para>The White Paper further identifies that:</para><para>-	it is no longer a priority to provide the basis for the rapid expansion of the Army to a size required for major continental-scale operations; and</para><para>-	Australia must be realistic about the scope of our power and influence and resource limits.</para><para>Given these assessments, the ADF has been directed to place an emphasis on providing a professional, well-equipped, well-trained force that is capable of deploying at short notice and is sustainable over extended periods. Reserve units are a crucial component of the flexibility, professionalism and sustainability of the ADF. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. This force should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region, including Australia. This force-in-being should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning.</inline></para><para>The White Paper and the Defence Capability Plan aim to develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. The White Paper acknowledges the need for the ADF to be capable of operating in more than one theatre concurrently and directs that the ADF be capable of sustaining a deployed brigade for an extended period, and at the same time have at least one battalion group available for deployment elsewhere. Army has developed force rotation models to provide for these contingencies and has two brigades and a battalion group capable of deploying on warfighting operations within four months' warning time. This reflects the committee's recommendation that the force-in-being should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region and that this force should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning. </para><para>The Government notes the community concern on this point, referred to in the supplementary report2, which is similar to that expressed in response to the pre-White Paper public discussion paper Defence Review 20003. In both instances, the community expressed concern that the ADF should have a balanced structure, which is not overly formula-driven and is able to cope with all eventualities, while at the same time maintaining a focus on the defence of Australia. The White Paper approach is designed to allow maximum flexibility to ensure that Defence planning does not leave us with a set of capabilities that is too narrowly focussed on specific scenarios. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3. We recommend that the Army be capable of:</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Maintaining a force-in-being of four brigades optimised for operations within Australia</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s ACSI and capable of deploying within no more than four months warning.</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Generating an additional eight brigades within two years of warning for operations within Australia</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s Area of Critical Security Interest (ACSI).</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Not Agreed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Maintaining a force-in-being of four brigades optimised for operations within Australia</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s ACSI and capable of deploying within no more than four months warning.</inline></para><para>Army does not have four brigades optimised for operations and capable of deploying with no more than four months warning. As stated in response to Recommendation 2, the Army has two brigades and a battalion group capable of deploying on warfighting operations within four months' warning time. In addition, elements such as the Special Forces can be available well within four months warning. The Government considers this to be sufficient deployable capability to meet Australia's current strategic objectives. </para><para>This deployable capability is drawn from a current land force that is based on two full-time, one integrated4 and six part-time5 brigades. The Army has an approved funding limit of 25,785 full time Army personnel for the financial year 2002-03. The Army is planned to grow to 26,271 full time personnel by 2010, but current recruiting levels indicate that Army may achieve this before 2010.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">For protracted deployments, force rotations are likely to require substantial support from the Reserve component. Therefore the role of the Reserves has changed from providing a partially trained force for mobilisation in the event of a major crisis, to providing fully trained personnel to round out, reinforce and rotate with forces already deployed. To facilitate this, new Reserve legislative provisions (detailed in response to Recommendation 8) have been enacted to enhance the range of options for call-out. Provisions for protection of a Reservist</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s employment, education and financial situation have also been enacted, in addition to improved recruitment, retention and training provisions. </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Generating an additional eight brigades within two years of warning for operations within Australia</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s Area of Critical Security Interest (ACSI).</inline></para><para>The Government acknowledges the changes made to this recommendation in the committee's supplementary report, in which the recommendation that Army be capable of generating an additional eight brigades within two years notice, is revised down to four brigades. Notwithstanding the Committee's revised recommendation, the Government has directed in the White Paper that Army expand the number of infantry battalions at high readiness from four to six.</para><para>The Government believes that the task of generating an additional eight brigades within two years would place very heavy demands on personnel, equipment and training resources, that would not be justified by our strategic circumstances, and would absorb resources that would detract from our ability to maintain a balanced Defence force. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4.

Firstly, operational information of this type is security classified and therefore could not be included in a public report. Secondly, if brigade-level reporting on Army were to be balanced by an equally detailed level of reporting for the other Services, annual reporting would risk becoming excessively lengthy and cumbersome. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">On alternate years, the Inspector General of the Department of Defence and the National Audit Office (ANAO), audit and report on the Army</inline><inline font-weight="bold">'</inline><inline font-weight="bold">s capability for force expansion.</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the ANAO's comment on this recommendation, that Army periodic reporting is essentially a matter for the Army and Defence rather than the ANAO, and notes the committee's acceptance of this in the supplementary report6. The Government does not agree, however, that such reporting should necessarily involve the Inspector-General.</para><para>The Government notes the supplementary report's suggestion that the ANAO should report to Parliament in 24 months (from September 2001) on the efficacy of the Army capability audit program. Defence has no opposition to this suggestion, if the ANAO considers such reporting to be of value.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5. We recommend that the Army force structure be reviewed, such that:</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">There should be no single unit or formation present in the force structure unless it is able to detach useful capability in components.

These components need to be in multiples of three</inline><inline font-weight="bold">â</inline><inline font-weight="bold">a component in commitment; a component returning and a component being prepared for deployment.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Where multiple units or formations exist in the force structure they must exist in multiples of three.</inline></para><para>The Government accepts that Army capabilities should be able to be sustained but does not agree with the blanket application of a âmultiples of threeâ principle. Army force rotation models are often structured in multiples of three to reflect a component in commitment, a component returning and a component being prepared for deployment. However, it would not be prudent to apply the trilogy structure rigidly. </para><para>Australia's strategic environment requires a flexible force that is capable of conducting varied operations, including the use of specialist forces. Some capabilities may only need to be employed once during an operation (eg. parachute or commando capabilities), and domestic operations will generally require less unit rotations than overseas ones. Such operational variables, combined with funding constraints, dictate that it is not viable or necessary to ensure that all units are structured in triplicate. </para><para>The committee's supplementary report asserted that:</para><para>...the decision to retain different, unique and individual capabilities at the brigade level and lower is seen ...as more an inability to make a suitable decision on force structure than a desire for flexibility7.</para><para>This assertion is incorrect. The deliberate and informed nature of Army force structure decision-making, has been demonstrated in the development of a combat force sustainment model, which meets the strategic sustainment, and rotation requirements set out in the White Paper. This model informs the Single Entitlement Document (SED) Review process that is being used to implement changes to Army's force structure. </para><para>The SED Review is a rolling three-year program, which reviews every personnel position and every equipment line number attributed to each unit. This will achieve the following:</para><para>-	implementation of force structure changes;</para><para>-	validation of unit capability and structure for the conduct of assigned roles and tasks;</para><para>-	standardisation of like Army units;</para><para>-	elimination of hollowness in unit structures; and</para><para>-	improvement of visibility of the true cost of a given capability or unit. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Where neither of these conditions can be satisfied the capability being sought should either:</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Be reduced to a force size that can meet the structuring principle, or</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Be removed from the force structure.</inline></para><para>The Committee's suggestion that unit numbers be reduced until multiples of three can be achieved is not viable given the currently high levels of the Army's operational tempo, and the Committee's own recommendation that Force in being be expanded. Further, it is clearly not sensible to remove these vital force support elements from the force structure altogether, simply because they fail to meet rotation model requirements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6. We recommend that the Army maintain its capability focus on the conduct of warfighting. This focus should be based on meeting or exceeding regional technical performance parameters up to, and including, mid-intensity conflict. We further recommend that the Army enhance or develop capabilities for:</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Terminal Operations (i.e. the equivalent of military stevedoring operations).</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">Civil Affairs (i.e. the capability on deployment to establish and maintain a relationship between the Army and the government, civil population and/or other agencies in order to facilitate the resolution of conflict and the re-establishment of normal civil life).</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Agreed with qualification</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">We recommend that the Army maintain its capability focus on the conduct of warfighting. </inline></para><para>The Government agrees that the Army focus be on warfighting. The White Paper clearly stated that the Government requires a capable defence force that is trained and equipped to meet the demands of conventional wars between states. It also stated that, even with the greater prominence of military operations other than conventional war, the military capabilities needed for the latter types of operations will have a lot in common with those we develop for more conventional conflicts. Accordingly, the Government's plan for developing land force capabilities over the next decade includes the most significant enhancements to Army's combat power in many years.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">This focus should be based on meeting or exceeding regional technical performance parameters up to, and including, mid-intensity conflict.</inline></para><para>The Government agrees that the performance standards of regional military forces should be a factor in setting the standard for our own Defence force.

This has been achieved through force structure changes to the Logistic Support Force (LSF), with the provision of an additional 450 personnel to support the deployment to East Timor. These increased personnel levels have been maintained after East Timor, and a further 192 positions have since been provided to the LSF. In turn, the number of LSF Terminal Operations trainees has increased.

ADF experience has confirmed the close connection between successful operations and the restoration and support of civil authority.

The civil affairs function is currently being performed as required by a combination of Reserve personnel with specific expertise and personnel from other units (when the nature of the contingency allows them to serve in a secondary role). On occasions, medical, engineering and transport units can contribute to civil affairs tasks as required, provided there is no detriment to their core operational tasks.</para><para>It is important to note, though, that the Defence contribution to this function is rarely in isolation, with other government agencies, the United Nations and non-government organisations having major roles. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7.

A voluntary Reservist option similar to Category B does exist in which Reservists can choose to complete a full time Common Induction Training period for around six months, after which they revert to the normal Reserve part time commitment in a designated unit. This arrangement differs from Category B in that the continuous training period is classed as part of the Army Reserve annual training requirement, rather than full time service. But in essence the outcome is the same.</para><para>As the committee's supplementary report acknowledges, a number of initiatives have been put in place since the release of From Phantom to Force in 2000, and these were important steps for the ADF's personnel structure. These include amended legislation allowing Reservists to be deployed anywhere in the world, and The Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001, which provides for employment, financial and education protection across the spectrum of Reserve service. </para><para>The supplementary report raises concern about the apparent lack of a defined role for the Reserves12. However, the Government has addressed this issue with a better defined and expanded role for Reserves as part of the ADF deployable force structure. The development Army's Combat Force Sustainment Model will refine the role and tasks to be undertaken by Reserves as specified in Defence 2000. It should also be acknowledged that the Reserve is making a contribution to Army's current capability by providing reinforcements to units deploying to East Timor and Bougainville, and rifle companies to Butterworth, Malaysia. Since November 2002 two Reserve companies have been deployed concurrently:</para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">one is in East Timor with the 5th/7th Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment; and </inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-weight="bold">the other is undertaking training independently as the Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9.

This ensures that the higher readiness units are given priority for available resources. </para><para>Within current resources, 20 percent full time staffing levels in all units could only be achieved by creating hollowness in high readiness full time units to reallocate full time manning to low readiness part time units. This would significantly impact on capability and morale. As a result, the Government does not consider it practicable for no unit to be staffed with less than 20 per cent full-time staffing.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Transition of soldiers between Categories is to be administratively simple. This includes a standardised system of performance evaluation based on merit.</inline></para><para>Transfers between the Regular Army and the Reserves happen regularly, to provide specialist augmentation, to better meet the needs of the Army and of Army personnel.</para><para>The Government recognises that it is important that this process is administratively simple. Army is currently re-designing its training to accord with the requirements of Competency Based Training and Assessment. This program is the basis of the Army Training System, under which standards are being aligned for both Regular and Reserve training.</para><para>At the point of graduation, the standards for both the Regular and the Reservist are the same. Naturally as the Regular is employed full-time and gains experience he/she can be expected to improve those skills. The Reservist on the other hand, who may not be able to utilise all their skills all the time, may lose skills to some degree. However, this is measurable and is taken into account before a Reservist is selected for any form of full-time or operational service.</para><para>Currently the Army provides a standardised system of assessment, with Reserve officers and senior non-commissioned officers subject to regular performance appraisal, and all soldiers participating in the Army Individual Readiness Notice system.  </para><para>With regard to attendance at courses, there are occasions where attendance by a Reservist may be a lower priority than that for a Regular. Wherever possible, courses are refined to assist Reservists in making the necessary time commitments to attend continuous service training for significant periods. This refinement of training in no way reduces the quality, the training objectives or standards to be achieved by the Reservist.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A graduated system of employment conditions that covers issues such as superannuation, injury compensation and housing assistance.</inline></para><para>The Government notes the committee's recommendation for a graduated system of employment conditions that covers issues such as superannuation, injury compensation and housing assistance. The service conditions of Regular and Reserve personnel differ substantially. For the majority of Reservists, the Army is not their primary source of income. Thus, for the part-time soldier tax-free pay is a more relevant incentive than superannuation. Similarly, Reservists will not be posted outside their own locality; thus most housing allowances are more relevant to their Regular colleagues who have to deal with posting turbulence. The Government has extended eligibility for the Defence Home Owner Scheme to Reservists, and has introduced legislation to protect Reservists' civilian employment, education and financial situation when rendering military service. The Government is also considering the recently completed Nunn Review with a view to optimising the conditions of service for all ADF members.</para><para>Reservists on part-time service are covered for workplace injury in the same manner as all other ADF members on peace-time continuous full time service who enlisted on or after 23 May 1986. Reservists on full-time service are covered for workplace injury in the same manner as all other ADF members serving in the same workplace.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10.

The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $13.409 million.</para><para>The need for the proposed work is driven by Customs' objective of collocating its two existing Sydney offices at a single purpose-built premises within the Sydney Airport precinct. </para><para>At present, Customs occupies two premises in Sydney: Link Road, within the Airport Precinct and 447 Pitt Street in Sydney's CBD. The decision to relocate is timely given that the leases on both properties expire in 2003. </para><para>The degenerating condition of the Link Road building, witnessed by the committee during their inspection of the site, provides further impetus for the proposed works. At present, the building has air quality and air-conditioning problems, and requires significant annual repairs at Customs' expense.</para><para>Customs expects rationalisation and consolidation of its accommodation to result in a number of operational and administrative benefits, including cost and infrastructure efficiencies, technological improvements in services, enhanced corporate identity, increased amenity to clients and efficiencies in work allocation and resource use.</para><para>As the new premises will be purpose-built to meet Customs' requirements, Customs will have the opportunity to integrate many of its specific needs into the base-building works. This will reduce tenant fit-out costs and increase the amenity of the building for Customs' operations.</para><para>The works required to meet Customs' objectives comprise:</para><para>Â·	integration of electrical, mechanical, security, communications, fire and hydraulic services into base-building works;</para><para>Â·	fit-out of investigations rooms, evidence rooms, operation rooms and a control room to meet special Customs requirements; and</para><para>Â·	general office fit-out, including reception facilities, security-controlled access, partitioning and open-plan work areas, workstations, enclosed offices, computer room, meeting rooms, personal and common storage facilities, conference and training facilities, a first aid room, utility rooms, a carer's room, kitchens, a gymnasium, lockers and showers.</para><para>At the public hearing, Customs informed the committee of two changes that had been incorporated into the design of the new building since the agency's evidence was submitted in March 2003. Under the new design, it is proposed that the building will be reoriented to have a more northerly aspect; and will have one central core rather than three.</para><para>Customs believe that these changes will significantly improve the overall building design, in that reorientation will increase energy efficiency and the single core will enhance overall operational efficiency and will improve the flexibility of internal configuration.</para><para>Questions asked at the public hearing arose chiefly from evidence that Customs staff had expressed some concerns in relation to their relocation. In particular, staff had raised issues with respect to:</para><para>Â·	increased travel times and costs;</para><para>Â·	parking arrangements;</para><para>Â·	the provision of child care facilities; and </para><para>Â·	access to food outlets.</para><para>Customs demonstrated they were working to address all the issues raised by staff.

The opposition has long indicated to the government its support for these bills, subject to the outcome of the Senate committee inquiry and subject to draft regulations being made available to the Senate prior to our deliberations on the bills. In relation to these two conditions, the Senate has tabled its report but, despite an undertaking from the Treasurer's office some months ago, the opposition and, therefore, the parliament and the Australian people still await the draft regulations. In matters such as this, where regulations will contain the detailâthat is where the devil will be, of courseâof how this legislation will work, it is crucial that parliament has the opportunity to properly consider them before or at least concurrently with the current legislation. When I say `consider them', I mean that parliament should take them into account in the context of the appropriate form of the legislation. Indeed, there is a strong tradition of that occurring. To their credit, most ministers within the Howard government follow this course in the interests of getting their bills through parliament and, in some instances, in the pursuit of good public policy, but not in this case. </para><para>The <inline ref="R1745">Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003</inline> is a Treasury bill, and I note that the statement that was tabled by Senator Hill says that this portfolio does not follow the practice of circulating draft regulations. One wonders why this portfolio takes a different view from other departments, other ministers and other portfolios to assisting in the pursuit of legislation through this chamber. We hear the government talk about a lack of cooperation from the Senate. What could be a greater demonstration of the government's desire to frustrate the will of the Senate in seeking to cooperate with the government than for this portfolio to refuse to circulate draft regulations? That point is emphasised even more by the fact that the tabled statement indicates that the draft regulations were circulated to industry, albeit on a confidential basis, on 15 May. </para><para>Members of the tax office fuel grant advisory forum are entitled, apparently, to see these draft regulations but the Senate is not so entitled in its consideration of the legislation. If it is germane for the draft to be with the industry before the legislation is passed, one wonders why the minister in this case has chosen not to share that information with the Senate. The government comes to this place, it says, seeking the cooperation of the Senate to pass its legislation and to allow it to fulfil its mandate. It ought to come here with clean hands. In this case, by refusing to supply this information, this minister is saying, `I don't believe I need to cooperate with the Senate.' We will say to you, `Block this legislation and stop this measure coming into place.' That is what we are prepared to say. What the Senate has required of this minister is the production of this information. I stress again: it is information which has already been supplied to others outside this place. If it is good enough for them, it is good enough for the Senate under the order of the Senate. Obviously, we will pursue this matter further in the debate on the legislation but I thank the Senate for the opportunity to respond today.  </para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>12051</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>12051</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThe President has received a letter from a party leader seeking variations to the membership of committees.</para></talk.start><para>Senator HILL (South AustraliaâMinister for Defence) (3.52 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Finance and Public Administration References Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSubstitute member: Senator Bartlett to replace Senator Ridgeway for the committee's inquiry into the administrative review of veteran and military compensation and income support issues</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</inline>â</para><para>AppointedâSubstitute member: Senator Bartlett to replace Senator Ridgeway for the committee's inquiry into health care needs of Australian Defence Force members and veterans with overseas service.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MEDICARE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>12051</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>12051</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para></motion><para>(a)	condemns the most damaging effects of the Government's proposed reforms to Medicare, which will create a user-pays, two-tiered health system in Australia and dismantle the universality of Medicare;</para><para>(b)	acknowledges that the first of the damaging effects of the Government's reform package is to cause bulk-billing rates to decline further, and that these reforms do nothing to encourage doctors to bulk bill any Australians other than pensioners and concession cardholders but make it clear that the Government considers bulk billing to be a privilege that accrues only to a subset of Australians, not an entitlement that all Australians have as a result of the Medicare charge;</para><para>(c)	notes that the second most damaging effect of the Government's proposed changes to Medicare is the facilitation and encouragement of higher and higher co-payments to be charged by medical practitioners, and that a central plank of the Government's package is the facilitation of co-payments to be charged by doctors who currently bulk bill Australian families, as well as to make it easier for doctors who currently charge a co-payment to increase the amount of this co-payment; and</para><para>(d)	notes, with concern, that the Government seeks to allow private health funds to offer insurance for out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $1 000, a measure which, if implemented, would inflate health insurance premiums as well as be a real step towards a user-pays system in Australia where people who can afford co-payments and insurance premiums will be treated when they are sick, whereas those individuals and families on lower incomes will be forced to go without medical assistance. </para><para>The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his coalition government are set on a path to destroy Australia's internationally regarded health system. This government is threatening the fabric of a system designed to provide quality health care to all Australians. Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and our public hospital system are all under attack. The Howard government's proposed changes to health care will effectively create a user pays, two-tier system in Australia where the average family will simply pay more and more. We are seeing in Australia an Americanisation of our health care system because this government just does not believe in Medicare. Mr Howard said so himself, and has been saying so for a very long time. In a media release in 1986 he said, `Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.' On radio in June 1987 he said, `The second thing we'll do is get rid of bulk-billing.' He went on to say, `We will be proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling; we'll pull it right apart.' These are the Prime Minister's words over many years about the system of health care in Australia that all of usâall Australiansâcherish. </para><para>Mr Howard has never believed in Medicare, and we are now seeing its de facto dismantling. Mr Howard got a bit smarter though as he went along. He now does not attack Medicare directly like he did in the 1980s. He now knows that Australians believe in Medicare, and we have repeatedly had information at estimates that supports that viewâthat the public do value a Medicare system that is accessible and affordable. Instead of publicly attacking Medicare, he has been slowly undermining it since 1996, but in a far more insidious way.</para><para>Under Labor, bulk-billing increased every year to a peak of 80 per cent in 1996. Every year since 1996âsince the election of Mr Howard's governmentâit has decreased. GP bulk-billing is now below 70 per cent nationally and, in many regional areas around the country, has dropped to well below 50 per cent. If you do not have access to bulk-billing, you do not have access to Medicare, and in many centres we have pretty well reached that situation. In my home state of Queensland we have GP bulk-billing percentage rates in the low 40s in Hinkler and Capricornia. In Dawson and Herbert, bulk-billing is around the 60 per cent level. In Leichhardt it is just in the 70s. Even in the electorate of Brisbane, GP bulk-billing has dropped 20 per cent in the last two years to 63.9 per cent. In Queensland, from Brisbane to the Torres Strait, bulk-billing is disappearing. The same thing is happening all around the country. My colleague Senator Forshaw will speak more about this in detail in his contribution.</para><para>However, we can be certain that Mr Howard, as he has said previously, wants to dismantle Medicare. He does not believe in bulk-billing and he never will. Only Labor believes in Medicare and we will rebuild it. Only Labor has a plan to reform and reinvigorate Medicare. Under a Crean Labor government, we will save Medicare with a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse in bulk-billing by lifting the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. A Crean Labor government will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the schedule feeâan average increase of $3.35 per consultationâand a Crean Labor government will subsequently lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 100 per cent of the schedule feeâan average increase of $5 per consultation. </para><para>In addition, Labor will offer financial incentives to doctors to not only keep treating their patients without additional cost but also extend bulk-billing, especially in outer metropolitan areas and regional areas, where the collapse in bulk-billing is hurting families the most. Doctors in metropolitan areas will receive an additional $7,500 each year for bulk-billing 80 per cent or more of their patients. Doctors in outer metropolitan areas and major regional centres will receive an additional $15,000 a year for bulk-billing 75 per cent or more of their patients. Doctors in rural and regional areas will receive an additional $22,500 a year for bulk-billing 70 per cent or more of their patients. Lifting the patient rebate and introducing financial incentives for bulk-billing will help stem the current dramatic decline in bulk-billing and act to make bulk-billing available to more Australian families. Under Mr Howard, bulk-billing has declined by more than 12 percentage points from a high of 80.6 per cent to 68.5 per cent today. By offering GPs a significant increase in the Medicare rebate and financial incentives to meet bulk-billing targets, Labor will restore bulk-billing to respectable levels again. These measures are the first step towards Labor's objective of lifting the average national rate of bulk-billing back to where it was under Labor of 80 per cent or more.</para><para>The decline in bulk-billing is denying families access to affordable health care, forcing them to pay more and more to see their doctor, despite the fact that Australians have paid for Medicare through their taxes and their Medicare levy for the last 20 years. We only have to look back at history to know that only Labor believes in Medicare. When Labor was elected in 1941, Chifley was determined to implement a national health service. However, the civil conscription clause in the Constitution, limiting the regulation of doctors, and the election of the Menzies Liberal government in 1949, prevented him at that time from establishing a national health service. In 1953, Prime Minister Menzies, whom we know Mr Howard absolutely idolises, established the Earle Page system. The scheme was primarily a method whereby the Commonwealth government subsidised private health insurance by meeting part of the cost of rebates for medical expensesâand doesn't that ring a bell? This is what Mr Howard wantsâa 1950s health care system. Mr Howard and his government believe in private health insurance, not in a universal health system where everyone has access to quality care. They believe in a two-tiered system where the quality of care you receive depends on the size of your wallet, not the level of your need.</para><para>When Labor was re-elected in 1972, Prime Minister Whitlam again proposed a national health service and Medibank was eventually born. However, Labor had to fight the coalition opposition to establish Medibank. The opposition controlled the Senate and blocked the bills establishing Medibank, forcing a double dissolution election to be called in 1974. Health care was a centrepiece of the subsequent election campaign, which we know, of course, Labor won. But the coalition again blocked the legislation in the Senate. How many times was that? That was two. Medibank was therefore only established following a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives in August 1974.</para><para>With the election of the Fraser government, of which Mr Howard eventually became the Treasurer, the coalition once again began the process of deconstructing Medibank. By 1981 there was essentially a return to the Earle Page scheme, with Commonwealth subsidies only paid to members of registered funds. Contributions to funds became eligible for taxation rebates and eventually free treatment in hospitals was eliminated in every state except Queensland. All of us in Queensland would remember the battle that was had within the coalition for the retention of our free public health system. The Liberal Party has always been opposed to a public health system with equal access for all Australians and, I am afraid to say, the National Party of today is no different. </para><para>With Labor in power for an extended period, from 1983 to 1996, Australia finally obtained the health system it deserved. Medicare was established and Australia again had a universal health system, a system where everybody would have access to quality health care, importantly, irrespective of where they lived. As we know, Medicare has three objectives: firstly, to make health care affordable for all Australians; secondly, to give Australians access to health care services with priority according to clinical need; and, thirdly, to provide a high quality of care. The Liberal Party have always fought against the notion of equal access to health care. They are still opposed to that, and this brief history certainly demonstrates it.</para><para>Most Australians, however, value Medicare and understand the need for a health care system where you are treated based on your need rather than on the money in your pocket. They want a fair system, one where everybody has access to quality health care. Mr Howard, as I said earlier, understands the political consequences of openly attacking Medicare. He campaigned against Medicare in 1984, 1987, 1990 and again in 1993. He lost all of those elections. He is not openly going to go there again but he is determined to dismantle it. Finding a bulk-billing doctor is almost impossible in much of Australia, and the government's Medicare package will only make that worse. When the health minister, Senator Patterson, launched the Medicare package, she said that the government's Medicare changes were `for all Australians'âechoes of 1996, when Mr Howard was elected as Prime Minister and his slogan was `For all of us'. Everyone knows now that his government is only for some of us. It was an intriguing use of words by the health minister. We now know that Medicare will be just for some of us. It is a return to that longstanding public policy view of the 1980s that bulk-billing should be restricted to the disadvantaged and doctors should be free to charge everyone else whatever they like.</para><para>These changes to Medicare can mean only one thingâa two-tiered user-pays system under which Australian families will pay more to visit their doctor. Doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill concession cardholdersâa de facto means testâbut they will be given the green light to charge higher fees for everybody else. In estimates some weeks ago, no evidence was provided by the minister or her department to support the view that gap payments will not increaseâno evidence at all. Australian families with two children who earn more than $32,300 a yearânot a lot of moneyâare not eligible for a concession card. For them bulk-billing will end and, when they visit their GP, bit by bit they will be asked to pay more.</para><para>The government, though, is not happy to simply destroy bulk-billing; it also wants to destroy our public hospital system. The information from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the federal government's share of expenditure on public hospitals has been in decline since the Howard government came to office. At the same time, the states share of public hospital funding has been on the increase. It is estimated that the federal government has cut $628 million out of public hospitals under the current health care agreement with the states, and it plans, as we know, to cut even more from public hospitals. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AUF</name.id><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator Barnett</name></talker><para>âThat is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>âThis year's budget, the forward estimates, shows that the Howard government is withdrawing funding for public hospitals to fund its Medicare package. It is almost dollar for dollar, Senator, and you know it. The accident and emergency departments of our public hospitals are already under greater pressure. Instead of recognising the pressure they are under, the government is withdrawing a further $918 million over four years from our public hospital system. This cut in funding will lead to fewer nurses being employed, fewer operations being undertaken and longer waiting lists for elective surgery. This cut to public hospitals precisely offsets the budgetary impact of the government's $917 million Medicare packageârobbing Peter to pay Paul. These fundamental changes will destroy Medicare and put an end to bulk-billing for Australian families. Over the five-year period from 2003-04 to 2007-08 the total funding withdrawn from public hospitals is in the order of $1.5 billion. As well as attacking Medicare, this government is attacking our public hospital system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Howard promotes the private health care system at every chance he gets. At the same time our public system continues to struggle. The 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance actively encourages people into the private health system. The Howard government's planned increases in pharmaceutical copayments and falling bulk-billing rates are increasingly making basic health care unaffordable. This is combined with a public hospital system in crisis because the Howard government continues to cut its funding. The government is well on its way to achieving the same thing today. The coalition and in particular Mr Howard do not like Medicare. They hate Medicare and they want to destroy it. They have campaigned against it over and over again. However, they have learnt the hard way that Australians love their Medicare and they respect the need for a health system that everyone can access based on need. Mr Howard knows as a politician that he simply cannot announce the scrapping of Medicare so what he is doing is slowly dismantling it, undermining it and destroying it by stealth. History and his actions support this contention.</para><para>The continued decline in bulk-billing is just a continuation of the government's attacks on public health care. What will a coalition health system look like? We need look no further than the United States of America, where the quality of care you receive is determined by the size of your bank balance. Basically it is a system in which the average Australian must have private health insurance if they want quality health care. The declining rate of bulk-billing attacks Medicare's first objective: to make health care affordable for all Australians. The proposed increases in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments will have a similar effect. Labor opposes these measures because we believe in a fair public health system. We will again invest in our public health system and increase bulk-billing rates. Only Labor believes in Medicare, our public hospitals and the principle that everyone should have access to quality health care.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>12055</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI stand in total opposition to the motion put by Senator McLucas. I plan to dismantle the arguments put by the Labor Party one by one, and to put the facts on the table so that the Australian public can clearly understand what is in their best interests and what is in the best interests of our health system here in Australia. We have a very good health system and it has improved markedly since 1996 under the Howard government. The three key strands regarding the universality of Medicare relate to, firstly, the rebate. I am going to talk about the Medicare rebate and the track record of Labor in the last six years of the Labor government, prior to 1996, and compare that to the track record of our coalition government. I am also going to speak to the merits of the initiative, which is a $917 million injection into the Medicare system that has recently been announced and is currently being blocked by the opposition parties in this Senate. </para></talk.start><para>Secondly, I am going to rebut the totally unfounded, baseless allegations and misrepresentations made by Senator McLucas and other members of the Labor Party in the public arena regarding the funding of public hospitals. Thirdly, I will be addressing the comments that have been made regarding the PBS and make very clear the facts regarding the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Fourthly, I am going to make a comment about prevention, which is really a fourth strand of the universality of Medicare. Prevention is always better than cure.</para><para>Firstly, to the bulk-billing arguments: if you believed what you saw in the newspapers and what has been alleged by the Labor Party then you would think that this federal coalition government was actually cutting funding to Medicare. You would think that there has been a big slash in funding. Nothing could be further from the truth; it is in fact the exact oppositeâan injection of $917 million. The system has not changed. We are proposing an increase of nearly $1 billion. Let us just walk through that. There is no means test. As is the case now, doctors will remain in control of their billing practices, and they can choose to provide care at no cost to any patient regardless of whether or not they hold a Commonwealth concession card. Remember there are seven million Australians with concession cards out there who in particular will benefit under these proposals of the coalition government. Doctors will be free to bulk-bill whomever they choose but, for the first time, we are strengthening the availability of bulk-billing for those concession cardholders. As I say, there are seven million Australians who will benefit, particularly people in the outer metropolitan areas and the rural areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âThey should be getting it now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AUF</name.id><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name></talker><para>âWe will come to your policyâthe Labor policyâwith respect to rural and regional Australia and the discrimination under the Labor policy.

I want the facts on the table. Let me make it clear: res ipsa loquitur. That is Latin for letting the facts speak for themselves. I am walking through the facts and the Labor Party do not like it. They do not like to listen to the facts. Under our system, in the city areas the doctors that sign up for bulk-billing will receive $3,500 extra. But benefits will flow to the rural and regional areas and the outer metropolitan areas because doctors will receive $22,000. In Tasmania, for example, in places like Ross, Campbell Town, Queenstown and St Helensârural and regional townsâaccess to bulk-billing will be strengthened. There is no denying that. There will be an extra $22,000. Towns like Launcestonâmy home townâBurnie and Devonport will receive $18,500 under our system. For the GPs in those areas, that is a great incentive to bulk-bill. The incentives in fact are going to be indexed by the CPI and that is appropriate. There is nothing in this Medicare package that should increase doctors' fees. In fact, the vast majority of doctors will be financially better off if they choose to participate in the GP access scheme. Doctors will continue to be able to provide care at no cost. It is at their discretion and it is their option. The universality of Medicare will be retained. Everyone will continue to have access to the Medicare rebate when they visit their GP. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to get on to the record of the Labor Party in that regard. Firstly at the momentâlet us make it clearâseven out of 10 services are still bulk-billed in this country. What is true is that the government subsidised visits by Australians to GPs to the tune of almost $2.8 billion last calendar year. Under the coalition government, the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation has increased by $4.20 or 20 per cent since 1996. What is the record of the previous Labor government under Paul Keating? There was a reference to Robert Menzies so let us make a reference to Paul Keating. In the last six years of Labor, what did the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation rise by? Was it $4.20? No, it was $1.70 or less than nine per cent. So we stand by our record of a 20 per cent increase compared to Labor's nine per cent. Under Labor in its last six years in government the Medicare rebate for longer consultations increased by only five per cent to $65.20. What is our record? In the past six years of this government, the rebate for longer consultations has increased by 23 per cent to $80.40. As I say, the facts speak for themselvesâres ipsa loquitur.</para><para>While we are talking about Labor, let us see what Dr Blewett, the former health minister under Labor, said about it in 1987:</para><quote><para>What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention.</para></quote><para>We know what the Labor Party stood for in 1987. We have Senator McLucas going back to 1986 with quotes. Let us compare those quotes and those commitments that were made at that time. We know what Labor stand for. We know that they actually want an increase in the Medicare levy. The opposition have a track record of increasing taxes. They have a track record of pushing up the government debt. It was $96 million when we came into government in 1996 and that has been cut back big time under the Howard coalition. Let us have a look at some of the other facts regarding the Medicare rebate and Labor's proposal. What did Kerryn Phelps, the former President of the AMA, have to say about Labor's proposal to pay doctors who bulk-bill more than those who do not? She said, `Effectively, it abandons the universality of the Medicare rebate.' What hypocrisy have we got here? We have Labor standing here today accusing us of dismantling Medicare, yet there is Kerryn Phelps of the AMA saying that. Have a look at that quote and you will be hoisted with your own petard. You are caught out by the AMA.</para><para>Let us look at the Medicare rebate and how, under our package, there is a benefit. There are special incentive payments for doctorsâand a lot of people are probably not aware of thisâwhich give them the resources and the time to manage patients with diseases such as diabetes and asthma, and with mental health issues. Did you know that there is $46 million extraâin addition, to all the incentives that I have already outlined, which are in the A Fairer Medicare package? There are incentives for doctors to manage patients with, for example, diabetes. The current initiative is some $46 million over several years, and that is to help early diagnosis of people with diabetes. It is a good initiative. It is a good move. It is an incentive payment. It is called a PIP paymentâa Practice Incentive Program payment.  </para><para>The Labor Party failed to mention that. I want to get the facts on the table during this debate so that the Australian public can know who to support and which health policy is better. There are practice incentive payments not only with respect to doctors but also with respect to nurses. Labor have made no mention of that anywhere in the discussion today or previously. They simply ignore the facts, and that is not good enough. When you put all those special payments togetherâthe practice incentive payments and the other special payments for doctorsâon average they receive nearly $18,000 a year in additional income, over and above the Medicare rebate. That is not to be sniffed at. It helps, and I can assure you that it is appreciated by the medical fraternity.</para><para>Let us move on to the public hospital system. We need to dismantle the argumentâthe totally baseless and unfounded allegationâthat there has been a $1 billion cut under the government's proposal to support the public hospital system. I have never heard such nonsense in all my life. Under this proposal the Commonwealth government is increasing funding by an extra $10 billion over the next five years, to a total of $42 billion, for the provision of free public hospitals in this country. That is a real increase of 17 per cent over that period of time. It is the biggest commitment to the public hospital system ever in the history of the Australian health system, and it is happening under the Howard coalition government.</para><para>What are the states doing? Senator McLucas did not mention the state Labor governments when she was talking about public hospitals. Let us have a look at their track record. There is no mention about that because they are the culprits in terms of inadequate funding for our public hospital system. The big test with regard to the real 17 per cent increaseâwhich is a $10 billion increase over five years and, as far as Tasmania is concerned, is a $220 million increase over the next five yearsâis: will the state Labor governments sign up? They say, `No, it is inadequate.' Will they match the commitment? Has it been said publicly anywhere, any time by any state premier in this country that they will at least meet the 17 per cent real increase in funding to public hospitals? Not once. They have not said that. They simply pooh-pooh the agreement and the proposal and they will not agree to match, or better, the increase. If it is inadequate, surely at minimum they would at least meet the agreement? Surely, they would! No. The writing is on the wall. The facts are on the table. The assessment of the budget papers put forward by Senator McLucas is simply not there. They know what is in the proposal by the Howard government, and they cannot get away from it.</para><para>Let us look at the facts with respect to public hospital funding. I have mentioned the $220 million increase in Tasmania, which is a 17 per cent increase in real terms. Using my state as an example, if Tasmania will not sign the hospital agreement, including a commitment to match the rate of growth in federal fundingâthat is the key pointâit will receive $836.9 million over the five years, or $85 million less than the optimum amount. Let us consider the following points. The federal government's share of spending on hospitals nationally grew from 45.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent between 1997 and 2001, while state and territory spending fell from 47.2 per cent to 43.4 per cent. That is a four per cent drop. The federal funding commitment has increased, while the Labor state and territory government funding commitments have decreased by four per cent over that four-year period.  </para><para>The federal government's 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance led to an increase in private hospital admissions of 18,098 in Tasmania, which was an increase of 38 per cent between 1998 and 2001. This has eased the burden on the public hospital system. Putting more people into the private sector takes the pressure off the public hospital system. Again, this has not been acknowledged by the Labor Party and the other opposition parties. Let us have a look at this, because this will be good for all Australians. It will reduce waiting lists. For example, the most urgent elective surgery for category 1 patients in Tasmanian hospitals increased from 22 per cent of total admissions in 1998-99 to 29 per cent of total admissions in 2000-01. It has increased. Why do we allow it? I call on the Australian people to write to or otherwise contact their local state member of parliament and the state premiers and ask them to sign up to the agreementâto say: `Please sign up. This will be good for me and this will help reduce waiting lists and waiting times in public hospitals all around this country.' I would like to say a lot more about that, but time does not allow me.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWell said.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AUF</name.id><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name></talker><para>âThank you for that interjection and for the support and encouragement, my fellow senators McGauran and Boswell. I would like to comment on the PBSâthe third tier of the universal Medicare systemâvery quickly because of the time factor. In 1990 the PBS cost $1 billion. This past year, it cost nearly $5 billionâ$4.8 billion. It is unsustainable. And it is the opposition parties that are blocking this initiative in the Senate. What we need is affordability and sustainability, which the Australian public is being denied as a result of this obstruction by the Labor Party. Present payments mean that patients pay $22.40 for their subsidised drugs or just $4.60 per prescription for concession cardholders. They are the facts. I have put them on the table. If the Labor Party would simply support that initiative, it would go through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have type 1 diabetes. There are new drugs coming onto the market which will help people with diabetes. There are a million people with diabetes out there. Make no mistake: of those people, about 800,000 of them are type 2. There is a drug called glitazone. It is important that we try to get that onto the PBS. How can we get all these new drugs, which modern day Australia and modern science are allowing us to create through good research, onto the PBS? How we can we afford it? Could the Labor Partyâand, Senator McLucas, I am looking at you because you are a key person on the other side with respect to health and ageing issuesâplease reconsider their position, sign up and say, `Yes, this is a good move and we will make it more sustainable for all Australians'?</para><para>Finally, I refer to prevention. Why did I mention prevention? Because I think that could be a fourth tier to the universality of Medicare. Prevention is always better than cure. Today I have been with Senator Kay Patterson and the Hon. Larry Anthony at the launch of Food for Health. I want to congratulate both ministers on the launch. It was a great success. This relates to new guidelines which recommend lifestyle changes to promote healthy living. This is a big issue. Childhood obesity, for example, has doubled in the last 10 years. It is becoming close to a crisis and action is required. Two things need to happen: we need to have a balanced diet and regular exercise. With respect to balanced diets, the announcement today of these guidelines is a great step forward. I hope that not only Iâit applies to meâbut all Australians will take them into account when they consider their own health needs. Well done and congratulations on the launch. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>12060</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the motion today to refer this Medicare package to the Senate Select Committee on Medicare. As we know, the government has already identified the Medicare bill as being necessary to be debated quickly. It is important to point out that this is a major change in health services for GPs and others in our health system. It is critically important that it receive the kind of scrutiny that people have come to expect the Senate to give to such important legislation. The Democrats initiated the Senate inquiry into the government's proposed changes and it is fitting that this bill, now it has been received by the Senate, be referred to that committee.</para></talk.start><para>When we initiated that inquiry we developed terms of reference and, as is common for us and this place, they were circulated to other parties. In the spirit of a true democracy in this place, suggestions were taken on board and consensus reached about what sort of inquiry this place should engage in. I think that is a good example of how this place works. It also demonstrates that the Senate will not be told by the government that the bill will be dealt with before there has been any scrutiny. We will not be told that this is a matter that we should not invite the public to make submissions on, that we should not look outside the square, as it were, at other alternatives or that we should simply knuckle down and agree to whatever it is the government has put up to us. The package that has been put up has received almost universal condemnation from not only doctors but also consumer groups and people who value the Medicare system in this country. </para><para>The Democrats have argued that Medicare is a very important social institution. In fact, we go so far as to say that it underpins how Australians relate to each other. It is a universal system of health care access paid through taxes. It is progressive and cohesive. We do not want a two-tiered system in this country where income determines your level of health care and where doctors can dish out charity to the deserving poor with regard to health.</para><para>There has been a trend in the last few years for many of the institutions that we hold dearâinstitutions that reflect a healthy egalitarian countryâto be eroded. I name the ABC, academic institutions and peak organisations, for instance, that might occasionally criticise the governmentâafter all that is their jobâand they have been subjected to resource cuts and criticisms by this government over time.</para><para>It is vitally important that the public is aware of how the parliament works and how it regards pieces of legislation which do have the capacity to change in very substantial ways important institutions such as our Medicare system. I think our health system works very well. We have good health outcomes and some excellent health and medical professionals to service our system. But it is the case, despite what has been said on the other side already, that bulk-billing is in decline. It is certainly the case that the new President of the AMA says that he can see further decline and rapid decline at that.</para><para>We know that there are parts of Australia where access to a GP is extremely limitedâin fact, GPs are not available in many towns. We know that GPs are leaving country areas and outer metropolitan areas in numbers that are too large to ignore. But we also know, by its own admission, that the government's package will not actually fix those problems. The shortage of doctors in country areas is not going to be fixed overnight. Arresting the declineâlet alone talking about increasing the availability of bulk-billingâis not necessarily on the government's agenda. So this package, worth $900 million and more as it is, is actually not going to do what the vast majority of Australians expect it to doâthat is, fix the problems that we currently have. </para><para>I think there are other problems too. One of the reasons for initiating this inquiry was not just to examine the government's packageânot just to look at whether or not Australians were being misled and at whether this was an honest attempt at fixing our health systemâbut to look at a whole range of other aspects of Medicare which could well be enhanced and open up public debate about some of these. Medicare does not make use of allied health professionals, whose skill and expertise could complement and, in some cases, replace general practice consultation. In other words, we think there may be considerable cost benefits in removing the need for a GP to be all things to everyone and allowing other health professionals to take up some of the need. The GP could therefore concentrate on using his or her specialist skills in more satisfying ways. Reducing the proportional use of GPs might also mean that their remuneration could be relatively higher than in the present circumstances.</para><para>This is a really important consideration. When we talk about prevention we particularly need to look at allied health professionals, who can be active in this area in different ways from those of GPs. There is a dimension in health services which is both economically desirable and socially and medically desirable for us to pursue. So I would be very surprised if our inquiry does not also give the government some good ideas on how we might use allied health professionals and prevention in a much more effective way. I could probably talk for the next quarter of an hour just on prevention measures that I think we ought to be putting in place for smoking. That causes billions of dollars in health costs every year, yet this government spends just $2 millionâI almost said $2 billion; that would be goodâa year on antitobacco campaigns. That is despite the fact that 19,000 people a year die from smoking related disease. We really do very little to persuade people to not take up smoking in the first place or to give it up if they already do smoke. However, I am getting off the track.</para><para>There are other aspects by which Medicare could be reformed. We do not think, as I said, that the package put forward by the government is acceptable. The ALP has put forward its proposal that may stem the flow of GPs leaving bulk-billing, but I think by any account that is probably a short-term solution. We would like to see a greater vision than thisâone that is in step with the fundamental philosophy that the Australian community still embraces, despite the government's best efforts at destroying itâand that is providing institutions which unify the country and looking after all members of society in a way that does not stigmatise people. That is what we are after.</para><para>On that question of whether the government is actually being honest with us, we need to look beyond what is on the page in this package. We need to explore the risks, and I think they include health costs, GP costs, increasing substantially if this package were to go through in this place without any form of amendment. We would see an escalating increase in costs for GPs and we would see those costs being borne more and more by private individuals, by patientsâby sick people, in other words; people who in many cases, when we talk about increasing costs, can least afford to pay them. </para><para>We know it is families at the end of the day, not necessarily those on health care cards, that are going to suffer from increases in health costs. We know it is families that in some circumstancesâif they are on medium or low incomes or have illness in the family for whatever reasonâare going to suffer the greatest disadvantage from this package. There are also the chronically sickâthose people who have a need to visit their GP on a very regular basis. I am thinking of those who perhaps have cancer, are getting oncology services outside hospitals or have other illnesses which take them to their GPs for treatment on a very regular basis. For those people this package would make things extremely difficult to afford as well.</para><para>I think we need to ask whether the government is being honest with us about the long-term prospects with this legislation. We know that Australia has an ageing population, in common with so many other countries, and we know that more services are being provided outside hospitals. So will people of my generation, the baby boomers, move into a very high cost area? Will the kind of pathology designated for our health services become very costly? Is that in fact what this government has designed? Has it designed a system which will shift the costs for those kinds of health services to individuals to pay themselves?</para><para>That is what I think we need to be looking at in this inquiry. I very much look forward to reading all of the submissions, and some have already been received by the committee. Many know what is in the government's packageâwe have had plenty of information about thatâso to some extent those submissions are already about this legislation. I hope that the Minister for Health and Ageing is able to keep an open mind on her reform agenda and consider the perspectives from those making submissionsâthe eminent health experts and the representatives from the state governments which deliver health services and bear the brunt of some of the problems associated with Medicare at present, including access to GPs. I hope they will have something really worth while to sayâI know they willâand I look forward to weaving together some of this information and putting forward to the government alternatives to what we have before us. I sincerely hope that the minister is generous enough to look at those, embrace those ideas which are good and come up with an alternative solution, because the vast majority of Australians are not convinced that this legislation will do what we need it to do and what the government thinks it will do and, longer term, they are fearful that this legislation may change very dramatically the way in which health services are delivered in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>12062</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn any objective analysis, Medicare is one of the great achievements of governments in postwar Australia. Indeed, it stands beside such universal schemes as superannuation for all Australian workers and access to higher education for all Australians irrespective of income as something that defines this country throughout the world. Great achievements, such as universal health coverage through Medicare, superannuation and access to higher education, are what defines an equitable society. These were all achieved by Labor governments.</para></talk.start><para>Medicare, of course, was the re-creation of Medibank, which was first introduced by the Whitlam government in 1972. I pay tribute to my colleague Senator McLucas who so clearly outlined the attitude adopted by the coalition when they found themselves on the opposition benches after the 1972 election. They could not stand the concept of promoting universal health coverage for all Australians. They wanted to maintain a system of privilege in which, if you could afford private health insurance, you might get access to a decent health service. If you had the income to pay for private health insurance then you were okay. If you did not you would very often have to utilise the services of public hospital emergency departmentsâcasualty departments, as they were called in those daysâto get medical assistance for you or your family. I can recall that. I can recall those days when casualty departments in public hospitals were overflowing with people waiting hours and hours to see a doctor because they could not afford to go to their local doctor or they did not have private health insuranceâlet alone whether they needed to get hospital treatment or specialist treatment. </para><para>Under Gough Whitlam, the Labor government established a universal health system, Medibank. Of course, the coalition did not want that; they fought it tooth and nail and blocked it in the Senate, as Senator McLucas has outlined. When the coalition finally got back into power in 1975, through the constitutional vandalism of the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, they set about destroying this great achievement of the Whitlam government. And they did; they abolished Medibank. So by 1983, when the Fraser government was defeated, over one million Australians in this country were uninsured and unable to afford access to decent health care. Under Bob Hawke, the Labor government re-established Medibank, this time as Medicare.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âWe don't want a lesson in history.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âThe history is important, Senator Boswell, because you and your Prime Minister are trying to recreate history by destroying Medicare. That is what the coalition has always been about. It is on the record. It is worth while remembering what the current Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, was saying about Medicare back in 1986. He was saying that Medicare had been `an unmitigated disaster'. It had been in operation for three years, bulk-billing levels were increasing and Mr Howard was out there saying to the Australian population that Medicare was `an unmitigated disaster'. In 1987, trying to be clever with a literary analogy, he said that `radical surgery would be performed on Medicare'. That was the policy of the coalition at the 1987 election. In respect of bulk-billing, which I am going to come to shortly, he said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The second thing we will do is get rid of the bulk billing system, it is an absolute rort.</para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>Bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged.

That is its policy todayâthe policy it had in 1987. There is a famous quote that has been mentioned on a number of occasions and which is worth mentioning again. Mr Howard said this about Medicare:</para><quote><para>We will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its de facto dismantling ... we will pull it right apart.</para></quote><para>Like Senator Barnett, Mr Howard apparently liked using Latin phrases too. Prior to winning the election in 1996, Mr Howard realised the error of his ways. He said:</para><quote><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk billing ... We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk billing ... We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel. </para></quote><para>This is what Mr Howard said in the campaign leading up to the 1996 election. And, remember, his slogan was `for all of us'. To me, and I think to all Australians, `for all of us' means universality. He was promising to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel. The shadow health minister at the time who later became the health minister, Dr Wooldridge, said:</para><quote><para>Medicare stays. Universal bulk billing stays. These are the things the Australian public demands and we accept that.</para></quote><para>They had had a conversion along the road because they had realised that Medicare had become, as I have said, one of those great achievements of a Labor government and people wanted it maintained. The coalition knew that, if they said anything that suggested they would either weaken or destroy Medicare or that they were opposed to it, they would never win an election in this country. The 1993 election proved that, because Medicare was one of the key issues in the 1993 election, along with Mr Hewson's GST in the Fightback packageâI think it should have been more appropriately called the throwback package.</para><para>This government got itself elected by promising to maintain Medicare, promising to maintain bulk-billing and promising to maintain Medicare and bulk-billing as a universal system for all Australians. Well, what have we seen? Let us have a look at the statistics on bulk-billingâstatistics which are provided by the government's own department. We have seen bulk-billing rates, which reached a peak of 80.5 per cent in 1996 at the time the government was elected, decline to 68.5 per cent nationally. In just over six years the rate has dropped by 12 per cent. And this is supposed to be maintaining the universality of Medicare and bulk-billing? It is a nonsense. What is even worse is that in the last two years the rate of decline has been much, much greater. In fact, six per cent of the 12 per cent declineâhalf of itâhas occurred in the last two years. When you go to the statesâbecause 68.5 per cent is the national averageâyou will find that it has declined, of course, in every state and territory. In Western Australia the decline has been 8Â½ per cent. In the ACT there has been a 21.3 per cent decline in bulk-billing of GP services.</para><para>Senator Barnett tried to argueâhe made a comment, but did not really advance an argumentâthat the Labor Party's policy was discriminatory against rural and regional areas. The Labor Party's proposal that is out there and is fully costed and fully funded will provide incentives to GPs to lift their bulk-billing ratesâand not just for concession card holders. This government is trying to dumb down Medicare and bulk-billing to apply only to those on concession cards. Our proposal is for bulk-billing for all Australians. We have deliberately skewed it to ensure a faster increase in rural and regional areas. There are higher incentive payments for doctors in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas than there are in metropolitan areas. That is deliberate.</para><para>The rates of bulk-billing that need to be achieved to attract an incentive payment in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas are lower than in metropolitan areas. And why is that? Because there needs to be an extra incentive in rural and regional Australia to lift bulk-billing rates. This government has even recognised that with some of the proposals it has put on the table. I have heard government members and senators and the minister talk about how the real need and the real priority is in rural and regional Australia because of the shortage of doctors and the problems of accessing doctors who bulk-bill in those areas. When Senator Barnett gets up and runs his furphy that we are discriminating, he should tell the whole story. Because what we are doing is recognising that bulk-billing rates in rural and regional areas in Australia are at abysmal levels. </para><para>In electorates like Cowper and Page on the far north coast, bulk-billing rates are at levels of 50 per cent and 47 per cent respectively. There is a real need for an extra incentive to get those levels up to somewhere near the target of at least 80 per cent. We know that in metropolitan areas they are higher and in some cases much higher. Ironically, if you go to Liberal held seats such as in the North Shore of Sydney, have a look at the levels of bulk-billing there: they do all right. It is the people in areas represented by people who belong to the party of Senator McGauran and Senator Boswellâthe National Partyâthat are really doing it tough with terribly low levels of bulk-billing. In Eden-Monaro the level of bulk-billing is 38 per cent. That is why our package is deliberately designed to promote bulk-billing in all areas but particularly to give extra incentives for rural and regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWhat is your package?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âSenator McGauran, I do not know what you or your adviser who is here to help you are doing, but I will send you a copy.

And, again, I quote Mr Howard:</para><quote><para>Bulk billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose.</para></quote><para>The government has made it clear, because its members have stood up, and the minister has stood up, in this chamber and tried to argue that Medicare and bulk-billing were never designed as a universal system. Even though the Prime Minister is on the record in 1996 as promising to maintain the universality of Medicare, in recent weeks we have the ministerâand other senators as wellâstanding up in this chamber and saying on behalf the government, `Medicare was never really intended to be universal. It was really only ever intended to be for people who were on low incomes or on concession cards.' That argument is a total furphy; it is a lie, because Medicare was created and was always intended to be, and under Labor will remain, a universal system.</para><para>The government's proposals clearly are directed at providing incentives to doctors to bulk-bill concession card holders. On that point, one could say that at least the government has now realised that there is a problem with Medicare. Indeed, it knows there is a problem because the department of health in December 2001 said that, unless something dramatic was done, the decline in bulk-billing would reach catastrophic proportions. So the government has been on notice from its own department, and it is has put forward this proposal targeted at concession card holders. Of course the quid pro quo for thatâI have picked up another Latin phraseâis that anyone else going to a doctor is going to end up paying more and more each time they visit. Dr Kerryn Phelps, when she was the President of the AMA, stated: </para><quote><para>What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk bill their concession card holders, they're going to have to charge their non-concession card holders more in order to meet the cost of running their practices.</para></quote><para>That is what Dr Phelps said, speaking on behalf of medical practitioners. This is the doctors' representative organisation saying to the government that the government's own proposals will lead to higher costs for anyone who does not have a concession card.</para><para>We know that any family in this country whose income is more than $32,500 is not eligible for a concession cardâand that is a lot of families with a lot of kids. Overwhelmingly, Australians who now have access to bulk-billing, if they are lucky, if they can find a doctor who bulk-bills, in the future are going to have to pay increasing amounts to visit their doctor. The universality of Medicare will disappear. I do not think that there is any doubt about that, and of course that has really been the coalition's agenda all long. That is why they have sat back and allowed bulk-billing rates to decline since they have been in office. Senator Hill said earlier in an interjection that the coalition support choice. The choice has become having to either pay substantial amounts of money to be in a private health fund and have your premiums to that private health fund increase on a regular basis or queue up at your public hospital emergency departmentâthat is the choice that this government support. They do not support Medicare and they certainly do not support the universality of Medicare.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>12066</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor Party's position in respect of these reforms is a little puzzling. Here we have a set of measures which, first of all, invest huge additional amounts of money into the Medicare system. It is a fact that there is an extra $917 million going into the Medicare system under these arrangements. This has not been mentioned much in this debate but, very clearly, it is the most salient feature of the reforms that the government has announced.</para></talk.start><para>We have measures designed to increase the access for the poorest in our community to bulk-billing; that is undeniably a feature of this system. We have measures to improve the accessibility for people in rural and regional areas in Australia to doctors and other related health professionals. We have measures to prevent families with high health bills in this country from having to bear the full cost of those bills above certain prescribed levels. I would have thought that each of these measures characterises the sort of social policy that the Labor Party, once upon a time, espousedâassisting those in rural and regional areas who have poor access to doctors, assisting the most poor in society, investing more in the health system. And that is just Medicare; I am not talking here about the extra $10 billion the government has proposed to put into the hospital system in this country. With this package, we have an enormous shift of resourcing into the areas where demand and need are greatest, and we have a Labor Party which is universally opposed to what is being put forward. There is no feature of the system that has been put forward by the government with which it can find any agreement. Apparently nothing we have done is worth supporting. I find that very surprising.</para><para>At another level, it is not surprising at all, because this Labor opposition to the government's announced reforms to Medicare is as much about giving Simon Crean and his rather ragtag team some traction on an issue where they need to have it. In fact, we are seeing quite deliberate distortions and misrepresentations coming forward from the Labor Party in order to lay a glove or two on this package. I saw the literature of a Labor member of the lower house which baldly asserted that, under this new package of measures announced by the government, there will be no bulk-billing other than for concession card holders. That is simply not true. There is nothing in this package which affects access by people other than concession card holders to bulk-billing services. Indeed, measures like the streamlining of red tape associated with bulk-billing should make it easier for people other than concession card holders to get access to bulk-billing doctors and bulk-billing services; it is clearly a bald misrepresentation to assert otherwise. It is also a sign of the desperation inherent in the Labor Party's approach to this issue that they need to escalate their response so quickly to outright distortion and lie. </para><para>All Australians should have access to high-quality and affordable health care. That is and always will be this government's position. Medicare underpins this and A Fairer Medicare attempts to shore up the future of this vital institution. Senator Forshaw thought that he could characterise the government's package by what was said over a decade ago in a much earlier debate. I say to Senator Forshaw: look at what is happening at the present time; look at the money being put into the system; look at the nearly $1 billion going into Medicare under this package. It is not going to get siphoned off into bureaucracy or disappear into some unattractive area of the health system; it is not going anywhere but into enhancing accessibility to Medicare. That is where it is goingâevery last dollarâand I am surprised that that does not win the support of those opposite.</para><para>It surprises me that a Medicare reform package that benefits those most in need, while not in any way disadvantaging middle Australia, is not supported by the Australian Labor Party, a party with social justice pretensions. Such is the desperation of the Crean team that they are willing to misrepresent those reforms and drive fear into the Australian people on that subject. We have heard in the last little while a ramp-up of that campaign of fear. We have heard Labor try to characterise the $10 billion extra being put into public hospitals in Australia as a cut to public hospitals. Excuse me, a cut? That is what we have heard from some Labor figures: that we are cutting public hospitals in this country. I look forward to hearing the ingenuity of later speakers in explaining how $10 billion extra can do that.</para><para>The ALP has already demonstrated its irresponsibility on health by not supporting reforms to the increasingly costly Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and by the failure of its state governments to back the 2003-08 Australian health care agreement. Now, with its opposition to A Fairer Medicare, it is going for the trifecta. Simon Crean believes Medicare is his electoral escape route. He has spoken a lot about it in the last few days. But this strategy is built, I think, on a house of cards. We hear constantly from the ALP that this government's reforms to Medicare will create a user-pays, two-tiered health system in Australiaâthe ALP seems to think that if it repeats that often enough people will eventually come to believe itâbut the facts do not support that contention. Under these reforms, all Australians will continue to benefit from a universal Medicare, a universal Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and universal access to free hospital care.</para><para>Senator McLucas, in putting forward this motion, says that our reforms give the impression:</para><quote><para>... the Government considers bulk billing to be a privilege that accrues only to a subset of Australians, not an entitlement that all Australians have as a result of the Medicare charge ...</para></quote><para>If Senator McLucas and her party wanted bulk-billing to be a right rather than a privilegeâshe has characterised our view as being that bulk-billing is some sort of privilege; presumably that means she believes it is a rightâthen why didn't the ALP make bulk-billing compulsory when it introduced Medicare in 1984? Why didn't the Hawke and Keating governments take measures to require certain minimum levels of bulk-billing in the Australian community? The fact is that the 80 per cent coverage of bulk-billing that Senator Forshaw spoke about in this debate was the high watermark for Medicare, and it was a high watermark from which the system was receding long before the change of government in 1996. It was not 80 per cent in 1996, Senator, it was before that point. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âIt was!

As it was, during Labor's time in office access to bulk-billing was declining. That decline, admittedly, has continued in more recent years. That decline has led to this government's decision to reinforce bulk-billing for those in the community who are most in need of that service. The government have made sure that those who have the greatest need for access to bulk-billing can get it, particularly in those parts of Australia where it is not largely accessible at the moment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think that the Hawke and Keating governments realisedâand I hope that Senator McLucas does nowâthat to somehow mandate compulsory bulk-billing would have been unaffordable and an administrative nightmare. The fact is that we have always required or provided for choice among doctors to bulk-bill. It is probably unconstitutional to do otherwise. This government, unlike its predecessor, has developed a Medicare policy which explicitly acknowledges the significance that bulk-billing has for low-income Australians. That is why we want to introduce incentives for GPs to bulk-bill concession card holders. In many ways, those measures will not particularly benefit people in strong Liberal voting areas in this country. They are not intended to. They are intended to particularly benefit those on concession cards and those who are most in need. The ACT, incidentally, is an electorate where access to bulk-billing is at a very low rateâin fact, it has probably the lowest state or territory rate of bulk-billing. That is why a measure like this, which will encourage doctors to bulk-bill particularly concession card holders and potentially others, is very much welcomed by people in my electorate. I am determined that everybody in Canberra and elsewhere should have access to an affordable general practitioner.</para><para>Senator McLucas and her colleagues seem to have developed a new line of thinking in Labor health policy. I congratulate them on that, given that they do not appear to have a health spokesman just at the moment.

That is very good. I hope she has more faith in the leader who wants to revitalise health care than her predecessor did. I can certainly see a strange shift in Labor policy, which perhaps Ms Macklin will remedy, where instead of upwards envy we now have downwards envy on the part of the ALP. Senator McLucas implies that increased access to bulk-billing for low-income earners is a privilege. I think it is disappointing that it should be characterised in that way. I think the ALP has let down the people it has claims to represent in characterising it as a privilege. I think that members opposite need to heed what the Labor Minister for Health in the Hawke government had to say in 1987 about bulk-billing. At that time, Dr Blewett said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention.</para></quote><para>Dr Blewett made it quite clear there that the point of bulk-billing was particularly to focus on pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off. That is what he said and that is what he meant.</para><para>This motion refers to the dangers of a two-tiered medical system in Australia. Certainly, the two tiers that we are facing in a very real sense, not in the rhetorical sense put forward in this motion, is the dichotomy or tiering of metropolitan health and rural and regional health. A Fairer Medicare addresses the concern that a two-tiered system may develop along geographical lines in this country. That is why from 2004 under this package there will be an extra 324 medical school places in Australia. That is a crucial part of a strategy to develop access for all Australians to affordable health care. I am proud that the ACT will play an important role in this. The Australian National University's new medical school, opening next year, has been allocated 80 of those places. All medical school places created through A Fairer Medicare will be bonded for six years to work in areas of work force shortage upon completion of medical training so that areas of greatest need can experience the greatest benefit.</para><para>What about middle Australia, though, in all of this? Senator McLucas claims that our Medicare package will lead to higher copayments for those not bulk-billed. However, doctors have always been free to charge what they want under Medicare and this will remain the case. The Labor Party has overlooked the fact that competition between GPs is what keeps consultation fees in check. It is bad business to charge your customers, clients or patients more than the provider down the street is charging. I think that a 16 per cent increase in medical places in this country will lead to further downward pressure on those fees as well.</para><para>Finally, Senator McLucas is concerned that this government wants to let private health funds offer insurance for out-of-pocket expenses exceeding $1,000. She says in her motion that this would `inflate health insurance premiums'. In a sense, it will do that, it will inflate the premiums, because people now have a new health product to buyâthey can buy gap insurance. They can buy insurance to cover those medical expenses above $1,000 in any given year that come out of their own pockets. It has been estimated that that would cost about $1 a weekâhardly very inflationary, one would have thought. If Australians want to buy that new product on the health insurance market, why shouldn't they be able to do so? It is a very tawdry distortion of the argument to then say that, because a new product is being offered in that way, it is going to inflate health insurance premiums. Dear, oh dear! It will allow people, particularly families, to purchase the certainty that, if a member of their family happens to be sick, they will be able to afford all of their non-hospital medical benefit schedule payments in any given year. It is a pretty significant development. Senator McLucas says that giving health funds this option will inflate premiums. The argument is there for all to see. </para><para>I remind those opposite that this government also wants to introduce a new medical benefits schedule safety net that will cover concession card holders at the other end of the scale, if you like, for out-of-hospital gaps that exceed $500 in a year. Under that, the federal government will reimburse 80c in the dollar for costs over $500. This is another indication of the commitment this government has to those in this community who are most in need. </para><para>It is fair to describe the Australian Labor Party as being Medicare fundamentalists. They squeal at any possible changes no matter how necessary they might be. They fail to appreciate that the society they introduced Medicare to 20 years ago is changing and that Medicare, as an institution, needs to change along with it. The irony of their opposition to A Fairer Medicare is that they undermine what they claim to hold dear. It is the Liberal Party, not the Labor Party, that accepts the reality of Australia's health burden. It is this coalition government, not the Labor Party, which has designed an affordable program that will put Medicare on a sustainable footing. For that reason, senators should look very carefully at the wording of this motion, reject it and move instead to properly update the operation of the Medicare system to ensure that it is able to meet the changing needs, the changing demands, of the health system in the 21st century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>12070</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking to the motion to refer the Medicare package to the Senate Select Committee on Medicare I would like to highlight the inevitably disastrous consequences of the Howard government's proposed changes to Medicare. The first change is to allow medical practitioners to charge patients copayments and to receive the Medicare rebate. Doctors who agree to bulk-bill all of their concessional patients will be allowed to bill Medicare directly for all their other patients and to charge these other patients a fee on top of that. So if a doctor participates in the General Practice Access Schemeâthat is, if the doctor agrees to bulk-bill concession card holdersâthe doctor is then free to charge everyone else more than they are charged today. </para></talk.start><para>The Howard government is even going to give doctors an incentive to do this. They will receive a payment of up to $20,000, depending on their location, to participate in the scheme. From November this year participating doctors will receive a monthly incentive payment linked to the number of concessional patient visits. So, for doctors already charging private fees, rather than bulk-billing it will be much easier for them to increase their fee from $20 to $25 rather than to increase it from $40 to $45 and then make up the difference by receiving the Medicare rebate. At present it is not lawful to do this. The reason it is not lawful is that, if it were, there would be even less bulk-billing than there is now and doctors' fees would riseâand so it will be if the Howard Medicare changes are implemented. Only concession card holders will be bulk-billed and everyone else will be charged more. Of course they will be charged more. If doctors are now complaining about how little they get from the Medicare rebate if they bulk-bill and if the Howard government will let doctors charge more, why wouldn't they?  </para><para>The architect of Medicare, Professor John Deeble, is one of the many professional and expert voices when he says: </para><quote><para>There will be GP co-payments for most people. These would be uncapped and unpredictable, and only a fool would believe that they will not rise or eventually extend to other services ... Separating fees from Medicare benefits will leave doctors free to charge what they like.</para></quote><para>So the Howard government is even giving doctors an incentive to charge their concessional patients higher fees. Under the new arrangements doctors will know that the government will pick up 80 per cent of the costs of the medical expenses incurred by concessional patients above the $500 threshold. Why is all this going to happen? Simply because John Howard wants it to happen. In the 1980s he stated that bulk-billing should be restricted to the most disadvantaged in our society and that doctors should be free to charge everyone else what they like. Now he is trying to legislate for it. But what John Howard is not telling us is that there are a few problems with this approach. </para><para>Dr Gwen Gray, a senior lecturer in political science at the Research School of Social Sciences at the ANU, in an article entitled `Undermining Medicare: steadily, relentlessly, effectively' says that John Howard sees bulk-billingâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sandy (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Sandy Macdonald)</inline>âOrder!

Dr Gray says that Mr Howard sees bulk-billing as:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para> ... the special set of arrangements that are needed to provide access for the very poor in an otherwise private system. </para></quote><para>She goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Such systems are fraught with insurmountable problems, as Australian health policy history 1950 to 1975 clearly demonstrates. The most serious problem is the fact that user charges deter a great many people from using medical services. Other problems are that Australians cannot be divided into two neat groups, called the poor and the rest, that two-tier systems are inequitable and divide the community, and that predominantly private systems are the most expensive and most likely to result in uncontrolled increases in health care costs. </para></quote><para>She further points out: </para><quote><para>... studies have also found that user charges and decreased service use result in adverse health outcomes ... and user charges seem to be most detrimental to low-income persons, especially those who are already in poor health.</para></quote><para>So much for Mr Howard's gimmick of appealing to the battlers. If the battlers, those poor people who are not poor enough to qualify for a concession card, find that the increased doctor's fee is too much for themâbecause the costs of most other things have risen under Mr Howard's stewardship of the economyâwhat are they going to do? They have two choices. The first is to do nothing; they simply do not seek and obtain the medical care they need. This is exactly the situation that Medicare was set up to prevent. Their second choice is to go to an emergency department of a public hospital and seek medical attention. We know they will do this because that is what some poor people do now.</para><para>The Victorian government has estimated that the Howard government's proposed dismantling of Medicare will force 60 per cent more people into public hospital emergency departments. The emergency departments of our public hospitals are already under greater pressure than ever before because the Howard government has let bulk-billing run down by more than 12 per cent over the seven years since Mr Howard became Prime Minister. </para><para>Faced with this regrettable situation in our public hospitals, what is the Howard government proposing? Quite simply, it is going to make it worse, much worseâin two ways: firstly, by reducing bulk-billing even further and, secondly, by reducing funding for public hospitals. Unbelievable as it seems, and despite Senator Barnett's and Senator Humphries's protestations, the Howard government intends to withdraw a further $918 million over four years from our public hospitals. That $918 million is remarkably close to the $917 million that the Howard government intends to spend on its Medicare package, which will destroy Medicare as a provider of quality health care for all Australians by putting an end to bulk-billing for Australian families.</para><para>It might be thought that this is public policy gone mad, but it gets even worse. Over the five-year period from 2003-04 to 2007-08, the total funding to be withdrawn from public hospitals will be in the order of $1.5 billion. What is nextâan announcement that the government intends to make public hospitals free only for pensioners and concession card holders? Heaven forbid.</para><para>The second proposed change that I would like to examine is the further step in this already ludicrous proposal, whereby the Howard government intends to allow private funds to offer insurance for out-of-pocket medical expenses in excess of $1,000. At the present time, this too is illegal, and for a very good reason. The present system, whereby Medicare is the sole insurer for private out-of-hospital medical services, including visits to a GP, and where all Australians contribute Medicare through payment of the Medicare levy and through their taxes, has helped us to keep medical costs down. That is the system that is being wiped away. It is meant to be a safety net, and it may be for those who can afford it. For those who cannot afford it, it is not an option.</para><para>But this reveals a few other things. If we need insurance to cover our medical expenses, it is clearly an admission that costs will rise because of the limitation of bulk-billing to concession card holders and because of the doctors' ability to charge whatever they like. It is also inflationary. The Howard government has already indicated its willingness to allow the private health insurance funds to increase their premiums by twice the CPI in recognition of the increasing costs of health services. It really is the thin end of the wedge to Americanise our health system, to make it a system where you can only get the health care you can afford and where health care costs are incredibly expensive. </para><para>So a vast number of middle Australians will be denied bulk-billing, and huge numbers will be faced with ever-increasing medical costs as doctors increase the copaymentâthe gapâpatients will have to pay. This is Mr Howard's vision and he is gradually making it a reality. The question needs to be asked: why is he doing this? The answer is all too clear. It is driven by ideology. The ideology is that in health, as in most other things, John Howard wants to take financial responsibility away from the government and transfer it to individual Australian citizens. At the same time, the health system will be increasingly privatised through the health insurance system.</para><para>At the same time as the Howard government claims that the cost of supporting general practice is too high, it is using $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money to pay the private health insurance rebate. Since the Howard government came to power it has axed the Commonwealth Dental Scheme, made huge funding cuts to many areas of health services, increased user-pays charges for aged care, reduced entitlements for health care card holders, closed dozens of Medicare offices, introduced the Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme, had a $2 million publicity campaign to promote private health insurance and introduced a 30 per cent tax rebate for private health insurance at a cost to taxpayers of $1.6 billion. All this did not deliver a large increase in the levels of private health insurance. </para><para>Finally, with the $8.7 million taxpayer-funded `run for cover' campaign for Lifetime Health Cover, the level of private health insurance increased from 30 per cent to 48Â½ per cent, but to what purpose? Dr Gwen Gray has pointed out that, despite John Howard's push for the privatisation of our health system:</para><quote><para>... taxpayers' money is currently being used to underpin Australia's private health sector. The beneficiaries are those Australian doctors, particularly surgeons and proceduralists, who wish to work predominantly in private practice, along with private hospitals, many owned by overseas investment interests, and the private health insurance industry. The losers are the majority of Australians who rely entirely on Medicare, who could have had their services significantly upgraded with these tax dollars, now totalling approximately $2.5 billion annually. General Australian taxpayers lose as well. The overall financing result has been to reduce the total share of private financing from 11 per cent to 6 per cent. Far from generating greater private sector contributions to the overall health system and relieving pressure on public hospitals, as the Government claimed, taxpayer dollars have been used to replace private dollars!</para></quote><para>It is clear that John Howard's mania for privatisation is not even achieving the shift away from public expenditure that he wants. But that does not matter to him. His aim is to destroy Medicare by expanding the private sector, using taxpayers' dollars, instead of improving services in the public sector. Why does he persist? It can only be that he is stuck in the past, with no understanding that we live in different times with different needs, and quite clearly with no empathy or compassion for people in less comfortable circumstances than he and his family enjoy. John Howard's vision for Australian health care is a vision of the 1950s and a return to the system of publicly subsidised private health insurance introduced by Earle Page. Mr Howard was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 27 October 1971, saying that the introduction of Medicare was a:</para><quote><para>... cardinal mistake ... we destroyed the honorary system and we dismantled a perfectly functioning health system.</para></quote><para>Mr Howard conveniently ignores the fact that his ideal system was one that was investigated by the Nimmo committee of inquiry into the health care system, set up by Prime Minister Gorton in 1969 in response to public controversy over the system. It was found to be a system in which 20 per cent of people could not afford private health insurance and in which insurance costs and health care costs created hardship for additional groups of citizens.</para><para>Mr Howard conveniently ignores the fact that Medicare was set up to ensure that adequate health care was available to all Australians, regardless of their ability to pay for it. Medicare was intended to break the nexus between access to health care and the capacity to pay for it, where health care is based on health not wealth. Mr Howard's `vision' is quite the opposite: it is a vision of essentially a private system, with high charges for low- and middle-income earners and a bit of charity for the very poor. It is a dismal picture. Mr Howard's so-called A Fairer Medicare: Better Access, More Affordable is, like so many of his pronouncements, Orwellian newspeak. It would be laughable if it were not so frightening. He really means `An unfair system: No Medicare at all'.</para><para>Finally, the Howard government's proposed changes to Medicare must be seen in a larger context. They are not just about making disastrous changes to the provision of health care for ordinary Australians but are part of the Howard government's agenda for changing Australian society to one which we will not recognise and do not want. It is about creating a society where money alone matters and a fair go for all will be a thing of the past. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>12074</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is most remarkable to be sitting here listening to the Labor Party talk about health in this debate.

One would never suspect that when we listen to the diatribe coming from the opposition.</para><para>Labor say they will guarantee bulk-billing for all Australians, but we do not know how they will do this, because that was never the intention of Medicare when it was first brought in. Dr Neal Blewett, the former Labor Minister for Health, never conceded that point at all. In fact, it was quite the reverse. Labor know they cannot force doctors to bulk-bill so they have to convince them by other means, such as an increase in the Medicare rebate. Labor have said that their solution to make bulk-billing more attractive is to reduce the gap between the doctors' rebate and the fees that doctors want to charge their patients. </para><para>Labor keep running around and saying that `doctors are going to increase their fees'. What is different? What is different today from yesterday? What is different today from when the Labor government was in office? The difference is that the rebate has been increased at a greater rate under this government than under the Labor government. The AMA estimates that a reasonable fee would be around $50, but the current rebate is $25.05. To eliminate the incentive for gap payments, Labor would have to increase the rebate to 85 per cent of the AMA's recommended $50 fee, or an extra $17 per consultation for GPs. That is their answer, and that is what is stated on the record. But remember that each $1 increase in the rebate costs taxpayers an extra $100 million. In the case of a $17 rise, it will be $1.7 billion per year. At no stage in this debate have the Labor Party said where that $1.7 billion will come from.</para><para>It is about time they came clean; it is about time they came clean on a whole range of things. By how much will the Labor Party lift the Medicare rebate for a standard GP consultation? Do the Labor Party acknowledge that the budget cost of each increase of $1 in the rebate is approximately $100 million per year? Do they acknowledge that the policy they are enunciating equates to an extra $1.7 billion a year? We do not hear anything about that, because, more importantly, we do not hear where the money is coming from. It is up to the public to now scrutinise where that money is coming from. Are they planing to increase the Medicare levy? That is the most logical thing, because that is generally what they doâjust jack up levies to cover their wild spending. Of course, the now former Labor health spokesman, Mr Smith, happened to let the cat out of the bag about that a number of times. Mr Crean quickly said, `Sh! Don't tell anybody.' Are they planning to abolish the private health insurance rebate? Of course they are. Every time you hear a Labor person speak about the private health insurance rebate they say it has to go because it is a waste of money.</para><para>If it is not going to be abolished in its entirety, because they think that might be politically unpopular, they certainly are of one mind to abolish the rebate for ancillary benefits. Let us look at the older population of Australia. The older population of Australia relies very heavily on ancillary benefits, whether they be optical, dental, audiological benefits or any of those other extras. In many respects they take out private health insurance to take out the ancillaries, and they want that to be affordable. What does the Labor Party want to? They want to scrap the rebate, make it more expensive or make it prohibitive, so that people will not be able to have that choice.</para><para>Labor say that in a federal health budget of $30 billion they will be able to find enough money to make bulk-billing more attractive. What the public need to know is how they are going to do it and at what cost. There are Labor stalwarts like Professor John Deeble, who is a very proud person because he is the architect of Medicare. He has suggested that bulk-billing can be fixed by an across-the-board rebate increase of only $6. Let us put aside the fact that that does nothing to increase doctor numbers or encourage people to practise in rural and remote regions, but even this amount would cost the taxpayers $2.4 billion over the next four years. Is that what the Labor Party are all about? Is that the suggestion? The government's proposal, which will mean more doctors and encourage doctors to work in rural and regional Australia, would only cost $1 billion over the same period. </para><para>This is typical of the Labor Partyâthey just throw money at it and do not care how they get it. They just say, `This is what we are going to do and somehow or other we will find the money.' Clearly, it has to come from somewhere. It has to come from a rise in the Medicare levy; it has to come from abolishing the private health insurance rebate or it has to come from higher general taxation revenue. It is about time, after seven years in opposition, that the Labor Party told us where it is going to come from. I would suggest that that is not an unreasonable request. </para><para>Labor keep saying that they want a universal health care system, with universal access to bulk-billing. What do we mean by universal? Do we mean that everyone has to be bulk-billed? Or do we mean that those in need should have access to bulk-billing? I do not know what the Labor Party mean by this overarching universal access to bulk-billing. They know that they cannot guarantee access to bulk-billing for everyone, because the only way they could guarantee 100 per cent bulk-billing is by conscripting doctors, and conscription of doctors happens to be against the Constitution of Australia. But it is just amazing; they do not seem to care about the Constitutionâthey just say, `The Constitution is dispensable; it does not really matter. But to get a cheap vote we will say that that is what we are going to do, regardless of its constitutionality.'</para><para>Instead, when they are closely questioned about what they mean, they waffle and talk about increasing bulk-billing levels up to 80 per cent. So we have dropped from universal access down to 80 per cent and, as I said before, that 80 per cent level is where they ran up $80 billion worth of debt for the country, with high interest rates and high unemployment. We have mixed messages all the time. Labor's version of `universal' as we stand here today equals no guarantees for rural areas, regional areas, veterans or health card holders and no guarantees for any increase in bulk-billing rates whatsoeverâjust a cast iron guarantee that there will be a lift in the Medicare levy, abolition of the 30 per cent private insurance rebate or a lift in general taxation.</para><para>One of the best ways to take the strain off the medical system is to train more health workers. That is what A Fairer Medicare is doingâtraining those health workers to put them into the areas of greatest need. That is what this government has tried to do since coming to office in 1996. Then, provision of medical facilities in the bush, for exampleânot just remote Australiaâwas absolutely appalling. The provision of specialist services was virtually non-existent. The provision of adequate health for Aboriginal communities was virtually non-existent. Those issues have been largely turned around within the past seven years of the Howard government, and yet the Labor Party still whinge and whine.</para><para>The A Fairer Medicare package goes further. It takes the next step. It recognises the need for greater facilities and more health care workers, and includes almost $300 million in new funding for 234 new places for medical students who agree to work in areas of need, particularly rural and outer metropolitan areas, 150 more places for GP registrars and 457 extra nurses working in general practice in areas of needs. Our package is targeted effectively and in economically responsible terms. Labor's $3 promise is untargeted, uncosted and will not lead to any more health workers in areas where they are needed. </para><para>I challenge anyone to tell me that they have yet heard anyone in the Labor Party talk about how we will get more doctors and more nurses into areas of need under the dreadful proposition of a Labor government. I have not heard anything and I have been closely connected with this debate for many years. Here we are today talking about this issue with still not a hint of costing and not a hint of the way in which the work force shortages would be addressed by Labor. I think that is pretty disgraceful for an opposition that have been in opposition for seven years.</para><para>Mr Crean recently denied that Labor would use an increase in the Medicare levy or in taxes to pay for their promises, but that was only after his official health spokesman, then Mr Stephen Smith, let the cat out of the bag. If what Mr Crean says is correct and there would be no tax or levy increase, we still have to ask the question, `Where is the money going to come from?' Quite frankly, going on their record you would have to say that an increase in the levy would be their first choice, their first point. I think that we need to get some answers out of the Labor Party. As I said, there are other questions that Mr Crean needs to answer.</para><para>Does he acknowledge, for example, that even a modest increase of $5 in the Medicare rebate would alone more than double the cost of the government's recently announced measures? It would more than double the cost. But there is no acknowledgement from the Labor Party of that fact. What increase in the rebate does Mr Crean believe is required to lift bulk-billing rates in areas where they are low, particularly in outer metropolitan and rural Australia? Does he intend to either abolish or significantly means test the private health insurance rebate to pay for other health expenditure? If so, in what wayâis it going to be totally abolished or is it only the ancillaries that will be abolished? If Mr Crean happens to continue to support the private health insurance rebateâand I think that is very unlikelyâhow will he fund additional health expenditure? Will he rule out an increase in taxation? I hardly think so. You only have to think back 10 years to the l-a-w law tax cuts. They marched in here and put a law down. They put a bill to the parliament to guarantee tax cuts, got re-elected and said, `Whoopsâwe didn't mean that. It was only a bit of a con to get you to vote for us.' So how could anyone ever believe them again on taxation? Will Mr Crean rule out an increase in the Medicare levy? And, if is he prepared to increase the Medicare levy, can we know by how much? </para><para>I think it is about time we knew all the answers to those questions, given that the government has laid out the precise details of its proposed policy changes to strengthen Medicare. These are all very legitimate questions to be asked of a whingeing, whining oppositionâa whingeing, whining, carping opposition that can only oppose. They do not have any policies. I defy anyone to tell me what the opposition's policy is on anything. There is absolutely nothing, let alone in the vital area of health. For more then seven years they have sniped, they have scaremongered and, under both Mr Beazley and Mr Crean, they have failed abysmally to deliver an alternative health policy.</para><para>So it is a very interesting exercise that they are undertaking today, because they create so many myths. I wish I had more time to go through the myths. One myth they perpetuate is that bulk-billing will not be available for those earning more than $32,000. That is a blatant lie. There is nothing truthful in that. Even after it was corrected, the Labor government in Western Australia took out a four-page advertisement at the taxpayer's expense making the claim. That was just a lie. Another myth is that doctors will put up gap costs for non-concession card payments. There is no basis for asserting this. Given that doctors will be paid more to bulk-bill their concession card patients, there is no reason for them to charge other patients higher gap fees. It should be remembered that GPs have always had the ability to set charges as they see fit. There is another myth that the rebate to doctors has not kept pace with inflation. Between 1984 and 2002 the average benefit per GP service rose by 114 per cent. The CPI rose by 109 per cent.  </para><para>Yet another myth is that it is too expensive for doctors to set up the computer systems. The AMA's costing of $17,000 is based on a survey of one seven-doctor practice, which currently possesses no computers whatsoever. We have already spent over $400 million helping GPs to computerise their practices. A more realistic costing provided by the department of health indicates that the upgrade costs would be around $600 for software. I wish I could go on with all these myths about Medicare being dead. Medicare is healthy and the government's initiatives will strengthen Medicare and make it fairer for all Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>12078</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe central point the opposition is trying to make in this debate is that the so-called universality of Medicare will be compromised by these proposals. That is utter nonsense. The universality of Medicare refers to the fact that every person in Australia is entitled to free treatment in a public hospital. That remains, regardless of their income status and regardless of what is wrong with them. Whether they need a heart transplant or a toenail removed, everybody can get free treatment in a public hospital. Rather than ending bulk-billing, this package preserves bulk-billing for general practitioners, especially for those patients who happen to be concession card holders. If you look at the range of bulk-billing across the medical specialities, you will find it varies greatly: from surgeons, who bulk-bill very little, to people like pathologists, who bulk-bill almost all their services. This package preserves bulk-billing.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Brandis)</inline>âOrder!

It was only published this year and tabled on 26 March this year. That is quite a long period of time between the data that it represents and its becoming public. It is a very important report. As I have said a number of times in speaking to reports such as these, the parliament as a whole often does not give significant and adequate attention to some of the reports that come before it.</para><para>This particular report is produced under the Housing Assistance Act and it covers the operations of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreementâthe current agreement that was reached in 1999. This report is the second report covering the second year of that agreement from 2000 to 2001. That agreement expires at the end of this month and there has been a lot of debate and concern about the adequacy of the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, when it commences later this year, and also about the adequacy of government policy on the broader issue of housing, particularly access to affordable housing. </para><para>I asked a question in this chamber earlier this week at question time about what the government was doing to address the major and growing problem of the lack of affordable housing and accessible affordable housing. There is clearly market failure to provide housing that is affordable to either purchase or rent. There is growing poverty in Australia, as the current Senate committee inquiry is discovering, and a lot of that is driven by the large proportion of income that people have to spend on housing. This particular report deals with the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, which is the funding provided by the federal government to state governments to cover public and community housing. It is an important program and one that has suffered not just in the last couple of years but over a period of time due to underfunding and inadequate maintenance of the levels and numbers of housing stock at state level.</para><para>This winding back of the adequacy and the amount of public housing is adding to the broader crisis in affordable housing in other parts of the housing sector such as the private rental and private ownership sections. What the Democrats believe is needed is not just an overview of housing assistance programs but an overview of housing affordability more broadly that goes beyond governments simply providing grants to state governments for public and community housing and ensures that there is proper consideration given at a national level to a national housing strategy.</para><para>There are many organisationsânot just non-government organisations such as ACOSS, National Shelter and the state shelter organisations but also the Housing Industry Association, the Real Estate Institute and others in the private sectorâwho recognise that currently the way the housing market in all its forms operates does not provide adequate amounts of affordable housing, and that problem is actually getting worse.</para><para>We have heard repeatedly and quite rightly the government's praising the fact that they have low interest rates at the moment, and that is obviously better than the alternative, but it needs to be acknowledged that one of the downsides of that, because of no other addressing of the issue in broader housing policy, is that housing prices are going through the roof. That might be great if you are a speculator, but it is not good if you are a family just trying to buy your own home or finding a home to rent at an affordable level. What has been called for, not just by community organisations but by the industry as well, is a national housing strategy looking at the problem across the board. The Democrats believe that is important and will continue to push for that.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority</title><page.no>12079</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>12079</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This report is just an errata from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's annual report correcting some of the values for various outputs. I speak to it not just in the context of the corrections it contains but given the fact that it represents a significant and ongoing problem, which is the adequacy of resourcing for the marine park authority to do what is its core job, which is to protect the World Heritage values of that absolutely precious area. Coming from the state of Queensland, I have a particular interest not only in ensuring that this magnificent international asset is protected in all its variety and ecological values but also in the enormous economic benefits it generates for my state of Queensland, particularly central northern and Far North Queensland. </para><para>It is appropriate also, utilising this document, to note the current rezoning proposals for the marine park, which the Democrats have supported. It has been a number of years in the making. It started under the previous Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, and has been progressed under the current environment minister. Many times, and quite rightly, the Democrats have very strongly pointed out the failings of the federal government and the state Labor government in Queensland in dealing with the many threats to the marine park, but this particular undertaking should be strongly supported and the federal government should be strongly congratulated for continuing to push through this significant change in the zoning of the marine park.</para><para>The rezoning that has been proposed has just been released in draft form, and we are in a consultation phase that continues until 4 August. I very much urge all stakeholders to participateâand all stakeholders really includes all the people of Australia, because it is a shared public asset and one that all people should have an interest in protecting. The draft plan increases the amount of marine protected area from less than five per cent to over 30 per cent. Many people, I believe, are shocked when they discover that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is not all protectedâthat a lot of commercial activities, including very high-intensive activities like prawn trawling, continue in many parts of the marine park. People are often shocked to know that such minimal areas are protected.</para><para>The figure of over 30 per cent proposed in the draft plan is obviously a significant move forward, and it must be welcomed. The Democrats and other organisations, including a lot of people in the science community, believe that to maximise the protection opportunities and the benefits of increasing marine protected areas we should actually be looking at moving it up towards 50 per cent. Many people in the fishing communities, not surprisingly, initially react to that with horror, suggesting that all their fisheries will be removed and that they will be put out of business. I say two things about that.</para><para>Firstly, we have to acknowledge that the primary necessary objective is to ensure that the ecological values of the marine park and the reef are protected. There is no point in enabling people to make short-term livings out of various activities in the marine park if the long-term consequence will be the degradation and the destruction of the marine park. So we have to ensure that protection is provided and is adequate. If that means that there is some economic loss to individual people then that is regrettable and it needs to be minimised. I must say that means the entire broader community should bear that economic loss and economic cost so that compensation or financial adjustment can be provided to people. That is always painful but it is sometimes necessary, and the Democrats do not shy away from that.</para><para>Secondly, the science is clear: if you significantly increase marine protected areas, you significantly increase fish stocks and the size of fish. That is obviously something that recreational fishers, in particular, are keen on. So I do believe fishing folk should look more deeply at it and also should contribute to the consultation phase. I also urge all people that are keen on ensuring that the marine park is protected to lend their support to this significant increase to see if we cannot get the government to increase that protected area further, because it is essential that the government does not back down. Having gone this far, this is an opportunity for the federal Liberal government to have a significant environmental legacy. There are still many other threats to the marine park and the reef, it must be acknowledged, but this rezoning is a significant move. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>12081</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><para>Australian Law Reform CommissionâReportâNo. 95âPrincipled regulation: Federal civil and administrative penalties in Australia, December 2002.

It is particularly relevant because, as I raised in question time, the full bench of the Family Court today found that maintaining children in detention for prolonged periods of time or indefinitely, as Australia is currently doing, is in their view not only against the law butâand one of the reasons it is against the lawâa breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</para></talk.start><para>The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has indicated that he is considering appealing this ruling to the High Court. While I would urge him not to and to simply free the children from their ongoing torment, I suspect that, given his past record, he will seek to appeal the ruling. And it is possible of course, as always, that that appeal will be upheld. What I suggest that would mean is that maybe the court would be wrong in saying it has jurisdiction over children in detention. One of the aspects of the court's judgment was that the Family Law Act includes an implied incorporation of our obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That is partly why the court believed it had jurisdiction. </para><para>It is important to note that one of the Family Court's primary goals and areas of expertise is ensuring the welfare and wellbeing of children. Whilst it should be no surprise to anybody with an ounce of commonsense, it is nonetheless important that the court has found, not surprisingly, that it is not in the interests of children and their wellbeing to be detained indefinitely in immigration detention centres. That was also seen to be a breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Whether or not it is affirmed in the High Court that, for this reason, the Family Court had jurisdiction, or that the Family Law Act can or should be interpreted in that way, what will remain, regardless of any other ruling of the High Court, is that detaining children for prolonged periods of time is a breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is something the government has repeatedly denied, as it does every other accusation of breaching our international obligations, but it is also something that is quite clearly undeniable if you simply look at the facts and forget the political smokescreen.</para><para>This is a very important treaty. I think that all of us would acknowledge that the protection of children and their fundamental rights is a major issue. It was one of the driving issues behind the community outrage underpinning the recent debate we had on the future of the former Governor-General. I believe that the Australian people, almost to a person, strongly support ensuring that children are protected. That is what the Convention on the Rights of the Child is about and that is what we in this chamber should be about when we consider public policy and legislation. The fact is that it has been reinforced by the Family Court decision today that the ongoing detention of children is clearly against their welfare and is clearly not in their interests. </para><para>There is a massive amount of evidence from psychiatrists, child welfare bodies, people with expertise in child behavioural issues and other health professionals that detaining children for any significant period will inevitably do them enormous damage. We have seen some of the consequences and victims of that with individual children in Australia, some of whom are still in detention at the moment. There have been massive disorders, particularly psychological and mental, as a consequence. That is a direct consequence of government policy. The minister and the government would no doubt say that if they let children out of detention that would undermine the government's migration regime. I would simply say that any policy that relies on destroying children's lives, causing them permanent, significant, psychological harm is a policy that is not justifiable. I do not care what the end is, the end does not justify those means.</para><para>The government has to find another policy. There are plenty of other alternatives. The Democrats have put forward many themselves. There are many people in the community with not just the will and the desire but the expertise to care for children even if their parents are in detention. I should say that when this particular case I have referred to was before the court, the father was in the community, not in detention. The mother was in detention. There are five children in this familyâtwo initially for the hearing and I think three others joined up to it. Five children are affected, three of them under the age of 10. They are in detention as we speak, as a direct result of government policy, despite all the undeniable evidence of the harm that does to them.</para><para>This surely should be a wake-up call for the government. Whether or not the government appeals this ruling, the finding of fact that it is not in a child's interests to be in detention for a prolonged period of time will stand, I believe. The finding of fact that there has been a contravention of the Convention on the Rights of the Child will, I believe, also stand. The government needs to respond to it. The government needs to hear the concerns of people throughout the community. </para><para>As many senators would know, I have dealt with many aspects of the refugee and detention debate. There are a range of views in the community, and I acknowledge that many are different from the ones which I hold and which the Democrats promote. But on the issue of children in detention I believe there is a much wider degree of community support for finding an alternative. That is what we need to do, and we need to do it as a matter of urgency. I would very much urge the governmentâwhether it is looking at it the through the prism of the Convention on the Rights of the Child or through the prism of basic humanity and good public policyâto do something about it and do it now.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>12083</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and TradeâJoint Standing CommitteeâReportâAustralia's role in United Nations reformâGovernment response.

As many senators would know, the Democrats were instrumental in enabling the passage of that act, after getting an enormous number of amendmentsâover 100âmade to that particular bill. It is an act which I am certain is a significant advance forward in the overall powers of the federal government to enforce environmental protection. It is worth noting that that is another initiative and achievement of the Liberal government under the former minister, Senator Hill. It is an achievement that would not have been possible without the Democrats, I should add, and it would not have been an achievement without the amendments that the Democrats gained. It is nonetheless a significant act.</para><para>What has become apparent since that act was brought into being in 2000 is that, while this is not the best act in the world, it is pretty good and it has a good framework for further improvements. I note that the Labor Party has occasionally promised to make some further improvements were it to get back into government. I would indicate now the Democrats' willingness to support those whenever they are put forward by a Labor government. We will not back away from gaining improvements that are achievable in the interim whilst we wait for those other opportunities to arise.</para><para>But even a good act is only as good as the political will of the minister and the government that oversee it. That is a concern that the Democrats and I have that is growing more and more. The way that the minister and the department are administering the act is not using it to its full potential to prevent environmental damage to areas of national environmental significance.</para><para>This audit report is an interesting one. Whilst I do not read all of the reports out of the National Audit Office, I do try to scan a number of them. I have to say that, unusually, I am very dissatisfied with this one. The Audit Office seems to suggest that in the overwhelming majority of the cases examinedâand the cases are individual proposals for activities that were assessed by the departmentâthe reasons for the decisions by the minister or his delegate were documented and consistent with the Prime Minister's guide on ministerial responsibility and the principles of administrative law. I do not know if it was just bad sampling or an extraordinary case of good luck from the government's point of view in the cases that the Audit Office sampled, but in my view and in my experience with a number of proposals and potential actions that have come under the ambit of the environment protection act I do not think that that statement of the Audit Office applies at all.</para><para>I find astonishing the suggestion contained in this report that everything is being done very well and compliance enforcement is going well. I could go into the details, but in the time available I will not. I could list a number of particular examples where clear breaches of the act were occurring. Significant damages were being done, for example, to Ramsar listed wetlands and World Heritage areas that were reported to the department, and no action was takenâno compliance action and no legal action. It was left up to individuals and community organisations to get action in Northern Queensland in relation to fruit growers who were slaughtering enormous numbers of an endangered flying fox that were an integral part of the wet tropics World Heritage area. That action had to be taken by the community because the government and the department would not act.</para><para>It is only thanks to the amendments the Democrats put in that act that the community has the power and the standing to ensure that there is some mechanism for getting the government to enforce their own act, but it is still far from ideal to go through a court process when the department and the minister should be doing it. I do think that in this case the Audit Office has not got the real picture, and I am not quite sure why. It is something that needs to be looked at again. I will certainly explore the options for enabling that to happen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>12085</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to reports of the Auditor-General were considered:</para><para>Auditor-GeneralâAudit report No. 41 of 2002-03âPerformance auditâAnnual reporting on ecologically sustainable development.

In 1996 the health system was at breaking point. The number of Australians with private cover had fallen dramatically, putting unsustainable pressure on Medicare and the public hospital system. This was a direct result of 13 years of neglect by Labor. The Howard government has invested more in Medicare and public hospitals than any previous government and introduced a range of incentives to encourage Australians who can afford it to take out private cover. The balance has been restored. Now we have 43.8 per centâor almost nine millionâAustralians having private cover. Remember, in June 1996 that figure was around 33 per cent.</para><para>Unlike Labor, whose position on private health care is driven by an irrational and ideologically driven belief that Australians should not have the right to an affordable choice when deciding who provides their health care needs, the Howard government's policies are based on the need for sensible and rational policy outcomes. It is a matter of choiceâchoice for the Australian people. Quite simply, the record shows that our policies have worked. The states are receiving more money for their public hospitals and, interestingly, treating fewer patients. The latest figures from the independent Private Health Insurance Administration Council show that in the December 2002 quarter there were more than 523,000 privately insured episodes in Australia. These are the people who would otherwise join the waiting lists for public hospitals. The boost in support for the private hospital system and private health cover helps reduce the waiting lists and waiting times for public hospitals. </para><para>Private hospitals are playing an ever-increasing role. For the first time in the history of Medicare, between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 public hospitals nationally treated fewer patientsâit was down by 4,591. Private hospitals have responded to this by significantly expanding their level of service provision, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the work of their members. The increase in the numbers there has been 245,129 or 12.1 per cent. Private hospitals now provide more than six out of 10 major joint replacements, around half of chemotherapy procedures, over half of major procedures for malignant breast conditions, around six out of 10 cardiac valve procedures and a massive seven out of 10 major eye lens procedures.</para><para>The rebate is universal by intention. It contributes around $750 every year to the health care costs of millions of Australian families, but for many the benefit is over $1,000. Importantly, it is helping families on low incomes. Over one million Australians on incomes less than $20,000 per year have private cover. That is an amazing statistic. So we have nearly 44 per cent of Australians with private cover, and for them it will always be 30 per cent cheaper under the coalition than under Labor, because Labor will simply not commit to supporting the 30 per cent rebate.</para><para>I would like to make a few comments on the Australian Private Hospitals Association. Again, I support the work they do and the good advocacy work of Michael Roff, their executive director at the national level. I want to highlight some of the key statistics. There are actually 299 private hospitals in Australia, with 24,465 bedsâaround 32 per cent of all hospital beds in Australiaâcompared with 749 public hospitals, with 52,591 beds. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, private hospitals treat four out of every 10 admitted hospital patients in Australia. Private hospitals perform the majority of surgery in Australiaâ52 per cent. In 2000-01 private hospitals admitted 2,270,791 patients, which is up 12 per cent on the previous year, whereas public hospitals admitted 3,867,607, which is down 0.1 per cent on the previous year. Over the past decade, full-time equivalent staff in private hospitals have increased by 47 per cent to 46,314. That is a staggering increase in the number of jobs in the private hospital sector, and I congratulate that sector for the work they have done and their initiatives. In 2000-01 capital investment by private hospitals grew by $452 million, which is up 28 per cent on the previous year. Again, that is a very significant percentage indeed; it is a very significant increase.</para><para>I commend in particular the private hospitals in Tasmania for the work they are doing in contributing to the health and welfare of the community. In Tasmania the 30 per cent health insurance rebate boosted private hospital admissions by 38 per cent between 1998 and 2001, reducing the burden on public hospitals. Our waiting lists for urgent elective surgery have increased from 22 per cent of total cases in 1998-99 to 29 per cent in 2000-01. Interestingly, the state spending on hospitals has fallen from 47 per cent to 43 per cent, while federal government spending has increased from 45 per cent to 48 per cent. In addition, federally funded residential aged care beds have increased by 21 per cent to 3,902.</para><para>Federal funding of Tasmania's hospitals in the five years to 2003 totalled a bit over $700 million. The new offer for the next five years is $921.7 millionâan increase of $220 million, or in real terms a 17 per cent increase. I encourage the state government to quickly sign up to that agreement, because this will help reduce our waiting lists and waiting times. It is imperative for the good of the Tasmanian people. The Tasmanian government say that the offer is not adequate. Of course, if they say that in Tasmania and in other states as well, surely they are willing to match that offer. But they simply are not and they have not put it on the record. I urge them to reconsider and to sign up as soon as possible. </para><para>I am distressed and disturbed by a letter to the editor in today's <inline font-style="italic">Examiner </inline>by Kathryn Hay, where she makes an allegation against me and my support for the private hospital health insurance rebate. I ask her to reconsider her position and that of the Tasmanian government. The information and facts she used are misleading and, sadly, mostly rhetoric from the Labor Party. She does not acknowledge the facts that are on the table and she says that there has been a $1 billion cut to the offer provided for the public hospital system, and it is actually staggering that such information has been put into the public arena in such an incorrect and misleading way. I am disappointed about that.</para><para>With respect to the disability services agreement, I want to urge the state government to sign up. Last year the Commonwealth offered the states a further $2.8 billion to assist them with their responsibilities under that agreement, and that is over a five-year period. That is nearly $900 million more in cash for the states than was provided in the last agreement. The condition was that the states would have to outline their five-year funding commitments in dollars, giving us the growth and indexationâin other words, putting their money where their mouth is. The states were initially unwilling to match the Commonwealth's growth, which is about 7.3 per cent. Of course, the growth in our portion of it for employment services has been much higher than thatâit has been over 12 per cent.</para><para>Victoria and Western Australia have signed up. The Northern Territory is expected to sign up shortly, as is the ACT and South Australia. Queensland has made an offer which looks very positive. Sadly, Tasmania has made an offer which does not provide a sufficient increase of commitment to people with disabilities from state funding. The letter sent just a few months ago from the Premier to the Prime Minister was totally inadequate. I urge the state government to reconsider and to put on the table, in a letter from the Premier to the Prime Minister, a reasonable offer, like the other states. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gambling</title><page.no>12087</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>12087</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to speak on what I believe to be a very crucial issue for our society, and the issue is problem gambling. I want to outline some initiatives of the South Australian Labor government that were taken over the weekend to try in some way, and I think it is a small way, to address the problem we have with gambling. When I first saw the article in the paper announcing this program by the minister Stephanie Key, I recalled the early days in South Australia when we were debating whether or not to allow poker machines into hotels, and indeed I can remember the debates about whether to allow them into the casino as well. I thought, `I wonder what would happen if we had a conscience vote on gambling and poker machines in this place.' It would probably be more chaotic and divided than the embryonic stem cell debate because views are so divergent.</para></talk.start><para>Over my years working with the Australian Workers Union, and before that the Federated Ironworkers Association in Whyalla, sadly I came into contact with a lot of people who, for various reasons, became addictedâand I do not think there is any other term appropriate here but addictedâto poker machines. It is an issue that I think you have to morally weigh up in your mind, if you possibly can. You can have a dislike for poker machines, you can advocate or speak vocally against poker machines; but, then again, I remember that I cannot impose my will on what someone else does with their leisure time or with their money. At the same time as weighing up that, you see children who are suffering because they are not well fed. They are children in a society that is supposed to be forward thinking and affluent, yet they have to have their breakfast at school because there is no money to feed them at home. I do not lay blame on any government; I lay blame on all of us for allowing this affliction to get to people. At the same time as saying that, I still believe that every person has a right to decide for themselves. </para><para>On Sunday the South Australian government launched a series of particularly hard-hitting television commercials about problem gambling. They had to go this way because it is not one particular section of our community which is afflicted by problem gambling. It is not an affliction that affects only poor people or those not so well-off, it is not an affliction that affects wealthy people alone, it is not a cultural thing and it is not a religious thing; it affects all in our society. I really am particularly pleased that the South Australian government have taken the initiative that they have. The program they launchedâwhich, as I say, is a particularly hard-hitting and very straight to the point campaignâis called `Think of What You're Really Gambling With'. It is a new community education campaign which supports more responsible gambling and encourages people with a gambling problem to ask for help. I think all of us, in many aspects of our lives, really need to ask for help at some time. I can well remember that my father, who has now left us, had an addiction to gambling, and that brought much tension to the home. He was a loving father, a caring father and a good provider, but he was addicted not to poker machines but to horses that did not particularly run well.</para><para>Gambling is a part of Australia's culture, but we cannot deny that it is affecting us and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. It is as plain as the nose on your face that gaming machines are a popular form of entertainment for people who enjoy playing the pokies for a bit of harmless fun and social interaction. But in South Australia alone there are an estimated 22,000 problem gamblers. This is in the order of two per cent of the population of South Australia. These are the identifiable problem gamblers. The 1999 Productivity Commission report into Australia's gambling industries noted that problem gambling affected both men and women and appeared across all ages and cultural groups. On a general level, Australians with gambling problems lose around $3 billion every year. That translates to $12,000 per capita. Research has also indicated that the money lost is mostly taken from household funds and that around half of all people with gambling problems also borrow money from other sources. Problems that emerge from this, such as not having the money to pay household bills, are too often the source of family conflict and result in the breakdown of relationships, increasing family poverty and domestic violence. A gambling addiction can go unnoticed by many of us, but the people affected by gambling problems are the ones who see the realitiesâand they are all too real. The ramifications go further. For every one of these problem gamblers there are at least five other people who are affected, either financially or socially, by the problem gambler's behaviour.</para><para>I think the South Australian government has acted particularly commendably. A number of strategies are being implemented by the government to address this problem. It is imperative that those with a gambling problem or those affected by gambling are aware that help is out there and that they are not alone. A solution is possible. The South Australian government, through these advertisements that they are now running, address this and show how people can get help. </para><para>In the 2002-03 South Australian state budget, a major budget allocation was made for an extra $4 million over four years for the Gamblers Rehabilitation Fund, to increase services to assist people most affected by gambling, and an additional $1.1 million over four years for the Independent Gambling Authority, to be used for research. Many counselling services funded from this are based at the Adelaide Central Mission; the Wesley Uniting Mission; the Salvation Army; Relationships Australia (SA); Anglicare; the Port Pirie Central Mission; Centacare Whyalla, in my own home town; Lifeline, in the south east of the state; the Centre for Anxiety and Related Disorders; Aboriginal community areas; the Overseas Chinese Association; the Vietnamese Community in Australia; and the Cambodian Association. All of these services provide confidential and non-judgmental counselling. I would encourage anyone who is affected by gambling, either directly or indirectly, to contact one of the services. I believe that every person in a position of responsibility who purports to represent the community should encourage all of their constituents to take advantage of those services.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Live Cattle and Sheep Exports</title><page.no>12089</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>12089</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the issue of the live cattle and sheep trade. It has been an issue of some controversy and some interest in Australia for quite some time. Indeed, senators may recall that the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare did a report on the livestock export trade back in the mid to late 1980sâa committee that was established, of course, by Democrat senator Don Chipp. That report made a finding that, if you were going to assess the industry solely on animal welfare grounds, you would certainly want to ban it. But, of course, economic and other factors get in the way.</para></talk.start><para>Since that time, the industry has actually expanded enormously. In the last financial year, over 6Â½ million live sheep were exported from Australian ports as well as over 800,000 cattle. The sheep destinations are predominantly the Middle Eastâcountries like Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. The cattle destinations are more towards South-East AsiaâIndonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. But they are also sent to the Middle East, with Libya and Egypt being the most popular destinationsâpopular for the exporters, but not, I suspect, for the cattle.</para><para>It is important and relevant to mention this because, in recent times, the ban on the export of live sheep and cattle to the Middle East, which was introduced last year following a massive wave of deaths, was lifted by the federal government. That was done because the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, said that new criteria had been introduced to reduce the potential welfare and health risks to the animals. It is worth mentioning the numbers that died on just four journeys last year. The number of sheep that died was well in excess of 15,000. On one of those vessels alone, over 6,000 head of sheep diedânearly 11 per cent of the total number of sheep that were loaded on board the vessel.</para><para>Particularly given that the ban on exports has been lifted, it is worth noting that exports of live sheep, cattle and goats to the European Union is banned and has been banned for a very long period of time. I think the suggestion that somehow our industries could not cope with a further expansion of that ban does not hold up to scrutiny. Indeed, at times when wider bans have been introducedâand, at various stages, there have been halts in the export trade to various countries, either because of animal welfare outrage and large-scale deaths or because of stock being rejected at the other end because of diseaseâthe amount of trade in dead cattle, as in refrigerated meat, has gone up significantly. </para><para>The other aspect that I think needs to be covered is the welfare issue for the animals not just on board the vessels. Those are significant. I think anybody who has seen one of those vessels would acknowledge that, with the best conditions possible, it would still be an extremely unpleasant journey for the animals. I would like to refer particularly to an article in this month's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Veterinary Journal</inline>, written by a vet from the UK who followed Australian cattle from the ship through their offloading in Egypt and to the slaughterhouse in Egypt. I apologise if some of this is very unpleasant reading, but I think it needs to be put on the record. The issue is not just how the cattle are treated on any one part of the voyage, but the totality of that voyage. I really do not think the totality of it is recognised by a lot of people.</para><para>The long-distance transportation of export animals, in this case cattle, in Australia begins with road trains transporting them many hundreds of kilometres where they are offloaded to feedlots at main ports around Australia. They are then loaded again onto the vessels, which are usually very crowded. The particular ship that is mentioned in this article was carrying 75,000 sheep, 7,000 cattle and 800 goats. The reported conditions were very crowdedâanimals that were down were unable to get up again because of the crowding around them.</para><para>The lower decks had an extremely high concentration of ammonia, with the vast majority of cattle showing signs of conjunctivitis and respiratory distress. In the lowest two decksâand these are multideck vessels, as people would know if they have seen themâthe manure was eight to 10 centimetres deep. There was no bedding and citric acid to counteract the effect of the ammonia. Between 25 and 30 per cent of the water troughs were defective, with the continuous overflow of water adding to the problem of the muddy faeces in the lower decks. Liquid manure flowed into the food troughs, where the food was sodden and soiled with the sheep manure from the decks above. That is just a short summary of some of the descriptions. The vet reported this to Livecorp, which is the organisation that oversees our live exports. According to her, Livecorp appeared to take no action. It was not until the information was directly passed on to the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Maritime Safety Authority that eventually something was done before the ship had its second voyage.</para><para>Worse than that is what happens to the animals when they are offloaded. The stockmen's authority for the animals on the vessels ends at the beginning of the ramp, when the animals are offloaded. If they go into Egypt, it is about a three-week journey often in extremely high heat, which was part of the reason for the massive number of deaths last year. They are loaded onto just trucks, not animal transporters, by lorry drivers and local stevedores, who frequently hit the animals with long sticks armed with rusty nails, metal bars and sometimes hammers. The trucks are general cargo trucks, often without any bedding and always without any shelter against what is often an extremely hot sun. </para><para>The slaughterhouses are described in some detail. I will not go into all of the horror of it. The slaughterpeople in Egypt are usually used to the calm and tame Egyptian cattle and buffaloes. The untamed Australian cattle cause significant concern for them. Fear of this has led to some unfortunate slaughter methods. For example, at one abattoir initially four or five cattle are driven from their pens into a narrow gangway. The exit to the gangway is then bolted. The slaughterman then approaches from the outside and cuts the Achilles tendon of the right-hand hind leg of all the animals. This is done to try to prevent them from escaping. They are then driven onto the landing, where the slaughtermen spread themselves around the huddled animals and begin to cut more tendons on the front and the hind legs. Whenever they are able to approach an animal from behind or from the side, they strike out with a knife at a tendon. The animals then attempt to hobble in the other direction, where another slaughterman waits to strike.</para><para> The article says that the knee and elbow joints are targeted for destruction, and the eyes are knocked or stabbed out. The author had witnessed men kicking animals in the face and stabbing them in the anus to get them into the main slaughter hall. He observed a slaughterman cutting the tongue from an animal and stuffing the tongue into his shirt directly after the throat was cut while the animal was still conscious. Apparently some of the labourers get paid in only what parts of meat they can manage to get whilst they are slaughtering. These conditions have also been reported to the representative of Livecorp in the Middle East. According to the author, again, despite negotiating with representatives of Livecorp a range of measures to improve the situation `none have yet been put into practice'. That is just one example.</para><para>I suggest that is continuing to occur all of the time with all of the cattle and sheep that are shipped from Australia to the Middle East. When we are considering animal welfare issues, we cannot simply look at the significantly problematic aspect of forcing large numbers of sheep onto vessels in what are almost always unpleasant conditions for weeks at sea. There is the journey beforehand, which should not be forgotten, and, more importantly than that in terms of animal welfare measures, what awaits them at the other end and the lack of attention that Australian authorities pay to that. They should pay attention to that and, before we start expanding exports and lifting bans on exports of live sheep and cattle to the Middle East, we should consider some of those important issues.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Policy</title><page.no>12091</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>12091</page.no><name role="metadata">Scullion, Sen Nigel</name><name role="display">Senator SCULLION</name><name.id>00AOM</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to put on record my total support for this government's immigration policies.

The old Labor that we have here should really be keeping an eye on that because New Labour have decided that they need to put an immigration policy in place that actually takes into account issues like national interest and talks about the economic outcome for your country, selecting the right people, looking at some of the really good parts of our policy that recognise prioritising humanitarian issues and humanitarian outcomes for those who are very needy. </para><para>Senator Bolkus, who presided over the immigration policies of the previous Labor government before 1996, must be squirming in his seat when he tries to compare the pathetic policies of that stage with the policies of the Australian government of today. But do not take my word for it, Mr Acting Deputy President: there are always people within the Australian Labor Party who are prepared to put in their two bob's worth. The Australian Labor Party's finance minister at the time, Peter Walsh, described Australia's immigration program as administered by Nick Bolkus as one characterised by cave-ins and blow-outsânot much of an endorsement for someone who had a place in the same cabinet.</para><para>You have to look for an independent view on these things. Katharine Betts, a Monash based researcher, wrote a paper entitled `Immigration and public opinion: understanding the shift'. It is really good every now and again to look at what the Australian community really wants out of something and to try to reflect some of their views. That research paper says that opposition to immigration has declined since 1996. Going further you can say that there are many factors that have produced this change, with no doubt the single biggest factor being the election of the coalition government. I am not so sure the election was the primary issue, but certainly the bringing on of sensible immigration policies brought about some transparency, some probity and took away the mismanagement and the shambolic processes of the previous immigration program.</para><para>I can remember some of the great panaceas. Let us talk about the class visa. Maybe it was just too difficult for them in those days to go through people one at a time and to consider and respect the individual circumstances that these people found themselves in instead of saying: `It's all too hard. We'll run a ring around them and generally have a bit of a look at it.' The last little class visa action that went like that ended up, I think, in a serial migration into Australia of 42,000 people. It was political expediency and incompetence. There is absolutely no way you can look back at history and those sorts of policies and say that this was well thought out and considered or that they could have anything else except for the shambolic outcome that they delivered for Australia. Not only was it a shambolic outcome, but we should look at some of the 42,000 people and look carefully at who was not able to come to this country. We have to look at people on humanitarian lists. I am talking about people like a Somalian lady who is in a refugee camp in Somalia. The only reason her life gets better every month is one of her children dies. That is the sort of person we need to give priority to and that is why we need to make sure that we have a visa process and a refugee and asylum process that deals with the individual needs of individual applicants.</para><para>I have obviously been very concerned about the processes of the East Timorese and I have looked very much at our policy on this matter. Senator Crossin stood up in this place last night and basically took most of the credit. She certainly said that I had done absolutely nothing about this matter. I want to put on the record the unbelievable selective memory of people in the Labor Party. Here she is saying, `Why didn't you have a visa class?' When the East Timorese needed a class visa actionâalthough I would not have agreed with it; it was bad policy, but the Labor Party probably would have handled itâ where were they then? Absolutely nowhere. Every Australian looked at the Santa Cruz cemetery massacre and felt absolutely dreadful about it and thought, `How can we help our neighbours?' The Labor government said: `We'll tell you how we'll help. We'll talk about it for eight years. We'll allow this shambles to go on and on. We'll quote some colonial aspect of the UNHCR determinations. We're part of this convention, but we're going to take the worst part of it and say, âWe think you have dual citizenship; go back to Portugal.â' The vast majority of East Timorese, had they been assessed for asylum at the timeâand some of them have showed me their letters from the review tribunal process, and the review tribunal process identified thisâhad they been considered and triaged through that process, would have been given permanent resident status. This was eight years ago. It is pretty hypocritical. </para><para>It is really up to the coalition to resolve the issueâand we have. We are now looking at the roll-out for that sort of stuff. It is absolutely fantastic. Senator Crossin claims credit. All I can remember is the Labor Party, particularly Senator Crossin and othersâ you have to help where you canâgoing to fundraisers and sitting around sipping tea and saying: `It's a terrible thing that the government won't do this for you. I'm not going to share with you any real history. It is a terrible thing that the Howard government won't do this for you.' We kept saying: `We are doing it. We are sorting out the shambles.' And that is exactly what has happened.</para><para>Then of course we have had the Crossin amendment or, should I say, the Clayton's amendmentâthe amendment that you have when you are not having an amendment. You talked about it to the media: `Will Scullion vote on our amendment?' Well, Scullion went down to the Table Office and said, `Do you have the amendment?' and they said, `We're sorry, Senator, there is no amendment here; we've never heard of the amendment.' Right up until the last day of sitting, no amendment at all was put to this place. It was actually reported in the paper that Dave Tollner had voted on an amendment. You talk to Senator Crossin and ask, `Why don't you take the opportunity to clear it up?' but there is no question of that happening. What have we done? It is about leadership. You talk about self-promotion. She says, `You've done nothing; we haven't seen you.' It is very un-Australian to say, `The first thing I'm going to do about these people is rush over to the newspaper and tell them what I'm going to do.' It is un-Australian and it is not the way I do business.</para><para>We actually make things work. I have had meetings with over 75 per cent of the refugees. I have had long meetings to ensure that I can amplify their cases and the circumstances that fall under section 417, the ministerial discretion section, and ensure that the minister does not miss out on any nuance. I continue to support and explain things to them, unlike someone who stood in this place last night and said, `Be afraid.' She said: `When the minister writes you a letter and says, âI am prepared, subject to the health situation et cetera,â that does not necessarily mean he's going to let you in.' What rubbish! All I can say is that at worst it is political opportunism and at best it is thoughtless incompetence. I remind you once again of the fantastic lineâand it is absolutely commonsenseâ`We decide who comes to Australia and the circumstances under which they come here.' </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.06 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>12094</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>12094</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Export Control ActâExport Control (Orders) RegulationsâLivestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment) No. 1 of 2003.</para><para>Quarantine ActâQuarantine Service Fees 2003-2005 (Australia Post) Determination 2003.</para><para>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) ActâRequests from Minister to APRA, dated 22 September and 1 December 2002.</para><para>Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) ActâDetermination under paragraph 15(1)(b) No. 2 of 2003.</para><para>Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) ActâTelecommunications Universal Service Obligation (Eligible Revenue) Determination 2003.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>12095</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans' Affairs: Fraud Control</title><page.no>12095</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1004 amended)</subtitle><id.no>1004 amended</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12095</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 9 December 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to paragraph 6.22 in the Australian National Audit Office report no. 6 into fraud control in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, tabled in the Senate on 29 August 2002 and the estimate in the department's Fraud Control Plan that up to $15 million may be at risk to fraud in the medical accounts treatment processing system:</para><para>(1)	(a) What specific items of medical services were included in that estimate; and (b) what was the estimate against each item. </para><para>(2)	For each of the past 3 years, what amounts have been recovered, by state, from: (a) providers of medical services, by type; (b) providers of community nursing; (c) providers of other home care and domestic services; and (d) other providers of health-related services. </para><para>(3)	What resources are specifically allocated in each state office to fraud control and management in the health area. </para><para>(4)	For each state in the past year, how many health providers have been interviewed or counselled with respect to claims lodged for payment. </para><para>(5)	In each of the past 5 years, how many providers of health services have been prosecuted for fraudulent claims. </para><para>(6)	In each of the past 5 years, how many veterans in relation to fraudulent travel claims have been: (a) investigated; and (b) prosecuted. </para><para>(7)	In each of the past 5 years how many transport contractors in relation to fraudulent claims have been: (a) investigated; and (b) prosecuted. </para><para>(8)	With reference to state offices, what instructions exist for the implementation of the fraud control plan.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12095</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a) and (b) The estimate of $15 million was a global estimate only.

The second shipment was detected to have a Malathion residue level of 0.67 ppm.</para><para>	(f)	The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) undertakes inspections of blueberries on a consignment basis - where a consignment is defined as the product declared on a single phytosanitary certificate. A representative sample is randomly selected from the consignment and visually inspected for the presence of live quarantine insects/diseases. Each piece of produce in the inspection sample is closely examined, and any suspect produce is further examined using a X10 hand lens. The packaging is also checked for the presence of live insects. The entire consignment will pass or fail based on the outcome of the inspection. AQIS does not examine or test fresh fruit or vegetables for chemical residues or for quality issues.</para><para>Unless a different sampling rate is specified by the importing country (i.e. under a protocol arrangement), the inspection sample is to comprise 600 units (unit is 1 piece of fruit or vegetable) - or for small consignments, 2% of the cartons in the consignment. In the case of blueberries, which are packed in small punnets, the inspection sample is selected on the following basis: Random selection of 6 trays/cartons per consignment and full inspection of 2 punnets per tray/carton (equivalent to 50 berries per punnet). This will give a sample size of 600 units. Alternatively, 2% of the number of trays can be sampled with the minimum sample being 3 punnets per tray. </para><para>	(g)	AQIS understands that the pre-export inspections for these two shipments were performed according to the above criteria.</para><para>	(h)	The excessive residue level of Malathion was detected in the first shipment on 1 November 2002. MHLW notified the Australian Embassy in Tokyo of the second Malathion residue detection on 25 November 2002.</para><para>	(i)	After the detection of the first violation of the MRL in the first shipment of blueberries, the Japanese government implemented a 50% enhanced inspection order in accordance with Japanese legislation. Japanese authorities notified the Australian exporters of the high Malathion residues on 5 November 2002 for the first consignment and 25 November 2002 for the second consignment. On 26 November 2002, MHLW notified by press release, the implementation of an enhanced inspection order for blueberry fruit from Australia. The order required sampling and Malathion testing of all (100%) blueberry fruit imported into Japan. This order stipulated that MHWL would approve customs clearance of Australian blueberries after MHLW-certified laboratories confirmed non-violation of the MRL for Malathion.  </para><para>MHLW conducted a review of the existing inspection orders during March, and have implemented the enhanced inspection order from 1 April 2003 until 31 March 2004. All Australian blueberries, (excluding those which are accompanied by an Australian Government certificate for completion of chemical residue tests), will be subject to inspections by MHLW-certified laboratories for Malathion residues.</para><para>	(j)	Between when the first violation was detected and remedial action taken, and 28 January 2003, 83,931 trays of blueberries in 187 containers have been exported to Japan by Blueberry Farms of Australia and tested for Malathion residues. All have been cleared for release. Furthermore, since the 100% inspection and testing requirement was imposed by MHLW on 26 November 2002, and 28 January 2003, 38,501 trays of fruit in 55 consignments have been successfully imported into Japan in 58 AV containers. All shipments to other countries, including the UK, have met all of these countries' food safety standards and MRLs. Up until 28 January 2003, this was in excess of 122 consignments totalling more than 28,620 trays.</para><para>	(k)	After notification of the detection of the Malathion residue violation on 5 November 2002, remedial actions commenced immediately by AFFA. Malathion is now applied to blueberries at 50% label rate and not used at all on small blueberry bushes. After the second violation was reported, all Malathion applications to blocks for Japan ceased and the chemical is no longer used for pest control.  </para><para>Exporter information was obtained from importers to aid the trace back of fruit by AFFA.</para><para>An AQIS audit visit was conducted on 3 December 2002. The auditor verified that the violation of the MRL was not due to deficiencies in AQIS regulated procedures.  </para><para>Correspondence and representations by staff have been exchanged between the Australian Embassy in Japan and MHLW on a number of occasions providing technical and other information outlining remedial action taken to prevent recurrence of residues of Malathion over the Japanese MRL.

Information has only been withheld if deemed necessary for the security of ADF and Coalition personnel. I have given frequent media statements and Defence has made ongoing efforts throughout the Operation to keep the Australian Public informed of our efforts. This has been achieved with the development of an unclassified website; daily operations briefings from ADF spokesmen and numerous public statements from CDF, Service Chiefs and other senior officers, both in Australia and the Middle East Area of Operations. Also, official Defence historians are deployed in theatre to record significant events. At the completion of the Operation, and given the appropriate period for publication the official, historians' report will be readily available to the public.</para><para>(2)	The types of operations conducted by the different ADF elements makes it impossible to give an accurate figure of Iraqi casualties, either military or civilian and any attempt to do so has the potential to be misleading.</para><para>(3)	No. Australia does not use cluster munitions and the ADF does not have cluster munitions in its inventory. Actions by others in the wider battle sometimes involved the use of cluster munitions. It is possible that ADF forces were indirectly involved in operations in which others used cluster munitions. Therefore, although I am able to confirm that cluster munitions were not used by the ADF, I am unable to confirm that ADF elements were not involved in operations where those munitions were employed.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>12115</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1467)</subtitle><id.no>1467</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 May 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the answers to question on notice nos 1160 to 1162 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 14 May 2003, p.10967):</para><para>(1)	Have Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel been instructed to prevent objects of archaeological or cultural significance from being taken out of Iraq.</para><para>(2)	(a) What instructions have been given to ADF personnel about the movement of items of archaeological or cultural significance; and (b) can a copy of the instruction be provided.</para><para>(3)	(a) Are ADF personnel able to search people leaving Iraq; and (b) do ADF personnel search people leaving Iraq; if so: (i) under what circumstances, and (ii) have any archaeological or cultural items been recovered.</para><para>(4)	(a) Can a copy be provided of the analysis relating to cultural property, including archaeological sites, which was prepared for the military operations in Iraq as referred to in your previous answer; and (b) if a different analysis has been prepared for the occupation of Iraq, can a copy of that also be provided.</para><para>(5)	Is Australia required to analyse the effectiveness of its compliance with the Hague Convention; if so: (a) when and how will that be done; and (b) when will it be published.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Australia is subject to a range of obligations under international and domestic law governing cultural property. Cultural property is protected under the laws of armed conflict and specific conventions. For each specific operational deployment, Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel receive training that concentrates on an individual's obligations under the laws of armed conflict including the obligation to respect cultural property. For Operation FALCONER, the training has included individual member's obligations under the Hague Convention (1954) and the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention (1949). </para><para>(2)	(a) and (b) Defence has issued policy giving specific guidance on collection restrictions, the approval process, in-theatre preparation and the management of non-Australian imported materiel into Australia.

The classification of the analysis does not allow it to be tabled in the public domain. That analysis complied with the laws of armed conflict including the Hague Convention, its definitions of archaeological and cultural sites. A separate analysis has not been conducted for the occupation of Iraq.</para><para>(5)	(a) and (b) Under article 26(2) of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, Australia has an obligation to periodically report on measures being taken, prepared or contemplated by the Government of Australia in fulfilment of that Convention. However, Australia does not formally have an obligation to conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of its compliance, with respect to the operations of Australian forces during activities such as Operation FALCONER with the Convention. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
