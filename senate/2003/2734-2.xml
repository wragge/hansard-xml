In doing so the amendment gives effect to the government's express desire that proponents would not be able to thwart or circumvent the referral, assessment and approvals provisions of the EPBC Act by splitting projects into smaller components. In this regard the explanatory memorandum for the EPBC Bill says:</para><para>An action may be a series of activities carried out over a particular time period (for example, under a licence or permit). This is intended to ensure a person cannot avoid the provisions of the Act by breaking one action into many small actions.</para><para>Controlled action decisions have been made on split projects over the past two years but there is still some ambiguity about whether the minister has the ability to enforce the government's stated commitment that I have just quoted. Our amendment will simply provide that certainty. </para><para>When a proposal is referred to the minister, he or she must decide whether the action requires approval under part 9—in other words, whether it is a controlled action. Under part 7 the minister can decide that an action will not require approval under part 9 if it is taken in a specified manner. The problem with this process at the moment is that the manner specified is not enforceable. A person who takes an action in contravention of the manner specified will be guilty of breaching the act only if it can be established that the action had a significant impact or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter protected under the relevant provisions of part 3. The amendment rectifies this problem by inserting a statutory obligation to comply with the manner specified outlined in the notice of decision. It also imposes penalties for noncompliance.</para><para>In addition, the amendment repeals section 77(5). That section provides that reasons for controlled action decisions do not need to be given in relation to referrals where the person proposing to take the action stated in the referral that they thought it was a controlled action. In the interests of improved accountability and transparency it is appropriate for reasons to be provided in all circumstances. I point out that this is almost identical to Senator Lees's amendment (109) but in Senator Lees's amendment a minor error has been picked up. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator J.J.

Our amendment gives the minister the capacity to grant a maximum of two extensions of time to the AHC for the production of assessments if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the relevant period. Each extension is for up to 12 months, meaning that all assessments must be completed within five years, which should be enough time for the AHC to complete an assessment and consider new studies et cetera, even for very large areas.

Specifically, the question is: will the nine sites, which I understand either have listing or are waiting to be listed, be listed prior to that crown land being sold off on Norfolk Island?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13610</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to take that on notice because I do not know of any plan to sell off land on Norfolk Island.

This plant is found in only one place, and the population is down to some 250 mature individuals. The plant is listed as critically endangered because it is confined to that area. It actually occupies a space of less than 10 hectares. There is only one population, and it is declining. There are extreme fluctuations in the numbers of plants and, clearly, it is faced with extinction. The access road through the Southport Lagoon conservation area to the Recherche Bay logging area goes right through this area of habitat of this critically endangered plant. Could the minister give me the status of the study of the impact of that access road, which was begun in May 12 months ago but is now on hold and is slated for renewed roadworks if the logging proceeds at the end of the year? In the assessment of the status of the plant, it names that road as a specific danger, not just directly but through the introduction of rootrot fungus, for example, which could endanger this plant, which is making its last stand on the planet. I ask the minister: is the swamp eyebright on the critically endangered list under the current legislation? If so, what will be the impact of the road on that eyebright? To be blunt, isn't it a matter of that road not being allowed to proceed without danger to this plant, which as I said is making its last stand? What other action would be appropriate to protect the plant other than ensuring that that road does not proceed? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>13611</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know off-hand the status of the swamp eyebright, and I have to confess that I do not know of this particular access road.

It is to do with its cultural as well as its natural heritage—in particular as a meeting place between the great French scientific expedition of D'Entrecasteaux and the Pallevar people in 1793. It was a very extensive meeting, and it has been very extensively diarised by the French expeditioners of the time. I have just alluded to a further factor that is involved here, which is that one of the most critically endangered species in Australia, the swamp eyebright in Tasmania—which, by the way, is a most beautiful flowering plant—is right in the way of roadworks being proposed for a very limited but destructive logging operation to be undertaken by Gunns Pty Ltd at any time that a voluntary moratorium is listed. </para></talk.start><para>We have here a critically endangered suite of values. The minister wrote to me saying that there was an independent assessment of these values being done by the Tasmanian Heritage Council and that it was an appropriate way to proceed. But what I want to draw Senator Hill's attention to is a decision—for reasons unknown; I believe it was a political decision involving the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Jim Bacon, intervening in the process— saying that the Tasmanian Heritage Council will not do an independent study. He went on to say that therefore the community groups, without the money, the wherewithal or the expertise—they would have to go and look for those—would have to do the study if they wanted this area protected. </para><para>What I am pointing to here is a totally inadequate process for doing an assessment of a critically endangered area by the system that is in place. Surely the Commonwealth should move in to do this assessment if the state government will not. Why should it be left to community groups to do this work? Is this not prime national heritage that is at stake here? I ask the government: ought it not move in to ensure there is an independent study done? Why put it to a group of communities which, at the end, will no doubt have their expertise questioned by the logging industry which wants to get in and make money out of logging part of that peninsula? It ought to be done at arms length by government and it ought to be independent. I asked the minister what the reasons were for suddenly not having that study done in Tasmania, because I believe they are political and I believe they are the outcome of pressure from Gunns on the Tasmanian government, which has said it will not help by doing the study that is required. </para><para>It is the worst of my fears—and the fears of the Greens—about this legislation that is happening now right in front of this committee. I want the minister to be able to assure us that there is a better process than this— that it will not be at the behest of a pressure group, which has a development afoot, that is simply moving right across a proper process for establishing critically endangered National Estate and putting the kybosh on it as best they can. I ask the minister: will he ensure that he gets a response from the Tasmanian government as to why that funding was not provided, if that is the problem, for the Tasmanian Heritage Council to go ahead with this decision to do an independent study? I am sure Senator Hill will agree with me that, on the face of it, it does not add up.  </para><para>It is not a reasonable process to say to community groups, `Yes, this is endangered; within months they are going to be in there logging, you go and do the work that says that they should not do it.' You cannot have prime Australian heritage sites—cultural and natural—and an extraordinarily important historic landscape subject to such imminent damage as this, and you cannot have governments withdrawing and saying to the community, `You sort it out, you prove it to us or the damage is going to occur.' I ask the minister: will he find out why that independent study is not proceeding and is there a Commonwealth facility to do that independent archaeological, historic and natural assessment as to the value of this peninsula? Might I also flag with the minister a real problem arising here. This is going to become a huge dispute in Tasmania in the New Year if it is not properly dealt with now.</para><para>The Tasmanian Heritage Council made an interim listing of about a hectare around the French garden site on the peninsula and down south on the point, where the observatory was. But the logging is going to occur. It is just 10 hectares of logging within this 140-hectare peninsula, but to get into the peninsula they have to go through the Southport Lagoon conservation area, which is protected. That requires the permission of the Premier of Tasmania—he has to give his go-ahead—and it will threaten the highly endangered swamp eyebright. The peninsula is a cultural landscape because the French moved across it in a great number of surveys. They met up with the Indigenous people in the second year and there are extraordinarily detailed descriptions of their interrelationship with the Tasmanian Aboriginal people. It is a remarkable record of positive contact between those two totally different cultures. </para><para>This small peninsula, with its intact sites, is extremely important. I would be happy to provide the minister with maps of the French expeditions and an indication of the complexity of the historical values of what we know about this peninsula. Frankly, there is no way. Gunns is logging thousands of hectares a year. To log this 10 hectares on this peninsula is way out of court. The minister and I have different approaches to many things, but I appeal to him to get some information about this issue and the way it is being handled. I think the Tasmanian government is being influenced by Gunns to make a very big mistake that will damage one of the most important small cultural landscapes in the nation. </para><para>I reiterate: the garden was put there by the French. There is a second garden that has not been located yet, possibly in the woods there, that is the site of the first European burial in Tasmania. It is the site of a duel between a woman who secreted herself onto a French expedition dressed as a man, got sick of being slagged off for her effeminate ways, had a duel with one of the crew and was winged on the peninsula—a very famous woman in French history. She later fell in love with one of the crew on board. The two of them, sadly, succumbed to a tropical disease in Indonesia on the way home and died within a day of each other. So did D'Entrecasteaux himself. They were caught up with the revolution occurring in France. </para><para>The historical collection relating to this peninsula, including the first collection of the floral emblems of both Tasmania and Victoria, is still intact in the drawers of conservatoriums in Paris and in Florence. The historical record of this contact is quite extraordinary. For Gunns to be going in to log the centre of this cultural landscape—I understand it will now be after Christmas because they simply do not have enough equipment to get there in the meantime—is just not on. But it is going to happen. We had a process for an independent assessment and suddenly—I think it is due to pressure from the Tasmanian government and/or the logging industry—the independent experts who are going to assess this peninsula for its cultural value are withdrawn.  </para><para>One of the most eminent archaeologists in Australia, Professor Mulvaney, and Dr Bickford from Sydney, also an eminent expert in the field, have been to the site and have said this is an extraordinarily important cultural landscape which must be protected. I would appeal to the minister to talk with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage about the tragic situation unfolding in Tasmania around this natural heritage site, and to move to protect the Commonwealth's interest in this site. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>13614</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an eloquent and passionate case put by Senator Brown.

But I will find out the detail of the process that has been adopted, why it changed, and ensure that it will achieve the outcome of a proper assessment.

Obviously, with those amendments having failed, Labor does not now believe that this bill is supportable in any form, and I should flag that Labor intends to move a couple more amendments in this debate on related matters. I express my disappointment and concern that the government was not able to recognise Labor's view that the independence factor was our fundamental claim—our case for what could make this bill workable.</para></talk.start><para>As I stated yesterday, many of my colleagues have stated that Labor recognise that there did need to be some change to heritage protection and our amendments created the opportunity to maintain that critical independence of the Heritage Commission as well as to make those upgrading and updating changes that we think were also constructive and positive.

A very clear example of this is occurring at the moment with the logging of the Styx Valley, the Huon Valley, the Weld Valley and the Picton Valley in Tasmania, where eminent experts in the field have pointed out that, for example, the wilderness values of the World Heritage area are being infringed. Currently there is a major logging coupe under Snowy North, one of the peaks of the Snowy Range in Tasmania, where, by the way, this morning snow has fallen down to 300 metres right across the Styx Valley. There is no way anybody could say other than that that is damaging the World Heritage values of the Snowy Range itself and its wilderness values. </para></talk.start><para>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has called on the Australian government to protect the World Heritage area from this impact on the World Heritage values and particularly the degradation of the wilderness values of the World Heritage area by this creeping series of logging coupes, the danger of breakaway fires and feral animals and plants being brought in and, of course, the remoteness and intactness of the wilderness itself being compromised by logging right up to World Heritage boundaries.

Under that convention Australia commits to the conservation of World Heritage listed assets, and that might be affected by actions outside the listed boundary. It has always been a contentious area, but in principle what I have said I think is correct. It is contentious in the sense that it would have to be proven that the actions outside are significantly and detrimentally affecting the World Heritage values inside. I think the same principles will apply in relation to an asset that is listed under the new national list, because it is listed for its values and the obligation is to conserve the values. I know that in relation to Tasmania there has been a long and at times contentious debate about the effect of certain logging actions in what I think used to be referred to as the shoulder areas or the margins of the World Heritage list. They are debates that the scientists have and assessments are made. I know it is an area that has been of interest to the World Heritage Commission in the past. The bottom line of what I am saying is that what was the position in the past, as I understand it, continues. Therefore, Senator Brown in his efforts in this area is at least not detrimentally affected by the changes that are proposed in the chamber today. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13620</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been making out—and the minister is echoing that—that in very important aspects the changes being made in the chamber do not help.

Underlying this is the reality that commercial interests—in this case Gunns Ltd—override timeless heritage values for the nation as a whole. The whole point and the central thrust of the argument is that this legislation does not give teeth to protecting heritage areas against such prodigious commercial interests. Short-term commercial interests win out over the long-term national interest.</para></talk.start><para>The minister is not going to come back and answer my challenge, because there is no answer to it. The fact is that the World Heritage values in Tasmania are being damaged today by those logging activities. It is not just the wilderness values; there are threats to other values. Indeed, the Styx Valley should be part of the World Heritage area, because it is of World Heritage value and adds to the stature of the World Heritage area. I am not going to get any good answer out of the government—nor would I if the opposition were sitting over there—on this central question of our nationhood, which is: where do we draw the line on the continual attrition of the natural, historic and cultural values of this nation which is occurring at a greater rate now than ever before? This is not some process where we are turning it around. It is occurring at a greater rate than ever before in history and this legislation does not have the teeth to stop it. It does not have the teeth to stop it because we are in a materialist age which says you must not get in the way of companies like Gunns making money at the expense of not just this generation of Australians but all generations to come.</para><para>The World Heritage values in Tasmania are being damaged; that is the totality of expert opinion. But this government is not doing anything about it and, under the regional forest agreement, the Prime Minister stamped his approval on the process—wide-eyed and knowingly. This legislation does not countermand that deliberate support for the frittering of extraordinarily important values, which is at the heart of the matter we are debating today. It is something that is going to have to be corrected. We cannot undo the damage being done now, but we have to put an end to this process down the line.

Because so many of the amendments not only are, I think, similar but also cover the same territory, the minister is now sitting back and just picking and choosing the ones that will meet the government's objectives as far as the deal that was being negotiated leading up to the debate today goes. So, again, from Labor's point of view, we are not supporting these amendments. What we are dealing with is the nature and extent of that deal between various parties on the crossbench—primarily, in this case, the Democrats and Senator Lees. It just makes for an interesting observation. Senator Bartlett was, obviously, quite right when he said, in his speech in the second reading debate yesterday, that the negotiations did not go too well.

Section 341 currently requires that, if the minister includes a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List, he or she must notify the owners and occupiers of the place and the person who nominated the place if the place was nominated. Amendment (40) inserts an additional requirement for the minister to publish a copy of a notice of decision and the reasons for the decision on the Internet. This amendment will ensure greater transparency in the listing process.</para><para>Other amendments require that, if the minister decides not to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List, he or she must publish details of the decision and the reasons for the decision on the Internet and provide a statement of reasons to the person who nominated the place within 10 business days. These are some of our general amendments on transparency in the listing process. Under the emergency listing provisions, the minister can include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List if he or she believes the place may have one or more Commonwealth heritage values and any of those values are under threat. After including a place and its values on the list, under these provisions the minister must ask the AHC to assess whether the place does in fact have any Commonwealth heritage values. At the completion of the assessment, the minister must decide whether to keep the place and its heritage values on the Commonwealth Heritage List.</para><para>Further amendments require the minister to notify the owners and occupiers of the place and the person who nominated the place for inclusion on the list, including the person who notified the minister of the need to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List under the emergency listing provisions, and to provide them with reasons for the decision within 10 business days of the decision. As the bill currently stands, there is no requirement to provide this information to a person who notifies the minister of the need to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List under emergency listing provisions.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13631</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment (46) on sheet 2990: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(46)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 54 (lines 16 and 17), omit subsection 341L(7), substitute: </para><para>	(7)	The Minister must publish within 10 business days a copy of the instrument published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette </inline>on the Internet and in any other place required under the regulations (if any).</para></quote><para>This amendment relates to publication of decisions to remove places or Commonwealth heritage values from the Commonwealth Heritage List.

It is required because the bill currently contains provisions that may result, we think, in inadequate statutory protection being provided to places of Indigenous heritage significance. Indigenous heritage values of a place are currently defined as:</para><para>... the heritage value of the place that is of particular significance to indigenous persons in accordance with their traditions.</para><para>The key problem is the potential for historic heritage values of Indigenous communities to be excluded from this definition. For example, archaeological surveys of an area known to have been occupied by a particular Indigenous community may reveal burial remains or evidence of human settlement— for instance: middens, stone tools et cetera. The Indigenous group or community may have no known tradition that places importance on the objects that are discovered. However, these objects clearly would have special historic significance to the Indigenous group or community over and above their significance to other Australians. </para><para>Similarly, the customs and beliefs of an Indigenous community may have traditionally attributed significance to a place, but these customs and beliefs may no longer be acknowledged and observed by the Indigenous community. In these circumstances it is arguable that the heritage value of a place is not an Indigenous heritage value because the special significance of the place to the Indigenous community is not in accordance with their traditions, rather the place has historical, cultural significance that is unrelated to the customs and beliefs currently held by the community. This issue is also of concern to ATSIC and it is my understanding that a letter was sent to the minister from ATSIC in the last few days regarding this.</para><para>The problem with the definition of `Indigenous heritage values' arises in the context of the statutory protection that will be afforded to national heritage values under part 3 of the EPBC Act. Proposed subsections 15B(4), 15C(7) and 15C(8) prohibit a person from taking an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of a national heritage place, to the extent that those national heritage values are Indigenous heritage values, without the approval of the minister under part 9. By way of example, subsection 15B(4) says:  </para><quote><para>A person must not take an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values, to the extent that they are indigenous heritage values, of a National Heritage place. </para></quote><para>This creates a two-stage process for establishing a breach of those provisions of sections 15B and C that relate to Indigenous heritage values. Firstly, it will be necessary to establish that the relevant action has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on national heritage values of a national heritage place. Secondly, the applicant or prosecutor will have to prove that the value threatened by the action is an Indigenous heritage value. Establishing the second element will require the applicant to prove that the relevant heritage value is of particular significance to Indigenous persons in accordance with their tradition. This ensures that those heritage values that are included in the National Heritage List on the basis of their social, cultural or spiritual importance to a particular cultural group or community will not be protected under subsections 15B(4), 15C(7), 15C(8) unless a link between the value and the traditions of the relevant group or community can be established. </para><para>There is considerable uncertainty associated with what will constitute `traditions' for these purposes. This could result in many heritage values that are of great importance to contemporary Indigenous communities not being able to be protected under these provisions. It is also arguable that places that are only of historic significance to an Indigenous group or community as opposed to being of significance in accordance with their traditions will not be protected under these provisions. </para><para>If it cannot be proven that the national heritage values of a national heritage place are of particular significance to Indigenous persons in accordance with their traditions, these values will only be able to be protected under the other provisions in sections 15B and C that rely on heads of power unrelated to Indigenous issues. In other words, it will be necessary to establish that the defendant's action was taken or will be taken for the purpose of trade or commerce et cetera. To ensure that Indigenous heritage is appropriately protected, the Democrats propose the following definition: </para><para>... indigenous heritage value of the place means the heritage value that is of significance to indigenous persons generally or a particular group of indigenous persons in accordance with their practices (including laws and cultural practices), observances, customs, traditions, beliefs or history. </para><para>It is our view that this is an improvement on the amendment which has been circulated by Senator Lees. Our amendment makes it clear that an Indigenous heritage value can be of significance to Indigenous persons generally and a particular group of Indigenous persons. Senator Lees's amendment only specifies Indigenous persons. It is necessary, we think, to specify that the values can apply to a particular group of Indigenous persons since there is the ambiguity that I mentioned as to what `Indigenous persons' means and whether this implies all Indigenous persons or can include a particular group of Indigenous persons. </para><para>Our amendment also specifically includes reference to laws and cultural practices. If the minister does not intend to support this amendment, I would appreciate some response from him as to why this is the case. I also ask the minister to indicate whether the government intends to bring the ATSIHP bills—which were to some extent dealt with in the Senate some years ago—on for debate. To some extent the Democrats think it is important that that legislation is dealt with and that the EPBC Act is not replied upon for Indigenous cultural heritage. So I ask that some assurances be provided to the chamber that that legislation is forthcoming. If it is not, I would like some dates on which we can expect to see the legislation to be debated. If we cannot, then I urge the chamber to support this legislation because, as we know, many Indigenous sites are at risk or have been lost. If we cannot properly deal with heritage protection through the ATSIHP bills then I commend this amendment to the chamber as a way of making sure that we do it through this legislation. I ask the minister to respond to the matters that I have raised.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13638</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue of Indigenous heritage is obviously very important but also very complex, and it is no secret that there are strongly held and differing views within the Indigenous community on the issue. Some would argue that it is inappropriate for Indigenous heritage to be within legislation of this type at all, but the view of the government is that it is necessary to have contemporary and effective legislation to protect sites of significance. As we have said, the current legislation is inadequate in that regard and the government is still intending to bring to the Senate new site protection legislation. There has been a long consultation on the detail of that legislation. That consultation is still not complete. I thought it was all but complete before the last election, but it did not quite reach finality. I am assured by the current minister that the process has continued and the bill will be brought to the parliament as soon as possible. I cannot give a specific date.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation deals with something different in this area—Indigenous heritage that comes within the definition of `national significance'. When it does, it achieves the protection that is set out within the legislation. On the issue of the definition of Indigenous heritage, again there has been a range of views. I am told that, whilst ATSIC may have preferred an even wider definition, through Commissioner Dillon it is prepared to accept this definition. I gather that there has been a flow of correspondence on that issue. The definition that we will accept does not go as far as that proposed by Senator Allison, but we think in the circumstances, the type and purpose of the legislation we are dealing with today, it is appropriate. I think as time goes by, and as a result of the continuing debate on these complex issues and changes of view within the Indigenous community, there may be argument for further changes in this area, but we think that what we have put before the chamber today and the changes to the definition as foreshadowed in amendments that are to come later in this debate achieve the purpose of being able to protect Indigenous heritage of national significance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13638</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Hill has made it clear that he is supporting Senator Lees's proposition rather than the Democrat proposition.

That is why the government has been prepared to undertake such a comprehensive and time-consuming negotiating process. It is still not quite complete, but I am advised that it is getting there.

I asked whether the minister could outline what `continuing' means. Does that mean everyone sitting with the draft bill on their desk or are there meetings taking place? If so, when was the last time the government met with ATSIC on this issue or with other groups who are keen on the bill? It is my understanding that Indigenous groups were happy with the bill as it was last drafted.

It is my understanding that there are a number of protected Aboriginal heritage sites that are being compromised by clear-fell logging in Tasmania. These are sites that are listed by the relevant state authorities but which are nevertheless expected to be protected under the Forest Practices Code, which is the mechanism for implementing the regional forest agreement and a Commonwealth signed document. I ask the government whether it could furnish me and the chamber with a list of sites known to be in regional forest agreement areas which have been affected by logging since the regional forest agreement was signed. I refer to individual sites from the finding of implements to quarry sites, habitation sites, middens—all listed sites in Tasmania. I ask the government whether it could give the committee a complete list of which sites have been destroyed and what the parameters are for allowing clear-fell logging where such sites are destroyed. I also ask whether the government can furnish the chamber with a list of prospective sites that are now threatened with imminent destruction. Logging is moving into coupes anywhere in the state where there are Aboriginal sites and there has been a request that these Aboriginal sites not get in the way of that clear-fell logging. The logging is either occurring through and between the sites or is, in effect, bulldozing them into obliteration.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13640</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am a little puzzled by the question. I would have thought that if the sites were listed under the Tasmanian Aboriginal site protection legislation then they would be protected under that legislation. One of the difficulties in this area is that there is another part of the Indigenous community who either are uncomfortable with or believe it inappropriate to identify the location of sites and therefore, if the state is setting rules for forestry activities and is unaware of the location of Aboriginal heritage sites, it is very difficult for it to take those into account. I cannot see that the Commonwealth would have a list of prospective Indigenous sites as referred to by Senator Brown, but if there is a particular Indigenous site that he believes might be characterised as being of national heritage significance and which is being affected by the regional forest agreement then we would be prepared to have a look at that. There is always the possibility of a renegotiation of aspects of an agreement with the state where, following the agreement, new information comes to light—and new information relating to Indigenous heritage of significance is always treated very seriously. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13641</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would be satisfied if the minister could furnish the Senate with a list of sites in Tasmania that were listed but have been given ministerial exemption for their disturbance and/or destruction by the logging processes since the regional forest agreement came into being.

In my view, Indigenous heritage is of national significance wherever it is, but the Commonwealth may have a different view on that.

The government argues that there are some sites which would not be appropriate to put straight onto the list because there would be further consultation required. The most often cited case is the wet tropics in Queensland, where Indigenous groups would like to see that early listing amended in order to pick up some of the Indigenous values that are not currently on it. We would argue that there is still an opportunity to do that, that if these sites—and there are not that many of them—were to be put immediately on the National Heritage List, given the very extensive assessment process that has already taken place for them, this not only would be a good and important gesture but would indicate that the National Heritage List was just that. </para><para>The government also argues that the list already has a very high level of protection, and that is true. But this is about whether or not we have a list which can truly be said to be of national significance and there are no more significant sites than those that are currently on World Heritage. We see no reason why this should not happen. The government argument goes along the lines that there needs to be more work. That is fine: put them on the list, do further work on them, make them a priority and then adjust that assessment as necessary. </para><para>I urge the ALP to think about this one. If they vote against this, it is an indication that they do not see great value in World Heritage, that they do not see World Heritage sites in this country as of national significance. I know they are not supporting any of these amendments because it is not their old regime and it is not what they proposed to do with their amendments. However, it seems to me that this, for a whole range of reasons, is a very important thing to do and I strongly urge senators to think carefully about these amendments and support them. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>13644</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just briefly explain the government's position. We do not support the amendments, but it is not because we do not wish the World Heritage assets to be listed on the national list. We do believe that the process of assessment should take place and, further, that that can have incidental beneficial outcomes. I pick up the point that Senator Allison mentioned in relation to the Wet Tropics that is not listed on the World Heritage List for its indigenous values, which would be described as cultural values, yet there may well be a strong argument, and I have certainly heard the argument put, that those values are such that it would deserve listing under that heading on the Australian national list. Therefore, we think that it is better an assessment process take place, and that is why we have drafted the bill in the way we have.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13644</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It must be extremely humiliating for the Democrats to go through this extended exercise in trying to salvage at least a little of their deal with the government on these bills. I think, on this matter like every other matter, Labor has made it very clear that we do not think these bills are salvageable. I know we are going to be taking an opportunity at some point in hopefully the not-too-distant future to put forward a couple of amendments of our own, but we have made our position clear. We think the crossbenchers had the opportunity to preserve the most important principle and the fundamental issue, and that was the independence. When push comes to shove in all these Democrat amendments that we are now considering—and the amendments that we will consider that have been foreshadowed by Senator Lees—what we are talking about is trying to now make a fundamentally flawed regime a little more accountable by tinkering with it around the edges. Labor is not engaging in the process. We are not supporting the amendments. We do not believe that the accountability regime will be effective once you give the minister the power to make these decisions.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13644</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The problem there is that Labor has got its amendments coming down the line— the same as the Greens do. We do not know what the outcome is going to be in the vote at the end of today. It is going to be close. Anybody who has looked at some of the earlier amendments and the way the vote went there would know that. I think we are caught in the position where, yes, we do have flawed legislation—it is seriously flawed— but it is heading for potential enactment and, under those circumstances, we certainly have to do what we can to influence the quality of the legislation, to bring it from one out of 10 to two out of 10 if we can.</para></talk.start><para>When it comes to the World Heritage properties, of course they should be listed on a National Heritage List. They are listed, and they should remain so. They should be made as safe as possible. The question is about the ability of this bill to protect anything. Here is a chance for the parliament to establish a baseline list of World Heritage properties to go onto the new National Heritage List, which comes out of the ashes of the burning and destruction of the list that had been drawn up with the nation's best expertise over the last 35 years. The parliament has a right to feed into that list. It has the right to establish it. Senator Allison is right: the World Heritage properties in Australia obviously qualify for the National Heritage List. As has been said so often, they are the cream of the cultural and natural heritage properties of this nation and from around the world. I agree with Senator Allison that Labor should support the amendments. Certainly the Greens will be. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendments (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Temporary Chairman—Senator L.J.

It concerns the way in which sites are listed, the powers of the minister and whether or not sites are listed for their heritage value or for some other purpose. These amendments set out the procedure for the inclusion of places and heritage values on the National and Commonwealth Heritage lists. In short, the standard process for both lists under our amendments is as follows. Anyone can make a nomination. The minister refers the nomination to the AHC for assessment of whether the place has any national or Commonwealth heritage values; in other words, whether it meets any of the listing criteria. The AHC carries out its assessment. In making the assessment the AHC must seek public comments on the nomination. The AHC then provides its assessment to the minister. If the AHC finds that the place has no national or Commonwealth heritage values, and the minister agrees with the assessment, then the minister cannot list the place.</para><para>If the AHC finds that the place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values, the minister has three options: to include the place and all its national or Commonwealth heritage values, to not include the place on non-heritage grounds, or to include the place and only some of its national or Commonwealth heritage values on non-heritage grounds. If the council finds that a place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values, and the minister decides not to include the place or one or more of its relevant heritage values on the National or Commonwealth Heritage List—in other words, makes a decision not to include on non-heritage grounds—the minister is required to undertake additional public consultation to give all stakeholders an opportunity to comment on the non-heritage matters that purport to justify the exclusion of the place or heritage values from the list.</para><para>In undertaking this additional consultation, the minister is required to publish a copy of the AHC's assessment and the reasons for his or her proposed decision not to include the place or some of its heritage values on the National or Commonwealth Heritage List. The minister can undertake additional public consultation in any of the other situations and, at the completion of the additional public consultation process, the minister must decide whether or not to include the place and its heritage values on the list. Our amendments include an equivalent process for the emergency listing procedure. I will provide detailed comments on each of our amendments before completing this part of the debate.</para><para>The minister has, in the earlier part of this debate, complained about Democrat lack of willingness to negotiate on this legislation, or lack of willingness to make our decision or come to agreement with the government— whichever way you see this. For us this has always been one of the most important issues to get right. From memory, we have put up four different models to the government for how listing might be more accountable— how listing might be truly said to be based more on heritage values and less on political, socioeconomic and other considerations; in other words, to be sure that we have a list that is about heritage values first and foremost. I make no apologies for attempting to do this because, as I said, I regard this as the most important aspect of the bill. </para><para>Our first amendment simply amends the outline of the division to note that the minister may undertake additional consultation. It is straightforward. The second amendment requires public consultation during the AHC assessment process. In the present bill the AHC is not required to carry out public consultation when assessing a place; it is only required to notify stakeholders who have a direct interest in the place—that is, owners, occupiers and Indigenous groups. Public consultation is carried out after the AHC has completed its assessment and is only required where the AHC finds that the place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values. This amendment requires the council to undertake public consultation when carrying out an assessment, and it must consider the comments received in making the assessment and give a copy of those comments to the minister with that assessment.</para><para>Amendments (3) to (8) are also about public consultation. They insert an additional public consultation process where the AHC finds that a place has one or more national heritage values and the minister proposes not to include the place or not to include all of its national heritage values on the list. The minister must then undertake additional consultation, and we think that that is reasonable. The minister must publish reasons for the proposed decision and copies of the AHC assessment. The intention is to ensure that, if the minister proposes not to include a place on the National Heritage List on non-heritage grounds—in other words, the miners do not like or there are socioeconomic reasons against doing it—the reasons are subject to public scrutiny. We think that this is the very least that ought to happen. In other words, we have an assessment which says `This has national heritage values' and we have a recommendation from the council that this site be listed. We think it is important that, if the minister does not want to do so, he or she is required to explain themselves.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13651</page.no><id.no>R1766</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13651</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13651</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1766">Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> before the chamber today amends three separate acts to make various changes to aviation policy. The changes will facilitate the ongoing review of civil aviation regulations and provide for the simplification and the international harmonisation of Australia's civil aviation regulatory regime. Specifically, the changes will modify the act to amend aircraft maintenance related definitions and terminology. The new definitions of state aircraft and Australian aircraft will align with international law and practice. The bill also makes minor corrections to provisions relating to goods seized as part of an investigation.</para></talk.start><para>The bill amends the Airports Act 1996 to repeal section 192. This change will remove the requirement for, and the application of, ministerial determinations under that act. This goes to airport services that would otherwise be subject to declaration provision under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. These determinations are by necessity in general terms and subject to ACCC scrutiny. The Productivity Commission found that this section provides no tangible benefit to stakeholders. There was, therefore, no compelling case to keep the process and it declared all airports subject to the generic access provisions of the Trade Practices Act. </para><para>The amendments related to article 83bis agreements are significant. The bill transfers from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the function to enter into article 83bis agreements with the national airworthiness authorities of other countries. Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago 1944, best known as the Chicago Convention, a party state is generally responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft on that state's register irrespective of where the aircraft is in the world. Some obvious difficulties in administering safety regulations arise when an aircraft registered in one country is operated in another for a substantial period. Article 83bis is a relatively recent addition to the Chicago Convention. It correctly enables the transfer of safety regulatory functions from the state of registration of an aircraft to the state in which the aircraft is to operate. Naturally, this can only occur with the agreement of both states. ICAO considers that such agreements should be made between the relevant national airworthiness authorities as they are administrative instruments of less than treaty status.</para><para>Australia ratified article 83bis on 2 December 1994 after amending the Civil Aviation Act by the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 to give effect to the convention. This bill ensures that CASA will have the functions to enter into article 83bis agreements on behalf of Australia. Public scrutiny and transparency of the process are ensured because it is a requirement that CASA publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette </inline>particulars of an article 83bis agreement or an amendment to such an agreement. There will also be detailed administrative and technical provisions concerning the implementation of article 83bis agreements in the regulations.</para><para>I want to pick up on a couple of points made in the other place by my colleague the shadow minister Mr Ferguson. Firstly, and in particular, Mr Anderson continues to show more interest in matters other than his portfolio interests and therefore not particularly in the area of his responsibilities. Obviously, he is shortly to leave this parliament but I encourage him in the short time he has left to focus on his day job. He claims to be an expert on Telstra and on water reform but when it comes to his own portfolio you hardly hear from him. You hardly hear any comments from him on aviation but you never hear from him on the shipping industry. You hardly hear any comments from him on his so-called future land transport plan, which, frankly, everyone knows is a shambles. Finally, there are air services amendments from the government to this legislation. My advice from Mr Ferguson is that we will support those amendments to be moved by the government today and we will support the bill as amended.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13652</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1766">Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is an omnibus bill which will make amendments to three different acts.

The memoranda were circulated in the chamber on 25 June 2003. The government amendments will allow Airservices Australia to pursue additional commercial opportunities, both overseas and in Australia, while ensuring that in providing services and facilities Airservices Australia must give priority to air navigation within Australian administered airspace. In doing this, the bill is simply proposing to implement what was always the intention of the Air Services Act 1995. There is no intention or scope in the amendments to change any other aspect of Airservices Australia's governance or the domestic environment in which it operates. These amendments were foreshadowed in the Main Committee to provide an opportunity for all parties to talk to the issue. They also allow Airservices Australia to provide other services and facilities within Commonwealth constitutional limits.

It is interesting that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should introduce a bill that effectively deals with truth in labelling. Australia's access to international markets is reliant on our reputation as being free from pests and diseases that exist in the rest of the world. Yet under this minister we have seen that reputation eroded.</para></talk.start><para>During the May estimates hearings this year the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service admitted that drums of Chinese honey have been transiting through Australia for the purpose of relabelling the products as being of Australian origin. They are then reshipped to our markets in the United States. The honey may have been contaminated with chloramphenicol, which AQIS says causes the disease aplastic anaemia in some susceptible individuals. AQIS could not confirm the number of shipments that had transited through Australia. The Senate estimates committee also heard that some international honey has been labelled `product of Australia' and shipped to third countries without even landing on our shores. </para><para>This honey laundering is occurring on an unknown scale. According to an AQIS official, agriculture minister Warren Truss had in May this year known about the problem for up to 12 months—that is, in May he had been in possession of information about it for 12 months. The committee heard that, even so, Australia still has no arrangements in place with customers of genuine Australian honey to identify the real product. According to the minister's department, this is a problem for importing countries. But Labor disagrees. This scam has the potential to do serious damage to the reputation of Australian honey producers.</para><para>This honey laundering scam revealed by Labor is not the first such scam. Labor also revealed in July last year that meat from other countries is being sold in the international marketplace under forged Australian health certificates. In response to a question on notice, Mr Truss confirmed that in the 18 months to July 2002 some 233 metric tonnes of meat from unknown sources was sold overseas and passed off as coming from Australia. This illicit trade and the associated risk of disease or chemical contamination to our customers could have cost Australian rural industries billions in lost exports. For example, if a shipment of beef contaminated with mad cow disease were to find its way to the US or Japan under forged documentation, it could cast doubts over the entire system of certifying Australian export meat. That could close those and other markets to Australian products. Thanks to Labor, Mr Truss appears to have addressed the problem of beef export health certificates, but we will of course be keeping an eye on this matter continually. Mr Truss is yet to act on ensuring the integrity of export honey marked `product of Australia', and every day he delays he is damaging the international reputation of not only Australian honey but our entire export certification process for agricultural and food products.</para><para>Whilst on the subject of exports and the government's mismanagement in this area, I must point out the plight of the Tasmanian apple industry. I have had a number of representations from Mr Gary Groombridge talking about the difficulties in making a living as an apple producer and the fact that India has real potential as a market for Tasmanian apples. However, the Indian government places heavy import tariffs on our apples. I wrote to Minister Vaile to ask what he had been doing to have these trade restrictive barriers reduced. To his credit, Mr Vaile in his response advised me that he was aware of the problem and had raised the issue with his Indian counterpart during a trip to India in February this year.</para><para>I must say that, like the Howard government's lacklustre efforts on the Japanese beef `snapback' tariff, Mr Vaile's efforts have clearly been too little and too late, and India maintains its tariff position on the importation of Tasmanian apples. I think Minister Vaile's efforts in this regard leave a little to be desired, and I will continue on behalf of Tasmanian apple growers to monitor Mr Vaile's performance on this issue. As I said earlier, market access for our agricultural and food produce depends on our relative disease-free status and the fact that, when people overseas buy Australian, they know—or at least they did know—what they are getting. The inability of Mr Truss to manage this key part of his portfolio risks billions in export income—income to farmers and income to workers who work in the sector and also in the processed food sector—and risks the jobs of thousands of Australians. As this amendment seeks to preserve trade benefits that arise from Australia's unique pest and disease status—something that Labor at least takes seriously—we will support this legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13656</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the bill to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>13656</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.02 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>13656</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13656</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I inform the Senate that Senator Amanda Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services, will be absent from question time today.

I draw to the Senate's attention a survey released last week that showed that R&amp;D expenditure by business in this country is now at a record level. It has gone up 13 per cent, to $5.546 billion. Under this government we are seeing the highest expenditure on R&amp;D in the history of this country. It is now higher than it was when the figures were artificially inflated by the rort of syndication in 1995-96. We have the highest number of companies engaged in the R&amp;D tax concession. We have the highest number of people working in R&amp;D that we have ever had in the history of this country. These tremendous results are a consequence of the focus that this government has put on R&amp;D by virtue of the first ever national innovation summit, which it held in 2001, and the release of the biggest ever support package for innovation in this country, Backing Australia's Ability—a $3 billion commitment to innovation that included not only a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to the 125 per cent tax concession but the introduction for the first time ever of a 175 per cent tax concession for additional R&amp;D and a long-term commitment to the R&amp;D Start program of around $160 million of grants for R&amp;D in this country. </para></talk.start><para>This government has a very proud record in assisting business to engage in the critical activity of investing in R&amp;D. We have now seen the fruits of that effort from the figures that I just quoted from the ABS survey released last week, which show record expenditure. Indeed, if there were any concern that business might have, it would be on the issue of the ALP ever getting into government. The ALP have made it quite clear that they will adopt a very antibusiness strategy in everything that they do and that they will fleece business to pay for their unaffordable promises in education and health. They announced last week that, to pay for their education package, they will attack the mining industry and foreign workers who want to work in Australia. It is clear from statements made by the now shadow Treasurer, Mr Latham, that the R&amp;D tax concession will also be in the firing line. He said, not that long ago, that the R&amp;D tax concession is not a good outlay, it is not a good policy and it is not an efficient strategy. So business, I think understandably, is now very concerned about any prospect of the ALP getting into government, given that it is clear they will fleece business to pay for their extravagant promises. The shadow Treasurer has made it quite clear that business should have no confidence whatsoever that the R&amp;D tax concession—a critical part of our innovation commitment—would survive the advent of an ALP government.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13657</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

This government has a very strong record of achievement in responsible economic management and our policies have delivered extraordinary growth and wealth creation in this country. In fact, household wealth has increased by $1.6 trillion, or around 90 per cent, since the coalition came to power. As everyone knows, a large element of this growth has flowed from the housing sector. One of the biggest impacts on the demand for housing has been the record low interest rates that Australians have enjoyed under this government. We now have standard variable mortgage rates at 6.55 per cent, down from 10.5 per cent under the Labor government. As of August 2003, the average monthly repayment on a housing loan throughout Australia is $450 lower than it was in the dying days of the previous Labor government. These positive influences have driven the demand for housing, but there are other factors driving the cost of housing. </para></talk.start><para>It is clear beyond argument that the Labor states control the main housing levers, especially in the supply of land and the cost of stamp duty, which is staggering in its magnitude. A recent survey by the Housing Industry Association showed that in Sydney state and local government fees, levies and stamp duty on the average first home contract will total about $85,000, while the GST component will be around $34,000. This reduces to $27,000 once the first home owners grant is added back. In Victoria, state and local government fees and charges are 2.6 times the amount of Commonwealth charges. State government revenue from stamp duties now stands at an extraordinary $8.4 billion. Since 1996, the stamp duty on the average home has hiked from $6,000 to $16,000 in the most populated cities—Sydney and Melbourne—where the first home buyers feel the tax slug most keenly.</para><para>I am asked about alternative policies. Typically, the member for Werriwa tends to ramble inanely on these sorts of matters—to simply fill the empty policy void that is Labor's policy vacuum—and is totally unconvincing in trying to blame the GST for first home unaffordability. This is a real furphy because the GST only applies to new homes, not the massive stock of existing dwellings. The Commonwealth put in place the first home owners grant of $7,000 which is paid to every first home owner, whether they are buying a new or established home. Eighty-five per cent of first home buyers do not buy new homes so they do not even face the GST, yet they still get the grant. While the Labor states control the housing levers, this government has actually instituted an inquiry—the Productivity Commission inquiry. If the Labor Party wants to help in the interim, it should admit where the problem lies—with state Labor governments—and put the pressure on those who can and should be taking steps now to help families and individuals buy their first home.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Sex Industry</title><page.no>13658</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13658</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

It is now 10 years since Mr Crean and his Labor colleagues gave us one million unemployed, it is 10 years since they gave us 21 per cent interest rates and it is 10 years since they gave us the Centenary House rort. It is easy to see what was attracting Labor's attention 10 years ago. Their priority was to set in place this scam, as opposed to dealing with high unemployment and high interest rates. This scam means that taxpayers will pay an extra $3.5 million above market rates this year and a total of $36 million over the life of the lease.

I think Senator Ray's question suggested that more work would need to be done to ascertain whether it was in the recruitment business and what level of anti-Western propaganda, if that is indeed what it is engaged in, is being propagated. There are, presumably, matters of degree involved in all this. </para></talk.start><para>The government is aware that a number of Arabic language television stations are available on TARBS and on Optus pay television.

The government recognises the importance to Australia's Arabic community of television services that enable them to maintain links to their cultural heritage. There are, for example, 10 Arabic language channels offered by TARBS. The government would, however, be concerned if a service was being used to promote terrorist activities or to incite racial or religious violence. The ABA does have responsibility to ensure that pay TV broadcasters operate within the provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act and the ABA registered industry codes of practice. The codes require that broadcasters will not knowingly broadcast any program which is likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against, or vilify, any person or group on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual preference, age, religion or disability. </para><para>The Commonwealth Criminal Code contains antiterrorism offences which may apply to certain proterrorist activities engaged in by broadcasters or programs broadcast. Investigation and prosecution would be a matter for the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. So it is a matter of significance. There are sensitivities involved not only in the wider context of enabling people whose primary language might be Arabic but also in general terms of not being overly intrusive. But to the extent that they are engaged in antisocial activities, and ones that might even contravene certain sections of the legislation or the codes of practice, then I am sure the ABA will be taking a very hard look, and we will be awaiting their advice.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13661</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

If you are in the Kenneth Davidson school, you take the view that what should be required of Telstra is that it roll the fixed line network out to every household in Australia. He has estimated that to be about $15 billion or $20 billion. I have seen other people—maybe Senator Cherry—say that you should be spending $4 billion or $5 billion on that sort of activity. You do not need to do that at all. In fact, you would be locking yourself into a particular technology that may become obsolete. DSL currently has a capability of one to two megs, but it is generally reduced by sharing—in what is called the retention ratio—and therefore you want to be able to access the most appropriate technology. At the moment, by definition satellite is universally available, it has ubiquitous coverage and usage rates do not vary, because it does not cost anymore to provide it in metropolitan or non-metropolitan areas.</para></talk.start><para>The key difference at the moment is the cost of the equipment. In order to reduce that to reasonable levels and make the cost of satellite subscription roughly equivalent to the cost of similar services in metropolitan areas, our higher bandwidth incentive scheme will provide for one-off subsidies to carriers on a per capita basis in order to ensure that rural coverage is affordable. At the moment we think with Telstra that about 75 per cent of homes are accessible to DSL. Telstra has just released a new ISDN product, called BigPond ISDN, which will give you 128 kilobits per second, which is double the old ISDN and much higher than your dial-up modem maximum of 56k. </para><para>It is a question of what people want. If you happen to have access to a cable network—and there are probably 2½ million homes that do in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane—then you will be able to get DSL equivalent rates or higher. Broadband rates will normally be adequate for most people's purposes. The idea of somehow spending billions of dollars on rolling out a fixed line network is a complete and utter nonsense. Most people may well find that the new ISDN product is sufficient for their purposes, and that would cover 96 per cent of the population. If you get DSL up to 80 per cent of the population, and our bandwidth incentive scheme covers the other 20 per cent, you have basically catered for the entirety of the Australian community.

Having said that, as Senator Brown will know, Keke has been arrested on a charge concerning robbery.

But he is also being investigated in relation to a number of alleged serious offences, and whether he gets prosecuted for those no doubt will depend on whether evidence is available that could be brought before a court. Beyond that, whether the Solomon Islanders in relation to less serious offences want some form of truth and reconciliation process I think is really a matter for the Solomon Islanders. We do not seek to dictate to them how to run their country, but we agree with them that, unless major offences are prosecuted, they will not be able to run their country.

In relation to the economic misdirection, what I have said is that clearly part of this corruption has been contracts where an unfair benefit of the contract has flowed offshore.

Carer allowance obviously is designed to assist those parents who have children who are disabled. When I was on the other side, we had a debate with Senator Richardson about some of these issues— very difficult issues—about assessing eligibility for an allowance, particularly people with a disability. It is very difficult to assess a person: just to call a person by a disease name does not indicate the level of their ability to perform activities of daily living or how they compare with someone who is not disabled.</para></talk.start><para>There are some disorders or medical conditions where it is very clear and very obvious that a person will require ongoing care on a regular basis. There are others where, with age, a child can improve, can develop skills and can learn to cope—as Senator Vanstone said yesterday—with diseases like diabetes. When they are below five or six, it is obvious that they need a carer, but as they get older and can deal with self-injecting, for example, when they have diabetes, they may not necessarily need a carer. It is appropriate to have reviews.</para><para>The review was undertaken and—I do not remember the exact figure, I think it was about 40,000—before we were operating on the basis of information from experts: people who assess people in terms of their disability. It was fairly obvious to Senator Vanstone as they went through those reviews, about 40,000 of them, that there were certain conditions for which they were getting a very high rate of acceptance—that is, that people would continue on those benefits. Rather than wait until the whole lot had been reviewed, I think it was very appropriate that Senator Vanstone responded and added those six additional disabilities—phenylketonuria, Down syndrome, et cetera.

She said, `What are some of the issues that concern you?' and the people behind the counter said to the minister, `We have people coming in here, who are getting a carer allowance, with asthmatic children, basically to get a health care card.' Some of those people would have been on a carers allowance— with children who were asthmatic—and some of them have self-selected not to continue with a carers allowance. It is about 30 per cent, but I have forgotten the figures. Some people have said, `Yes, it is obvious I do not need a carers allowance.' They have self-selected off the program. Others needed to be reviewed. The doctor, most probably, seeing people coming in, did not necessarily understand the whole overview of the program.

It took a supplementary question to get the minister to say that he thought that the advice on the Shane Warne circumstance would be that he would not be able to play. But that was not without a major qualification either—that is, taking advice and possibly a review of Cricket Australia's antidoping policy. This is nothing more than a farcical squib on behalf of the minister because we know that Cricket Australia's drugs policy is modelled on the Australian Sports Commission's policy. Given that Cricket Australia thought that their policy covered all matches, by default the minister is saying that the Australian Sports Commission policy somehow needs review. It is quite a debacle when the minister cannot be definitive about his government's own drugs policy. The answer of course was no, but the minister could not quite bring himself to say that in his response to my question.</para><para>It is worth going back through these circumstances to understand what the facts are. In February this year, Shane Warne was given a 12-month ban from playing cricket for testing positive to taking a banned substance. Cricket Australia should be commended for having banned Shane Warne from playing in all cricket matches until February 2004. They believed that this action was in accordance with their antidoping policy. However, following a challenge by the Australian Cricketers Association, it was found that Cricket Australia does not have the ability under its current antidoping policy to ban cricketers from playing in charity matches and testimonials.</para><para>This ruling was detrimental to Australia's credibility in the fight against drugs in sport. Athletes must know that, if they are found to be in breach of antidoping policies, they will attract a ban that is enforceable. This also serves to vindicate naturally talented athletes who excel in their sports without the aid of drugs. However, it has become very obvious that the Howard government is not serious— or, indeed, consistent—in its application of its own Tough on Drugs in Sport policy. If this government were serious, it would act now to ensure that all national sporting organisations are beginning to implement the world antidoping code, to which this government is a signatory—and I do acknowledge the work that has taken place on that code.</para><para>The fact is that this government has proven that it is not willing to enforce even its own policy at this most basic level. This has never been demonstrated more clearly than when it was revealed that the sport of cycling had failed to comply with antidoping requirements within the specified time frame, and the Australian Sports Commission and the minister failed to apply any sanction to the sport of cycling. In fact, despite the government rhetoric, it was only at the recent estimates last May that the government and the Australian Sports Commission required national sporting organisations to conform to an antidoping assessment process at all. Prior to that, it did not happen. Even once they had got around to making sports accountable for fighting drugs in sport, those requirements were not enforced. Instead, in the case of cycling, they effectively fulfilled their requirements at their leisure, and certainly not within the specified time frames. </para><para>I think that this government must better support the independent work of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, who are constantly undermined by Sports Commission board member Alan Jones. Because he is the deputy chair of the Sports Commission, it makes it particularly pertinent that the government allows that to occur without providing the reprimand that is so obviously necessary. I do not think that the Howard government is doing enough to support national sporting organisations who are doing the right thing in their implementation and their working towards the World Anti-Doping Association code. I think that the implementation of the code would ensure that athletes in breach of the antidoping policy receive consistent and equitable treatment and that, when they are appropriately banned from participating in any sporting event, that sticks regardless of its nature. As signatories to the WADA code, the coalition must enforce its adoption by all national sporting organisations, to ensure compliance by Athens 2004. I call on the Howard government once again to abide by its Tough on Drugs in Sport policy. It is a policy that Labor, obviously, began with the establishment of ASDA, and it should support those—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired.)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13672</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to respond to some of the points that Senator Lundy made. Senator Lundy has a chronic problem in not listening to answers. I think that that is effectively demonstrated not only by her responses today but also, I must say, by her performance at Senate estimates and elsewhere. Senator Lundy has a peculiar capacity to not actually listen to what people say. In relation to the Shane Warne issue I think that the facts are well known. I am on record—and I continue to go on record—as saying that I believe Australia should maintain the highest standards in antidoping policy. I strongly support the work of ASDA and the ASC to ensure that this occurs.</para></talk.start><para>Australia took a lead role in the negotiation of the WADA code. The expertise of Australians was often called on. Senator Lundy, that code will now be implemented. Work is being done to ensure that. There is no government keener than this government to ensure that there is a level playing field throughout the sporting world in relation to the antidoping code. I can assure Senator Lundy and the Senate that the Australian government is pursuing the implementation of this code with vigour, and I believe that we will again show the rest of the world what can be achieved in this country. But, Senator Lundy, it is not adopted overnight; there is a lot of work to be done. That work is in train and will continue. That is the point that I make.</para><para>For you to get up, Senator Lundy, and attempt to grandstand on this is a bit of a pity. We would have wanted you to play a more constructive role in sport. I think that Senator Lundy is famed for her sporting policy over the last 12 months. When we asked what Labor's sporting policy was it seemed that it was, essentially, to drive a four-lane highway through the front yard of the Australian Institute of Sport. Senator Lundy supported that crazy policy of the ACT government, which would have had a very detrimental effect on the Australian Institute of Sport. I criticised her at the time for that. At the end of the day, it was clear that the position that this government adopted was the one that won out, and it protected one of the great jewels in Canberra. One of the things that Senator Lundy must always wear when she is in the sport portfolio is that, when she was needed to support a sensible policy to persuade the ACT government, she was leading the charge supporting a policy which, I believe, would have had a very serious effect on the Australian Institute of Sport. </para><para>Getting back to the case of Shane Warne and the issues in relation to the charity match and the training, as Senator Lundy pointed out, Cricket Australia was very concerned about the charity match and in fact took action. There was a case with an arbitrator and, at that stage of the game, the fact of the matter is that the policy of Cricket Australia was not upheld by the arbitrator. We will see how this develops in the future. But I think it is true that, when you look at what Australians expect, you see that they expect the highest standards in this area. They expect the highest standards, and this government expects the highest standards. That is why, Senator Lundy, a great deal of my work and my time in the portfolio has been to ensure that we work with international organisations to ensure the adoption of a world antidoping code. This government should take great pride in that and, particularly, in the work of the Australians who are involved.</para><para>Senator Lundy, the fact is that now we are going to implement the code. That is what the policy is. It is no good for you to stand up and pontificate about this. Your government talked a lot in so many areas but it did not take the required action. This government has taken a real lead, and I pay tribute to Jackie Kelly and Senator Amanda Vanstone for the work that they did before the 2000 Olympic Games and I pay tribute to the people in ASDA and people in the Sports Commission.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—Just make sure they are doing their jobs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—They take their jobs very seriously, I can assure you. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13673</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing today relating to mental illness. One in five Australians suffering from a mental illness cannot afford to keep paying rising doctors fees but are excluded from private health insurance. How is a person suffering from mental illness expected to improve their condition when this government, through its changes to Medicare announced in the budget, will make visiting a doctor more expensive? As the number of doctors who are bulk-billing has continued to drop it becomes even more expensive. Doctors have admitted that, as a result of the government's Medicare initiatives, they will need to raise their fees to cover their costs.</para></talk.start><para>People with mental illnesses already face barriers to seeking treatment. They often do not want others to know they are psychologically unwell. Also, they fear that the treatments may be worse than their illness and that Medicare systems may not respond appropriately. We also know that men and older people are particularly unlikely to take themselves to a doctor for psychological help. Now they face another barrier—an unnecessary barrier, a mean barrier—and that is the cost of treatment. If you cannot afford to see your doctor it is simple: you just do not go. You do not have a choice. For people needing to have their medication supervised and their condition monitored this can have disastrous and costly effects both for the person, for our health care system and, I also add, for the people caring for them.</para><para>A doctor giving evidence to the Senate poverty inquiry in Brisbane said:</para><para>The ability of those with mental illness to access a bulk-billing doctor is critical to their long-term wellbeing. Without such access they miss their treatments and become even more marginalised in society.</para><para>This is an illness that can be managed yet if it goes without treatment it is likely the person will end up in the acute care section of our public system or killing themselves—as the statisticians tell us, in 2001, 2,454 people killed themselves and this included 339 young persons between the ages of 15 and 24. The most common mental health problem that leads to suicide is depression. Without access to health care and bulk-billing these numbers will possibly increase. </para><para>Being a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiring into poverty, I have heard numerous times of the links between mental illness and poverty. In Western Australia we heard how a lady was forced to live for 2½ years on negative $12 a week before food. This was because she paid for her own private health insurance and had to pay for other counselling services on top of that. She said that her private health insurer fought tooth and nail not to provide many of the services she needed because of her condition. In describing how she felt she said there was nobody there for her. To get by she resorted to shoplifting from the supermarkets and baking cakes to sell door to door.</para><para>This government has pushed private health insurance. People with mental illnesses who have taken up private insurance despite their ominous financial situation are finding that the very service they are paying for is failing them. Many of the health services they need, such as counselling, their private health insurer will not cover. As the Senate poverty inquiry heard, a severely disturbed individual is very rarely admitted to a private hospital because of the Mental Health Act and the issues of restraint and control. Therefore, for people with a significant mental illness, private health insurance will not guarantee quicker or more suitable health care. The Mental Health Council of Australia and beyondblue, the national depression initiative, have called for an immediate resolution of the discriminatory insurance practices. They have been informed of insurance companies declining insurance policies to people—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13674</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs today relating to conditions of service of ADF and AFP personnel in the Solomon Islands. Our personnel are part of the cooperative intervention in the Solomon Islands, which at this time is going very well—let us hope it continues to do that—along with troops from Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand and the PNG. This operational allowance is based on an assessment of the security environment. That applies whether our troops are involved in East Timor, Afghanistan, the war against terror, the build up to the war in Iraq, the multinational interception force, the Iraq war itself or now, of course, the Solomons. In my experience the allowance ranges from $200 per day to what has been assessed as appropriate in this particular ADF exercise, which is $55 per day. It is based on an assessment of the security environment in the Solomons and the tasks and mission that the ADF personnel deployed in the operation will expect to meet. Despite a level of risk, it is a non-warlike declaration of service and that is appropriate for this operation. As a consequence, the conditions of service provided to ADF members for this operation include: the tax-free deployment allowance of $55.50 per day inside the specified area; comprehensive coverage for injury under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act; and additional recreation leave at a rate of 10 days per annum on a pro rata basis.</para></talk.start><para>I am advised that there is a possibility that their earnings will be tax-free as well, which applies under a general provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act which exempts certain foreign earnings where a member has engaged in foreign employment for a continuous period of not less than 91 days. There is a fair expectation that some of our ADF people will serve for longer than 91 days. I make the point to the Senate that this provision is not an ADF condition of service. It is something that is very appropriate for those who are risking their lives on our behalf, and it is an additional benefit that they have. In addition, members will continue to receive their normal salary and environmental allowances. </para><para>ADF members deployed for six months or more are eligible for the additional following benefits: embarkation and disembarkation leave and travel; removal of dependants to extended family support—and I remember, Mr Deputy President, that when you and I were on the inquiry into conditions of service it came up that it was important for people who are left at home with a young family to have family support, and the ADF extends that to military families and so they should— removal of personal effects to store; and relief for out of country assistance to travel back to Australia.</para><para>We take our responsibility to our personnel overseas very seriously. I do not think there is anybody who does not believe that they should be looked after in their absence, that their families should be looked after in their absence and if something untoward might happen to them. The government are going through the review process to improve the range of benefits that might be available to our ADF personnel overseas. We take that very seriously. I think there is bipartisan support for anything that we do for our ADF personnel. It is important because they are on an important mission. All missions are important, but this mission is particularly important.</para><para>We have 1,500 ADF personnel in the Solomons. We have a show of force that has been very effective, I think, in bringing the war lords and dissident groups to the table, and certainly in making them cooperative. I am delighted that Harold Keke has seen the light and decided to hand himself in. When I was in the Solomons a short period ago— about six weeks ago—they were very worried about the murderous activities of Harold Keke down on the Weather Coast. It is pleasing to see that he has seen the light and decided to hand himself in. I suspect he would not have done so if it had not been for the show of force of the ADF, along with our allies—Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea have also sent troops to support us. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>13675</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs today, relating to trafficking in the sex industry. Trafficking in the sex industry is a growing global trade. There have been significant increases in the trafficking of sexual labour, particularly the use of women for the commercial sex industry. At some stage in this country we will realise that crimes against women need to be taken seriously and treated harshly. There has to come a time in this country when we are as tough on the criminal use of women's sexuality as we are on drugs. If we had a policy that addressed the use of women in the sex industry, particularly in trafficking for the sex industry, which was as tough as our stance on drugs then perhaps some of these women would not find themselves in the situation they are currently in. Until we take it seriously and until we start to deal with these crimes harshly, we still will have a major problem before us.</para></talk.start><para>In my question to Senator Ellison I asked about the trafficking of two Thai women for the sex industry back in November. Apart from him failing to tell us what DIMIA were doing about this or what the Australian Federal Police were doing about this in cooperation with the New South Wales Police, he mentioned that these women had left the country voluntarily. I do not believe for one instant that voluntary departure or willingness to even come to this country in the first place is a reason for not doing something about it. The consent of these women to come to this country—when they do not realise what they are coming to and how their bodies are going to be used—is not a defence of your system or a reason to do nothing about it. The fact that they may well have left their country voluntarily and come here voluntarily does not mean that you simply step back and decide that your current system needs to be defended. It is a system that does very little to catch people involved in trafficking and to protect women who are being used in this way. </para><para>There is a conflict between the way the government has failed to deal with trafficking in the sex industry and its current immigration laws. This government has its priorities in immigration laws. We know it is going through this whole juxtaposition of allowing these women who are here illegally to be detained and retained in this country and afforded the protection they need while they are used to give evidence against any traffickers that may or may not have been caught. In this country there has not been one prosecution for this crime. In this day and age, current laws and policies are completely out of step with the internationally agreed standards; in fact, they are well behind and are seriously inadequate to deal with this growing global industry and crime.</para><para>We do not have a comprehensive national approach to this. We do not look at a policy that is designed to punish the traffickers and at the same time protect the victims. We have a government that does very little to look after the physical, psychological or social recovery of these women because, pitted against their current immigration policy— which is to remove illegal people from this country as quickly as possible, deport them as quickly as possible—there is a conflict in sending those people back home as this government has done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>13676</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>13676</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>13676</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator HILL (South Australia—Minister for Defence) (3.31 p.m.)—I present the government's response to the 49th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response to the 49</inline><inline font-weight="bold">th</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties</inline></para><para>The Government thanks the Committee for the careful consideration given to the Timor Sea Treaty in the hearings and in the Report.

The delay in this response is quite indicative of the way the government has conducted itself throughout the Timor Sea Treaty negotiations. Throughout this process, the Australian Democrats have voiced our concerns regarding the fairness of the treaty and the way in which it was negotiated. It was on the basis of these concerns that we were unable to support the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Our minority report made several recommendations, one of which was that the treaty be renegotiated in order to address the very serious issues raised by a number of people in their submissions to the committee. But the government in its response that has just been tabled has not even bothered to respond to our recommendations which, we would remind the government, are an official part of the committee's report. I hope the government will, if need be, table a supplementary response in order to deal with those recommendations. I acknowledge, though, that it may be far too late.</para><para>The Democrats believe that it is in Australia's national interest for East Timor—our newest neighbour—to develop into a strong, prosperous and democratic nation with proper regard for the rule of law. At a time when Australia has just made a very substantial contribution and commitment to assist the Solomon Islands in order to prevent it from becoming a permanently failed state, it is important that we take into account the warnings to the inquiry by the East Timor Institute for Reconstruction Monitoring and Analysis, which said that without economic security and without the ability to rely on the rule of law both within East Timor and internationally, East Timor also faces the serious risk of becoming a `failed state'.</para><para>It is neither in the interests of East Timor nor Australia for East Timor to maintain its financial dependence on other countries and regress to a situation similar to what we have seen occur in the Solomon Islands. Members of the government have spoken a lot in recent weeks about the importance of Australia providing leadership in our region, which is something the Australian Democrats agree with. In his ministerial statement to the Senate earlier this week, the Minister for Defence said:</para><para>If Australia wants security, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our region, our neighbourhood, is stable—that governance is strong and the rule of law is just.</para><para>The Democrats could not agree more with that statement by Minister Hill, but the government's conduct in this instance has not demonstrated leadership and has given us many reasons to doubt the sincerity of its rhetoric. Providing leadership means that Australia must support the structures and principles of the international legal justice and legal systems, which have been established to promote collective security, the just resolution of disputes and international peace. All of these things are important. In practical terms, this means submitting to the rule of law even where this is contrary to our more immediate or financial interests. For this reason, the Democrats strongly oppose the government's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with respect to the determination of seabed boundaries. This sets a very poor example for East Timor and its people. As one submission put it: </para><para>Australia and others in the international community consistently encourage East Timor's new government to implement democracy, the rule of law, transparency and safeguards against corruption as we develop our governmental structures and practices ... At the same time, Australia is not practising what you are preaching. When your country withdrew from legal processes for resolving maritime boundary disputes, you taught us the opposite message—that when the booty is large enough, the legal principles go out of the window.</para><para>Significantly, East Timor was given no prior notification of Australia's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of that court. The national interest analysis expressly stated that this was to prevent any action being commenced against Australia that could not be initiated after the declaration had been made.</para><para>Another of the Democrats' concerns relating to the Timor Sea Treaty is the ongoing uncertainty as to the exact seabed boundary between Australia and East Timor. People remember this as part of the debate on the legislation. While the Democrats do believe that a 90:10 split in favour of East Timor represents a fair allocation of the resources within the joint petroleum development area, the problem is that the boundaries of that area remain in contention. A series of legal opinions have given rise to conflicting interpretations of international law as it applies to the determination of the boundary between Australia and East Timor. These divergent and often equally persuasive opinions illustrate the complexity of the legal principles that apply to the delimitation of seabed boundaries and the unique factual circumstances of this particular case. For these reasons, it may well be necessary for this dispute to be determined by an independent body.</para><para>The Democrats' view is that the seabed boundaries must be determined in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and any applicable customary law. If Australia and East Timor are unable to reach a fair and just agreement, they should submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. By ratifying the treaty and finalising the unitisation agreement before the determination of seabed boundaries, not only is Australia accessing resources that potentially belong to East Timor but also East Timor's ultimate claim to those disputed areas may be prejudiced.</para><para>What we are now left with is a situation in which Australia has no incentive or legal obligation to negotiate with East Timor in an attempt to conclusively determine those seabed boundaries. That was one of the reasons why the East Timorese wanted the ratification of the treaty to proceed independently of the unitisation agreement. While the unitisation agreement provides that almost 80 per cent of the Greater Sunrise oil belongs to Australia, the Timorese argue that under the principles of international law most if not all of Greater Sunrise rightfully belongs to East Timor.</para><para>By insisting that the unitisation agreement be finalised prior to the ratification of the treaty, the government forced East Timor to compromise its long-term interests in order to meet its short-term needs. No-one denies that there were—and still are—very pressing short-term needs. It is hypocritical for the government to, on the one hand, provide aid to East Timor but, on the other, prevent it from accessing resources which arguably belong to it and which would enable it to progress more rapidly towards a situation of financial independence. </para><para>As Dr Alkatiri indicated earlier this year, the best way to alleviate poverty in East Timor is to give it an equitable share of the revenues from Timor Sea petroleum developments. The government acted like a bully throughout its negotiations with East Timor and I was embarrassed and ashamed of the way in which our country dealt with this issue, as I know many Australians were. And yet it was not that long ago that I felt proud of the leadership Australia showed when it demonstrated its commitment to human rights and its role in preventing human rights abuses against the East Timorese and assisted East Timor during its transition to independence. Unfortunately, we risk undoing or undermining that good work that we have done in the past.</para><para>The Democrats once again urge the government to proceed with negotiations with East Timor for the final delimitation of the seabed boundaries. We urge the government to do so in good faith and in accordance with the relevant principles of international law. And we certainly urge the government to resubmit Australia to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and allow it, if required, to determine the disputes regarding maritime boundaries. We must show leadership with this new neighbour and we must act responsibly in our dealings with it. I acknowledge this belated response from the government to the committee's report. I do ask the government to respond to the Democrat recommendations as part of its report, although I do acknowledge that it is too late given that the treaty legislation has passed the parliament.

Unfortunately, there have been some instances of blatant disregard for orders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court.</para><para>Violations of Court and Commission rulings include instances where the Commission has ordered that industrial action cease or not occur and instances where the Federal Court has issued injunctions to enforce orders to stop industrial action. In a number of cases, those disobeying the orders have gone entirely unpunished for their failure to comply. </para><para>Failure to punish law breakers encourages law breaking. If such behaviour goes unpunished then it is likely to be repeated. </para><para>The Government believes that further enhancements to the legislative framework are required to ensure that the integrity of the system is not undermined by failure to comply with Court and Commission rulings. </para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill will amend the principal Act to provide more effective sanctions against those who flout the authority of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court. Whilst non-compliance is concentrated amongst unions and their representatives, the provisions of the bill will also apply to employer organisations and their officials and employees. </para><para>The bill will establish duties on officers and employees of registered organisations to comply with orders and directions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court. Where those duties are breached, the Minister can seek orders from the Federal Court that financial penalties be imposed. Where Court orders are breached, these new powers do not affect the existing powers of the Court to deal with contraventions of its orders and directions.</para><para>Officers and employees of registered organisations who are fined by the Court for failing to comply with Court and Commission orders would generally be disqualified from holding office in registered organisations, under provisions contained in the bill. Registered organisations and their representatives have significant rights and privileges conferred upon them by the Workplace Relations Act, but with those rights come responsibility. Those who neglect their responsibilities by wilfully or recklessly disregarding the authority of the Commission or the Court should not, in most circumstances, retain the privilege of being able to exercise authority as an officer of a registered organisation. </para><para>The bill provides flexibility in the application of sanctions. Office holders and prospective office holders found to be in breach of their compliance duties will be able to apply to the Federal Court for leave to hold office. For the purposes of exercising this power the Court would have to consider a number of matters, including the circumstances of the contravention and the nature of the person's involvement in the contravention. The bill would also safeguard an organisation from financial damage suffered as a result of an officer or employee of that organisation contravening their duties, where the Court is satisfied that the organisation took reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.  </para><para>The Commonwealth has a duty to the community and the national interest to ensure that its laws are respected and upheld, particularly where this may prevent unlawful industrial action which threatens business performance, international competitiveness, and jobs. </para><para>On 19 December 2002, I announced that the Commonwealth would take a much more active role in taking legal action and pursuing penalties against people and organisations that fail to comply with Federal Court or Commission orders in workplace relations matters. The Government will make full use of existing laws to seek penalties where there is compelling evidence that a person or organisation has defied orders and it is in the public interest to take the legal action. The Government will take contempt of court action where Federal Court orders, and in particular orders against industrial action, are defied. The Government will use existing law plus the measures in this bill to seek penalties against parties who fail to comply with return to work orders of the Commission or other orders designed to ensure the effective operation of the workplace relations system.</para><para>In appropriate cases, the Government will refer cases of failure to comply with return to work orders of the Commission to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution for `contempt of the Commission'. To that end, I foreshadow that I will be introducing legislation to codify section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act so that all conduct that amounts to `contempt of the Commission' is expressly identified. These amendments will also bring the maximum penalties into line with Commonwealth policy for offences of this kind. Complete codification of the offence will provide enhanced certainty and will complement the provisions contained in this bill.</para><para>The Government believes that registered organisations and their representatives should act in a responsible manner and respect the rule of law. </para><para>The proposed measures will increase confidence in the system. They should also reduce the harm to business, jobs and the economy associated with defiance of the workplace relations law and its guardians.</para><para>—————</para><para>NATIONAL TRANSPORT COMMISSION BILL 2003</para><para>I take pleasure in introducing the National Transport Commission Bill 2003. This bill provides for the establishment of the National Transport Commission. </para><para>The establishment of the Commission will be an important step for Australian governments and the transport industry. For the first time, there will be a body with a focus on reforming not just road transport, but also the rail and intermodal transport regulatory environment where a national approach to regulation is warranted. This reform process has the potential to deliver improved efficiency, productivity, safety and environmental performance in the transport industry.</para><para>The National Road Transport Commission has played a vital and increasingly successful role in progressing national action on road transport reform over the past decade. The National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 is due to cease in January 2004. </para><para>A recent Review of the Act recommended to the Australian Transport Council (which comprises Commonwealth State and Territory Transport Ministers), that a new body with a broader regulatory reform focus should be established. This new body would be able to respond to the needs of an increasingly integrated freight transport industry. All Heads of Government subsequently agreed to this recommendation. </para><para>The new Commission will build on the success of the National Road Transport Commission. The Commission will maintain the momentum of road transport reform, while bringing a much-needed national approach to a number of rail issues, particularly in the safety arena, and to issues involving more that one mode of transport. </para><para>A key objective of the reform process, that has been agreed by Transport Ministers, is to create a more cost effective and nationally consistent approach to rail safety regulation, including a more effective application of mutual recognition arrangements and procedures to manage risk factors such as fatigue.</para><para>There will also be an increased emphasis on reform maintenance, to ensure that the benefits of reforms are not eroded over time.</para><para>Like its predecessor, the Commission will develop national reforms in consultation with the Commonwealth, States and Territories and industry and other stakeholders.</para><para>This bill sets out a framework for the operation of the Commission, including its accountability to the Australian Transport Council. An inter-governmental agreement, to be signed by the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory ministers, is currently being negotiated. The Agreement will spell out the roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Australian Transport Council and the jurisdictions and, in particular, sets out the framework for approving and implementing reform proposals developed by the Commission. It will also aid in strengthening the cooperative nature of the national transport reform process.</para><para>The bill also provides a new legislative mechanism for achieving a uniform or consistent regularity environment across Australia. Under this approach, model transport legislation will be set out in regulations to the proposed National Transport Commission Act. This will enable the States and Territories, and if appropriate the Commonwealth, to either reference or enact the substance of the model legislation in their own laws. </para><para>This approach addresses concerns expressed by the States and Territories over the `template' approach which was envisaged under the NRTC process. It also addresses the need for nationally agreed model legislation to be developed so that it can more appropriately mesh with jurisdictional law.</para><para>—————</para><para>NATIONAL TRANSPORT COMMISSION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2003</para><para>This bill is an adjunct (a cognate bill) to the National Transport Commission Bill 2003.</para><para>The National Transport Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003 has two main objectives.</para><para>Firstly, the bill provides for consequential amendments to other Commonwealth acts as a result of the repeal of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and the commencement of the National Transport Commission Act 2003.</para><para>Secondly, it puts in place arrangements for a smooth transition from the National Road Transport Commission to the National Transport Commission. These arrangements cover assets and liabilities, and annual reporting requirements. </para><para>This bill, together with the National Transport Commission Bill 2003, provides for the establishment of the National Transport Commission— a body to replace the existing National Road Transport Commission. The new statutory body will build on the success of the former Commission by continuing to progress road transport regulatory reforms with an increased emphasis on reform maintenance. </para><para>In addition, in response to the needs of an industry operating within an increasingly integrated transport environment, the work of the Commission will also include regulatory reform of rail and intermodal operations. The new Commission, like its predecessor, will facilitate development of national reforms in close consultation with the Commonwealth, States and Territories, industry and other stakeholders.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as a separate order of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13683</page.no><id.no>R1478</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>13683</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives returning the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002, acquainting the Senate that the House has disagreed to the amendments made by the Senate and requesting the reconsideration of the amendments.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of the message in Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS: PROPOSED DEPARTMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SERVICES </title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>13683</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—A message has been received from the House of Representatives forwarding a resolution agreed to by that House relating to the proposed amalgamation of parliamentary departments.

Sadly, the ethanol scandal is just the latest in a growing catalogue of incidents in which the Prime Minister has failed to tell the parliament and the Australian people the whole truth about his conduct. Once again, he has been caught red-handed and once again he has failed to take responsibility for his behaviour. It is the sort of thing that would not become a child, but it is the behaviour we have come to expect from the current Prime Minister. </para><para>A number of matters relevant to the Senate's consideration of this matter are beyond dispute. The first is that on 17, 18 and 19 September last year the Prime Minister told the other place that he did not meet with the Chairman of Manildra, Mr Dick Honan, prior to the government's announcement of its Manildra-friendly ethanol package on 12 September. We know, through the release of a meeting record obtained under freedom of information, that Mr Howard and Mr Honan did meet on 1 August last year. That was a meeting that obviously Mr Howard wanted to keep secret. It was only revealed when I obtained a small number of heavily censored documents from the Prime Minister's department under freedom of information. </para><para>The record of the meeting shows us that these two men—the Prime Minister and one of the coalition's biggest donors, Mr Honan—discussed just two matters. One topic of discussion was so sensitive that the Prime Minister's department has refused to disclose its nature. The second matter was the ethanol industry. What did that discussion include? According to the meeting record, the Prime Minister and Mr Honan discussed:</para><para>... the payment of a producer credit to ethanol producers to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product. </para><para>A production subsidy and industry protection are exactly what the Prime Minister delivered to Mr Honan and Manildra six weeks after that meeting took place. Over recent days the Prime Minister has run the argument that a reference to competition from cheaper Brazilian product did not mean they talked about Brazilian imports. We have heard some outrageous distortions of the truth from Mr Howard in the course of his prime ministership, but the suggestion that a reference to competition from Brazilian ethanol did not mean that the two of them talked about ethanol imports defies belief. How does cheaper Brazilian product become a competitive item if it is not imported into this country? One wonders where the Prime Minister's thinking was. The Prime Minister expects the Australian people to believe that he had a discussion with Mr Honan where, his own minute-taker records, they talked about competition from cheaper Brazilian product but somehow, he suggests, that does not imply the product had to be imported. It defies belief.  </para><para>We also know that a week before Mr Honan met the Prime Minister his company told two of its customers, Trafigura and Neumann Petroleum, that Manildra could not supply them with ethanol. Mr Honan knew that if Trafigura and Neumann wanted to stay in the fuel ethanol business and could not get a supply from his near monopoly company they would have to go to CSR—which, as I understand it, also had no ethanol available for sale, CSR being the only other local producer of any note—or they would be forced to import ethanol from overseas. Obviously, ethanol from overseas was the only real alternative option. It was this knowledge that Mr Honan carried to his meeting with the Prime Minister and it was this knowledge that they both had when they discussed—and I will quote from the record of the meeting:</para><para>... the payment of a producer credit to ethanol producers to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product. </para><para>The second matter of relevance to this debate is the failure of the Prime Minister and other senior ministers to disclose full details of their involvement in this ethanol scandal. The first failure was the Prime Minister's failure to disclose his meeting with Mr Honan—the meeting that occurred six weeks before the government announced its Manildra-friendly ethanol policy. The second failure is the continuing failure of the Howard government to comply with a Senate order for the production of documents related to ethanol policy, that order falling due on 21 October last year. On 21 October the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ian Campbell, told the Senate that the government would comply. He said:</para><para>I can indicate that the government intends to comply with the order as soon as possible and fully expects to be in a position to do so shortly. </para><para>That did not happen. On 12 December last year Senator Ian Campbell gave another commitment to the Senate. He said:</para><para>While consideration of the documents is close to conclusion, the government has not been able to provide its final response by the close of business for this, the final sitting day—which is something that I had certainly hoped to achieve since I had given an undertaking to the Senate. I have spoken to the minister tonight about it, and I have actually also spoken to Senator Kerry O'Brien and have given him an undertaking on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources ...</para><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The minister is happy for me to commit to tabling those documents out of session by Tuesday. I am confident, dare I say—the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> might be quoted back to me next year!—that we will achieve that, and I have said that to Senator O'Brien privately and now on the record.</para></quote><para>He was right. On 5 February this year, Senator Ian Campbell told the Senate:</para><quote><para>Over the summer recess, the documents have been thoroughly gone through in regard to the normal protocols that apply to tabled documents responding to a Senate return to order.</para></quote><para>Later, he went on to say:</para><quote><para>The government is seeking to conclude its consideration of these documents and its compliance—albeit very late—to the order of the Senate. My latest advice is that the government will respond as soon as possible.</para></quote><para>The government has not complied with the return of order. It has not complied with it many months after those statements by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. He must be sorely embarrassed by it. But why has the government not complied? It is pretty clear—because it has plenty to hide. That is what we have been finding out by pursuing, through the freedom of information process, material which has now become public. </para><para>The third matter of relevance to this debate is the failure of the Howard government to release all documents pursuant to my freedom of information application lodged in January this year. Clearly, I was far from convinced that the government had an intention of complying with the orders of the Senate, notwithstanding the assurances of Senator Ian Campbell, he having been put in the position by ministers from the other place that he was promising compliance but being left with egg on his face when they failed to give him the documentation to allow him to do so. The Senate is familiar with the censored record of the meeting recording the details of the Prime Minister's discussion with Mr Honan on 1 August last year. I have received other documents relating to my request and most of the documents have a common characteristic—lots of blank paper.</para><para>The third key failure is the refusal to answer a series of questions that remain on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice</inline><inline font-style="italic"> P</inline><inline font-style="italic">aper</inline> in relation to ethanol, including questions about the government's knowledge of the aborted importation of Brazilian ethanol by Manildra's competitors. If the Prime Minister and other members of the government had any interest in clearing up this matter, they would have done three things. Firstly, they would have released in full the meeting record of 1 August without censorship. Secondly, the government would have complied with the Senate order for the production of documents in full. Thirdly, the government would have answered my questions on notice about the actions of the Prime Minister and other senior ministers in preventing the importation of ethanol by two companies unable to get it any other way.</para><para>The final failure of the Prime Minister is his refusal to apologise to the parliament and the Australian people and to correct the misleading answers he gave to the parliament last year about this matter. Labor was unable to hold the Prime Minister to account in the other place because of the government's refusal to allow the Prime Minister's behaviour to be referred to the Privileges Committee. In my view, it was an abuse of the executive's power over the legislature—just one of a series of abuses of the parliament for which this Prime Minister and his government have been responsible. The pattern of deceit noted in the question before the Senate does matter. It matters because the government has taken a policy decision that has delivered to Manildra millions of dollars and will deliver to that company many millions of dollars more.</para><para>Manildra exercises a near monopoly position in the Australian fuel ethanol industry. In less than 10 months last year, the government gave Manildra $20,857,998 to do exactly the same thing it did the year before without the subsidy. The only other company to receive a subsidy was CSR. It received $845,182. With more than 96 per cent of the subsidy total paid to Manildra, it is indisputable that the company got a very good deal from the Prime Minister and his government. There are not too many other companies that would knock back import protection with production subsidies of more than $2 million per month.</para><para>It seems, however, that Mr Honan is not happy with the deal he has. In June he was threatening to close his Nowra plant because the 1 July regulation regime for ethanol blending was imminent and the government did not propose to agree to mandating ethanol in petrol. Regrettably, it seems that threat has come to pass—at least in respect to part of his operations. On 7 August a letter sent to Manildra staff at the Altona site in Victoria, under the heading `Partial closure of the Altona site', said this: </para><quote><para>The Manildra Group has decided to partially close the Altona site. Legislative restrictions have recently been introduced limiting the amount of ethanol which is permitted in domestic fuel. This has had an adverse impact on our ability to sell ethanol, and as a result we are forced to reduce our ethanol production.</para></quote><para>It is a matter of profound regret to me and to the Labor Party that, despite the protection regime that the government has put in place and despite the payment of tens of millions of dollars to Manildra, Mr Honan has decided to sack up to 50 members of his work force. If Mr Honan and the government had agreed to the imposition of a cap many months ago, the impact of the 1 July change to blending would not have had the impact it clearly has. It is very clear, of course, that the regime that has been imposed—that is, a limit of 10 per cent on the blending of ethanol—has been imposed at the behest of the motor vehicle industry, their representative organisations and the ACCC, which suggested that lack of a limit of ethanol in fuel may have amounted to a deception of purchasers of petrol.</para><para>I want to turn to another matter, and that is the matter of political donations. The return of $50,000 to Manildra by the ALP, consistent with the party's donations code of conduct—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—I understand that Senator Brandis would marvel at the idea of a political party having a code of conduct, as his obviously has none. The donations code of conduct has excited considerable interest. Much less interest has been paid to the Howard government's record as a recipient of donations from Manildra. According to AEC returns, the Liberal Party has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manildra over recent years—hundreds of thousands of dollars. Those donations include a single donation of $10,000 to the Prime Minister's re-election campaign in Bennelong and $10,000 to Tony Abbott's campaign in Warringah. I suppose he is smarting after being left dangling by the misrepresentation of the facts with regard to the sackings that he trotted out in question time yesterday, only to be knocked back into his place by the following question from Nicola Roxon.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have heard from the government a claim that political donations do not buy access. I understand that, since Mr Howard has been Prime Minister, Mr Honan has had almost unfettered access to him, including at least four meetings in Canberra and another three in Sydney. That is the sort of access probably even denied to Mr Sinodinos, his chief of staff. Mr Ross Cameron, the Member for Parramatta, has received a $20,000 donation from Manildra, despite the risk to motorists in Western Sydney from unregulated ethanol blends in petrol. The May budget reveals an extension of the ethanol regime. Since then the acting industry minister, Mr Hockey, has announced tens of millions of dollars more in capital grants. Manildra has also been granted the services of an exclusive facilitator to help it through tough commercial negotiations.</para><para>All of this, which I would categorise as bad policy, has sprung from a bad policy-making process—a process shrouded in secrecy that gets more murky as more details of the Prime Minister's pattern of deceit are revealed. I think honesty matters in Australian politics, and I regret that the Prime Minister does not agree with that. I regret that those opposite do not seem to care a jot either, especially when small companies like Trafigura and Neumann Petroleum are affected. </para><para>The parliament and the people have been let down. Mr Howard met Mr Honan on 1 August last year. An industry assistance scheme, including production credits and import protection, was discussed at that meeting. Mr Howard denied the meeting occurred when answering three questions in parliament over three days in September last year, and he has avoided responsibility for those answers when challenged in the parliament this week. This is a pattern of deceit—a pattern that includes and follows the `children overboard' outrage and the provision of false information to the parliament about Iraq's alleged uranium imports from Africa.</para><para>Mr Howard usually tries to hide behind his staff and his bureaucracy, but in this case he does not have that opportunity. He can hide no more. The Australian people, if one can interpret the commentaries appearing regularly in the media this week, are no longer going to be satisfied with his excuses. It is clear that he has been flushed out. It is clear that there is an acceptance he has not told the truth to the Australian people in this circumstance. This is the pattern of deceit of this Prime Minister that has been revealed and which he will now carry to the next election. In relation to that, this chamber and this parliament should not be satisfied with anything less than compliance with a transparent process, which means this government must provide the documentation that the Senate has asked it to provide by resolution. The resolution of the Senate yesterday to defer the ethanol legislation until that is provided is one example of the insistence of this chamber—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—It is an absolute disgrace!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—to get this government to account for an outrageous policy framework that it has put in place, where policy is being set for its mates and not for the Australian people.

We will see things and hear things we never expected to see or hear in our lives. But I must say that, of all the astonishing things one hears in the course of a political career, there is nothing more implausible or risible than the sight of the Australian Labor Party in full moralising mode. For the Labor Party to be giving the Howard government, which has set new benchmarks for integrity in Australian public policy, lectures on political honesty is a bizarre sight indeed. To hear Mr Latham, the member for Werriwa, lecturing, as he did in the House of Representatives yesterday, about proper parliamentary standards is remarkable and astonishing.</para></talk.start><para>What we saw from Mr Latham in the House of Representatives yesterday and what we have just heard from Senator O'Brien in the Senate today is the standard Labor Party approach: long on rhetoric, free to make allegations, full of innuendo but short on the facts—because when you pare back to the facts they tell a different story from what is represented by the Australian Labor Party. I am not going to engage in the dishonest rhetoric we have heard from Senator O'Brien; I am going to confine myself strictly to the facts. The facts are these: on 1 August 2002 there was a meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Honan, the Managing Director of Manildra. The fact of that meeting has never been denied. The entire case built by the Labor Party is built on sand, because it is based upon an interpretation of answers given by the Prime Minister to three questions in the House of Representatives in September last year, none of which constituted a denial of the meeting on 1 August 2002. I will come back to that. </para><para>The picture the Labor Party would like to conjure for you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and for the public in the hope that they might grab a tabloid headline—or even a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>— and create a false impression among readers who do not have time to get to the nitty-gritty of the facts is this: they say there was a secret meeting between the Prime Minister and a big Liberal Party donor in the form of the company Manildra, as a result of which Manildra got a tremendous benefit that was concealed from the Australian public. We virtually heard Senator O'Brien say that before—and each of those propositions is wrong. </para><para>First of all, there was no secret meeting. The meeting that took place on 1 August was a meeting attended by no fewer than six officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, including an official notetaker. A note was made of the meeting, it was put on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's files, and it was that very note which formed the FOI request from the Leader of the Opposition, upon the basis of which this case was sought to be made. So to the allegation that there was a secret meeting: demonstrably wrong.</para><para>Secondly, the Labor Party seeks to say that the Prime Minister lied to the House of Representatives in denying there was such a meeting. He never denied that there was such a meeting. He was never asked a question about such a meeting. What he was asked was a series of three questions about what discussions he may have had with Mr Honan from Manildra concerning a shipment of ethanol from Brazil by a rival company of Manildra's, Trafigura. These are the facts, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator O'Brien did not tell you about. The Prime Minister told the House of Representatives that representations had been made at all levels of government on behalf of Manildra—as it was entitled to do—in relation to its interests in ethanol policy. I am quoting from what Mr Howard said in answer to one of those questions:</para><quote><para>I would be very surprised, in relation to a matter like this—</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Senator Forshaw and Senator Mackay, you have been talking incessantly since this speaker has been on his feet and I will ask you to desist.

I will start again. The Prime Minister said this in answer to questions from the opposition in September last year—and remember it is the answers to these questions that are the entire case sought to be made against the Prime Minister:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>I would be very surprised, in relation to a matter like this, if representations had not been made by all of the interested parties to various levels of the government—in fact, I would be quite amazed.</para></quote><para>The questions that the Prime Minister was being asked were questions about a shipment from Brazil `Did you,' went the question, `have discussions with Mr Honan about importations by Trafigura from Brazil?' And do you know what, Mr Acting Deputy President? The truthful answer to that question was no—because the first the Australian government knew of any shipment by Trafigura, the Manildra competitor, of ethanol from Brazil was at the earliest on 21 August and perhaps as late as 23 August 2002. </para><para>So how can it be that at a meeting on 1 August, three or more weeks earlier than the first knowledge by the Australian government of the Trafigura shipment, that could have been discussed between Mr Honan and the Prime Minister? It was not, as the notes taken by the notetakers from PM&amp;C reveal. Yet that is what the Prime Minister was asked in effect. He was asked, `Did you have discussions with Mr Honan about this shipment?' and he said, `I had no such discussions.' And that was true. As the notes taken by PM&amp;C reveal, his denial was true, and it could not have been otherwise, because the meeting took place three weeks before—and this is not a controversial fact—there was any knowledge by any Australian official of the imminence of the Trafigura shipment. So the case sought to be made against the Prime Minister fails at the threshold: no secret meeting, no deception, and the matter that it was alleged was covered up not even known of at the time of the meeting.</para><para>Thirdly—this is the next limb of the allegations that are made—Mr Latham in the House of Representatives earlier in the week used the expression `crony capitalism'. `This is crony capitalism,' so Mr Latham said. `We have the Prime Minister's mate, on behalf of a Liberal Party donor, meeting secretly with the Prime Minister'—that was wrong—`to secure a benefit for his company.' </para><para>I pause to say that of course there is absolutely nothing wrong with any Australian company or any Australian citizen seeking to influence government policy, seeking to persuade government to a point of view which will be to its financial interest. That is the way our democracy works. There is no shame in that. But what was it that Mr Honan was in fact seeking to achieve? Mr Honan, as Senator O'Brien has correctly pointed out, runs what is far and away the largest Australian ethanol producer. I think its market share is something approaching 96 per cent. So Mr Honan's company, Manildra, had a very distinct interest in securing a set of policies, as a result of which ethanol admixture to petrol was mandated. It was against Manildra's interest that ethanol admixture to petrol should be capped.</para><para>So what is the outcome of the meeting? On 1 August Mr Honan meets the Prime Minister and then on 12 September the Prime Minister announces the Australian government's ethanol policy. The first thing Mr Honan wanted—the Prime Minister has said this in the House of Representatives and has not been contradicted by Mr Honan in public debate—was for legislation to mandate an admixture of ethanol to all petroleum. That proposal was rejected. Secondly, what Mr Honan wanted—and this is probably the No. 1 item on his wish list—was that the government not impose a 10 per cent cap or a 10 per cent maximum additive level on ethanol mixed with petroleum. What was the government's policy response? The government's policy response was to do the very thing that Mr Honan had beseeched the government not to do—that is, to impose a 10 per cent cap. So, first of all, no compulsory or mandated admixture of ethanol with petroleum, which is what Mr Honan wanted. Secondly, the very thing Mr Honan beseeched the government not to do, that is, impose a 10 per cent cap.</para><para>The third thing Mr Honan asked the government to do was to keep ethanol excise free. You could understand why his company, as the near monopolist in the ethanol market in this country, would want to keep ethanol excise free. In the entire history of the Australian Federation since the Commonwealth first started imposing excise duties a century ago there has never been excise chargeable upon ethanol. What was the result of Mr Honan's representations to government? As a matter of fact, as the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced in the May budget, the government decided that excise would be introduced on ethanol, to be phased in over a five-year period. So Mr Honan did not have a very good day on 1 August 2002. He had gone in there to lobby for a compulsory or mandated level of admixture of ethanol, and the government refused to go along. He had gone in there to beseech the government not to impose a maximum cap on the admixture of ethanol, and the government, when it announced its policy, did the very thing he had beseeched it not to do. Thirdly, for the first time in a century, the government adopted a policy to impose an excise on his product. Not a very good day at the office for poor old Mr Honan.  </para><para>Fourthly, the Labor Party says, `Well, Mr Honan did pretty well nevertheless because he got a production credit which will make his company rich.' That policy, the policy of fostering a domestic ethanol industry through production credits—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—It was in the election. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name></talker><para>—I know. The policy of fostering a domestic ethanol production industry through production credits and other grants was announced in the Liberal Party's policy speech for the 2001 election—what lawyers might call `past consideration', Senator Coonan. So the one thing that Mr Honan might have got out of the meeting on 1 August he was going to get anyway, because the one thing all business people in Australia know about the Howard government is that it keeps its promises. He had asked for there to be no cap and he got a cap. He had asked that there be mandated admixture and he was told to get lost. He had asked that there be no excise imposed and for the first time in a century excise was imposed. All he got in the end was something that the government was committed to doing already. The Labor Party never told you any of that, Mr Acting Deputy President, did they? You never let the facts stand in the way of a good story, particularly if you are Mr Latham or if you are Senator O'Brien. Never let the facts stand in the way of a good story. But those are the facts the Labor Party did not tell you about. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So, far from this rather operatic picture of secret, shady meetings as a result of which a major Liberal Party donor comes away with a huge benefit, you have a meeting in the presence of six PM&amp;C note-takers, regularly minuted, as a result of which a lobbyist gets nothing of what he asked for and in fact, not in consequence of but subsequent thereto, the very things that he asked the government not to do the government, for sound policy reasons, decides to do. It doesn't look very much, does it, Mr Acting Deputy President, like a case of undue influence.</para><para>Finally, and this is the last aspect of the story that the Labor Party seeks to conjure for us, is the suggestion of donations to the Liberal Party. Any company in Australia is free to donate, subject to the requirements of the Electoral Act, to a political party, and it has never been in dispute, it has never been a secret, that Manildra is a Liberal Party donor. What was not a matter of public awareness until yesterday was the fact that Manildra is also a Labor Party donor. How embarrassing. Mr Latham and Mr Crean entertained the House of Representatives on two of the four days of the first sitting week back from the recess trying to parlay this story of secret financial influence of Manildra on the Liberal Party; and, lo and behold, they must have choked on their Weefies this morning when they opened the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> and saw a very good story by Jason Koutsoukis, Tony Walker and Laura Tingle under the headline `Labor caught in ethanol cash row'. We never heard that in the chronicle of righteous indignation from Mr Crean or Mr Latham in the House of Representatives, though there was a bit of retrospective tidying up in anticipation of what I was going to say by Senator O'Brien a few minutes ago. </para><para>What is the story? This is the story, as Jason Koutsoukis and his colleagues reported in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. Labor's national secretary, Geoff Walsh—who I interpolate to say has all of a sudden announced his decision to leave the Labor Party national secretaryship—confirmed to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> last night that he had authorised the return of money from Manildra after what he described as a heated conversation with Manildra chairman Dick Honan last Wednesday. The money was returned by the Australian Labor Party to Manildra—and did I say that the cheque was for $50,000? A tidy sum. The cheque was returned under cover of a letter of 6 August. If the Labor Party was so concerned about taking money from Manildra, why did it take seven weeks from the time the money was received by the Labor Party on 30 June, and banked?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—And used!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name></talker><para>—And used, as Senator McGauran points out, until the Labor Party then decided, `We can't touch Manildra's money.' Could it possibly be that, in the meantime, the FOI request for the note of the 1 August 2002 meeting taken by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Honan-Howard meeting, had been returned, so that by 6 August the Labor Party knew that what Mr Crean would do in the first week of the session was have a full-dress parliamentary debate about what a shameful thing it was that the Liberal Party should have financial dealings with Manildra and that the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister himself, as Leader of the Liberal Party, should meet with the chairman of Manildra? What we saw from the Labor Party was an exercise in retrospective outrage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On 30 June, before the Labor Party thought that it had an issue about Manildra, Mr Walsh wrote this to Mr Honan: </para><quote><para>Dear Dick—</para></quote><para>all very chummy—</para><quote><para>We have received a letter from your company enclosing a donation of $50,000 to the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>Your support is appreciated, as it has been in the past.</para></quote><para>I interpolate to say that one of the other things that Jason Koutsoukis and Tony Walker reveal in their Financial Review article this morning is that this is not the first $50,000 donation the Labor Party has taken from Manildra. Prior to the 2001 federal election, another $50,000 hit the tin. `Your support', the letter goes on, `is appreciated, as it has been in the past.' The Labor Party's fund raising code is then set out in what is apparently a form letter, but there is no suggestion that the Labor Party has any concern about taking the money. As I said, the money is banked and used.</para><para>All of a sudden—out of the blue—on 6 August, when the Labor Party knows that it is going to try to embarrass the Prime Minister on this issue, another letter to Mr Honan:</para><quote><para>Dear Dick,</para><para>I am writing to return the recent donation from the Manildra Group to the ALP National Secretariat.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>While I understand you are a vigorous advocate of your company's interests, I am sure you also appreciate the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party will always pursue issues on the basis of ALP policies and its judgement of the public interest.</para><para>In all of the circumstances, I believe it would be the best course to return your donation.</para></quote><para>It was in the public interest on 30 June to take the money.

Senator Brandis has made much in his commentary this afternoon of the meeting—I do not know which meeting he is referring to—apparently on 1 August 2002. Senator Brandis has said on a number of occasions in his commentary this afternoon that there were six people at that meeting. The FOI documents that Senator O'Brien has painstakingly retrieved from the department do not show that at all. They show that there were in fact three people at that meeting. I ask Senator Brandis: which meeting are you referring to? Was there another meeting that we have not asked questions about? Which meeting are you referring to? Has the senator in fact been misled by the Prime Minister? Is there another meeting that Mr Honan attended with the Prime Minister that had apparently six people in attendance? Certainly the one that we have some evidence of had only three.</para></talk.start><para>The lobbying efforts of the Manildra Group have done a lot of damage, as we have heard, to the ethanol industry as a whole. Manildra, as we know, had a commercial need to put 20 per cent—and in fact more—of ethanol into fuels and used all possible means to maintain that level in fuel through aggressive lobbying for a no 10 per cent cap for as long as possible. Senator Brandis made much this afternoon of the government agreeing to a 10 per cent cap. But how long did that take? It took ages. And what happened in between was the decimation of the potential ethanol industry, especially in my home state.</para><para>The rest of the industry views the close relationship and the secret meetings between Mr Honan and the Prime Minister as having been detrimental to achieving sustainable, long-term policy outcomes. It is clear that the views of Mr Honan and the rest of the ethanol industry are divergent. The ethanol industry would be a lot further along the track had it not been for his influence on the Prime Minister and his government. This has been to the absolute detriment of other major market participants like BP, Caltex and CSR and has put at risk a number of investment proposals, such as the Mossman Mill Multiplex consortium proposal, the CSR Burdekin and Sarina projects and the John Holland proposal to convert the Nambour sugar mill. This government's policy has failed both the sugar and the ethanol industries.</para><para>This afternoon Senator Brandis spoke at length about the policy announcement in the context of the Liberal Party's election platform in 2001. He was accusing the Labor Party of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story. Let me remind Senator Brandis that that announcement was made in the context of support for the sugar industry and I have got to say it has delivered absolutely nothing to the sugar industry in Queensland, the industry which I take great pride in representing.</para><para>The failure is no more evident for the sugar and the ethanol industries than in the coordination comments considered in cabinet on 10 September 2002, which said that the Treasury was `strongly opposed to linking development of the ethanol industry with assistance for the sugar industry'. Treasury said that `such development will do nothing to assist sugar farmers and will only raise false hopes'. I am so sad that this government has duped my industry for so long. This is because the problems in the sugar industry are not to do with market access. The cabinet comments went on to confirm what I have long feared: creating an alternative market, they said, for sugar products through interventions in the fuel market `will not increase income to sugar farmers'. </para><para>Even if ethanol producers were in a position to make major capital investments, which they are now not willing to do given the government's current policy framework, there is no likelihood that they would pay more than the world price for sugar in buying sugar by-product as ethanol feedstock. There are also lower cost feedstocks for ethanol production including wheat starch and sorghum. It is therefore clear that increasing domestic demand for ethanol will do nothing to alter the world price of sugar and therefore the sugar farmers and the communities that depend on them will be no better off. In fact, even Treasury notes that sugar farmers are already earning a higher price for sugar than what the ethanol industry is willing to pay for sugar. </para><para>Finance's comments in relation to the inclusion of measures relating to ethanol production in the sugar package are scathing. Finance considers that the measures raised for ministers' consideration will do nothing for the sugar industry. They will duplicate the objectives of the Energy Grants Credit Scheme due in 2003 and offer no quantifiable benefits. They appear poorly targeted, impose significant costs on other Australian industries, especially rural and regional industries, and will potentially result in significant costs to the budget. It is clear even from the outset—September 2002, almost a year ago—that the government received clear and unequivocal advice from the most respected government agencies that this flawed package was doomed to failure. </para><para>Yet, subsequent to the Prime Minister's meetings with Mr Honan, the government has pushed ahead regardless of the fact that the sugar industry needs a comprehensive policy framework within which it can move forward. This package is clearly not it. The package only demonstrates the extent to which the Liberal and National parties are prepared to hold out false hope to the cane farmers of Queensland and their families. Immediately subsequent to the government's decision regarding the sugar industry package, Canegrowers, the peak body representing some 6,000 Queensland cane growers, expressed serious reservations that the sugar industry assistance package would deliver the outcomes sought by government and industry. The general manager of Canegrowers, Mr Ian Ballantyne, said at the time:</para><quote><para>The board expresses extreme disappointment ... Grower representatives are gravely concerned ... The industry's immediate future will remain under threat ... The viability of entire mills and communities is in jeopardy ... Funding in the package is grossly inadequate.</para></quote><para>Since then, though, we have seen the future viability of the entire Sunshine Coast industry threatened by the announcement of the closure of the Nambour sugar mill. I cannot emphasise how absolutely devastating the impact of this will be on the region. There was some hope of a John Holland backed project to convert the mill into ethanol production but, given the government's mishandling in this area, the willingness of the financial markets to invest in ethanol production is understandably highly questionable. The future of this project is in grave doubt and with it the future of cane farming in that whole mill area.</para><para>Cane growing communities all over Queensland are under threat. Their situation, if anything, has worsened considerably in the last 12 months since the cabinet decided to ignore the advice provided by its own key agencies. Cane growers in my home state need leadership and they need it now. Sadly, I have said that sentence in this place for nearly 12 months. They do not need the government's failure to articulate effective policy on sugar and biofuels and the Prime Minister's arrogant refusal to admit that he has misled the House, the industry and the people of Australia. </para><para>Where has Minister Truss been during all of this? Since September 2002 there has been a lot of dragging of feet in relation to the implementation of elements of the sugar industry reform package. One could be forgiven for thinking that he is buckling under pressure from elements of the Queensland National Party—and let me say there is no unity in the coalition in Queensland over what should be occurring in the sugar industry. Since 1998 the industry has been battling poor seasons, flood, drought, and major pest infestations including orange rust and cane grubs. More than $700 million has been wiped from the industry since 1998. Four bad seasons and unprecedented low world prices have seen cane farmers struggling and many of their associated communities facing economic chaos. The sugar industry is not asking for a handout but they do need a hand-up, and they need it soon. They are asking the federal government for support, recognising that they do need to continuously improve industry performance.</para><para>The sugar industry reform package announced almost a year ago contained immediate assistance measures for growers and their families. They included income support measures and interest rate subsidies for replanting. The package also committed government to the establishment of long-term measures which, the government maintained, would assist cane growing districts to deliver on industry restructuring. These included an industry assistance group, regional guidance groups and regional projects assistance. </para><para>But we must remember that this package is being funded through a levy on domestic sugar sales—that is, it is being paid for by Australian taxpayers. So it is fair and right that Australian taxpayers should ask the obvious question: what has been delivered to the cane fields of Queensland? What has been delivered to rural towns like Mossman, Innisfail, Ingham, Home Hill and Ayr, in the Burdekin? What industry assistance and long-term support have been delivered to the communities in the Burnett?</para><para>I am sorry to report that this whole exercise has only added to the despair of cane growers and cane towns, who are still waiting for their promised support. Prior to the introduction of the package, all of Queensland's sugar growing regions had already established some sort of strategic industry organisation, board or structure to look at the future of the local districts. Millers and growers in almost every region were already working together to develop more efficient, effective and sustainable ways to grow, harvest, transport and crush cane within their mill areas. In many respects the minister has not announced anything new, and certainly nothing has had any impact to this point in time in the cane fields of Queensland.</para><para>Given that those structures were already in place, over which the minister's package simply added another expensive layer, the implementation process and unlocking of funding that it should have committed at the local community level should have been relatively simple. An interdepartmental committee was established which included Mr Max Moore-Wilton, who was then at Prime Minister and Cabinet. However, since Mr Moore-Wilton has moved on, the process of reform has languished in the offices of Minister Truss and AFFA. In fact, the framework that was to have been in place and the assessment of the proposals should have been up and running on 1 July. To date, not one cent has been allocated. I have to say that that is an absolute disgrace. This money has been taken from Australian consumers of sugar and is not being delivered for the purposes agreed to. </para><para>This package was negotiated with the Queensland government, and a memorandum of understanding was in place nearly 12 months ago. Minister Truss has failed to implement the package, because all of the assistance was conditional upon reform. When political pressure was put on the minister from some members of the National Party in Queensland, he was found wanting in courage. We are seeing levels of spectacular intransigence and incompetence. We are also, in effect, seeing a policy backflip, from a position where reform was demanded to a new, go-slow approach. No wonder cane farmers and the industry in general are confused and cynical. We have a minister and a government which reached a difficult agreement with the Queensland government on reform; yet, because of the lack of will to place the industry on the path towards sustainability, millions of dollars are now not flowing in to the cane growing regions of Queensland. Our industry cannot afford this delay. It is five minutes to midnight for our sugar industry and the towns that are reliant on it for economic activity. On the one hand we see a minister who is stuck in the political mire when it comes to sugar reform; on the other hand we see a Prime Minister delivering what effectively amounts to money for mates at the discount end of the ethanol industry, with nothing for the sugar industry, for which it was touted to be such a saviour.</para><para>Labor, by contrast, is taking the crisis facing the sugar industry seriously. Labor's plan commits immediate support for the industry. It recognises that the sugar industry is vital to Australia and that it is especially important to regional communities in Queensland. Labor will work with industry to secure a long-term sustainable future for farmers and communities in North Queensland. Labor recognises that a commitment is needed from farmers to restructure, to gain further business skills and to deliver better environmental outcomes. But sugar farmers and sugar communities cannot be left to do it all on their own. The industry and Labor expect the Howard government to ensure that sugar has a place in any free trade agreement developed with the United States and in any international or World Trade Organisation negotiations.</para><para>I wish to go now to what has happened to the industry in its attempts to develop ethanol in Queensland. The government has a policy to reach 350 megalitres of renewable fuels, which could be ethanol or biodiesel, in the Australian fuel mix by 2010. This would represent two per cent of fuel consumption. CSR produces 60 megalitres of ethanol per annum from molasses at Sarina. Very little of this, as we know, is used in fuel. It is mainly used domestically—it is a very high-quality ethanol—for pharmaceuticals, food additives and industrial applications. Quite a lot of this ethanol is exported to Japan for addition to sake, which I find interesting.</para><para>The strategy of developing renewable fuels was progressing reasonably well until November-December of last year, when the rash of publicity, mainly based in Sydney, occurred. This impacted disastrously on consumer confidence with respect to ethanol blends in vehicles. It mainly related to New South Wales but has had an ongoing effect around Australia. At the same time, BP was undertaking molasses based ethanol blends sourced from CSR at Sarina at a number of its outlets in Queensland. At that time, it was progressing with quite a lot of research and activity but, when consumer confidence dropped as it did, the negative publicity was devastating and BP's sales dropped off so dramatically that they were forced to suspend the trial. </para><para>The results of the trial were initially very positive. They received no complaints, there were no issues and the fuel performed as it should have. From a technical perspective, the trial demonstrated that the fuel additive was good and that it was well received in the community. At the same time, surveys conducted by major fuel companies showed that over 70 per cent of consumers in Sydney and 30 per cent of consumers in Brisbane said they would not use ethanol because of the negative publicity. Caltex are currently running a trial in Cairns and, I understand, BP are as well. They are using the same base sources as BP for their trial, and there has been quite a good level of consumer confidence in the trial. In fact, I am a happy purchaser of E10 in my town. But, given the lack of confidence that has been allowed to develop due to this government's inability to react to the need for a cap on ethanol, it is hard to say to people—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13696</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join in this debate on the government side, rejecting the opposition's motion moved by Senator O'Brien.

The measure of the Leader of the Opposition's utter desperation to register some sort of public notice or dint the credibility of his prime ministerial competitor is for him to dub this `ethanolgate'— this overused political tag really sums up the Leader of the Opposition's and the Labor Party's desperation to get politically noticed.</para><para>Their attack is baseless, exaggerated and opportunistic.

Your only way now, as your tacticians see it, is to make a dint in the Prime Minister's popularity in the hope Mr Crean's popularity will lift accordingly. That is how you have summed up the way you are going to get into government. Let us just say the `leaders' of the Labor Party have worked out that is the way they are getting into government. I see a few over on the opposition side of the chamber at the moment, like Senator Forshaw, who know only too well that that is not the way. We realise that he has worked to not make that the way, but he has been overruled. The smarter political tacticians, like Senator Forshaw and perhaps Senator Stephens—ironically, from the New South Wales Right—have worked out that this type of tactic, led by Mr Crean and Mr Latham in the other chamber and in this House by Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner, is not the way to get into government. You have been led down a path that will see Mr Crean's popularity sink even lower, because the public can see through your ranting and raving, your scorn, your slander and your slur. They will continue to reject you as a credible alternative government until at very least you can lace some of your slander and slur with some credible public policy.</para><para>There was, actually, a feeble attempt by Senator McLucas in her address to lace the slander and slur that is bound in this motion with some sort of policy debate. But the mover of this motion, Senator O'Brien, in his address, said nothing to that effect—yet he is a shadow minister, a frontbencher and a leader of the tactics of the opposition. Regrettably, Senators McLucas, Stephens, Forshaw and Buckland do not have control of the reins, because I am sure that this would not be their primary tactic at all. </para><para>You would have thought that, after a six-week winter break, a leadership challenge within that period and the complete flat-lining in the polls not only of your party but of your leader, the strategists in the Labor bunker would have reassessed the whole approach. But you have opened up the first week of the parliament with the same old approach. You have not come in here with some sort of credible plan to rebuild your credibility block by block. It gets harder the longer you are in opposition. Take it from us: we were in opposition for 13 years, and the sooner you start that block-by-block rebuilding of your credibility, the better—well, the sooner you do not start it, the longer you will be in opposition.

Instead, you open this new parliamentary session with personal attacks, personal innuendo and scornful politics. As I say, the public see through it.

The one policy they have announced is their higher education policy. Why haven't you made that policy the subject of a general business notice of motion in the Senate? It is not a very good policy and it is not a credible policy, but it is a policy they have announced which shows some differentiation with the policies of the government. Why don't you bring that into the chamber so we can debate that? Why don't you put that down as a general business notice of motion? At least you would then have some credibility. We are now going into an election year and the sooner you start to wrestle your tactics away from those who hold the reins at the moment—the scorners—the sooner you will look like a credible alternative government.</para><para>I now address more definitely the issue before us. The government have always been open about their policy regarding support for the ethanol industry. Our policy goes back to the 2001 election, where we announced our comprehensive support—a bit of Keynesianism—for the ethanol industry. That policy document reads:</para><quote><para>The Coalition will set an objective that fuel ethanol and biodiesel produced in Australia from renewable sources will contribute at least 350 million litres to the total fuel supply by 2010. Progress towards the objective will be reviewed in 2006 ...  </para></quote><para>It continues:</para><quote><para>To implement the 350 million litre objective, the Coalition will provide, through a grant process from 2002/03, a capital subsidy for new or expanded domestic production infrastructure of $0.16 per litre of biofuel, until total new domestic production capacity reaches 310 million litres or by end-2006/07, whichever is sooner ...</para></quote><para>That is a clear statement of support for the industry: a direct government injection of capital and production grants—and that is exactly what we have delivered. Our motivation for the industry package was quite obvious, even to the Labor Party. Firstly, our motivation was environmental—the environmental benefits from producing a green, clean fuel in competition to oil. Secondly, by producing an industry support package, we would support regional development—and this industry rests mostly in regional areas. Consequently, there would be an underlining of the employment already in regional areas through this industry and increased employment. As I say, given that most ethanol plants are situated within rural and regional areas, the National Party fully supported this policy going into the last election. And such support extends not just to the workers at the processing plants but also to the sugar farmers and the wheat farmers. It goes right down to supporting the farm gate and the farm gate prices and the demand for their raw material. By supporting and growing a new industry, you provide greater demand for your farm products. Thirdly, by supporting the ethanol industry as an alternative to petrol based fuel not only do we reduce our dependence on the oil industry but also the 10 per cent mix of ethanol in petrol at the pump produces cheaper prices for the consumer.</para><para>So the whole motivation for the government's policy is quite simple: we were injecting competition into the market and supporting the market in the short term for long-term benefit—simple economics with a touch of Keynesianism, which I would have thought those on the other side may have been attracted to. But no, you do not look at the policy analysis or the motivations; you just look at the slur and slander against the Prime Minister. Not one Labor speaker to date has addressed—but we hold out hope that perhaps Senator Buckland will—the merit and justification of this very sound policy or has perhaps put on the table an alternative policy. We await Senator Buckland's address to the Senate.</para><para>To support this vital industry the government has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into it, and we are proud of that support. First of all, on 25 July this year the government announced its decision to allocate $37 million to fund one-off capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity. Secondly, the subsidy will provide 16c per litre to new or expanded projects producing a minimum of five million litres of biofuel, with a maximum grant of $10 million per project. Thirdly, this is in addition to an existing production subsidy for biofuels equivalent to 38c per litre. That will be available to the industry until 30 June 2008, when it will then be reduced in five equal annual steps. Fourthly, the government has also decided to commission a report on the 350-million-litre biofuels objective in light of the latest evidence on the environmental and other benefits of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels.</para><para>On 22 July there was a very comprehensive policy announcement by the government: the government announced its decision to provide short-term assistance to all existing fuel ethanol producers to assist in the transition to the recently introduced E10 standard, which will allow the current production subsidy to be paid in advance of the payment of excise. This measure will provide a short-term cash flow injection to offset the impact on revenue of lower ethanol sales and will be in place until 31 December 2003 or until the $10 million financial cap is reached. In April the government announced its decision to set a 10 per cent limit for ethanol blends in petrol, to develop a standard for fuel ethanol and to legislate to require labelling of ethanol content in petrol. These steps will ensure a high quality for ethanol fuel and it will ensure that consumers have sufficient information about what is in the fuel that they are purchasing. The government's policy has been welcomed by the ethanol industry and by the sugar industry. It has been welcomed with open arms by the sugar industry. I could not quite see how Senator McLucas came to her conclusion that this was a policy rejected by the sugar industry.  </para><para>But let us look at Labor's claims regarding this comprehensive policy, keeping in mind that they have no alternative policy. The main thrust of Labor's attack is that this policy was specifically designed to benefit one player: the Manildra Group. This threadbare claim is based on nothing more than the fact that the Manildra Group is a major player in the industry and that therefore we have designed it so that the Manildra Group will get the bulk of the grants and subsidies that the government puts on offer. They say that we have done that for the simple reason that the chairman, Mr Honan, is a friend of the Prime Minister. And that is the beginning and end of their claim. I will refer to yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and allow the Prime Minister to reject that spurious claim. He said:</para><quote><para>I do not deny that I know him. But to suggest that he is one of my closest friends, to suggest that I play golf with him, to suggest that we are talking to each other every day and he is one of the closest mates I have in corporate Australia is absolutely absurd. The reality is that Mr Honan has been a very generous supporter of both sides of politics.</para></quote><para>He was a donor to the Labor Party. You only have to see the headlines of today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> to see what embarrassment has come upon the Labor Party with regard to accepting donations from the Manildra Group. The Prime Minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>I think I have said to this House before that the very first time I met Mr Honan he told me how much he admired my predecessor, Mr Keating, and he told me how very clever Mr Keating was and how very hard it would be for me to defeat Mr Keating.</para></quote><para>Mr Honan got that wrong. He praised the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. He seemed to be more of a friend of Mr Keating than he ever was of Mr Howard. We reject the spurious claim that we have designed this policy because this man is a friend of the Prime Minister. In fact, the government rejected the two main lobbying points that the chairman, Mr Honan, put to the government.</para><para>Why shouldn't Mr Honan lobby in these corridors? These corridors are full of lobbyists. Both sides of the parliament know that. There are paid professional lobbyists stalking the corridors. Mr Honan has every right, just as they have, to put a point of view in regard to an industry which he has heavily invested in. The chair of the Manildra Group, Mr Honan, wanted two special things from the government and he did not get them. Most of all he wanted the government to mandate a level of ethanol in petrol—to legislate that petrol companies put a certain amount of ethanol in their petrol. We rejected this. In his submission, the second thing that Mr Honan asked of the Prime Minister and the government was that we did not introduce a 10 per cent cap on ethanol. He wanted more, but we did introduce a 10 per cent cap on ethanol. </para><para>These two points have been made by a previous speaker, and the other side knows it very well. Those two things form the smoking gun. The smoking gun is that Mr Honan did not get the two main things that he wanted from the government. Our package is not specifically for Manildra; it is an industry package which will allow new entrants into the industry. It will allow another major player, the sugar company CSR, to expand into the ethanol industry. At the moment they have a small interest. This package is as much designed for them as it is designed for Manildra. It is designed for new entrants. It is designed to increase employment and it is designed to allow the sugar industry to expand. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13700</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I found Senator McGauran's contribution to the debate quite entertaining. He said that no-one has managed to get to the public policy issues of this debate, and that is certainly something I would like to move towards today. I will begin, in speaking in support of this motion, by saying that I want to get to the implications of this whole Manildra ethanol subsidy issue and the effect that it is having on rural and regional Australia and the industries about which Senator McGauran was so defensive.</para></talk.start><para>I will start with the Red Meat Advisory Council. On 8 August—very recently—Mr Bill Whitehead, the Chairman of the Red Meat Advisory Council, a consultative body that was set up by the government, wrote to the Prime Minister telling him that all six members of the council strongly opposed any further subsidisation of ethanol production using feed grains. Mr Whitehead also wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, strongly advising him against the government's planned introduction of the subsidy for grain based ethanol plants. Such a subsidy, Mr Whitehead wrote, would work only to further distort the operations of the domestic feed grain market to the detriment of all livestock industries, including those industries using grain to sustain their breeding stock during the current drought. Mr Whitehead continued in his correspondence:</para><quote><para>RMAC fully supports the objective of fostering regional development, but only on the basis that it is unsubsidised and government intervention does not discriminate between businesses competing for common inputs.</para></quote><para>The concession would accentuate the unfair advantage that grain based ethanol plants have over grain dependent livestock industries in the purchasing of feed grains. The Labor Party also supports the development of the alternative fuels industry and regional development but not at the expense of other well-established agricultural industries that provide jobs and contribute significantly to the economies and the viability of communities throughout rural, regional and remote parts of Australia.</para><para>Senator O'Brien's remarks at the beginning of this debate go to the issue of the Prime Minister's failure to disclose his meeting with the chief executive of Manildra, Mr Honan, six weeks before he delivered his Manildra package. We all agree that that was an outrageous misleading of the parliament. So too is the government's blatant game of political favouritism in delivering additional subsidies to what is the near monopoly ethanol producer.</para><para>The Labor Party were so disgusted by the scandal involving Mr Honan and his Manildra Group, and its secret meetings with the Prime Minister, that we returned the donation of money—the $50,000 mentioned by Senator McGauran—that was made to the ALP by that company. That donation, as the ALP Secretary, Mr Geoff Walsh, said and is quoted in this morning's press as saying, `came out of the blue in June'—something that Senator Brandis and Senator McGauran chose to ignore. Given developments since that time, it is hard not to be cynical about what the motivation for that donation might have been. Holding secret meetings, telling lies and unjustly promoting the interests of friends over the legitimate interests of other decent, hardworking people in the community is not the way the Labor Party operate. Mr Walsh had certainly done the right thing in returning the Manildra money and in telling Mr Honan that the federal parliamentary Labor Party is not in the business of taking donations when there is debate about public policy issues that might affect the donor's interests. On the other hand, it is clear that Mr Howard in his obsession to help the Manildra Group has ignored the implications of his action for other major grain users in Australia's rural economy. </para><para>I would like to address my remarks to those issues now. Manildra's ethanol production is based on grain, but so are the feedlot, chicken and pork industries. To subsidise Manildra is to impose prohibitive costs on those other industries. As great as the public concern about Mr Howard's deception to the parliament and to the Australian people is the level of concern within the agricultural sector about the potential impact of this additional subsidy for the ethanol industry. The Executive Director of the Australian Lot Feeders Association, Mr Rob Sewell, wrote a letter to ALFA members very recently. In that correspondence he said:</para><quote><para>No doubt news of the John Anderson driven bio-fuels incentives scheme has reached your business—or perhaps it was termed the Howard Government's Feedlot Industry Disintegration Program.</para></quote><para>He continued:</para><quote><para>Australian agriculture has accepted the `level' playing field but it is hardly fair when one team has their legs cut off. You have to wonder who has their hands in whose pocket, with this kind of rationale.</para></quote><para>Those statements are fair enough, given the circumstances. The Labor Party agrees with ALFA in its belief that the Howard government's proposal to develop the grain based ethanol industry will compete directly, and potentially in a disastrous way, with the intensive livestock farming sector. The Australian feedlot industry has been articulating its legitimate concerns about the supply of domestic grain for some time—to the apparent deaf ear of this government.</para><para>Where has the minister been in this debate? Despite the importance of these industries as generators of both income and jobs in regional Australia, there has not been one word from the minister responsible, Mr Truss. The continued drought throughout Australia's broadacre farming regions—the toughest and longest drought in living memory—has caused severe grain shortages. In distinct contrast to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, my colleague Senator O'Brien has been listening intently to the intensive livestock farming industries about their concerns over both the grain shortage and the growing subsidisation of the ethanol industry, and their fears are well supported. </para><para>ALFA commissioned independent research that is contained in the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Development of regional fuel ethanol industries based on grain feedstock and possible effects on the lot feeding and pork industries</inline>. The report says that, currently in Australia, 63 million litres of ethanol are produced from C-grade molasses feedstock and 50 million litres from starch feed stock. Further, it says there is an additional planned increase of 58 million litres per annum in ethanol production, with eight million litres proposed to come from sugarcane feedstock and 50 million litres from starch waste feedstock.</para><para>So it takes one tonne of grain or molasses to produce approximately 400 litres or 250 litres of ethanol respectively. That means that, at the current rate of production, some 1,818 gigalitres of ethanol would be required for the manufacture of petrol with an ethanol blend of 10 per cent, which is the level of blend that the Howard government is proposing. Full use of low cost feedstock, such as C-grade molasses and wheat derived waste starch, will only produce 350 million litres of fuel ethanol. That is just two per cent of the petrol market. A 10 per cent blend, that is 1.8 gigalitres of fuel ethanol, would require significant additional quantities of grain or other feedstock to produce a five-fold increase in the quantity of fuel based ethanol required, or 15 times the current ethanol production. </para><para>To put this increase in feedstock demand into perspective, Australia produces approximately nine million tonnes of feed grains per annum, while the mean annual molasses production between 1996 and 2000 was 1.09 million tonnes. In other words, half the feed grains, and about 70 per cent of all the molasses produced annually, would go to ethanol production. So where is that grain going to come from? Has the government given any serious thought to the repercussions for the intensive livestock industries of the shift to the ethanol industry of one of their primary inputs? It certainly does not look like it. The ethanol industry had been seeking—of course, as we now know, because of the association between Mr Howard and Mr Honan—and has been granted a subsidy excise rate of approximately 38c per litre. According to ALFA, that rate of excise equates to an indirect subsidy on grain and molasses inputs of $152 per tonne of sorghum and $98 per tonne of molasses. In total, the subsidy to the ethanol industry amounts to some $245 million.</para><para>The lot feeding pork, dairy and poultry industries are valuable regional primary industries. They have grown steadily in Australia over the last 10 years and in most cases are projecting future growth of 10 per cent per year. Most of that projected growth in the lot feed and pork industries will occur in northern New South Wales and in southern Queensland because of the proximity of those regions to grain supply, livestock supply, meat processing capacity and export ports. Total feed grain usage by the intensive livestock industries has grown almost 100 per cent since 1992-93—just in that decade—to 10.92 million tonnes in 2001-02. The pig industry's usage of grain has increased from 1.57 million tonnes to 2.13 million tonnes over the same period. Recently, some modelling work done by ABARE showed that demand for feed grain is expected to rise significantly over the next five years, with total feed grain supply increasing only slightly.</para><para>The pork industry is currently valued at close to $1 billion and it employs more than 33,000 people across Australia, with exports in the order of $270 million a year. The industry group Australian Pork Ltd says that distortions in the feed grain market due to the ethanol assistance package will reduce Australia's capacity to expand its export levels and to continue to build the critical mass needed for continued industry expansion. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, in its report called <inline font-style="italic">The impact of feedlot investment</inline>, shows the significant impact on the national economy of that industry, which has a capital investment, to date, in excess of $1 billion. Livestock purchases are also nearly $2 billion with spending on feed greater than $650 million and spending on transport of $195 million. About $55 million is spent on wages and salaries with direct employment of more than 1,600 people. Sales in the industry have accounted for a turnover of nearly $3 billion.</para><para>Let us look at the poultry industry. Egg production is also heavily dependent on purchased feeds and it is an industry worth well over $300 million annually and directly employing about 3,300 people. That does not include poultry meat production. I do not have the figures on the number of people employed in the poultry meat industry but it is an area of agriculture worth more than $2 billion in production, with some $24 million in export earnings. Let us look at the dairy industry. The dairy industry also relies on the supply of grains and it employs some 35,000 people across Australia. It represents a very significant part of Australia's total agricultural economy, with a gross production value of some $3 billion and exports of $2.2 billion. </para><para>The long-term viability of all Australia's intensive livestock industries is of course dependent on access to an adequate supply of grain and other feed at competitive prices. Feed grains approximate 60 to 80 per cent of the cost of production in those industries. Australia has had highly variable grain production. A recent analysis by the Grains Research and Development Corporation showed that in the northern grain region, which is the area where most feedlots are concentrated, there is the likelihood of a grain shortage in three out of every 10 years.</para><para>On average Australia produces 28 million tonnes of grain, of which nine million tonnes is used as livestock feed. Other feed includes molasses, of which Australia produces one million tonnes per year, with domestic demand being approximately half a million tonnes for stockfeed and other uses. Molasses is a key ingredient in feedlot rations as well as for the pastoral cattle supplementary feeding programs. The subsidy given to grain based ethanol producers, of which Manildra is the biggest, is not going to do anything to alleviate the situation for hard-pressed sugar farmers. This is despite the fact that the Howard government has for years been touting ethanol as the salvation of cane growers. This is the issue of course that Senator McLucas has addressed in her remarks.</para><para>In relation to the grain shortage, ALFA says that the situation is only likely to get worse because demand will continue to outstrip supply, especially in northern New South Wales and Queensland, where the industry is concentrated. The problem will be further exacerbated by other factors, including a projected decrease in arable area sown to grains, the forecast significant growth of Australia's lot feeding and pork industries to satisfy both domestic and export demands, and competition from the export markets for feed grains as overseas livestock industries continue to adopt intensive feeding practices.</para><para>Then we have the probability of a severe El Nino drought, which occurs once every 10 years. The current drought has highlighted the precarious position of livestock feed supply and demand, with Australia importing almost a quarter of a million tonnes of feed grains. Grain imports were also necessary in the 1994-95 drought, of course, so this is not a one-off situation. Feed costs for the intensive livestock industries have already increased significantly as a result of the drought. The dairy industry, especially in New South Wales and Queensland, is still adjusting to the effect of farm gate deregulation and certainly is in no position to absorb major cost increases. Dairy is also heavily dependent on export markets and in no position to pass any increased costs on to its consumers.</para><para>I am sure the government will seek to dismiss my concerns as just politics. Such a view would be seriously misplaced. The government trumpets its efforts in whole-of-government planning; yet, in its coordination comments to the cabinet submission relating to the government's now stalled sugar reform package considered last September, the Department of Finance and Administration said that the ethanol package would:</para><quote><para>... impose considerable costs on other Australian industries, especially rural and regional industries, and will potentially result in significant costs to the budget. </para></quote><para>So the cabinet was told by a central agency that there would be a problem for other major grain users if grain based ethanol production were heavily subsidised, but it chose to ignore that advice. This point was picked up by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>newspaper in its editorial of 12 August, which said:</para><quote><para>... as with all forms of industry feather-bedding, the protection of ethanol blights industries that do not enjoy the same patronage. For example, by distorting the market for grain, the ethanol subsidy harms the feedlot industry, and drives up the costs of beef and pork producers.</para></quote><para>So, when the Deputy Prime Minister talks about building new ethanol plants all around his own electorate to generate jobs, he really means that he plans to drive jobs out of intensive industries in the interests of Manildra. Given the contribution these industries make to economic growth, and given their forecast growth over the next few years, one would expect the government to be going out of its way to encourage them, not deliberately working to place them at a commercial disadvantage. Yet again, as in so many other areas of public policy, we have the Howard government pitting one group against another—and regional Australia will pay the price.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>13704</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was struck by Senator McGauran's speech a little earlier in which he talked at great length and with such passion about the benefits of ethanol.

Let us look at what that did. It was set up to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production in Australia of certain fuel ethanol to assist the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. That is what we are attempting to talk about today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also the case—and this certainly did not happen before 1996, Senator Macdonald; I was in this place and I remember it—that this government got rid of the Energy Research and Development Corporation. As the name suggests, that was a research and development body. I think it got $3.94 million a year in funding. Looking at its task, I am struck again by the irony of this debate and the situation we find ourselves in. It was set up to establish standards and test protocols for ethanol fuel blends. Isn't that amazing?</para><para>We have had the most extraordinary situation over the last 12 months or so where this government has refused to make a decision about limiting the amount of ethanol in petrol. We have seen a huge drop in confidence in ethanol-petrol blend products. The government dillydallied around with that whole matter and of course in the meantime Labor took great political advantage of that, not caring what consumers thought about ethanol in petrol and not worrying about confidence in the industry. Both parties were clearly not interested in a cleaner fuel—not interested in the development of this important alternative to fossil fuels.</para><para>The Energy Research and Development Corporation was also set up to do trials of fuel blends. It was to provide technical improvements to the blending process. That, of course, is what this whole debate—this whole mess—has been about, with some areas having petrol with higher levels of ethanol. That is what started this whole mess, which has had such devastating consequences for the industry. </para><para>Essentially, this debate is about accountability. It is about whether money has bought influence and whether the Prime Minister misled the parliament when he said that he did not meet a man who gave the Liberal Party substantial donations and who benefited from the decision the Prime Minister made shortly after the meeting to effectively stop ethanol imports. As I said, there are lots of ironies, and I am struck by that through this entire debate. The legislation that came into the Senate this week would have put into effect part of the agreement the Prime Minister is said to have negotiated in the meeting with Mr Honan. That bill had cross-party support.</para><para>We all supposedly want to have an ethanol industry in this country which will prosper and which will be competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable—all those things the bounty set up in the first place—so there was general agreement to support this bill. But, of course, we adjourned that debate at second reading, something the Democrats agreed with. Why was that? It was for accountability reasons. This government refused to provide the documents that had been ordered by the Senate and, until the government does that, that bill will sit there and not be dealt with, I hope. I hope the Labor Party does not change its mind on this issue because it is important to make a stand and to insist that the government provides the documents that this chamber decides it ought.</para><para>One of the reasons for the legislation— that is, the legislation which applies an excise on ethanol for the first time and then takes it away again by providing a production subsidy—is that the industry would not survive the competition from Brazil. Brazil produces something like 18 billion litres of ethanol a year, and it does that from sugar. It produces huge quantities of sugar, so much that it can afford to use low-grade sugar and presumably molasses—although I do not know this—to produce ethanol. In so doing, it controls not only the sugar market but also the global market in ethanol, or it could do. Of course, many cars run on 100 per cent ethanol in Brazil, and I understand it dominates there in the same way that petrol dominates elsewhere. But that is another matter.</para><para>As I said, this government did not appear to be at all interested in supporting the local ethanol industry back in 1996, and it is extraordinary now to hear people like Senator McGauran saying how critically important this industry is to their constituents. I would have thought it was important to their constituents all along, but this is a new found passion for ethanol that the people on the other side of this chamber have come across only in recent times. As I understand it, we are not talking here about a magnanimous handout to ethanol producers; it is effectively tariff protection by another name. Whilst the Democrats have no problem with that, I would have thought that the government, with all their discussion about free trade arrangements and dropping tariffs on everything else, would find that a bit uncomfortable, but they do not so that is okay.</para><para>You could argue that Mr Honan, if he did pay for influence, did not in fact get a lot for his money. He faces another crisis in 2008 because, between 2008 and 2012, the government proposes to take away that production subsidy and to make ethanol compete with overseas competition from Brazil, as we know, and with competition from petrol. Ethanol, like CNG, LPG and all those other alternative fuels, is a fledgling industry. We have seen LPG penetrate the taxi sector very successfully, and I am glad that it has, but CNG is still struggling to find a foothold. We are in a situation where auto manufacturers are on the brink of making decisions about proceeding to roll off vehicles from the production line that are ready to run on CNG or on biodiesel, but the so-called certainty the government has introduced from 2008 to 2012 will effectively see that industry go down the gurgler. As I said, I do not think Mr Honan got really good value for money, because by 2012 his industry is not going to be worth very much. The price, of course, will go up for consumers. Even if it were available to them, consumers are going to be less likely to buy it, particularly since there has been such a great campaign to denigrate ethanol. I think this is reflected in some of those other alternative fuels, as well. I think that confidence has slipped right away from the alternative fuel market. </para><para>It is interesting that the National Party backbenchers and others are now suggesting that the country should mandate levels of ethanol in petrol. I am grateful to Senator Stephens for pointing out some of the figures that I was going to point out as well. We had a look at this question of mandating ethanol, and I think it is something we should aim for. However, there are vast problems with doing so. I do not think we could mandate the sorts of levels of ethanol in petrol that would make it worth while because we simply do not produce enough. Even the ethanol which is produced from molasses, from sugar cane—and it has been going on in this country for a very long time—is mostly exported. A lot of it goes to Japan and becomes hair products, sake, gin and all sorts of spirits. A lot of Australian ethanol goes overseas to make those products, so it has a very high value. We are not going to see the ethanol that is currently produced suddenly being available to be put into petrol; there just are not the quantities. Senator Stephens pointed out the difficulties of producing enormous quantities of ethanol with grain.</para><para>The other problem is that if you say, `To make it reasonable, 10 per cent is the appropriate level to mandate. We think you could do that by 2020,' that is 1.8 billion litres that would need to be generated. In the meantime, what do you do? If you say, `Let's go for two per cent,' you are talking about mandating two per cent of ethanol in petrol across the country. That would mean getting that two per cent right out to Western Australia from New South Wales. It would mean that, across the board, you would have to transport ethanol an awfully long way. Until we have ethanol being produced locally right across the country, this is just totally unfeasible. I think it is a bit of catch-up on the part of the National Party to run around saying that the problems will be solved by mandating levels of ethanol. Of course they have a lot of work to do on consumers who currently believe that ethanol is bad for your car and bad for the environment. As I said earlier this week, I get distressed going into service stations and seeing these guarantees that there is no ethanol in their petrol. The ALP has a case to answer for doing that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Hear hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—but so has the government, Senator Macdonald.

It just makes absolutely no sense at all. Of course, we are powerless to do anything about this because, by the time 2008 comes, by which time we need the legislation to do this, we will not have an industry in CNG, in LPG or in biodiesel. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But, as I said, we are focused today on whether the Prime Minister told the truth and what money can buy by way of influence. The Democrats say that it is time for this parliament to deal with the problem of political donations that have or could be seen to have strings attached. That is what we are here debating today. Until we do this, I think the perceptions of dishonesty and illegality are going to keep coming up time and time again. My own preference is for a complete ban on donations to politicians and to political parties. But we are not going to get that, because it does take money to run political organisations. There is fierce competition between political parties—the stakes are very high—both between and at election times, and that demands that more and more money is spent on improving our chances of getting the message across to voters. So that is the reality. Of course we can look to the American system. I think that is the worst example of this. Much of what we see the Bush administration doing can be traced back to influential money. I seriously hope Australia does not go any further in that direction, because it is antidemocratic and I think it sends a really seriously wrong message about the integrity of our political system and our parliamentary system.</para><para>The Democrats say that the perceptions of undue influence are seen by the public well and truly as corruption. They make no distinction between illegal corrupt practices and the perception that moneys have been received and favours have been provided in return for those moneys. They need to be dealt with so that the public can have faith in the integrity of our political system, and that needs to happen urgently. I am reminded of the early days of this government, Senator Macdonald, when so many heads rolled because of the public's lack of confidence in politicians. We seem to have moved on from there, and the standards have dropped enormously in responding to those crises in public confidence.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—But there haven't been any since then.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—This is one good example, Senator Macdonald, and I am sure we can point to lots of others.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0</name.id><name role="metadata">Marshall, Gavin (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Marshall)</inline>—Senator Allison, could you address your remarks through the chair, please.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President, I do apologise.

The parliament and the government simply have to redouble their efforts in building confidence again. We cannot have our Prime Minister misleading the parliament. We cannot have lies being told, whether they are to do with children being thrown overboard, weapons of mass destruction being the basis for an attack on Iraq or refusing to release documents that are required in the debate or documents that might be embarrassing. It is time to clean up our act. The future of this place depends on it. I think this is a crisis. It is not just a crisis for the Prime Minister; it is a crisis for the parliament. It worries me enormously that we have to have this kind of debate today. As I said, there are other really important issues that fold into this whole debate. They also need to be explored, but of crucial importance is that whole question of confidence. We must deal with this matter of political donations and we must clean up our act.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13708</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the debate at this late stage in my capacity representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Senate and also in my capacity representing regional Australia in the Senate. I am actually a senator who lives in the sugar areas of Queensland, areas that could well benefit from some advances in ethanol use in Australia. I also live in an area where there are four CSR mills. Of course CSR is a very important part of this whole ethanol debate. There are many people in the sugar areas who would desperately like to help with the progress of the ethanol industry and the science behind it, but unfortunately they keep getting held up by the intransigence of the Labor government in Queensland in failing to come to any appropriate resolution of some of the crises confronting the sugar industry at the present time. </para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, I come to this debate late because, as a minister, I have actually had to spend the afternoon doing some real work, Senator O'Brien, not participating in political point scoring in a debate that has brought nothing new forward. Unfortunately I did not hear your speech, Senator O'Brien, but my staff have been listening for me and they tell me that not one new piece of information has come out of the waste of two hours of the Senate's time this afternoon. I do want to thank Senator Brandis and Senator McGauran for their comments. Again, I did not hear them but I know from the quality of those speakers that they would put the case fairly and accurately and would have quite clearly demonstrated that there is no substance in the motion before the Senate.</para><para>Senator O'Brien, I am told, spent his entire time doing what passes in the Labor Party these days for policy debate—that is, a personal vilification of individual ministers, including in this case the Prime Minister. Senator O'Brien talked about a pattern of deceit. Obviously, coming out of that preselection row a week or so ago, Senator O'Brien, you know all about patterns of deceit. I am not suggesting that you were part of that but certainly your opponent, Mr Price, was involved in a pattern of deceit for many, many months or even years, deceitfully pretending to be the state secretary of the Labor Party and all the time in there trying to knock you off, Senator O'Brien. We know that Senator O'Brien would not call this deceitful but one might wonder when you look at Senator O'Brien's position on livestock export.</para><para>Senator O'Brien was originally totally opposed to live cattle exports. He wanted it all banned and who was supporting him in that? It was the meat workers union. Remember that? They wanted it banned, so he wanted it banned. They are the union guys who run the Labor Party. But suddenly Senator O'Brien had another look at the whole issue and he saw that the Maritime Union of Australia thought it should be business as usual with livestock exports. Senator O'Brien then changed his mind and that seems innocent enough but you might have a look at which of the unions left the Left faction with Senator O'Brien when he switched over to the Right faction to guarantee his preselection. I will give you one guess which union went with him: it was the Maritime Union of Australia. Isn't it surprising that Senator O'Brien's change of policy position happened to go with his strength in the preselection battle.</para><para>I have to say, Senator O'Brien, I am particularly grateful that you were preselected. I think you do not do a bad job at times, only you should stick to the policy and forget the personal vilification of Mr Howard and Mr Truss, which regrettably you get a bit too much involved in. If you stayed on the policy issues you could contribute to Australia, so I am glad that you got there as No. 1 on the ticket. I hope that you get defeated at the election, but if we have to have Labor senators from Tasmania then you are as good as I guess we can get, if you stick to the policy questions. </para><para>I think the two speakers before me on my side of the house have clearly elaborated what the government's biofuels policy is aimed at. It is aimed at developing ethanol and biodiesel industries in Australia. We want to maintain an effective excise-free status for ethanol and biodiesel until 2008 by a production subsidy that equals the excise. From 2008 the subsidy will be wound back so that from 2012 ethanol and biodiesel will be subject to the full rate of excise. The second aspect, of course, is to provide assistance for construction of new ethanol and biodiesel plants, and the cost of this assistance will total something in the order of $37 million. This policy sets some pretty tough hurdles for ethanol and the biofuels industry, and many of the proponents think these hurdles are too high. Existing ethanol producers, CSR and Manildra, think they are a bit tough.</para><para>I must comment on Senator Allison's contribution to this debate. Some of her contribution was, at times, perceptive but she answered her own question on the substance of the debate about the deceit. Senator Allison said—and I emphasise that these are her words:</para><quote><para>... Mr Honan, if he did pay for influence, did not in fact get a lot for his money.</para></quote><para>Senator Allison has answered her own question. Of course, there is nothing in this scurrilous accusation by the Labor Party. Senator Allison rightly identified that by 2008, and certainly by 2012, ethanol will have to stand on its own two feet and, to quote Senator Allison, `by 2012 his industry is not going to be worth very much'. If there were anything at all in this allegation, you would only have to refer to Senator Allison. She answers her own question and she obviously quite clearly agrees with the government that this so-called pattern of deceit is simply a figment of the imagination of the Labor Party, which has nothing better to do with its time and has no contribution to make to the policy debate in Australia.</para><para>I have to say to Senator Allison that on the government side we do not give up as the Democrats have apparently done. We think ethanol can be a significant industry in Australia and we want to help cane growers and others to move forward on that, and we have some money waiting for the sugar industry so that they can fully investigate things like this. But, unfortunately, the Labor government in Queensland cannot come to a conclusion that will allow us to go ahead with the regional guidance groups that I know can do so much for the sugar industry.</para><para>Senator Allison spoke about a complete ban on donations to political parties. It is a nice thought, but I can guarantee you something, Senator Allison: the Labor Party will never countenance that so long as they can call upon the unions for these huge donations at every election campaign. So long as they can count on the rort at Centenary House to prop up their bank accounts every election time, they are never going to agree with that. The Labor Party, as well as having two sources of income, from the unions and from that Centenary House rort, also embark upon the bullying tactic with business in this country. They do as they do in this chamber so very often: vilify individual businesses until those businesses feel that they cannot donate to anyone or that they have to make equal contributions to the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. I do not particularly worry about that, but can you imagine what would happen if we asked the union movement for some fairness and for an equal contribution from them? If the Labor Party were serious about those things they would give away the rort that is Centenary House. </para><para>But I digress from the issue of our policy on biodiesel and ethanol. I want to go back to it and have a look at the Labor Party's track record on ethanol and biodiesel. Again Senator Allison hit the nail on the head— inadvertently, I think—because she was saying that there was an 18c a litre subsidy for ethanol and there was no excise at all, and she thought it was bad that that situation had finished. I go back to my interjection to Senator Allison: who actually introduced that policy? Who gave the ethanol industry those very substantial subsidies for which the coalition is now being accused of not even repeating but going about halfway there? The person who introduced those subsidies to the ethanol industry was none other than Mr Crean in his role as the then minister for primary industries. I cannot understand where the Labor Party are coming from. Their hypocrisy on this particular issue knows no bounds.</para><para>This debate has been laced with accusations of political donations, and the Labor Party have been fairly big to point out some donations that have been made by the Manildra Group to the National Party and the Liberal Party. But until recently they completely forgot about the donations that the Manildra Group had made to the ALP: $50,000 in this financial year, $50,000 to the national secretariat of the ALP in 2001-02 and $10,000 to the ALP in Victoria in 2001-02. Manildra Flour Mills, an associated group, gave $11,000 to the ALP national secretariat in April 2001 and $15,000 to the national secretariat in September 1998. I assume, from what I hear around the traps, they paid $10,000 in November 2001—just before the election, interestingly—to have a discussion with Mr Beazley. I understand that they could not speak to Mr Beazley so they got the second prize, or perhaps the dunce's prize: they got to speak to Mr Crean for that amount. Then of course they followed that up with a donation of $45,455 in October of the same year. Obviously these facts never came out until the Labor Party were forced to admit this and then to make a token repayment. If the Labor Party are so pure about those repayments we would like to see the rest of the $191,455 returned. And if they are going to be that pure about it they should also stop the rort that is Centenary House and cancel that lease agreement with the Australian National Audit Office.</para><para>The Prime Minister has, on so many occasions, so very clearly explained his position it does not need me to repeat it or to re-explain the actual situation. Any fair and independent observer would accept the Prime Minister's responses, and that is that his comments at the time referred to Brazilian imports. I think the whole tenor of the record clearly shows that, so we do not need to go into that. Regrettably I am not going to have the same amount of time as other speakers; I had quite a bit more that I wanted to say. But the thing that really does concern me about wasting the Senate's time on this debate when we could all have been doing some legislation, some more productive things, is that nothing new has come out of the debate in the last 2½ hours. One would think that if the Senate were going to embark upon this talkfest it would only do it if there was a new allegation to be made, something that had to be revealed that would take the debate forward. But all we have got from the Labor Party is a rehash of the vilification and personal abuse that now so often passes for Labor Party policy in this place.</para><para>We as a government want to do sensibly what we can to help regional Australia, to help agricultural industries, and to do that in one instance—and we do it in a lot of ways—by trying to help the ethanol industry. I know that Mr Truss, the agriculture minister, is very keen, as I am, to see if there is a way that we can push the ethanol industry forward and to get it to a stage where it can stand on its own two feet commercially so that it will be sustainable into the future. I would call upon people such as Senator Allison, who I think has the genuine interests of ethanol and biofuels or alternative fuels at heart, to join with the government in promoting some of these issues and to join with me in expressing that the Senate is appalled at the way the Labor Party have deliberately set out to destroy the ethanol industry. They pay no attention whatsoever to the jobs that have been lost and will continue to be lost. They have no interest whatsoever in the lack of development in regional areas, of the businesses in regional Australia that will go to the wall because of their campaign against ethanol. All they are interested in is trying to seize upon any opportunity that they can use to pinprick and to try to score a political point against the coalition government and against a man that I think all Australians would join me in saying we are proud to have as our Prime Minister. Our Prime Minister is a world leader. He has done a magnificent job for this country. The Labor Party cannot match him so all they do is embark upon invective, criticism and vilification to try to take down one of Australia's great leaders. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Alan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Ferguson)</inline>—Order!

That attention is focused of course around the issue of housing affordability—or, slightly more accurately, the lack of housing affordability and the absence of affordable and accessible housing particularly in areas where jobs and services happen to be. </para></talk.start><para>The McClure report—the report the government commissioned into welfare reform done by Patrick McClure from Mission Australia—highlighted that housing is fundamental to opportunities in all other aspects of life whether employment opportunities, educational opportunities or social opportunities. If people are not able to access appropriate and affordable housing where they need it then even in that first step there is often a fundamental barrier to people's ability to grasp some of the opportunities that we seek to ensure all Australians have access to.</para><para>It is particularly critical at the moment as the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement has just been gazetted and tabled in this place. There are aspects of that that the Democrats are certainly concerned about, not least what we believe to be the inadequate overall funding amount. Public housing is something that has not got a lot of attention in the recent debate about housing affordability, but it really should. The Productivity Commission has been commissioned to do an inquiry into aspects of housing affordability, but only for first home buyers. I think that is far too narrow an aspect. It quite clearly needs to look at affordability for people trying to buy a second home or a third home when moving from one home to another as they get a larger family or change jobs perhaps and move interstate. So it is not just the first home buyers that are having problems with affordability. </para><para>Similarly, the private rental market is a major problem in relation to affordable and accessible private rental. The vacancy rates in some parts of the country, not least in my home town of Brisbane, are very severe, and accessing reasonable rental housing is getting extremely difficult. Even in other parts of the country where the vacancy rate is a bit higher, a lot of that vacancy is in the high end of the rental market, particularly in some of the inner-city units and apartments that have flourished of late. That is where the vacancies are and that is not much use if you are on a small income and simply trying to find a place to live.</para><para>The Productivity Commission, or its forerunner, the Industry Commission, did examine public housing in a report some time back, in the early 1990s. It highlighted—and I think it is an important finding, particularly for a body that is often seen as a strong advocate of economic rationalism—the efficiency of money being spent on public housing in terms of dollar-for-dollar value in delivering affordable housing for people that need it. I think the move away from public housing that has occurred throughout the country—and this an issue too for state governments—is a real problem and is a contributing factor to the problem we are facing now. </para><para>There are many contributing factors. A lot of people are trying to suggest that it is only one thing. The government likes to suggest that it is all the stamp duty that the state governments are charging. Others might suggest that it is all due to negative gearing at federal level. Certainly those issues are important; they are all factors, but there is no single solution. Stepping away from public housing is making that problem more difficult. </para><para>This week we have seen the Treasurer a couple of times in question time gloating quite loudly about the immense amount of money that has been provided through the first home buyers scheme. I would have to say that, whilst that is welcome, it is not targeted at all. It is not even properly scrutinised to make sure that it is being applied legitimately. There was more money spent on the first home buyers scheme last year than was provided for public housing throughout Australia and I think that is a misdirected priority. I am not saying the first home owners scheme should be scrapped, but I am saying that we need to look at value for money in getting outcomes for people in terms of affordable housing, and that is not being delivered at the moment. We have to look to some of the drivers at national level that are making the market so full of investors that they are driving up the price. Housing has to be about providing people with a place to live, well before being a chance for people to make money.

There are many areas in this 2003-05 report that I could choose to focus on, but I want to focus on the decline in the numbers of Indigenous people who have entered higher education. This report is further testimony to those numbers and proves that the government is doing very little to arrest that decline. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think I might have mentioned in estimates this year that I was somewhat disappointed that the government's objectives in relation to policies for higher education did not include one dot point at all that went anywhere near ensuring equity and access to higher education. I notice that, of the five dot points in the introduction on page 1 of this report, the word `equity' is still not there; although there is a heading dotted throughout the report that somehow would seek to have it included. It is unfortunate that one of the overarching objectives of this government does not include access, equity and participation by equity groups, or ensuring that there is equity in that participation.</para><para>It is interesting to note that, unlike the reports in other years, on page 20 of this report there is a graph that shows the number of students from equity groups in higher education. Some may well remember that, in previous years, this did not include Indigenous students. This year those students are again not represented in this graph, but they do have their own particular graph on page 24. If you look at that graph, it confirms what we have known for a long time—that is, from 1999 onwards, there has been a decline in the number of Indigenous students entering higher education, with very little recovery in those numbers. We know that decline coincides with the major changes to Abstudy that occurred around that time. The figures prove to us that the changes had a major impact in the number of students who undertook, and chose to take up, higher education. I wonder if this group of students was in the higher education report that was to be released in the last week and whether they are another group of students whose figures were blotted from the copybook because we should not know about them. The government's own report says:</para><quote><para>It was noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Higher Education Report for the </inline><inline font-style="italic">2002 to 2004 Triennium</inline>—</para></quote><para>which is the report preceding this one—</para><motion><para>that in 2000 there was a 15 per cent fall in the number of Indigenous students—</para></motion><para>so the government is actually admitting that is the case—</para><quote><para>commencing higher education, and an 8 per cent fall in the total number of Indigenous students. The situation stabilised between 2000 and 2001 and has now recovered to some extent.</para></quote><para>I am not entirely sure what the words `to some extent' mean. Certainly they have not recovered because of any proactive policies of this government. There are some initiatives in the latest higher education package, but they go nowhere near addressing the problem. The Indigenous support funding program is outlined on page 72, and I notice there are only about nine universities that get an increase under that program, which is based on the numbers of Indigenous students in higher education. So if the overall number of students is declining, of course the amount of money in the Indigenous support funding program will decline.</para><para>On many occasions I have called on this government to change the way in which that program is funded, because as long as you have declining student numbers you will have a decline in the money going into the program. It is almost a downward spiral; you will never increase the numbers of students in higher education or support those students in completing the program—which is predominantly what we actually want to do—if there is a limited amount of funds in the bucket. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline> I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties</title><page.no>13713</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13714</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This document is a list of the multilateral treaty actions that are presently under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government.

There is another list of all the treaties, amendments and protocols, the texts of which are finalised, including treaties that Australia has signed but not yet ratified. There is yet another section on treaties to which Australia is a party but for which further action is under consideration. That is a fairly short list of only four, but there are certainly well over 50 in the second list and, as I said, nearly 40 in the first list.</para><para>I would like to draw specific attention to a couple of treaties. As senators would know, the parliament now has a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which examines treaties, usually after they have been tabled and agreed to by the government. We have 15 days to examine those. As I have said repeatedly, that was a welcome development and a good initiative of this government when it came into office, but it could improve further, particularly in those areas where there is pending treaty action, or action happening but not finalised. The committee could get more involved in examining those issues while they are still under negotiation rather than after the fact.</para><para>There is a particularly important one listed here, which I think does need attention drawn to it, in amongst the treaties that are under negotiation at the moment. Most of them, on the surface, appear to be quite positive ones. Negotiations are expected to conclude in January 2005 on the General Agreement on Trade in Services, which is about `progressive liberalisation and market access', to use the terminology here. Negotiations to review GATS are currently under way. That is happening through the states and territories consultative group on GATS, which I presume is a government-to-government forum. That is one area where it would be appropriate to have a proper examination of the consequences well before negotiations conclude.</para><para>It is for that reason the Australian Democrats successfully moved to have the issue of GATS and indeed the US-Australia free trade agreement considered by a Senate committee, and that committee is currently undertaking an examination of these issues. But it should be, I believe, more automatic for significant treaty actions to be able to be flagged and investigated by the treaties committee some time in advance. We saw recently with the Singapore-Australia free trade agreement some problems in the committee due to the fact that it had pretty much been agreed to before we saw it and there was actually enacting legislation going through this place before the committee had finished its inquiry. That is not preferable and, with something as important as GATS, about which I imagine all senators would know there is widespread community concern—a lot of it, I believe, quite justified— we need to try to make sure that there is proper public examination of the issues well in advance rather than simply seeing what the end product is after the government has agreed to it, when it is obviously much more difficult to get changes made.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>13715</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following order of the day relating to government documents was considered:</para><para>Independent Soccer Review Committee— Report into the structure, governance and management of soccer in Australia, April 2003.

It is quite a comprehensive report into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the South Pacific. There are a lot of aspects to the report and a lot of interesting and important recommendations in there, and I congratulate the committee on its work. I was not a member of that committee, but the relations we have with Pacific island nations is certainly an interest I have.</para></talk.start><para>I noted that Senator Sandy Macdonald in speaking to this report the other day thought he would have a shot at my colleague Senator Ridgeway about his alleged lack of involvement. Without chewing up a lot of time here, I think it was a very cheap shot, given the enormous committee and portfolio responsibilities that all Democrats senators have, not just Senator Ridgeway. I think it was a most unfair and inappropriate reflection on him and the work he puts into many committees, not least of which is the rural affairs committee that he chairs.</para><para>I particularly want to draw attention to chapter 6, which talks about Australia's political relations with Papua New Guinea and the Pacific. I have had the good fortune to attend a few forums on Pacific island issues and have met people there from various Pacific island countries, and that has helped me become a little more aware of some of the very significant and varied issues and challenges that those nations in the Pacific region are facing. The only one country that I have actually been to is the island country of Nauru, which I visited for a couple of days a week or two ago.</para><para>I note the recommendation in here that the Presiding Officers of the parliament look at developing some modified travel guidelines to facilitate the involvement of Australian parliamentarians in bona fide training and exchange programs with parliaments of Pacific island countries. I would like to strongly support that recommendation. I guess it would be easy for someone to take a cheap shot at that and say that we are just trying to find another way to get ourselves funded overseas travel. But I am sure it could be done in a way that works within existing budgets and guidelines and simply redirects some of that money towards these types of visits. I do believe that nothing really beats being able to directly meet with people to see the situation for yourself. In my visit to Nauru, although it was focused predominantly on the refugee facility on the island and trying to meet with people who were detained there, I did have the opportunity to meet with the acting president of Nauru, who was the finance minister at the time, and some other government officials and NGO people from the Nauruan community. Being able to hear directly from them about the very significant and severe problems that that nation is facing was very valuable and certainly gave me a much better appreciation of the situation they are in. </para><para>Senators may know that—and this was nothing to do with my visit—the government of Nauru changed about a week or so after I was there, and just this week a different president and different government are now in place. I think the minister I met with is now no longer a minister. These things happen from time to time and they seem to have happened quite regularly this year in Nauru, which is probably not helpful in terms of them dealing with all their problems—but that is obviously an issue for them as an independent nation.</para><para>Equally significant—in fact, far more so—was the section in this chapter on what is now called the Pacific strategy. At least, that is what the government now calls it; it used to be called the `Pacific solution'. I presume it was changed because the government now acknowledges that it is not a solution to anything very much, unless you count making hundreds of people suffer enormously at great expense to Australia as being a solution. That has now been changed to be called the Pacific strategy. It is nearly two years since that was established. The processing centre in Nauru was established on 10 September 2001, and there have been many people—well over 1,000 asylum seekers— who have gone through those two centres on Nauru. I was able to visit one of those when I was there, the Top Side Camp, and have a look at the facilities. They are certainly not up to the standard of facilities in Australia, which is probably not surprising, given that Nauru itself as a nation is in significant economic difficulty and the facilities for the islanders themselves and the conditions are not ideal, particularly in terms of water shortages, irregular power supply and some fairly dilapidated infrastructure. So in that context the fact that the camp itself is not particularly flash is probably no surprise. That is not a reflection, from my point of view, on the management of the camp, the IOM—International Organisation for Migration. I found them exceedingly helpful when I was there and very much focused on trying to do what they can to ensure the wellbeing of the detainees on Nauru, recognising, of course, that they as an organisation have no power or ability to determine what happens to these people—where they get sent or where they are allowed to go. They are really only able to focus on trying to make people's lives a little less difficult.</para><para>Certainly the lives of the people on Nauru are extremely difficult. The staff at the facility, the health workers there, made clear that 80 to 90 per cent of their work is with mental illness issues—with depression, anxiety and despair. It is very difficult for them to deal with that because the situation that the people are in is what is generating that mental illness, and that cannot be changed.</para><para>The worst scenario amongst all the people there that I encountered was of nine women, who between them have 14 children, whose husbands are in Australia on refugee visas. Not being permitted to reunite with their husbands in Australia, these women are being pressured to return to the very country and the very location from which their husbands fled, having fled—and been found to have fled—serious persecution. I think that scenario, whatever else people might think about the government's policies in relation to refugees, is simply unacceptable. To have those women and their children, most of whom are very young and who have not seen their father for three or four years—in a few cases ever—knowing where their husbands and fathers are in Australia but not being able to be with them and instead being told they have to go back alone to a country that was found to be persecuting their husbands and fathers I find simply extraordinary. The despair of those people—not just those in the camp but equally the husbands here in Australia, a couple of whom I have met—is simply enormous. The psychological trauma they are suffering just cannot be calculated. I really urge the government, even if they do nothing else, to at least look at the situation of those women and children and reunite them with their husbands and fathers here in Australia. I just cannot see any possible justification for causing such torment to people. </para><para>The committee examines the Pacific solution or the Pacific strategy in a little detail and looks at some of the expenses and costs. It is budgeted to cost another $430 million over the next four years and it has certainly cost well over $100 million already. But I was surprised—and pleasantly surprised—by a recommendation and finding contained in the report. I have double-checked it and it is a unanimous recommendation, which unanimity included the committee's government senators. Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Johnston I think were the two government members on that committee and they supported recommendation 29, which reads:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider modifying the operation of its Pacific Strategy which would allow for the removal of Nauru and Manus Province in Papua New Guinea as refugee processing destinations.</para></quote><para>That is a very significant recommendation and I welcome the fact that it is unanimous. I would prefer it to have just recommended that the government immediately move to close down the facilities on Nauru and bring people to Australia, but to get a unanimous recommendation, including from government senators, that the government consider removing Nauru as a refugee processing destination is a very significant advance, and I would like to congratulate the committee on that. I ask the government again to acknowledge the concerns of the committee and many others in Australia and act upon that recommendation. </para><para>The committee said it was `concerned that not only did the policy accentuate the perception that Australia tends to take advantage of Pacific island countries but that also it fuelled distrust amongst the Pacific island countries over Australia's mixed signals in relation to the duration of the policy in the Pacific'. The committee considers this policy in relation to Nauru to have been `detrimental to Australia's relations in the region in not adequately taking into account the potential for adverse effects in Nauru'. It is a significant finding; it is a significant recommendation as part of what is quite a comprehensive report. I believe there is no excuse any longer for leaving these people suffering in isolation, without any significant contact with friends and families, on the middle of the equator thousands of kilometres from anywhere. They should be removed from there and brought to Australia. Ideally they should be set free, particularly those women and children who have their spouses and fathers here in Australia.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>13717</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><para>Corporations and Financial Services—Joint Statutory Committee—Report—Inquiry into the disclosure of commissions on risk products.

The objective of the report was to examine and report on the quality and timeliness of the referral, assessment and approval processes under the act as well as on Environment Australia's activities to ensure compliance with the act. I do not say this very often about Audit Office reports, but I have to say with this one that I think it has failed in significant ways to perform this objective. As a report, it really does not identify what I believe are quite clearly inappropriate practices that are happening in relation to the assessment and approvals process under the EPBC Act.</para></talk.start><para>The EPBC Act was passed through this place in 1999 after hundreds of amendments from the Democrats to significantly strengthen it. Whilst the act can still be improved further—there is no doubt about that—it was a major advance in national environmental law and in the ability of the Commonwealth government to ensure environmental protection; hence the title of the act. Unfortunately, despite it being a significantly improved act, the problem lies in the implementation of it and the lack of political will from the government to actually use its powers to ensure environmental protection. There are numerous examples of this, but particularly I would like to focus on the approval process. I really believe that the Auditor-General needs to go and have another look at this, and I am giving consideration to moving a motion next week to recommend that the Auditor-General reconsider the report with a view to correcting some of the errors that I believe it contains and to look at identifying some of the more obvious flaws in Environment Australia's administration of the act.</para><para>There are clearly failings in the way the act is being administered and these should be identified. As the National Land and Water Resources Audit and State of the Environment Report have highlighted, there are serious environmental problems in Australia that require urgent attention—including biodiversity loss and the degradation of land and water resources. The EPBC Act's referral, assessment and approvals process is intended to be one of the central pillars of the federal government's response to these challenges. It is intended that the act provide a regulatory safety net for the protection and conservation of matters of national environmental significance. However, this has not been provided by this government. The audit report should have provided this parliament with details of these failings, the great majority of which would be quite obvious to people who work with some of the various proposals that get referred, assessed and approved under the EPBC. </para><para>My concerns include the department's having regard to beneficial impacts in controlled action decisions. This is where the minister or the department makes a decision that an action is a controlled action and has to be examined by the environment department because it relates to matters of national environmental significance. In making an assessment of whether or not the project should be approved it is against the act—that is, it is against the law—to take into account beneficial impacts of the action. The audit report makes reference to the fact that the minister is not permitted to have regard to beneficial impact. The report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that beneficial impacts were considered at the referral stage, which would have been contrary to the act.</para><para>I find that finding truly astounding. There are numerous instances where it is quite clear that the minister has had regard to the beneficial impacts of an action when making controlled action decisions. These include a significant proportion of those instances where the minister has decided that an action does not require approval if it is carried out in particular manner. I could give the Senate a whole range of reference numbers of decisions but in the interests of time I will not do that. The extent of the practice, and the fact that it so obviously involves a contravention of the statutory requirements, makes a mockery of the Auditor-General's conclusion that in the overwhelming majority of the cases examined the reasons for decisions by the minister or delegate were consistent with the Prime Minister's guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility and the principles of administrative law.</para><para>A simple example is applications to clear trees and vegetation from endangered ecosystems or habitat of threatened species. For example, the bull oak tree habitat is a key nesting site for the red-tailed black cockatoo. There are frequent applications to clear areas of bull oak. Repeatedly and without exception, as a side effect and part of the approval of this action, the minister requires some new trees to be planted. Presumably the bird just flies around in the air for 30 years until the trees grow big enough and become appropriate for nesting or food. Leaving aside that absurdity, the planting of trees to cover the area that has been cleared is a beneficial impact. To say that the action is approved as long as it is done in the manner specified— the planting of these trees—is clearly to give regard to beneficial impact and is a breach of the law. That is not an isolated example; it happens with infuriating regularity.</para><para>Conditions imposed on approvals must possess reasonable certainty of meaning and application. That is a basic principle of administrative law and I believe that the terms of the particular manner decisions are also an area of concern. Although particular manner decisions differ from approvals, the same principles apply. The particular manner specified by the minister must possess reasonable certainty of meaning and application. I believe the Auditor-General neglected to analyse the particular manner decisions to determine the adequacy of the manner specified by the minister. In doing so it overlooked one of the most obvious flaws in the way in which the referral, assessment and approval process is currently being administered. </para><para>Another related issue is that the particular manner decisions often refer to information that is not publicly available. This also occurs in relation to the conditions imposed on approvals. By framing decisions in this manner Environment Australia prevents members of the public from being able to monitor compliance with the act. As the audit report recognised, third parties can and do play an important role in helping to enforce compliance with the provisions of the act. Another reason that the act is a significant improvement on previous environment laws is that it provides a mechanism for third parties to monitor and help enforce compliance. But, again, if you have a government that is not interested in facilitating that, it becomes much more difficult to use effectively. If third parties are expected to perform this role then Environment Australia must ensure that third parties can monitor the terms of its particular manner decisions. </para><para>The fourth issue that the audit report fails to analyse appropriately concerns staged referrals, which involve circumstances where a person divides a single action into a number of stages and then refers each stage to the minister as a separate action. In the act this is an obvious loophole that can be, and has been, exploited by people taking actions to avoid the assessment and approval requirements. The loophole could be easily closed—not simply by amendment but even by a minister refusing to allow people to refer projects in that way. The parliament was certainly aware of this issue when the act was passed and to ensure it did not occur the term `action' was defined very broadly by the Democrats. Again, unfortunately, the minister and the department seem to be happy to interpret this much more narrowly and that should be examined by the Auditor-General as well. There are issues in terms of the provision of false and misleading information in referrals, and in terms of enforcing the act, that have not been properly examined. In conclusion, I have some significant concerns and I think it is appropriate to see if this can be re-examined by the Audit Office. I will pursue that separately but at this stage I simply seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>13720</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to reports of the Auditor-General were considered:</para><para>Auditor-General—Audit report no. 41 of 2002-03—Performance audit—Annual reporting on ecologically sustainable development.

The vision statement in their 2002 annual report reads:</para></talk.start><quote><para>To increase the downstream involvement and influence of grain producers in the marketplace thereby assisting producers to maximise their productivity and profitability.</para></quote><para>It is certainly a well-financed organisation, with net assets for 2002 showing at $344 million and cash at the end of the financial year at over $44 million. Yet, with this background, the Grain Growers Association at every forum they turn up to attempt to pass themselves off as a wheat farmers lobby group, cynically representing the best interests of the wheat growers. Some farmers lobby group they are, with $344 million worth of assets and $44 million in cash in the bank! I would ask: where does such a farmers group get that sort of money?</para><para>The truth about the Grain Growers Association is that it is the parent company of the bulk handler GrainCorp. GrainCorp has joint ventures with the internationally recognised grain merchant Cargill, the largest multinational grain trader in the world. The chairman of the Grain Growers Association is also the chairman of GrainCorp. Grain Growers directors are also GrainCorp directors. The reason I outlined this information is to show what a powerful player the Grain Growers Association is in Australia's domestic wheat market, which is a good thing. I repeat: this is a good thing—at least until they decide to misrepresent.</para><para>Their misrepresentation is threefold. Firstly, they cleverly attempt to parade themselves as a wheat farmers lobby group in name and in their vision statement. They claim to speak for the bulk of the wheat farmers. Secondly, their claim of a 13,000-strong membership is very misleading. It is a membership based on the most spurious grower representation. For example, doing a business transaction with or holding shares in GrainCorp makes you a member for life. There are no annual fees or fees at all. The most spurious contact gets you a membership. What is more, the members are inactive. Thirdly, led by their chief executive officer, the association has lobbied in Canberra, in the media and around the country for fundamental changes to the single desk under the mantra of: `We support the single desk, but'—and then they go on.</para><para>The truth is that this slick and well-resourced presentation is nothing but a guise for the interests of the grain merchants. It would not be news to any wheat farmer that the big grain merchants seek to dismantle the Australian Wheat Board arrangements and therefore the single desk. What is new is this Trojan Horse approach by the grain merchants. I bring this Trojan Horse tactic to the Senate's attention because the strategy of the Grain Growers Association has started to gather pace and credibility in some parts of the country. Admittedly, it is the same old suspects who have been against the Australian Wheat Board and their monopoly operations, but they too have now picked up the Grain Growers deceptive mantra of: `We are not against the single desk, but'—and in fact it has reached such a crescendo that you know them by their words.</para><para>The Grain Growers Association have had a series of some 22 so-called farmer workshops. The Grain Growers Association portray the workshops as having the endorsement of the Grains Council of Australia—the properly recognised farmers lobby group— and themselves as being there to discuss marketing arrangements within the industry. In reality, the meetings are subtle propaganda attempts to lure wheat farmers away from their belief in the single desk. The meetings begin with the distribution of a strategic planning paper endorsed—and, if not, paid for—by the Grain Growers Association that conveniently criticises the Australian Wheat Board and the single desk powers, I dare say just to open up debate. Further to this, the forum facilitator vigorously pushes certain lines during the meeting—for example, single desk at port and deregulation of bags and boxes along with the reconfiguration of the Australian Wheat Board International and the Australian Wheat Board Ltd. The attempt to indoctrinate does not stop there. The Australian Wheat Board have been effectively locked out of these so-called workshops. They have been refused permission to send a representative, let alone speak at all of the 22 workshops—which I would have thought was necessary at any of these forums. </para><para>In short, the Grain Growers Association is attempting to carefully manipulate the workshops to get the result it wants: to set the agenda in the government's mind. I assume that the Grain Growers Association report from the 22 workshops will be ready to submit for the 2004 wheat marketing review. We already know the report it wishes to write: if it cannot abolish the single desk, it will undermine the integrity of the single desk. However, these pretenders will hit a brick wall, because over 90 per cent of the wheat farmers in Australia will not have a bar of any change of the single desk arrangements. So there are two camps: the Australian Grain Growers Association, representing the interests of the grain merchants; and the Grains Council of Australia, representing the 45,000 predominantly family wheat farmers. Whatever adjustments may be made or may have to be made to the wheat marketing arrangements following the 2004 review, the fundamental difference between the Grain Growers Association and the Grains Council must be kept in mind for the sake of an honest debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title><page.no>13722</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13722</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about SAP, an acronym for the selective application of principle. In this country, and especially in this parliament, there has historically been bipartisan support for Australia not seeking judicial sanction of capital punishment, nor has Australia supported its use elsewhere in the world. Indeed, within the last month the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, has been to the United States to negotiate with the US government to ensure that David Hicks, an Australian citizen, does not face the death penalty. Yet, what have we seen in the reaction to the death sentence of convicted Bali bomb terrorist Amrosi? We have seen Australian political leaders, albeit with the exception of the Chief Minister of the ACT, Mr Stanhope, and the Premier of South Australia, Mr Rann, saying that they either support the death penalty or feel that it is up to the Indonesians to decide. Is that the approach that we have taken in the past? Is that the approach that we have taken if an Australian citizen is condemned to death in other countries? No, but that is the approach that we take now—the Pontius Pilate response, some would say. Collectively, we have washed our hands of our opposition to the death penalty. There can be no doubt that the actions of people who committed the bombings in Bali were crimes against humanity, but does this mean that we should sacrifice our own humanity on the public altar of vengeance? No, it does not. Thankfully, Mr Stanhope and Mr Rann understand this.</para></talk.start><para>I want to go on the record as saying that I also oppose the death penalty in all situations. You cannot be in favour of the death penalty in some situations and not in others. We cannot be opposed to it here in Australia and support it in Indonesia. A person's support for capital punishment cannot be turned on and off depending on the circumstance. There can be no greater form of cold-blooded killing than that of state sanctioned execution. When a group of individuals as a jury or a panel of judges determines that a person deserves to die according to law, they are not acting out of passion or human rage; they are acting in the clear light of day and they are choosing to take a life. This is not the way to defeat terrorism, nor is it the way to deal with other crimes. The death penalty does not stop people committing crimes. Can we really pretend that, if people are prepared to be suicide bombers, having the death penalty will deter them? Think that one through for a moment. If we catch you before you can explode your bomb, a bomb which you expect to cause your death, then is sentencing you to death actually a penalty? It is no penalty in fact. Instead, it is the reward the suicide bomber seeks. It will not stop that individual, or any others who may follow in the same path. A society that says it has the right to put to death a person according to the law does not offer any real alternative to that suicide bomber. We do not fight people who are prepared to kill by sinking to their level. Death is not a punishment for those people. They want to be martyrs and those who support the death penalty are prepared to let them achieve that. </para><para>A far greater penalty for someone who is prepared to die is to not grant them their wish. What greater punishment for the fanatic than to deny them their death wish? Let us incarcerate that person for the next 60 years or so to send a message that, before they get to die, they can reflect on the failure of their mission and the casualties it caused. What more abject failure is there than the failed suicide bomber? What stronger punishment than to deny them entry to whatever fool's paradise they think is their reward? There is no martyrdom, no quick trip to paradise; rather, the message to their compatriots becomes that, if you engage in terrorism, we will not sink to your level. We will not use your despicable methods but will fight you by upholding our humanity. We will set our humanity against your killing. We will show the world that we do not resort to killing to solve problems.</para><para>For us, peace is not the absence of war, but the rule of law—not a law based upon retribution and violence but one based upon humanity. No matter how disgraceful your acts, no matter how heinous your crime, no matter how hurtful you are to others, we will not stoop to your level. To fight you, we will hold ourselves up as a nation concerned with human rights for all. We will hold up our democratic values, our love of freedom and our belief in the rule of law. By acting in concert with our values and beliefs, we will enable people everywhere to judge us against the anarchy and violence that terrorism promotes. This is not the selective application of principle; this is about the consistent application of principle. Not for me the Pontius Pilate act of washing my hands of the responsibility. Not for me the cop-out of saying, `It's up to Indonesia.' Not for me the populist silence. The death penalty is not appropriate in any situation, full stop.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Education</title><page.no>13723</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13723</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to follow up a question raised today about Indigenous education and talk in particular about the road that lies ahead as a result of the government's proposed policy Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. Whilst my main focus is the participation of Indigenous students in higher education, I want to draw upon the effects the government's reform package will have on the entire sector. I emphasise that the effects on Indigenous students are exacerbated by their already marginalised position in the Australian education landscape. </para></talk.start><para>To my mind, the education statistics for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous young Australians are of concern, as is the debt students are having to accumulate. But in the case of young Indigenous people these statistics highlight just how much ground has to be made up if all Australians are to have equal life opportunities. Of the 410,000 Indigenous people in this country—a very small numerical figure, if we think about it— about two-thirds are under the age of 25. This means that about 240,000 young Indigenous people are under that age, and most of those are under the age of 18.</para><para>Fewer than half of the young Indigenous people who are aged between 15 and 19 are attending secondary school. As a consequence, only about 10 per cent are completing their Higher School Certificate. As for non-Indigenous Australians, 70 per cent of them are attending secondary school and about 30 per cent are completing their HSC. Almost a third of Indigenous students had no formal qualifications of any sort before they entered higher education, compared with 7.7 per cent of non-Indigenous students. In 2001 some 70 per cent of all commencing Indigenous students gained admission through special entry arrangements, compared with 24 per cent of non-Indigenous students.</para><para>It is obvious to me that these statistics have significant implications for how the policy initiatives should be structured and delivered over the short, medium and long terms. It also strikes me that higher education is playing an integral part in the education of Indigenous people. Arguably, higher education is making up for the shortfalls in primary and secondary education for Indigenous people. Indigenous education needs to be addressed as a whole rather than compartmentalised into state and federal responsibilities, yet there appears to be a lack of commitment and cooperation between state and federal policies to try to improve Indigenous education outcomes. Thankfully, Indigenous higher education institutions, to varying degrees, do understand this need and are attempting to respond.</para><para>The problems in educational outcomes need to be addressed in light of other areas of Indigenous life such as access to employment, health services and breaking out of existing cycles of poverty. It is for this reason that special entry programs for Indigenous students in higher education are important, but they can only be part of the answer to delivering better education outcomes. These programs cannot be seen in isolation. Ongoing support for the various Indigenous support centres and for Indigenous staff is vital if institutions are going to see improved retention rates of both students and staff and improved student outcomes. Indigenous support centres across universities are, frankly, feeling the pinch as a result of tighter funding by the government of higher education.</para><para>While the latest budget is likely to have a profound effect on all students, its effect on Indigenous students should not be overlooked. It will certainly compound their circumstances. The government's higher education reforms provide limited and token gestures of support for Indigenous education. They will do little to increase Indigenous people's participation in higher education and will not provide the support that is needed to improve educational outcomes. I will not go through all of the details but, whilst there are some positive initiatives in the reform package, I need to mention some particular issues which arise.</para><para>One of the key things that I would like to explore a bit more in regard to these reforms is the issue of tying funding allocations to workplace reform in Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. Not only is $10.4 million worth of Indigenous student funding tied to workplace relations but also just over $404 million worth of university funding is tied to workplace reform. If the government is committed to Backing Australia's Future, I am puzzled as to how moving to AWAs or individual staff contracts can either improve the experience of first-year university students or make teaching and research better. </para><para>The government has instituted the Australian Universities Quality Agency with the aim of raising the bar in terms of educational standards and international reputation. That is a positive step, but it appears to me that it would make a lot more sense if additional funding were tied to productivity or output, not to workplace agreements. The government has made funding contingent on an arrangement to which staff are ideologically opposed. The government says that it is creating a more flexible and effective work force, yet the logistics and practical application of its agenda would lead to the exact opposite. Asking universities to make individual staff contracts with every single staff member would be an administrative nightmare. In my view, no funding should be tied to workplace relations, and certainly not funding for Indigenous education.</para><para>Initiatives that are aimed at improving Indigenous participation in higher education not only require a holistic approach but also need support and commitment from the most senior levels of the institutions in order to succeed. It becomes increasingly difficult to rely on the present government in relation to improving educational outcomes for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, so it may be up to each university to look at its own commitment to Indigenous education and ask whether it is providing adequate support for the needs of its Indigenous students and staff.</para><para>The final thing I want to say is that I think we all accept that inroads have to be made in relation to Indigenous educational opportunities to ensure that a new generation of leaders is able to emerge and be nurtured. The cost of failure in this regard is the possibility that current problems of high unemployment, community violence and family breakdown—these being of interest to the Prime Minister as a result of violence summits that he has convened and his recent visit to Cape York—all go back to the question of the general lack of life opportunities. If we do not address that problem, it seems to me that all we will be doing is compounding even further the difficulties that many young people are experiencing within our communities but, most of all, for the generations to come.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Manildra Group of Companies</title><page.no>13725</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13725</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier today we had a debate on a notice of motion moved by Senator O'Brien which condemned the Prime Minister for his ongoing pattern of deceit—this time in relation to his dealings with Mr Dick Honan from the Manildra Group.

Manildra is the largest Australian producer of fuel ethanol, and the company was able to rake in better than 96 per cent of the ethanol subsidies paid by the Howard government last year—money from the taxpayers' pockets. That means that the Prime Minister's mate's company got $20,857,998 while the other Australian producer, CSR, got a mere $845,182. It seems that things can be pretty lucrative for the mates of the Prime Minister if this action is any guide. At the same time as the Prime Minister was giving this money to his mate, he was telling the Australian people that he did not have Manildra in his mind.
