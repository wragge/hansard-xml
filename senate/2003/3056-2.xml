There is nothing of greater value to our nation than its university system. There is nothing of greater importance to our national economy, our culture and our society than knowledge and ideas. Universities are the custodians and the generators of knowledge. This point was eloquently made by a witness to the recent Senate inquiry into this legislation. Mr Brendan Sargeant, of the Department of Defence, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Any comprehensive review of our universities should also take account of how the public universities help define what it is to be Australian ...</para></quote><para>The contributions of our public universities and the intellectuals who have researched and taught in them have been of crucial importance to how we see ourselves as Australians. I think of Manning Clark and his defining work on Australian history. I think of creative writers such as Elizabeth Jolly. I think of the art historian, Robert Hughes. I think of the painter John Bracks, who was the head of the institution that formed the nucleus of the Victorian College of the Arts. I think of Professor Graham Clark, who helped put Australia on the map in medical science with his invention of the cochlear implant, now used around the world. I think of people such as the world pioneer of IVF technology, Dr Carl Wood, of Monash University; Douglas Mawson, the famous Arctic explorer who taught at the University of Adelaide; and Australian Nobel prize laureates, including the most recent, Professor Peter Doherty, and the philosopher Peter Singer, now at Princeton. All of these people were nourished by our public universities not only as students but as teachers and researchers. They pass on ideas and knowledge to future generations. But it is not just the towering intellects and the world famous creative figures that make the achievements of our universities remarkable. We have our great public universities to thank for the teachers in our schools, the nurses, the engineers, the agricultural scientists, the doctors and the community workers—all the highly skilled professionals that keep our country's wheels in motion and contribute to its social, cultural and physical health.</para><para>Our quality of life is vastly enriched by the quality and the extent of the contributions made by our universities. It is not the first time that I have found it necessary to make remarks like these in the Senate. The opposition find it alarming that these things have to be said at all, but they do have to be said. We are entitled to ask why this government is hell-bent on destroying our universities. It wants to destroy the very environment essential for universities to act as the custodians and the generator of ideas. It wants to destroy university autonomy. Without the freedom to make academic decisions about the courses they will teach and how they will balance out their educational offerings, universities become, in principle, no more than propaganda machines of the state. </para><para>In one of the provisions contained in the Higher Education Support Bill, all the knowledge that universities produce and hand on is effectively to be sanctioned by the minister of the day. If it is not sanctioned, it will not be taught. It certainly will not be funded by the Commonwealth. This is one of the most audacious, draconian and radical pieces of legislation that has ever come before the Senate. We have seen a fair bit of mind-blowing audacity from this government, but this bill is up there with the very best of that action. The cold-blooded duplicity of the children overboard affair, the repeated attacks on the rights of workers through attempts to alter the industrial relations system and the cynical campaign of lies that led to sending Australian troops to war in Iraq are matters that are in the same league as this piece of legislation. The legislation before the Senate is duplicitous. It pretends to cut red tape—to free up universities—when it actually binds them hand and foot. This bill, if passed by the Senate, would allow the minister or officers of the department to enter universities, to search their filing cabinets and their databases and to interrogate their staff.</para><para>Last week, at the eleventh hour in this debate and with his back firmly against the wall, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, offered up a series of petty, token concessions in an attempt to appease and win over the vice-chancellors, whose outrage at the bill's unprecedented potential powers grows by the day. Dr Nelson's concessions go nowhere near any of the big ticket items identified as the major flaws by those same vice-chancellors. This bill is a cynical attempt to bring our public universities to heel. It treats them like any commercial peddler of off-the-peg courses, and ignores their traditions of independence and their status as statutory entities. </para><para>If we examine dispassionately the pathetic attempt by the minister to save the reform package a few things will become evident. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has identified threshold issues—five major aspects of the bill—it claims have to be changed before this bill should be passed. The opposition agree that there are big issues and that these five are among them, but there are many others of equal importance. Let us consider the vice-chancellors' five big issues. In a statement dated 14 November, after Dr Nelson had released his list of 27 paltry paper concessions, the AVCC president, Professor Schreuder, provided this inventory of substantive issues. He said that the interest rates on loans for full fee paying students through to fee help should be removed. He said that the HECS repayment threshold must go to $35,000, which is in line with Labor's position, as set out in our policy document `Aim Higher'. He said that funding for equity programs must increase by $50 million next year, and must grow to $150 million within three years. He said that the number of funded scholarships for disadvantaged students must be doubled and that an additional $404 million in funding for the core teaching programs of universities must be untied from the government's proposed, unworkable industrial relations reforms.</para><para>These points are on top of the concerns that the absence of indexation has raised, which was presented by the vice-chancellors in June. Labor could not have said it better ourselves. This package increases inequality of access, especially for the disadvantaged. It imposes unreasonably heavy debt burdens on an increasing proportion of students. This package would force upon universities a harsh and unprecedented industrial relations regime, the likes of which we have never seen in Australia's university history. Not one of the major issues identified by the vice-chancellors has been picked up in the list of trifling, nitpicking amendments put forward with such fanfare by the government at this point. What we have been offered instead are a few paltry concessions. Dr Nelson has attempted to buy off the vice-chancellors, who ought to have the key responsibility as the temporary custodians of our great public institutions. I would be very surprised if the vice-chancellors ultimately do not fulfil that obligation. Equally, I would be very surprised if the Senate is bought off by such paltry concessions. </para><para>We have a revocation of the measure concerning the recognition of higher education providers, which will take place only after the period of disallowance has expired. Instead of four months to submit their financial statements, universities will now have six months, which it is at present. In determining the allocation of Commonwealth funded student places, the minister will be told to consider the views of institutions. There will be a removal of what he calls `unnecessary requirements'—they are unspecified but referred to as being unnecessary—`surrounding the management of scholarships and fee help'. These are all paltry concessions. On the strength of this list of trivia, we are supposed to pass this bill. </para><para>The minister has also used the opportunity to clear up a couple of major drafting errors in the legislation. For this, I think the Australian public should be suitably grateful. The irony is that it took a Labor-instigated Senate committee to identify some of these howlers. Remember that this is legislation the government said was perfect. This is legislation we were told we should be `ticking and flicking'. This is legislation that fundamentally alters the relationship between the Commonwealth and the universities and between the universities and the states. We were told that this was all perfect; yet the government now says that there are major problems, which it puts down to over-enthusiastic public servants. The government—we can only assume that it was done unwittingly; but they are not quite certain on that point—prohibited universities from enrolling overseas students as opposed to domestic students at the level of 50 per cent in any one course. Dr Nelson assured us that it was not his intention to forcibly curtail the profitability of universities' international education activities; that he could not support that. But it is in the bill put before us—the perfect legislation!</para><para>It is hard to see how the government, with an army of resources at its disposal, could make such a hash of drafting this set of bills. A lot more will be revealed through the processes of this chamber. The government's amendments go nowhere near far enough. They tinker at the edges of an edifice so badly built that it threatens to collapse. The bill contains the seeds of its own destruction. As Professor Brown said, `It's unsustainable.' This bill proposes to introduce a regime so interventionist in the internal and proper academic decision-making processes of universities that it astonished most of the vice-chancellors. Even that long-time and hardened supporter of the current government's higher education policies, Melbourne University's Vice-Chancellor Professor Alan Gilbert, referred to these intrusive provisions as:</para><quote><para>An interventionist regime of the kind we have not seen before in Australian higher education.</para></quote><para>Professor Gilbert was referring to the powers that the minister would have, if the bill were passed, to determine what went on at his university and at other universities. Sydney University, headed by Professor Gavin Brown, is another sandstone university, like the University of Melbourne, that stands to do very well out of the competitive market environment being proposed. On the topic of government intrusion, Professor Brown said in his submission to the Senate committee: </para><quote><para>There is an overly tight straitjacket for the distribution ... of government subsidised university places.</para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>There is an excessive degree of control inherent in the discipline mix, with the potential for gross intrusion upon university autonomy, academic freedom and student choice.</para></quote><para>These comments are arresting in their vehemence, coming from usually mild-mannered vice-chancellors. They also highlight the plain fact that the government has been hoisted with its own petard. My colleague Jenny Macklin has pointed out that the very nature of the proposed new higher education funding model—the Commonwealth Grants Scheme—forces the minister to intrude, in this entirely inappropriate manner, on what universities teach.</para><para>The new model is based on funding by `discipline clusters'. Funding varies by cluster. Now, by contrast, under the existing funding arrangements, universities are funded essentially on the average cost of a student place at a flat rate. They are free to shuffle their student numbers around within that average funding level of about $11,000 per student. Under the proposed new arrangements, they will be funded about $1,500 for a law student and $15,000 for a student of agriculture. If they try to move their student load within their overall allocation and teach more agriculturalists and fewer potential lawyers, the costs to the Commonwealth would blow out, perhaps by many millions, unless the minister has the power to veto and approve these decisions.</para><para>That is why the intrusiveness of the minister's role is at the heart of this bill. That is why Labor wants to see it amended to remove the detailed funding model based on clusters. The system we have now allows for flexibility and for institutional autonomy. It must be retained, unless we can offer something better. What Dr Nelson offers so far is far worse, as Professor Gilbert, Professor Brown and 20 other vice-chancellors or their deputies who have all given evidence to the Senate committee on these issues have indicated.</para><para>The Senate committee identified another issue that goes to the absolute core of this legislation, and, therefore, to the fundamental problem facing Australian universities: the abject failure of the government to provide for an adequate system of indexation for Commonwealth funds. Labor, in 1996, introduced a temporary index for what we now call operating grants—a temporary measure that, to provide some allowance for wage and salary increases, used the IRC's Safety Net Adjustment. This measure was intended as a stop-gap until the ABS had completed development of a new wage cost index. In 1997, the ABS published the new wages index, but the Howard government refused to replace the temporary safety net measure in the university funding index. That refusal has cost our universities well over half a billion dollars. Now the government refuses to introduce a sane and reasonable indexation measure and instead wants to make students bear the burden of all future cost increases through increased tuition costs. They will have to be paid either through increased HECS charges or through the expansion of full fee places. Either way, the students will have to pay.</para><para>The very heart of the government's reform package is sick. It is sick to the core. No amount of tinkering with minor provisions will cure it. The Senate committee, having received 486 submissions and heard from 147 witnesses, recommended that the bill not be given a second reading. As the committee said:</para><quote><para>Important features of the nation's higher education system are being fundamentally reshaped and redefined by the Higher Education Support Bill. Such a radical assault of the fundamentals of the system was not foreshadowed nor discussed during the review process. The sector and the broader community do not support discarding university autonomy and academic freedom. </para><para>These bills will initiate a regime which will shift costs to students. It will stifle student choice and impose a heavy burden on families. These bills will deepen inequities in society, and undermine economic and social prosperity.</para></quote><para>The committee goes on to conclude that, should the Senate nevertheless agree to give the bills a second reading, `substantial amendments' would be required. The alterations that are required go to the very heart of the bill: a radical shift of responsibility for financing increased funding for the sector onto students themselves through higher HECS fees; the abrogation of the government's responsibility to fund planned expansion of higher education through increased Commonwealth funded places, replacing them instead with expansion based on full fee-paying places alone, of up to $100,000 for a degree; the fatally flawed funding system, the Commonwealth Grants Scheme; the draconian industrial relations provisions that the government wants to introduce as a condition of grant increases; and the unprecedented intrusion on universities' proper academic decision making powers and, consequently, their intellectual role in Australian society.</para><para>At the start of this speech I listed a number of Australian luminaries and icons who studied, taught and researched in our universities. Those from that august list who are no longer with us would turn in their graves; some of those who are well and truly still with us have spoken out. Take, for instance, Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, who was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 19 November as saying:</para><quote><para>... our public universities are not adequately funded ... Innovation in many areas now starts from the high-level knowledge base that is provided by a good university education ... This country will not continue to prosper if we fail to provide adequate support for public education, at every level.</para></quote><para>The names and achievements of the great Australians who have been nurtured by, and who have in turn nurtured, our university system live on past their deaths. They transcend the age in which they lived. Then UNESCO Director-General, Federico Mayor, said in 1997:</para><quote><para>... if we create market universities run purely on market principles, they may be of their age but they will not be able to transcend it.</para></quote><para>During the committee stage of this bill Labor will introduce a large number of amendments designed to salvage what, if anything, can be saved—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—Senator Carr, your time has expired.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move the second reading amendment standing in my name on sheet 3187.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate deplores the fact that important features of the nation's higher education system are being fundamentally reshaped and redefined by the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and that such a radical assault of the fundamentals of the system was not foreshadowed nor discussed during the review process; and notes:</para><para>(a)	further shifting of the cost of university education onto students and their families by allowing the Higher Education Contribution Scheme to increase by 30 per cent and doubling the number of full-fee paying places;</para><para>(b)	that the education sector and the broader community do not support discarding university autonomy and academic freedom; </para><para>(c)	that these bills will initiate a regime which will shift costs to students, stifle student choice and impose a heavy burden on families; and</para><para>(d)	that these bills will deepen inequalities in society, and undermine economic and social prosperity”.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17476</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that the Australian Democrats believe that the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> are fundamentally flawed and that they threaten the sustainability of the higher education sector as a whole. We believe that these bills represent the largest single attack on higher education in Australia in our country's history and, for that reason, all senators will be opposing these bills at the second reading stage.</para></talk.start><para>The focus in this package is not on improving educational outcomes but on market ideology. The proposed changes would see increased stratification in the sector and, more broadly, within our society as a whole. The recently released AMP.NATSEM report titled <inline font-style="italic">Income and</inline><inline font-style="italic"> w</inline><inline font-style="italic">ealth of generation X</inline> provides a timely and salutary example of how undertaking tertiary study impacts on students and their future lives through reducing rates of fertility and even home ownership. The government's proposals today would only worsen that impact on students and graduates.</para><para>Even the AVCC has acknowledged that these bills need substantial reform if they are to be even considered. Mind you, I think the AVCC has been blackmailed by a government that refuses to invest appropriately in higher education, saying that the only way they will get additional funding is through this process which sees not only coercive workplace practices attached to additional funding through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme but also the increase of fees and charges—that is, cost shifting to students. But the AVCC is far from unanimous in its view that these bills should be passed at all. One vice-chancellor from an outer metropolitan university told my office that the reforms outlined in Backing Australia's Future<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>would `kill us'. A vice-chancellor from a regional university told us that the transitional and regional funding were `chocolate-covered euthanasia pills'. Vice-Chancellor Gilbert said that the legislation represented `an interventionist regime of the kind we have not seen in Australian higher education' and, of the minister's reform agenda, `Australian higher education, sadly, will be better off without it'. Vice-Chancellor Brown said:</para><quote><para>The proposals in this package are not sustainable in the medium to long term and there will continue to be an inbuilt degradation factor ...</para></quote><para>Vice-Chancellor Chubb, who once again showed his leadership qualities when he signed an enterprise bargain with his staff recently—one that did not meet the industrial relations requirements set out in this bill—said: `I think the [new workplace] guidelines were too intrusive and I couldn't see anything in them that could actually improve the ANU.' So, that is vice-chancellors speaking.</para><para>General and academic staff of universities are under no illusions. A week ago, the National Tertiary Education Union said: `The NTEU will oppose any bill that allows universities to increase HECS by 30 per cent. The NTEU believes that major changes are needed to the proposed Commonwealth Grants Scheme to ensure that universities receive more funding. The union is also totally opposed to capping the amount of time that students are entitled to a Commonwealth-subsidised place, as this is inequitable and counter to the need for lifelong learning.' So, the message from intellectual drivers of our nation and the staff of universities is clear. </para><para>The message from students and aspiring students, who have the most to lose, is clear too. Universities exist to teach and train students in their chosen discipline. They are the future of our nation. But students are already feeling the burden of HECS debts—and others—in this country. They are the ones who know what it is like to stand in the aisles of an overcrowded lecture theatre and the ones who have to drop out of university because of massive debts and a lack of improvement in student support measures. They are the ones who are going to shoulder this burden if this legislation passes the Senate. I would love to do a straw poll of how many senators in this place have a HECS debt. How many senators paid HEAC or HECS? How many of you paid full fees? I think it would be an interesting comparison to what students of today are paying and what they face if this legislation passes. </para><para>CAPA has said: `If this legislation is passed, university autonomy is dead. Backing Australia's Future is all about ideology and pays only lip-service to quality. We agree with the Senate report's recommendation that it be consigned to the dustbin of history.' NUS said on Wednesday that the Senate must not allow this legislation to be passed. Instead, the government should be made to go back, dig into its $7 billion budget surplus and come back next year with a real plan for sustainable and equitable expansion of higher education. Hear! Hear! The message is clear.</para><para>This package fails to address the crises in which our universities have been since the early 1990s, largely the result of poor indexation of grants by both Labor and coalition governments. Since 1995 the indexation shortfall has been estimated at $600 to $700 million, and the government has already cut $5 billion from university grants, thereby basically bringing about this crisis. In this legislation, there are no proposals and no solutions to the problem of indexation, which remains the outstanding issue. Evidence of the cost shift can be found in the 2003 OECD report <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance</inline>, which found that, between 1995 and 2000, Australia's public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent—more than any other country in the OECD—while the average OECD growth was 21 per cent.</para><para>Professor Bruce Chapman told the Senate inquiry that government funding for higher education has fallen from 85 per cent in 1987 to just over 45 per cent in 2002 in relation to course costs, but still the minister insists that the government is paying 75 per cent of the costs, so 25 per cent is being met by students. Yet student fees have doubled, fee-paying arrangements for undergraduate places have been introduced and student debt is more than $9 billion. The government is proposing to fund this growing shortfall by exacerbating the cost shift by allowing universities to charge our students more. The HECS increases that are outlined in these bills mean students will pay, on average, from 44 up to 56 per cent of their degree. We have among the highest fees and charges in the world for public universities. This is not a contribution scheme. It is well beyond that.</para><para>Minister Nelson also wants to increase the number of full fee paying undergraduate places to 50 per cent for all courses, unless he feels that a course should be 100 per cent full fee paying. It is up to him. Senator Carr has alluded to this extraordinary level of discretion. Students paying full fees will pay 3.5 per cent interest plus CPI on their loans. Already, a full up-front fee Bachelor of Veterinary Science at the University of Queensland will cost $148,000 in 2004. Full up-front fees for some courses have risen by 40 per cent since 1998—pretty good, if you are rich! These fee hikes will price many students out of higher education. ACOSS, along with much international research, has identified debt aversion as a real factor in students deciding whether or not they will participate in higher education. They conclude that this package will further lower the participation of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, who are of course among the most debt averse. </para><para>Student debt—more than $9 billion in this country now—has been shown to have some serious life-changing effects on students. The AMP.NATSEM report, which was published this year, reinforced CAPA's research paper into the social and economic impact of student debt. It found that one of the main reasons Australians born between 1961 and 1976 are delaying starting a family is their large HECS debts. So debt is having an impact on fertility rates. Home ownership among the 1989 to 1999 generational group fell by 14 per cent. Apart from the decline in the fertility rate and the decline in home ownership, the migration of students is also increasing. Students are migrating to avoid paying their debts. There is also the inflationary impact as graduates have even higher levels of debt: it then starts to push up salaries and other charges. This government is not concerned about the broad impact that this legislation will have on Australians. Since the government scrapped the Higher Education Council, the public have been reliant on research from other quarters, because we do not have independent government funded research any more.</para><para>The partial deregulation of higher education will also have negative effects on equity groups. The government is not even waiting for prices to rise as a result of its policy; it is now actively encouraging universities to put up their fees by up to 30 per cent. Those universities who have access to numerous affluent students will be able to take advantage of this price flexibility and the increases in the allowable percentage of full fee paying undergraduate courses. The University of Sydney has already indicated that its prices will rise by 30 per cent as soon as this legislation is passed.</para><para>However, universities with low SES and low population catchments, such as regional, rural and some outer metropolitan universities, will not be able to exploit the full fee paying student or increased HECS market to the same extent. Along with having negligible additional government supported places, these universities will also be the ones most restricted in their growth. A huge funding differential will exist, and a binary university system will once again be created. The double impact of this policy on those low socioeconomic areas will be that any fee increases implemented by an institution—in an attempt, of course, to have funding parity with another university—will actually further exclude that debt averse low-SES group of students. Poor kids will miss out. That is the bottom line of this legislation.</para><para>Under increased market pressures, universities will cut courses that do not return enough income. We know that this has happened already, particularly in regional institutions. They will focus on their strengths and thus reduce the diversity of courses available to students. Already revenues from international and postgraduate fees are being injected into marketing, the recruitment of international students and offshore campuses. When the focus of a university moves from education and research to raising funds, the substantial non-market activities of the university suffer—particularly disciplines like physics, chemistry, maths, languages, history and philosophy. It should be about the search for truth, not the search for funds.</para><para>The government has also taken a strongarm approach to industrial relations and governance reforms by universities, tying to $404 million of funds some incredibly coercive workplace practices. The forced introduction of AWAs, the removal of the cap on casual staff numbers and the removal of existing arrangements deemed to be in excess of community standards will all cause further deterioration of the effective staff-management relationship and scholarly community that currently exist within our institutions. This will also have an impact on students' learning experiences. </para><para>The governance requirements include limiting the size of university governing bodies to 18, removing politicians from councils and forcing all members to act solely in the interests of the university. But the government has not specified what the university's interests are, who should define them or, indeed, what is so significant about this magical number 18. The Democrats are concerned that, in defining a university's interests, a person or persons may provide greater powers to themselves than to other members of the board. But the government's ideological agenda is perpetuated through a vast array of ministerial discretion, which includes the ability to determine what a university is, how much a university will receive, the conditions attached to that funding and, indeed, which courses are run at which universities. No wonder the VCs say that this is unprecedented interference.</para><para>The student support measures in this bill are miserly. They are pathetic. There are five scholarships for Indigenous university staff to undertake postgraduate study. Five for the whole country? That equals about one-eighth of a scholarship per university. The new Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships will cover about 17 per cent of Indigenous and low-SES students, and the Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarships will reach about 20 per cent of commencing rural students. The Student Learning Entitlement presents many problems, particularly for students attempting to retrain or to upgrade their qualifications, as they will not be supported once they have exhausted their five-year basic entitlement. For example, nurses who wish to become midwives, or science graduates who wish to become teachers, could be deterred by the prospect of future interest-bearing loans. This will be a particular deterrent to those who are in professions that have a relatively low starting income as they will thus have a longer repayment period. The Student Learning Entitlement scheme will destroy lifelong learning and it must be deleted from the legislation.</para><para>The government claims that it wants these bills passed in this sitting period. Yet it has neither released all the details of the package nor explained to the universities how they will be adequately funded—although we do not know whether those details are likely to improve the situation. The minister has tied $404 million of funding to strict industrial relations practices and governance requirements. I have already said that this legislation contains a lot of ministerial discretion. So there is a theme here—a theme of government control through direct ministerial control and through making funding reliant on obeying government orders. The minister still denies that there will be losers under this legislation. What about the Victorian College of the Arts? It stands to lose 35 per cent of its funding, without any transitional funding, and has been provided with no reassurance as to how much transitional funding it will receive.</para><para>Many universities are still unclear as to how this legislation will affect them. JCU, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, stated: </para><quote><para>... it is not possible to gauge accurately how each of these measures will affect individual institutions ... </para></quote><para>Melbourne University told the inquiry that it had not performed detailed modelling as it was not possible because of the variables in the funding mechanisms. We are still waiting to see the complete guidelines, which enact most of this legislation and the redistribution of the 25,000 places. They have not been finalised! That is the kind of detail we should be discussing today. For that reason we should not be proceeding with this debate, certainly not into the committee stage.  </para><para>With universities still in doubt over significant parts of the package and the sector widely opposed, the minister now tries to con us with eleventh hour acknowledgements of some of the more obvious public criticisms. Hopefully senators will not fall for it. The minimalist set of government amendments announced last week by the minister only go a very small way towards meeting the original promises made by the minister and improving some of the unworkable arrangements in these bills. Make no mistake: the amendments or the proposals announced by the government do not address the fundamental flaws of the legislation. </para><para>Despite the government's attempts to woo us with eleventh hour changes and its attempts to sell this legislation to the public, the views of the vice-chancellors, the academic and general staff, the students—be they undergraduate or postgraduate—and, indeed, the community are clear. If this legislation does not pass, the University of Western Sydney will not lose $16.7 million of funding in 2005 and the Victorian College of the Arts will not lose 35 per cent of its funding. Students will not be graduating owing more than $150,000 to the government and spending most of their working lives repaying that debt. </para><para>We will not have students locked out of higher education because they are poor or from rural and remote, Indigenous or disabled backgrounds if this legislation is stopped. We will not have students being locked out of education because their five-year learning entitlement has expired. If we stop this now, universities will not have to be at war with their staff in an attempt to qualify for desperately needed funding. Most of all, we will not have those parents of low-SES students telling their kids, `I'm sorry, you can't go to university because we can't afford it.' </para><para>The Democrats recognise that the future of higher education is at stake with these bills. The government's view of higher education in front of us today is one that is unsustainable and inequitable and its effects will be felt by generations to come. I am proud of the Democrat record on higher education. It is one of the reasons that I joined the party and certainly one of the reasons I am a member of the party now. </para><para>Education is an investment and not a cost. Countries and governments all around the world recognise that. Even the tories—the brother/sister party of the tories in our country: the Liberal Party coalition government—are talking about the abolition of fees to make education fairer in the UK so that students do not get locked out and so that the system is not too elite. What are we doing? We are running in the opposite direction and, at the same time, diminishing funds for the sector—a sector that had funds brutally cut from it in 1996. </para><para>The Democrats have passed laws like the Backing Australia's Ability legislation in an attempt to get better funding for the sector and to encourage innovation and development. We have worked for fairer income support measures. We have tried to stop increases in fees and charges, because we recognise the psychological and financial effects that they have on whether or not people partake in higher education. I am proud of the party's record and am not going to sell out on it. I hope no-one else does either.  </para><para>It has been too easy for this government to put up fundamentally flawed legislation in the knowledge that desperate senators—desperate for publicity and recognition for re-election and election—will fall for it. But with this legislation what are they going to offer? Get rid of VSU in exchange for token scholarships? Get rid of the threshold or increase it in return for some measly change to the legislation? Will senators really accept those token measures? No. When the government start talking about indexation, proper funding, reducing fees and better provisions for both general and academic staff—and when they start talking about a climate of innovation, development and vision—then we will talk to them. Until then, this legislation deserves to go in the dustbin, just like CAPA suggested. Under this legislation, universities, students and aspiring students are worse off. I am not going to fall for it. I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment, which has been circulated in my name, on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>17481</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to comment on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. At the outset I would like to say that, having spent all of my working life in the education industry, having been in the Senate for the last five years, having sat on the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee and having been part of two major inquiries into the higher education system—one of which concluded that the higher education system in this country was in crisis and the second report, tabled only some weeks back, suggested that this legislation should not pass—I fail to see how the government can come up with the title for these bills of `higher education support'. </para></talk.start><para>I have yet to discover, from any of the readings I have undertaken on these bills or from any of the evidence I heard from witnesses who appeared before the Senate inquiry, exactly what part of these bills support which aspects of higher education. These bills diminish the public resources in the system and support those people who have a fat wallet and can afford to pay for the higher education courses they want to undertake in the future. It would have to be one of the most anomalous names for a bill I have seen come before this parliament. </para><para>This government has introduced these bills as its perceived way of reforming higher education in this country. Right from the very beginning this government has it wrong—so very wrong—when it comes to reforming this aspect of our education sector. There has been no support for its ideas—only opposition. In fact, intense opposition has spanned the length and breadth of this country to the extent that the government is now forced to back down and to make changes to bills that were, in its eyes, untouchable. It is now looking for deals with vice-chancellors. It continues to ignore and show total disregard for the concerns of students and their families. Universities have protested at these reforms through the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Students and university staff have signalled major problems with the package on offer—a package that is unsustainable from both a quality perspective and a financial perspective.</para><para>Of course, we had the ironic situation some weeks back when we had university staff in this country taking industrial action that had been provoked by a third party—not by their bosses, not by the people who employ them at the universities, but nationwide industrial action that had been provoked by this government. It was like the Maritime Union and the wharfies dispute all over again. We have seen the attack on the building industry; now we have seen an attack on academics and general staff through the education industry. The only ones who thought they had got it right were the government, but their ideological blinkers prevented them from seeing anything but further `user-pays' and attacks on the working conditions of staff through gross interference in workplace relations as being the way to reform higher education. </para><para>In fact, the higher education package proposed by this government will make it harder for young people to get a university education. It will make it harder to get a university place. It will make it increasingly more expensive. Getting a degree will depend more on your family income than on your ability as a student. But then, what is new about all that with this government? They see it as almost right and proper that there should be the haves and the have-nots in our society. This government claims that the package will ensure quality higher education. There is nothing wrong with quality. We would support any element of this package that ensures there would be more quality in the system. We would all fully agree that quality higher education is essential for our nation. However, just how the regulation of university governing councils would achieve that is not clear in this package. How the ruthless enforcement of workplace relations, the offering of Australian workplace agreements and the increasing casualisation of staff would achieve better quality is still quite unclear to me. But that is of no worry to this government. It is part of this government's workplace relations policy to make life harder for the workers: `Let's take this chance to hit the academics now and try to sell it as a way of improving higher education as a quality package.'</para><para>What has proved clear to universities, students, families and the nation as a whole is that this package, as introduced—and as more and more of the package unfolds—is yet another government attempt to shrink the spending on public education, to put more of the cost burden onto students and families but at the same time give the government far more power to regulate and to interfere in the day-to-day running of universities, their courses and the way in which they operate. This is from a government that has overseen the decline in real terms of higher education funding, that has seen our academics slide down the international ladder in terms of salaries, that has caused the ratio of students to staff to rise to the extent that staff morale is at its lowest. The lecturers and seminars have large numbers and minimal individual attention for students. If our higher education sector has problems, then they are clearly of the making of the government. But equally clear is that this package is not the way to solve these problems.</para><para>The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee was tasked with inquiring into the principles of the higher education package—to look at the effects of the proposals on sustainability, quality, equity and diversity in teaching and research at universities; the implications of the proposals; and the effects of the proposals on issues including institutional autonomy, governance, academic freedom and industrial relations. We received over 400 written submissions. We faced and questioned and listened to over 100 witnesses that were interviewed at hearings all around the country. The committee found very little support—if, indeed, any support—for this package and for the proposed higher education changes. After the greatly delayed introduction of the actual proposed legislation into the House, many stakeholders expressed great surprise at the package requirements. Through the AVCC they held talks with the minister who sold them one story, but then the next day along came the legislation. Professor Le Grew, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania, said: </para><quote><para>What came forward initially was a package where there was some convergence and synergy between the universities ... and the government ... I might say there has been some slippage in that period of time, especially in the process of drafting the legislation.</para></quote><para>But again, this is nothing new with this government—they bend the truth to their own ends all the time. Professor Gilbert, the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, had this to say:</para><quote><para>I have a fairly strong feeling that there will be universities that will say that the impact on the quality of education we can offer if we are forced to comply with these regulations is not worth the money.</para></quote><para>The Chief Executive of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, John Mullarvey, said the government's proposals had left the sector in disarray. He said:</para><quote><para>It's a minefield for us. It's a disaster as far we can see because universities operated on a certain basis, based on the statement we sought ... on Budget night.</para></quote><para>There certainly had been unexpected changes: interference in governance, workplace relations, overall distribution of places and courses to name a few. The universities were absolutely right in being fearful of what this government was proposing. On sustainability, Professor Robson, the Vice-Chancellor at the University of West Australia had this to say: </para><quote><para>However, we are critical of the fact that it is not properly indexed and is not backed with enough resources.</para></quote><para>The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Brown, said:</para><quote><para>The proposals in this package are not sustainable in the medium to long term.</para></quote><para>These were views that were expressed quite frequently during the hearing: the package, as proposed, with no indexation is not sustainable. Mr Bradley, the President of the Murdoch Guild of Students, said:</para><quote><para>Over the past 5 or 6 years we have seen increasing student to staff ratios and decreasing optional tutorials. ... There is no doubt that the university system needs more money. What we have here is a manufactured crisis. When the Liberal Government came in, they removed X billion dollars from the system, and—surprise, surprise—it is having an effect. What we have here is an ideological bandaid with strings attached ...</para></quote><para>Professor Gardner, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the Queensland University of Technology said:</para><quote><para>... we are concerned that there may not be sufficient government funding to allow the universities to maintain the quality of their offerings and access to higher education for a broad range of students.</para></quote><para>There are serious doubts about the package offering sustainability, quality or equality of access to higher education. The President of the NUS in Western Australia said:</para><quote><para>If I did not have this scholarship, I would have questioned whether I wanted to study a five-year science and engineering degree. ... That is the case for a lot of women ... there will be a lower participation rate for women, especially in the more expensive courses. </para></quote><para>The very small number of scholarships on offer in this package will go no way towards alleviating these concerns. Five scholarships are on offer for Indigenous employees at universities around this country. Someone said to me, `It's a start.' It is not a start; it does not even get you into the starting blocks. It is not a start at all; it is a pathetic attempt to try to show some concern towards increasing the number of Indigenous people who work in our universities at all levels. This package does not offer equality. Other evidence suggested that it would be very hard for Indigenous students to access higher education. Indigenous women would be the most disadvantaged. On governance and workplace relations proposals, Professor Robson, who was the acting Vice-Chancellor at UWA, said: </para><quote><para>We are totally opposed to tying funding increases to the introduction of AWAs or to being dictated to about how we can organise industrial relations within the university. </para></quote><para>Again at the University of Tasmania, Professor Le Grew said:</para><quote><para>We think our capacity to negotiate, as we do, with our staff, is compromised by an over emphasis and structures being put in place by provisions of the AWAs.</para></quote><para>All of the above quotes are taken from transcripts of the evidence before the committee and show that there was no support for the proposed package as it stands with its associated rigorous requirements. People simply could not see how such a package was going to provide funding and change that would enable our universities to catch up on the lack of funding since 1996 and to provide quality higher education to an ever increasing population of young people wanting to access university. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Hacking Australia's future: threats to institutional autonomy, academic freedom and student choice in Australian higher education</inline>—more adequately named, rather than `Backing Australia's future' under this government's proposal—will come as no surprise to anyone really in touch with university students and families in Australia. The committee found that the policy put forward by the Howard government was totally unacceptable, that universities would be subject to major and heavy regulation by the government. This would diminish their academic freedom and autonomy. They would be subject to government control and regulation on their course offerings. Access and equity would suffer. Family income would become an important determinant in whether young people could attend higher education. Women would find it more difficult to access courses which were longer or more expensive.</para><para>The committee was of the opinion that the bill proposes a radical attack on the fundamentals of higher education. The proposed bill goes way beyond what was discussed during the government's review process and this government has no such mandate, I believe, to implement any of these major changes. Under the Howard government proposals in this bill, there will be insufficient HECS places to accommodate the number of students eligible to attend university. The Howard government policy will see this position worsen as the population increases. Universities will be forced to take advantage of being allowed to raise fees and degrees will cost even more than $150,000 for those who can afford to pay. This government will also increase the number of full fee paying places so that 50 per cent of places will now go to those who can afford to pay, irrespective of their academic ability. We have already seen the University of Sydney signal that they will very quickly jump on the bandwagon and raise their HECS fees by 30 per cent. Students will leave university with a massive debt. The student debt in this country has already doubled under the Howard government and now stands at $9 billion. The long-term effects of this debt will be reduced home ownership, delayed parenthood and an increase in the brain drain. Finally, the Howard government has tied over $400 million of much needed funding in blackmailing universities into implementing extreme industrial relations conditions. </para><para>I have already spoken about the complete lack of support for the changes as proposed in this bill. The opposition from universities, through the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and protests by university staff, was shown time and time again in evidence to the Senate committee. Last Friday, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee laid down changes it believed were necessary to make the bill acceptable to universities. The minister has now proposed a raft of 27 amendments, which we are yet to see. Unfortunately for him, they are still not seen as being sufficient to make this bill workable and were described by Ross Peake of the Canberra Times as `tinkering at the edges'. The changes fall way short of what is required and, in reality, leave the universities bound in red tape and at the mercy of the minister. They are of a technical nature. The bill remains authoritarian and leaves the minister to determine what is taught. Far more fundamental change is needed in order to make this bill anywhere near acceptable.  </para><para>In the Northern Territory, both higher education institutions will lose out under the proposed reforms. When Charles Darwin University appeared before the Senate committee, they revealed that they would still be left short financially and with limited options of raising income through fees. Recently appointed Vice-Chancellor Helen Garnett said:</para><quote><para>We are grateful for the 30 per cent loading ... but in fact it provides no more dollars to us as a whole than the old system provided because the 30 per cent is based on a different underlying set of principles. ... the lack of realistic indexation is an issue for all of us ... For this university which is aiming to focus on delivering appropriate education to the region and replacing ageing equipment ... it is absolutely essential that the indexation be somewhat similar to that which is granted in schools.</para></quote><para>The Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, which is the only tertiary institute in this country that has Indigenous students only, is one of the hardest-hit universities under this package. Even figures provided by the department show that its transitional funding will require over $2 million a year for the next three years, but of course that funding is transitional and will not be there in 2008. Veronica Arbon, who is the director of the institute, had this to say:</para><quote><para>The proposed changes impact quite seriously on Batchelor Institute. The 30 per cent does not bring us back to status quo; there will be a negative impact. We do not have any room to move in relation to fees or course costs. ... 100 per cent of our students come from Indigenous Australia and probably 99.9 per cent of those come from situations of poverty. So there is no room for those students to pay fees or for us to leverage any kind of additional HECS.</para></quote><para>During the Senate estimates process I discovered that Batchelor Institute will no longer be listed as an institute that will receive anomalous funding under this package. They have been removed from this list. When I asked how that funding would then be compensated for, how Batchelor college could find any degree of comfort in what may be before them in terms of additional funding through the Indigenous support funding, I was told that it had not been worked out yet: `We can't tell you that, Senator, because those calculations have not been made.' You expect me to stand in this place this week and put my hand up to support a bill which is going to ensure that the one and only tertiary institution in this country that has only Indigenous students will be worse off to the tune of nearly $6 million under your current package, yet you cannot tell me what impact the new Indigenous support funding is going to have to ensure that this institution will not be worse off. That is a great sign of practical reconciliation from this government, isn't it, to turn its back on those Indigenous people in the Northern Territory and expect us to support this bill?</para><para>I commend to the Senate the motion that was moved earlier today by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition as a second reading amendment because this is a bill that actually shifts the costs of university education onto students and their families and it will ensure that inequalities are deepened in our society. In fact, this bill will undermine the long-term economic sustainability of our universities. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>17486</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens believe that we must not let our higher education system as we know it disappear into some kind of quagmire about user pays ideology that we are hearing from the government. If we let the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> go ahead, 10 years down the track we may well have forgotten that universities are supposed to be places of independent intellectual pursuit. This legislation is about making students, not the government, pay for the provision of higher education in this country. It is about making it easier for rich students and their families to buy their way into universities. It is about taking away workers rights in universities to collectively bargain for their employment conditions along with their trade union. And it is about taking student and staff voices off the key decision making bodies in Australia's public universities.</para></talk.start><para>The Senate committee described this legislation as being a change of a fundamental and far-reaching nature. This change that the Senate committee report was talking about is the government reneging on its responsibility to fund higher education in this country. I was looking at a dictionary of politics on the weekend and it spelt it out when it said that another word for the removal of this government funding is privatisation. That is what we are seeing in this legislation: we are seeing the privatisation of the funding of Australia's universities by shifting that social responsibility from government onto the shoulders of already struggling students and their parents.</para><para>We have already seen what the removal of government funding has done over the last two decades to universities, forcing them to turn to corporations to make up this funding shortfall and then having to deal with all the strings that are attached to corporate funding for our universities. This legislation brings more of this approach. At the same time as it does this it gives bargain basement private education providers, who do not provide a comprehensive university experience, a leg up in competing with our public universities for government and public funding. This legislation is the latest step in the government's ongoing project to privatise education in this country, and it is a barely veiled ambition that we see from this government in the area of schools, in the area of TAFEs and here today in the area of higher education.</para><para>Government senators in their comments in the Senate committee report said:</para><quote><para>There cannot be a complete reliance on the public purse to maintain and fund the expansion of the sector.</para></quote><para>They quoted in their comments in the committee report the Warden of Trinity College in Melbourne where he was lamenting:</para><quote><para>To rely again on public funding being sufficient to meet our needs would represent a triumph of hope over experience.</para></quote><para>The Greens find this government logic breathtaking. We have government members saying that their government has so underfunded public education in this country that they cannot be trusted with the future funding of education in this country. Instead, the responsibility has to be shifted onto the private sector. I would have thought that it is more usual in cases of such incompetence in adequately funding higher education in this country by the government that we should sack the mismanagers and we should deal with the underfunding of the higher education sector when new managers are brought in. That is something that the Greens will be working to do, and I hope other senators here will join us in sacking this government for its underfunding of higher education. </para><para>Minister Nelson had a different explanation for why we should privatise higher education. He said in his second reading speech that it was the vice-chancellors' fault. He said:</para><quote><para>In response to requests from every one of the vice-chancellors of Australia's 38 universities, the government has also recognised that it is important that universities respond positively to the request that they need the flexibility to determine the value of their courses and to set HECS charges.</para></quote><para>That is, that they charge students more money for the running of universities while government pulls the money out. Later in his second reading speech we get a little bit more of a look at the ideology behind this government's education package at the moment. He said:</para><quote><para>... we have some 30,000 to 40,000 students, in recognised private higher education institutions, who receive no form of public assistance whatsoever despite the fact that they are Australian taxpayers.</para></quote><para>So here we have the minister putting his case that we should put more money into private companies that are running education services in this country. Then we get the minister's user-pays ideology that he was talking about particularly at budget time, saying that students should pay more for higher education in this country. I will get to what percentage of costs students are already paying in this country for providing themselves with higher education. But all these explanations from the government, whether it be from the senators on the committee or the minister in his various speeches, all point to the same thing: this government wants to spend less public money on higher education, and it wants the cost of higher education to be on the shoulders of the students and their struggling families.</para><para>This legislation is about ensuring that that occurs. It is about encouraging private companies to compete with Australian universities for the little government funding that is left. It is about forcing students and their families into debt. This government is kidding itself if it thinks that the public is going to sit by and have a bar of its contention that the only way to save higher education is a healthy dose of economic fundamentalism: user-pays, private investment, workplace reform and the free market. Australians have seen too many disastrous privatisations to believe this sort of claptrap.</para><para>The government has tried to claim that this economic fundamentalist approach is the approach that some of our more successful competitors are taking, but this is simply not true. OECD statistics on higher education show that countries like Ireland and Sweden, who invest some of the highest proportion of public money in their public education systems, perform consistently well, whereas Australia is already—based on 1999 data—a low public investor in tertiary education. In fact, we are equal 21st out of 28 in the OECD when it comes to putting public money into tertiary education. Australia already requires a very high private investment from students and companies into higher education in this country. We are equal fourth in the OECD for private contributions that already go into Australian universities from students and companies. The OECD does not provide figures that cover access and equity achievements of higher education systems, but it does not take a genius to work out that systems like Sweden and Ireland, where undergraduates pay no fees for their degrees, are able to achieve these access and equity outcomes far more effectively than Australia and the path the government is trying to take us down. </para><para>I had an intern, an ANU student, that worked in my office earlier this year. She has now gone overseas. She spent some time at a Swedish university. She sent me a postcard about the situation at the Swedish university she is currently visiting. She said:</para><quote><para>... the standard of living here is really high and you can tell the difference between higher education systems—lots of Swedish students study single units until they decide what degree to do. As well as free education, they get a study loan so no-one has to work to support themselves. I think a lot of Australian students would be very jealous!</para></quote><para>I am sure they would, and quite rightly so. Sweden has more university graduates as a percentage of population than Australia—it has 37 per cent as against our 34 per cent. So in Sweden more people are getting a university education, but because they pay for public services through their taxes, rather than have a financial barrier for students when they want to study, they get far better access and equity outcomes. What I call access and equity is what we are seeing in countries like Sweden.</para><para>Perhaps this minister does not care about access and equity. Certainly he was talking at budget time about not encouraging students to go to university. Then we have the minister's dream to have one of the top 100 universities in the world in his little patch. Apart from the fact that these league tables or rankings do not exist, we have the minister saying that he wants one top quality, world recognised university rather than a top quality, world recognised, comprehensive, public university system. That does not sound like a commitment to access and equity to me. That sounds more like a return to elitism. And this ideology comes from a man who went to university and got not one but two university degrees for free.</para><para>There are no free degrees in this package. This package is ushering in an era of top-dollar degrees—an era where credit ratings are far more important than academic achievement when it comes to your capacity to get into university. This is already happening with full fee paying domestic students, and the situation will get even worse. I received a letter last week from a researcher from Melbourne who spelt out the situation, and I will read some of his letter. He said:</para><quote><para>Current arrangements in place at Monash University (and in other universities) allow full-fee paying students to switch to HECS places in their second year (subject to satisfactory performance). Hence full-fee paying students leap-frog the VCE/HSC entry requirements and then obtain a subsidised place in their second and subsequent years. The result is that qualified students are denied HECS places in their first year.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>The government has claimed basically that expanding the number of full-fee paying students has no effect on current arrangements—it only allows some extra students to enrol who would not otherwise have been able to study. This is not true. If universities respond to the new legislation as they already have to their existing opportunities to enrol full-fee paying students, there would be almost no HECS places available for first year students in (say) law. All the HECS places would be allocated to second and later year students. All (or almost all) first year students would be full-fee paying. The potential impact on access to, and equity in, higher education is enormous. Such arrangements already exist in one course I know of at [my university].</para></quote><para>So the government's legislation is not about access and equity, and it is not about international competitiveness. The example I just outlined from an academic gives us some idea of the sort of vision this government has for higher education. It is about students paying more money and governments not having to take on the responsibility of ensuring we have a quality public higher education system in this country.</para><para>In my travels to universities and communities in New South Wales and across the country as a member of the Senate committee, I and others on that committee did not find any support for this kind of approach. In fact, the minister may be surprised to hear that the public are generally quite attached to a comprehensive public university system that is a place where young people can go to continue their learning journey, and for that decision to be an academic one, not a financial one; where learning, inquiry and debate are fostered as ends in themselves; where the broader experience of university life is encouraged; where universities and communities can work together to achieve outcomes for their students and for their communities; and where staff are confident contributors to public debate. Those are the sorts of things that people have been saying to me and to the Senate committee as we have travelled around. This is the sort of higher education system that people want in this country, and this is the sort of vision for this country that the Greens and others have been advocating, and will continue to advocate, in this debate. </para><para>My fellow senators should not be misled by the cries from vice-chancellors to pass this legislation. It is important to understand that the only reason vice-chancellors are making these pleas is that, over the past seven years, this government has bled them of funds, leaving them begging for mercy when it comes to government funding. Someone described it to me as when a starving man accepts some mouldy bread, that should not be a recommendation to make it a national dish—which is the approach we are seeing from this government. I have had vice-chancellors in my office telling me that this is what it comes down to—desperation. That is not the way we should be deciding public policy and laws in this country, especially not public policy issues like the future of higher education. Vice-chancellors have said many times that what they really want is a solid commitment to public investment in our higher education system via improved block grants, which would be properly indexed, as they are with schools funding. If you asked vice-chancellors whether they would rather have the government's package or one which did not increase student fees but instead gave more core funding with real indexation, I do not think you would find a single vice-chancellor supporting the government's package.</para><para>Yet we know the desperate situation that these vice-chancellors are in. First the government starve universities into submission and then say, `We don't want to give you more money or be responsible for raising student fees, because that's bad politics and won't look good for us. So how about you, as universities and vice-chancellors, increase student fees and we'll let you deregulate the system so you can access a far softer funding option than Treasury—that is, students and their families.' That is nasty politics coming from this government. Now the government have the peak lobby group for public universities agitating for higher fees and for deregulation. The government have got the turkeys voting for Christmas.</para><para>The Greens will not be supporting this bill. We will not support the further privatisation of higher education by this government, we will not support the attacks on trade unions that are in this legislation and we will not support the move to elitism that is behind this legislation. This bill does not deserve to go any further: the Greens are calling on fellow senators to stop it in its tracks and to force this government to do better. I will finish with a quote from the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney:</para><quote><para>We took the view—which is a universal view in the sector—that there should be additional public funding in the higher education sector, that there should be no further financial imposts on students and that there should be not one or two world-class universities but a world-class university system. These principles encapsulated our view of the role and importance of higher education, particularly for those students whose lives have not been characterised by privilege. For those of us, particularly in the west, who have seen the transforming power of higher education, the statement that universities serve the public good is incontestable. </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17490</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to add my voice to the great chorus of dissent that has sounded in response to the government's higher education bill to further undercut our public university system. The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> could not be less aptly named. It is a bill which fails to support either our higher education institutions, the academics and staff who work in them or the students and community members who use them. The meagre amount of funding provided for by this bill is little more than a drop in the $5 billion pool that the government has callously repossessed from our universities and does not come anywhere near the level of investment needed to provide the people of Australia with a bright future.</para></talk.start><para>Minister Nelson talks about having a world-class university. Australia knows that what we need is world-class public funding. The Senate has previously made the government aware of the crisis that our university system faces in a 2001 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Universities in crisis</inline>. That report highlighted key issues of proper indexation of running costs, barriers to study and quality of learning. Since that time the crisis faced by universities has deepened. Where Australia needed a vision of an educated and prosperous nation set out for it, the government has provided only blind adherence to market ideology and elitism. That is not surprising because the government was the precipitator of this crisis from its first day in office in 1996. The funding cuts of 12 per cent, introduced by Senator Vanstone, the then Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, are a gash in Australia's future that has only ever been left to bleed by the Howard government. Indeed, the casual observer would view the government's attempts to fix higher education as akin to the medicinal orthodoxy of the Middle Ages. The leeches have been applied to our universities by this government. The bill before us today is surely the death knell of the public university system, established and expanded by Labor. </para><para>Since 1996 we have seen student fees increased by 85 per cent. Access to the education system for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds has been decimated by the consistently reduced number of places available to school leavers. The quality of learning has been drastically affected by larger class sizes, fewer staff and fewer contact hours. The integrity and autonomy of universities have been violated by the weaning of public universities onto private sources of funding. The quality of teaching has been damaged by programs that allow tertiary entrance rankings to be subverted by large cash payments called up-front fees. And, of course, tertiary entrance rankings are being subverted by federal government money that funds private schools, already providing enormous advantages to the children of the wealthy. </para><para>To facilitate the formulation of this bill, Minister Nelson travelled the country talking to all who would listen about his great plan to fix universities. The overwhelming majority of opinions put to that review process called for more public funding and a serious commitment to investing in Australia's future. Hundreds of submissions and thousands of hours have been wasted by the minister and his department. The 2001 Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee inquiry was enough background for Minister Nelson to understand and set about repairing the university system that his predecessors, Ministers Kemp and Vanstone, had dismantled. The bill before us today is much less the result of ignorance than it would appear. It is the result of careful attention to the God whom all in the Liberal Party serve—the almighty free market. The Higher Education Support Bill punishes harshly those who do not worship at the same altar. Nine out of 10 children who attend non-selective public schools fail to achieve a tertiary entrance ranking of 90 or more. Should any of these children wish to study for a degree, for which they may have the brains but not the private school education, this bill will force them into debts of well over $100,000. </para><para>The bill also fails to maintain the level of funding that our universities need. I have mentioned the $5 billion ripped out of higher education by the Howard government since coming to office in 1996—and this is no abstract figure. These cuts have done irreparable damage to educational standards in this country. Examples in my home state of New South Wales come all too easily. The western suburbs of Sydney have been served since 1989 by the University of Western Sydney. The UWS mission statement is to `aspire to improve the lives of the people of Greater Western Sydney'.</para><para>The UWS is one of the universities worst affected by the proposed changes. The UWS is a large and diverse university, with six separate campuses, each with deep connections to their local communities. This is a university for whom the great majority of graduates are the first in their family to go further than school. The UWS also shares many of its campuses with TAFE colleges, creating an environment of educational encouragement at all levels and shared resources of learning. Under the coalition's funding scheme, the UWS would face a further decline in total funding of over $30 million for the next seven years. The UWS Vice-Chancellor has been attacked by Liberal Party members of the lower house for even daring to defend her university and demand more money. The UWS has already been forced to cut so many courses that the number of degrees it offers has dropped. This year many students were told that their degree no longer existed. Other courses were removed from the Penrith campus to the Campbelltown campus, which can be a four-hour round trip away, because the university could only afford to run one class.</para><para>Last year, final examinations were held in a leagues club when no adequate room was available at the university. The inevitable outcome of the provisions of this bill will be the closure of some of the campuses. It would take away more than education from the people of Western Sydney. It would take away jobs. It would take away money out of the local economies and it would take away the aspirations of a group of people who work harder than most for what they get. The fact that the government's small provision for non-metropolitan campuses does not include this university, nor the universities of Wollongong or Newcastle, is disgraceful. The total amount set aside in its package would not cover the shortfall at the UWS, let alone any of the other deserving universities. The government has failed to reward those who need and deserve help because of its previous mismanagement. The government's attack on higher education funding is causing similar tales of woe at universities across New South Wales. Our regional universities are especially suffering. Let us take one of Australia's finest regional universities, the University of New England in Armidale, as a case in point. </para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>17492</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>17492</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On 30 October 2003 I advised the Senate of changes to ministerial representation.

I am sure that, if Senator George Campbell were as up to date with the ministerial arrangements in this place as he should be, he might also have been more up to date on Work for the Dole reports. The government welcomes independent evaluations of its employment programs by academics such as Professor Borland and the Nevilles. In this case, however, Professor Borland's study is simply out of date as it refers to Work for the Dole pilot projects that were in operation in 1997 and 1998. Since 1997 major changes to employment services have occurred. The Job Network, the Australians Working Together measures and the active participation model have been introduced. All of these changes have been about helping people to move forward by providing opportunities for participation and, ultimately, economic independence.</para></talk.start><para>A more recent and comprehensive study has been conducted by the independent Centre for Applied Economic Research. The study was undertaken by Anne Neville and Professor John Neville. It looked at the current Work for the Dole program. The Nevilles' book <inline font-style="italic">Work for the Dole: obligations or opportunities</inline> was launched recently. In contrast to the Borland findings, the Nevilles concluded that, on balance, Work for the Dole does help participants find jobs, in particular young participants. In fact, they found that, by international standards, Work for the Dole appears to be remarkably successful in helping participants find employment. As somebody who has launched a number of Work for the Dole schemes in my home state of Tasmania and who has also been at the graduations of these same programs, the confidence of the people involved in Work for the Dole programs is immense. In fact, if there is one regret of those who participate, it is that it lasts for only six months. Another key finding is that Work for the Dole has a positive and significant impact on employment. This is very encouraging and is in agreement with Minister Brough's department's own findings.</para><para>Mr President, if Senator George Campbell were genuinely interested in the answer to the question he asked, he would not be on the phone now.

It is of great benefit to the community. In relation to specific information, in scientific terms Work for the Dole has a positive employment effect, with a net impact of around four percentage points. This means that participants in the program are 14 per cent more likely to be employed 16 months after commencing the program than similar job seekers who have not participated. The beneficial effects of the program are particularly obvious over the longer term. The bottom line is that, three months after participating in Work for the Dole, some 32 per cent are employed or are in further education. After 12 months, this increases to around 46 per cent. Those figures speak for themselves and show once again why Work for the Dole has been such a popular initiative introduced by the Howard government.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Economic Policy</title><page.no>17493</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17493</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill.

The Australian employment market continues to perform strongly under the Howard government's responsible management of the Australian economy. The most recent labour force figures are outstanding. Australia's unemployment rate has dropped to 5.6 per cent—its lowest level in 22 years. The number of long-term unemployed has dropped to its lowest level for seven years. There are now more Australians in work than ever before. Since coming to office, the Howard government has helped to create almost 1.3 million new jobs. That is 14,000 jobs per month, which is double the rate of job creation achieved by Labor in its last two terms of government. We have delivered the goods on job creation. We have given young Australians the chance to secure employment for the first time and given existing workers confidence in their ongoing job security. That job security allows Australian families to plan confidently for the needs of their families in areas such as health and education. With business and consumer confidence remaining strong, indicators suggest that labour market conditions will continue to improve in the months ahead. </para></talk.start><para>What a contrast with Labor. Who will ever forget their bungled management of the economy, which put more than one million Australians out of work, sent interest rates through the roof and sent the budget spiralling into debt? It is an appalling record, and they have not learned their lesson. We have taken the tough but necessary decisions to get the budget back into surplus and to keep it there. It is this responsible economic management that has enabled us to deliver historically low interest rates, low inflation, to repay much of Labor's debt and to put more Australians into full-time jobs than ever before. Every one of these decisions that we took to strengthen the economy was opposed by the Labor Party. The coalition's record speaks for itself.</para><para>What is the alternative? It is the same old story from Labor: whip out the government credit card, put up taxes and run up massive budget deficits. We know what the results will be. It is clear from Labor's track record that history will repeat itself, with record high unemployment, record interest rates and record levels of government debt. You cannot trust Labor on economic management, you cannot trust them on taxation policy, you cannot trust them on jobs growth and you certainly cannot trust them to keep interest rates low.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: People-Smuggling</title><page.no>17494</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>17494</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

Senator, as you know, we have a very strong view that people who seek to come to Australia illegally should have to come to the mainland. Those who attempt to come here illegally, if we have the opportunity—that is, if they do not make it to the mainland—will be processed offshore. To achieve that, it may well mean that a boat and its crew will need to be returned. I do not want to make a point here that the crew are not to be regarded as people smugglers. In many cases they are clearly involved and clearly do know what they are doing. I do not have figures on this, but there may be examples of where crew have repeatedly come to Australia for a fee in the past, or have sought to come to Australia, to deposit people here who do not have a proper entry permit to come to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The decision was made, and was always going to be, that a boat that seeks to come here illegally would be returned whence it came or taken to another place to be processed offshore. Those arrangements in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> have worked very well. The boat was returned in the direction whence it came and was delivered to just outside Indonesian waters. Because of prior indications to the Indonesian government, the International Organisation for Migration was on the island—in fact, they were in the town of Saumlaki—to make appropriate arrangements for the care, accommodation and that sort of thing for the potential illegal immigrants, and the UNHCR would of course be involved. </para><para>As to the fishermen, you cannot necessarily return the illegal cargo, if you want to put it that way, of the vessel quite as easily if you have accepted it onshore and then tried to return it, so it went back with the crew. But you should not assume that, because the crew have gone back, no further inquiries are being made about that boat or that we are not keen to pursue anybody who is involved in people-smuggling. I do not have the particular brief with me, but I was advised over the weekend that a number of people have been successfully extradited to Australia to be prosecuted for people-smuggling in various states. We continue to be very interested in pursuing people smugglers. People who are used as crew may be similarly placed to crews of boats that bring drugs here, for example. They may be able to give us information about who paid them, when the arrangements were made and whether they have been involved in this sort of thing in the past but may not themselves have been the primary people smugglers.</para><para>In relation to the ongoing investigation by the Australian Federal Police, I do not have information; Minister Ellison may well have. There are two aspects to our policy. One is that people who try to come here illegally should be processed offshore. If they are found to need protection, we do our fair share. I am advised that over a fairly recent period we have taken 80 people from Indonesia who have been processed under these arrangements. Equally, we have another view—that we should be in constant pursuit of the people smugglers, and that is continuing to happen.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17495</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The first part of my answer to you made it very clear that our policy is not to accept people coming here illegally. That means the boat has to go somewhere else. You would equally understand, Senator, that when the boat does go somewhere else, `somewhere else' is not in our jurisdiction. Therefore, we work in close cooperation with the Indonesian government and others in relation to the prosecution of people involved in people-smuggling. So you should not infer, Senator, that anyone has got off scot-free and that investigations are not proceeding. I made that clear in my answer. If you are under the impression, Senator, that we have the capacity to prosecute people in Indonesia, you are under a misapprehension; you are the victim of a misunderstanding. The deterrence factor is that the people smugglers are not successful. And do you know what happens when a people smuggler is not successful?

The Howard government believe in keeping taxes as low as possible, consistent with delivering the services that Australia needs. In this year's budget we managed to increase spending on health, on education, on defence and on other social services. At the same time, from 1 July 2003 we delivered tax cuts for every Australian, worth $10.7 billion over four years. The government took this decision because of a strong balance sheet, because we could meet our commitments and because we could maintain a surplus. In these circumstances the government believed that it was responsible to return this money to the taxpayer, and delivered a budget surplus. The government is committed to retire debt. Eighty billion dollars worth of debt was run up by the last Labor government before they were turfed out of office. The Howard government have reduced this debt by $66.6 billion over the last six years, with $8.4 billion paid off in the 2002-03 financial year. That means that we are saving over $5 billion a year in interest payments on this debt.</para></talk.start><para>I have been asked about some alternative policy approaches. Over the last few weeks the Labor Party has had some difficulty in agreeing on a tax policy. Things have got a bit tense on Labor's frontbench, with shadow ministers falling over their own feet to disagree with each other. Labor's shadow Treasurer, Mr Latham, has supported tax relief for those earning top marginal tax rates and a wealth tax, and it has got him into a heap of trouble. In 1998 death duties were lauded by Mr Latham as part of his `progressive expenditure tax', or PET. Mr Latham's preferred model proposed a marginal tax rate of 400 per cent—that is right, 400 per cent—on taxable expenditures of between $40,000 and $50,000.

That is exactly what Labor did through all of the nineties until they were turfed out of office. As Senator Hill has just said, the Labor Party did very little to help the workers.

It is wide of the mark in its tax policies and it is, in fact, having great difficulty in working out what tax policy might be efficient to deliver prosperity for Australians. As a principle, the Howard government, of course, is committed to responsible economic management, balanced budgets, meeting our commitments and then, in a responsible way, looking at whether we can return money to the Australian taxpayer. This government will continue to maintain its sound economic policy, which has delivered prosperity for all Australians for the past 7½ years.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: People-Smuggling</title><page.no>17497</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>17497</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

The point is this: we have a policy that people who try to come here illegally will have to get to the mainland, otherwise they will be processed offshore. Labor clearly has a policy that says: `Now we are open for business. Bring the people down. We will process them onshore.' That is why Mr Crean excised from the transcript that he released of his discussions in London those portions which indicated Labor is about to have a big about-face and would like to process people onshore. The consequence of processing them offshore is frequently that the crew need to go to the same place that the people on the boat go to. You can draw no inference whatsoever that the crew or people smugglers are not being pursued by way of a Federal Police investigation. Nor, with respect, can you draw an assumption that the crew are in fact the people smugglers and organisers as opposed to simply being people who are paid money. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>17498</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>17498</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp.

This government has provided very extensive support to the industry, of which we are proud, and we are pleased to do so. That is the first point. </para></talk.start></continue><para>As to the second point, I think a better question was asked by Senator Ridgeway. I am rather inclined to refer you to the answer I gave to Senator Ridgeway. What you have to understand is that we are in the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with America. This government signs treaties which are in the national interest of Australia. Certainly, a treaty along the lines of that being discussed has the potential—and now we will see what the outcome is—to greatly increase the ability of Australia to trade with the US and could have a major beneficial effect on the Australian economy to the tune, possibly, of billions of dollars. </para><para>We have made it very clear that we continue to strongly support the industry. We have made it very clear that the outcomes of the Australia-US free trade agreement will not undermine the government's ability to regulate for cultural and social objectives. We have made that point. As I said, we are not a government that trades away Australia's interests. Above all, we are a government that is very conscious of the interests of this country. Let me make it clear to you that we are very conscious of the interests of the film sector. The film sector is a very important sector in this economy. We are very well aware of the need of that sector for particular government support, which we are pleased and proud to provide.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17503</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

I notice in the gallery a delegation from the All-China Youth Federation. I acknowledge and welcome them here and make it clear that we have very good arrangements with China in relation to immigration policies, for which we are very grateful. Equally, we have good relationships with Indonesia. We have been very successful. We have had regional cooperation and arrangements with Indonesia since 2000, and only two boats have been successful since that time in getting to our territorial waters. Part of the success of this policy is that the people smugglers realise that they will not be able to get people to Australia to seek a migration outcome; they will be taken to an offshore place if they have an asylum claim to make, it will be made and we will take our fair share of people who are properly judged to be refugees. People who want to seek asylum obviously have the right to have that claim heard. They do not have a right to dictate where it will be heard, and they do not have a right to dictate where protection—should it be required—will finally be offered. </para></talk.start><para>This is a very serious business. Some four million people are apparently trafficked or smuggled each year and we need to get rid of the incentives. One incentive was: if you come to Australia, you may be able to use our court system to stay longer and longer and eventually claim some sort of alternative migration outcome. That incentive has been removed and you can see the success of this policy with only two boats having arrived.</para><para>I am asked whether I am aware of any other policies. Up until recently, I had thought that there was a bipartisan approach to this, an understanding that we did not want to send a green light message to people smugglers saying: `Australia is open for business.

I had thought that, until I saw a transcript of what Mr Crean apparently said in London and noticed that some parts of the transcript have been taken out of the copy that Mr Crean distributed. This is Mr Crean's excision policy: you say something in London which you later regret, so you cut it out of the transcript and distribute an edited version of the transcript.

I go to what Dr Carmen Lawrence has been saying. It is pretty clear that Dr Lawrence would like an alternative policy as she is calling for the party to take a more compassionate approach to boat people. In Dr Lawrence's language, that is code for, `Bring them on down and we will assess them here.' Labor frontbencher Carmen Lawrence is quoted as saying that there was a momentum in the party for a new approach, denying it would cost votes at the next election. That may be, but it is very clear that the newly elected President of the Labor Party wants a change. The other thing that is very clear is that Mr Crean has given in to that demand. He made it very clear in London that he believes Australia should be open for business, that we should bring the boat people down and let them in on the mainland. They will even put out a coastguard to usher the vessels right to our shore, just to make sure that they get here safely. `We'll assess them; we'll take the burden.'

When we believe there is a people-smuggling boat in the vicinity, relevant agencies go into operational mode and they are very careful about what they say, I think for quite obvious reasons, because there are people in the community who will take any opportunity they can improperly to frustrate the government in its objective of lawfully carrying out its policy. The government is required to act lawfully and if on any occasion it does not it faces the consequence of that.

It was only last week that the Australian Film Commission released its annual national drama production survey revealing a dramatic drop in feature film and TV drama production, which shows the extent of the harsh attitude that the Howard government takes to our cultural sector and in fact the policy negligence it is about to perpetrate. According to the survey, the production of Australian feature films has plunged by one-third, down from 30 in 2001-02 to just 19 in 2002-03, and total expenditure on feature film and drama production is down by 23 per cent. There were no Australian features with budgets over $10 million this year and only one in the $6 million to $10 million range. In the area of adult TV drama co-productions made primarily for the international market, there has been an overall downturn in expenditure in the foreign adult TV drama production, which halved from $102 million in 2001-02 to $51 million in 2002-03. </para><para>Incredibly, in the same week as these figures were released the Howard government have reneged on their commitment to protect Australia's cultural identity. They have admitted that they are prepared to trade away in the US free trade agreement negotiations any ability to support and regulate for local film, television and new media now and in the future. I think this is a serious case of kicking a sector when it is down.</para><para>It took John Howard and Mark Vaile, through the visit of the US President here, to really let the cat out of the bag. I think it is a disgrace that, at a time when the survival of Australia's film and television industry is at stake and they are suffering from a serious downturn, the Howard government is about to sell out the right of every Australian, now and in the future, to create and share in Australia's identity through the production of feature films and television programs that portray the diversity of Australian life, culture and heritage.</para><para>In a mean and tricky strategy to distract the cultural sector, the Howard government has spent the last 12 months assuring that sector and its representatives that everything will be okay. In fact, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Kemp, told a conference late last year that cultural support mechanisms, such as local content rules, would not be traded away. All we have heard since are weasel words and more weasel words. Despite the opposition and other senators giving Senator Kemp ample opportunity to stick to that commitment, all we get in this place when we ask a question is weasel words about where the Howard government is going to go and the extent of the sell-out. So why is it that the Howard government is so incapable of making a commitment to an exclusion clause? The only answer to that is that it is not going to, that it is prepared to trade, and everything that Prime Minister Howard, Minister Vaile and now Senator Kemp have said confirms this more strongly each time they have the opportunity. </para><para>The Howard government is happy to allow existing Australian content rules to be either scrapped or capped at their current rate in a bid to deliver the US free trade agreement, despite the industry needing more support than ever. That would be true negligence. And, of course, there is the issue of new media. It would be an absolute disgrace if the Howard government were prepared to trade away our future. Geoffrey Rush was absolutely right when, in the words that I read out in question time today, he said that what we have not yet even dreamt up will be disabled, locked down and prevented from having support mechanisms through the industry.</para><para>All Australians have the right to hear Australian stories. Without the ability to determine future local content provisions and provide strategic financial support, the economics of the film and television industry will determine that Australian stories are simply not told. That is why that support and the ability to put into place these regulations are so important. We know the economics of that sector will determine that those stories will not be told without that support from an Australian government. Our cultural identity is unique; it defines who we are as a nation. Labor is not prepared to sit by and see it used as a cheap bargaining chip in a free trade agreement, the details of which are not known and the details about which are being hidden and kept secret by the Howard government. Labor demands an exclusion clause for all present and future cultural content in any free trade agreement with the United States. For this to occur, an exclusion clause would have to be included in the FTA.</para><para>An exclusion clause was successfully argued under the Singapore-Australia free trade agreement and contains a specific exclusion relating to creative arts, cultural heritage and other cultural industries, including audiovisual services, entertainment services, libraries, archives, museums and other cultural services.

Nobody wants to see either Australian film production or Australian television production reduced, and that certainly is the government's position also.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lundy says that we are kicking an industry when the industry is down. Again, she is making huge presumptions about the government's position on the Australian film industry. This has all come from some comments that were made at the Australian Film Industry Awards last Friday night when a number of people, including, as Senator Lundy said, Toni Collette and Geoffrey Rush, jumped to conclusions about what might be contained in the Australia-US free trade agreement in respect of local content. Again, I have to say that these people are jumping to conclusions. The Australian government is keen to see the Australian film industry and television production thrive and prosper, because it is seen as important that the world hear and see what Australia has to say about itself.  </para><para>The fact is that this government has given enormous support to the film industry. In 2003-04 the government provided direct support amounting to $133 million to the Australian film sector through funding programs, grants and subsidies delivered through the Australian government film agencies, including the Australian Film Commission and Film Finance Corporation Australia. These programs, grants and subsidies will go a long way towards ensuring that our film industry is able to train the future professionals in the industry, they will boost our digital capacity and they will provide funding that will ensure that Australians make film and television programs which tell our story as a nation not only on cinema screens but on TV around the world in the countries to which we sell our programs.</para><para>There is no doubt at all that this government will continue to provide that kind of funding to support the film industry. It is quite irresponsible of Senator Lundy—who sits on the committee that holds the estimates hearings into the arts and hears what Film Finance Corporation Australia and Australian government film agencies are providing to the film industry—to make the kinds of comments that she has. It is quite clear that the Australian government will continue to provide direct support for Australian culture, including for film production, and that will not be affected in any way by the free trade negotiations.</para><para>There is no doubt at all that the Australian film industry has done a great job, as I have said; but Australian films and Australian television productions have to compete on their own merit in the world market. That is not a new thing; they have been doing that for many years. We have had great success selling television programs like <inline font-style="italic">Neighbours</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Home and Away</inline> on the international market; they have been very well received throughout Europe, in Canada and in the Asian region. That will continue. If these programs have universal appeal as stories about people, as they do, then they will be purchased internationally.</para><para>The free trade agreement is not going to affect the production of Australian film and television programs. The federal government is committed to supporting the Australian film and television industry to the extent that it is doing at the moment and more so—the Howard government has committed $133 million to the Australian film and television industry in 2003-04 for training and production purposes. That is a fine record. We stand on our record and we will accept no criticism of it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>17509</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also wish to take note of answers to questions asked by Senator Lundy in respect of the Australia-US free trade negotiations. The debate surrounding the impact of a US-Australia free trade agreement on our creative industries has centred on the negative cultural impacts such an agreement would have on Australia. It is not hard to understand why this has been the focus when you consider that a bilateral agreement of this type has the potential to severely erode local content standards and negatively impact the quality and vitality of our creative industries, with disastrous cultural ramifications for our national identity. In Australia, 63.4 per cent of all new television hours broadcast on television are sourced from outside the region. Compare this to the United States, where 98.5 per cent of television broadcast is new local programming—and we have just received the news that our feature film industry is in decline. The days when we can go to the cinema for an Australian perspective on the world may be numbered. I do not need to elaborate on the cultural impact of this decline; it is very clear. </para></talk.start><para>There is another part of this debate that has not received the attention it deserves: the economic impact on our cultural industries and the Australian jobs that are at risk. It may not be as glamorous as a debate comparing films like <inline font-style="italic">Lantana</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"> Breaker Morant</inline> and the television series <inline font-style="italic">The Secret Life of Us</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">Pulp Fiction</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Saving Private Ryan</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Friends</inline>. However, it is equally as important. Currently, our film and television industry alone provides employment for almost 50,000 Australians. If the government trades away its rights to protect our film and television industry, who knows what will happen to these jobs? There will certainly be a substantial number of Australians currently employed who will be looking for alternative employment.</para><para>Last week we received the news that Australian feature film and TV drama production declined in 2002-03: expenditure was down by 23 per cent, from $663 million to $513 million. The number of feature films made was down from 39 to 26 and the value of Australian production was down by 21 per cent, from $343 million to $271 million. You do not have to be a trained economist to see that fewer Australian films means fewer Australian jobs. We also must not forget the flow-on effects major local and foreign films have on local economies. From 1997 to 2002, TV drama productions spent an average of one-third of a billion dollars annually in Australia. If our film and television industry loses what government support it has, communities across Australia will suffer.</para><para>This proposed agreement also puts at risk a significant stream of revenue that flows into the pockets of Australian businesses and creators. Overall, Australia's copyright industries are worth $20 billion to the nation. Since 1987-88, Australian exports of cinema films, TV programs and videos have been worth over $2.3 billion. In 2000-02 alone, audiovisual royalties earned by SOCOG contributed $1.133 billion to the balance of trade. But a note of caution must also be sounded: these figures are dwarfed by Australia's import of foreign culture. Excluding the effect of the Olympics, audiovisual exports have dropped by 54 per cent over the last three years, while imports have risen by six per cent. This will only worsen if Australia sells its cultural industries down the river in the current free trade negotiations.</para><para>It is important to note that this government is obsessed with one feature in terms of the free trade negotiations with the United States: access for our primary industries—and if it can get that in an agreement, the rest will not matter; it will sell the rest of the industry base of this country down the river.

We are happy to respond to it. As we have in the past, we wish to assure those in the industry that the exaggerated claims and opportunism of the opposition are false and that our national identity is well and truly safe and secure. This has the look of an opposition overreaching for an issue, trying to win an industry that they once had, during the Keating years—the black tie and red carpet years. They have since lost significant support in that industry, quite frankly because of this government's record. We did not come in and slash and burn the TV and film industry at all; in fact, they were spared the famous 1996 budget cuts. This is an industry that has not had budget cuts at all. </para></talk.start><para>Recently, in the AFI awards, <inline font-style="italic">Japanese Story</inline> scooped the pool for best actor and best film. That film could not have come about without government support through the Australian Film Finance Corporation and through the Australian Film Commission contributing also in its own way. <inline font-style="italic">Japanese Story</inline>, a fine film with a good actress, was supported by the government. The Australian Film Commission has been part of the Australian film culture for many decades now and we have no intention of removing it. That has been put on the table in the free trade negotiations. I think the opposition are truly underselling—deliberately, of course—this industry's plight. In fact, I do not think the industry has ever been better. Look at the great actresses and actors whom we have been exporting—Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe and Geoffrey Rush himself. They are all great international actors and actresses who have achieved their success here in Australia because of government support. Little is it known and recognised by the opposition that Australia has some of the best film technicians in the world and some of the best advantages to film here in Australia, so much so that many films, such as <inline font-style="italic">Matrix 1</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Matrix 2</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Matrix 3</inline> have been filmed here in Australia. Hollywood has shifted much of its base out here in Australia.</para><para>There is nothing to say that this industry is ailing and there is less to say that, under the Australia-US free trade agreement, which is under negotiation at the moment, this industry will suffer at all. We have a commitment that we will not reduce the Australian content of the television industry. Why would we want to? Why would the Americans ask us to? The Americans have said that they are not asking us to make this commitment at all. As for some secret negotiations, that is classic opposition beat-up—they have to earn their pay each day. There is nothing secret about the US trade negotiations. At the moment they are quite open. I believe the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has just returned from Washington yet again with regard to finalising this agreement. Why put anything on the table or publicise anything at the moment until you have a draft agreement? You put it on the table then for public scrutiny. Again, I say that this is an industry valued by the government and proven so with regard to funding. </para><para>In fact, I visited the set of <inline font-style="italic">Stingers</inline> recently, a Channel 9 high-rating TV program. Its cultural value and its employment significance are properly highlighted. They pointed that out to me, and I can assure you that the minister is well aware of that too.

Before I get into the bulk of what I want to say, I should pick up some of Senator McGauran's comments where he indicated that we are exporting actors to the US. Indeed, that is terrific. It is great to see successful Australian actors performing in the United States. But our difficulty is that they are telling American stories for American audiences which then get sent to the rest of the world, including Australia. We actually want to hear Australians telling Australian stories. We want our Australian culture to survive this round of free trade agreement negotiations. The other point which Senator McGauran wanted to harp on is that the negotiations are not secret. I find that an absolutely bizarre statement. The fact is that the negotiations are secret. If they were not secret, we would not have to ask these questions in question time and the government would be able to give us appropriate answers.  </para></talk.start><para>What we saw today in the answers to the questions that were asked was simply a lot of nice, warm, fuzzy words. Senator Kemp said all the nice things. He said that the entertainment industry is an important sector in the Australian economy and that the government wants to develop this sector and has close contact with and input from the sector. I think that is terrific. If he was saying all those nice things, why can't he give the Senate the guarantee that was asked of him? Why can't he agree to guarantee that existing and future mediums in the entertainment industry will not be subject to open slather, free trade with the United States? It is a very simple ask. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Because if you do it for one senator, you have to do it for every other senator.

Even he must understand that these negotiations are following what we know as the `negative list model', which means that, unless something in the free trade agreement is specifically reserved or excluded, then it is automatically included in the FTA. That is what we are clearly asking for. If the government were good to their word, they would agree to an exclusion clause for this industry and include that exclusion in the negotiations. But, again, it is a matter of talking the talk but not walking the walk. While they make all the nice, fuzzy noises about it, the Prime Minister himself has raised the speculation about this aspect of the negotiations. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>of Saturday, 22 November, Mr Howard said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The line we have taken to date is that the existing local-content rules ought to be preserved in relation to existing media.</para><para>As to some discussion about what might apply to future arrangements then that might be part of the negotiation.</para></quote><para>While Senator Kemp can point us to Mr Vaile, I can point you to Mr Howard, who has clearly raised this issue and put it on the public agenda. To forgo our right to regulate future mediums is ridiculous in the extreme. To take that view is the equivalent of this parliament in the 1930s, prior to television when all we had was cinema and theatre, saying: `We will forgo our right in the future to regulate or make rules about new mediums.' Those new mediums turned out to be television and the Internet.</para><para>Not too long down the track we will see new modes of delivery in this industry, and we will see new technologies develop. If the government, by refusing to put exclusion clauses in this agreement, forgoes our right in the public interest to make rules and regulations in the entertainment, media, arts and film industries, it will forgo its obligation to regulate in the public interest. It is an appalling situation that we find ourselves in. All the government needs to do is to guarantee to the Senate and to the Australian public that it will include an exclusion clause in the FTA but, every time it is asked to do so, it simply refuses to do it. </para><para>The only conclusion we can draw from the government's refusal to do it is that it fully intends to trade this industry off. It intends to trade off this industry for access to agriculture or access to other industries in the free trade agreement. But it is not just an industry that we will trade off in these negotiations; it is our very culture. Culture is the essence of a people and it is the essence of a country. It is not something that ought to be simply traded off in trade negotiations between countries. It is something that we need to preserve. We need that exclusion clause. Australians do have stories to tell, and we need an industry through which to tell them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17513</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to join in the debate to take note of Senator Kemp's answers, particularly that given to my question about the Australian Film Institute. From the views that have been expressed most adequately by members of the Australian film industry, I think it is fair to say that they are the people that have led the charge against the attack by the government on the Australian film and television industries and other parts of our cultural industries by not giving firm and certain guarantees on a free trade agreement with the United States.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst Senator Kemp responded, and the government continues to respond through the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, that they will consider the free trade agreement in a manner that is appropriate by looking at its pursuit of cultural and social objectives and that they will not compromise anything under a free trade agreement, we need to go back to June this year and remember that in the early hours of the morning—I believe it was around 3 o'clock—when dealing with the bill relating to the Australia-Singapore free trade agreement, there was not one whisper from any side of parliament. No-one spoke up on that occasion about the template that was being set on the issue of our cultural objectives.</para><para>It seemed to me that, if anything, that particular free trade agreement set the benchmark for any future bilateral agreements, more particularly the one with the United States. We also need to remember that the Australian film, television and cultural industries are extremely concerned about the potential impact that a free trade agreement will have on the Australian cultural sector and, more particularly, our national identity. The minister responded by talking again about these warm, fuzzy objectives that the government held itself to, yet at the same time was lacking in giving a very firm and concrete answer to the Prime Minister's statement that he was prepared to be fully flexible with respect to local content and new media.</para><para>I think we need to keep those things in mind because, essentially, it is throwing everything on the table as fair game—as chips that can be negotiated, presumably for agricultural access to the US markets. It is one thing to talk about access to the US markets, but it is another thing to trade off our industries. It is so important not just for our esteemed actors whom we know well but also for the skills base of our industry—our producers, our directors, our lighters, our writers and all of those involved in this coalition of diversity in this country. They are the ones that have built up this industry, and they are the ones that need support. It is not surprising that the government would respond by saying that essentially it is seeking to continue to give subsidies and to look at tax concessions and quota for Australian content and that the United States government would not seek to intervene to have any of that changed.</para><para>It is all well and good to talk about having those arrangements in place, but it is also about future arrangements. The fact that the Americans are talking about new media—that there is the possibility of standstill arrangements—goes to the question of whether the Australian government will have the sovereign capacity in the future to intervene and regulate in this most important industry. This issue is about locking in the policy settings of 2003 and applying it for some future industry in the far-off distance. As the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has stated, `It is akin to establishing policy for radio in the early 1940s and failing to take account of the emerging technologies of television, pay television and the Internet.' These are the new technologies that will develop over the coming years. Part of the responsibility of government is that it is incumbent upon them to make sure at the very least that our cultural industries are exempted under the US-Australia free trade agreement. If we cannot do that, the government ought to look at the 55 per cent content rule in Australian television and apply that to new media. The minister was unprepared to give that commitment. I think they ought to at least give some certainty to the industry to make sure that it continues to thrive. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONDOLENCES</title><type>Condolences</type><page.no>17514</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Primmer, Mr Cyril Graham</title><page.no>17514</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>17514</page.no><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 1 November 2003 of Cyril Graham Primmer, a senator for the state of Victoria from 1971 to 1985.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>17514</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 1 November 2003, of Mr Cyril Graham Primmer, former senator for the state of Victoria, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para></motion><para>Mr Primmer was born in Warrnambool, Victoria on 19 April 1924.

The myth says that the Labor Party and the bush do not mix and that farmers and unionists are natural enemies. Cyril Primmer was one of those who challenged that myth. In his first speech in 1971, he said that it `has ever been the role of the trade union movement wherever injustice has been done' to support friends, mates and co-workers. In his life and his political career he proved that the great Labor and union traditions of standing together, of standing by your mates and your principles, were not limited by geography. </para><para>Cyril Primmer, dairy farmer and Labor stalwart, was born in 1924. Like many of his generation, he received a basic education through the public education system—in his case, Koroit State School and Warrnambool Technical College—but was prevented by economic reality from further study. Cyril's higher education was of two kinds: the extensive book-learning he acquired through wide and continual reading, and the tougher education he got in New Guinea and Bougainville as a corporal in the 2nd AIF.</para><para>After the war, Cyril returned to the Warrnambool area where he had grown up and returned to his dairy farm at Kirkstall. He was active in the Victorian Dairy Farmers Association, becoming secretary of the Port Fairy Branch and a member of the central council. Around that time, he also became active in the Australian Labor Party. Cyril's qualities were pretty evident to his local community and, by the mid-1950s, he was playing a leading role in local Labor activities as a branch president. Of course that meant that when the Victorian party split in the mid-1950s—and it was a particularly bitter and severe split in the Wannon federal electorate—Cyril found himself in the thick of the conflict. Some members of the party just curled up and hid during the tumult of the split, some walked and others thrived in the rough and tumble of factional brawling and found the split an excuse to release their thuggish instincts.</para><para>Cyril was none of these—he had done his fighting in New Guinea and Bougainville with the 2nd AIF. Nor was he about to retreat from what he saw as his obligation to the party. When he arrived at his first branch meeting after the split, settled into the president's chair at the front of the room and laid a shotgun on the desk, it was not mere bravado. Nor was it alarmist. In the months that followed, Cyril had to put up with DLP hotheads firing shots at his farm and letting down his tyres. The split ran deep in Wannon and tempers ran high. Cyril was a member of Belfast Shire Council from 1956 to 1971. The first few years of his term were a pretty rugged time for him. I do not think he ever forgot it. But he was committed to Labor and he was committed to his local community, and he went on, in his level-headed and reliable way, serving the needs of both. He was very active in the Vietnam moratorium movement, for example, organising and campaigning through and outside the churches in and around Warrnambool.</para><para>Like many of those who kept their heads and tried to hold the party together in Victoria in those difficult years, Cyril Primmer was a decent, sensible and steadfast member of the local community who was determined to do what was right and not be swayed by fear or by personal antagonism. This attitude was a constant with Cyril. When you talk to people who knew Cyril Primmer well, that is what they all say.</para><para>After his election to the Senate in 1970, he continued to do what he believed to be right, regardless of the consequences for himself. In 1978, despite the hostility he received from the meat industry, he exposed the corrupt practices in that industry which allowed the substitution of kangaroo meat for export quality beef. But I think at the federal level Cyril will be remembered most for his passionate devotion to the cause of the East Timorese. Gerry Hand told me the other day that Cyril was the first to speak out against government policy in East Timor. Interviewed by Margo Marshall on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program, he questioned Australia's willingness to see our staunch wartime allies, the East Timorese, subsumed into a larger state to which they did not want to belong. It was not only Labor leaders he confronted on this issue; he was one of the foremost of those in parliament who kept niggling the Fraser government over the issue of Timor, despite the relative unpopularity of the cause. </para><para>Cyril Primmer was also notable for his longstanding commitment to rural and regional Victoria and to the people of the regions. After he was elected he took the step—a very unusual step in those days—of establishing his electorate office in Warrnambool. It was almost unprecedented in those days for a senator to have their office outside the capital city of their state, but Cyril saw himself very much as a senator for country Victoria. And he was, in return, very popular with rank and file members of the Labor Party, particularly in those country areas, all his life.</para><para>Cyril was a first cousin of Frank Hardy. Hardy, of course, wrote a scathing expose of Victorian ALP politics called <inline font-style="italic">Power Without Glory</inline>. You could say that Cyril Primmer never really saw power with or without glory: he was never a minister, nor even a shadow minister. But he served his community faithfully and well. And in his first speech to the Senate in 1971, he pointed with unerring accuracy to the great challenge of his time—and still the great challenge of ours:</para><quote><para>I am deeply perturbed ... by the great imbalance between the haves and the have nots.

He did have an interest and expertise in rural issues. He did take on the meat industry in a big way in the 1980s, alleging corrupt practices. He did not hesitate to speak his mind, more than once getting himself into trouble as a consequence. In the very helpful information that the Parliamentary Library has provided, I noticed a quote from Senator Primmer after being cautioned on his language: `the closer to the bone, the sweeter the meat, Mr Temporary Chairman.' As a vegetarian, I would not know if that is true in the physical sense, but I think it gives an indication that, if he felt that he needed to get close to the bone in his comments to get to the facts, he was willing to do so. He was a strong, vocal supporter of East Timor from the earliest days, inside and outside the parliament. I guess it was a great satisfaction to him, as it was to many others who campaigned for so long, to see a free East Timor. He also repeatedly raised concerns about West Papua and the treatment of many of the people there. Unfortunately, some of that treatment and some of those concerns still continue to this day. </para><para>He took a great interest in foreign affairs, particularly in our region, and, as has been mentioned, he served in the South West Pacific during the Second World War. These two interests came together in this quote from his first speech in 1971:</para><quote><para>Huge losses of lives, huge expenditure on bombs and bullets in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have done nothing to win us friends or influence people.

I apologise for the delay in responding.</para><para>As noted in your letter, the relevant Reporting Standards contain commencement provisions which provide that the Standards `come into effect on 1 July 2004 or, if another date is declared by APRA, on that other date'.

However, APRA's lawyers have advised that the date declared in paragraph 2 of the Determination is, with reference to the commencement provisions of the relevant Reporting Standards, `another date... declared by APRA', and therefore the legal effect is that the commencement date of the relevant Reporting Standards is 1 July 2003.</para><para>APRA's lawyers have further advised that the actual date of commencement of the relevant Reporting Standards, whether they commenced on 1 July 2003 or commence on 1 July 2004, will have no practical effect on the reporting obligations of superannuation entities. This is because each of the relevant Reporting Standards specifies that `the first reporting period under [the] standard is the quarter ending on 30 September 2004'.

However, paragraph 1.20DA(2)(e) refers to undertakings given by the applicant in accordance with form 1067, or 1196. The paragraph does not refer to form 1196 (internet). This contrasts with the equivalent provision in paragraph 1.20D(2)(f), which deals with standard business sponsorship.

I apologise for the delay in responding.</para><para>Regulation 1.20C in Part 1 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (the Regulations) provides that an application for approval as a standard business sponsor must be made using forms 1067, 1196 or 1196 (internet). This covers all applications for approval as a standard business sponsor, both Australian business sponsors and Overseas business sponsors. Australian business sponsors are companies or employers who are legally and actively operating in Australia.</para><para>Regulation 1.20D relates to approving Australian business sponsors who can use the 1067, 1196 or 1196 (internet) forms to apply in Australia.</para><para>Regulation 1.20DA in Part 1 relates to overseas business sponsors. It is not intended at this stage that these applications be lodged via the Internet. The intent is for overseas businesses to continue to lodge their sponsorship applications at an overseas post using forms 1067 or 1196 until the systems and procedural issues are further considered. This reflects the fact that overseas posts are best placed to check these businesses' bona fides and their capacity to honour their sponsorship undertakings.</para><para>To lodge an application in Australia using the form 1196 (internet), the business must quote their Australian Business Number, Australian Company Number or Australian Registered Business Number. My department's computer system does not allow overseas businesses that do not have these numbers to lodge the 1196 (internet) form.</para><para>Excluding reference to form 1196 (internet) in regulation 1.20DA meets the objective that overseas business sponsors do not lodge their applications in Australia. However, I appreciate that it would be clearer to adjust the regulation to put the matter beyond doubt.

A discussion paper was released in September 2002 and draft regulations were released for public comment in May 2003. One of the aims of such consultation is to ensure that the Government can put in place the best possible regulation to achieve its policy aims. Indeed the draft regulations were changed in a number of areas as a result of the consultation.</para><para>The Government's wish in gazetting regulations was that the relevant Senate Committee examine the Government's final position on portability, as evidenced in the final regulations, rather than a draft of those regulations. By gazetting the regulations as soon as possible the Committee was given the opportunity to properly analyse the final regulations, rather than analyse issues that the Government had already addressed in the final regulations.</para><para>By gazetting the regulations the Government also ensured that the superannuation industry had sufficient time to prepare for the introduction of portability in advance of the 1 July 2004 start date. The need to achieve that lead time had been identified as a priority in consultations with industry and meant that the regulations had to be gazetted promptly to achieve that timeframe.</para><para>Whilst in the normal course of events the Government would not gazette regulations that were the subject of a Senate Committee inquiry, in this instance the Government sought to balance the timeframe for transition with making available the final form of the regulations to the Committee.</para><para>I trust that this clarifies the points you have raised.</para><para>Helen Coonan</para><para>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greig</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to prohibit discrimination on the ground of sexuality, transgender identity or intersex status, and for related purposes. <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill 2003</inline>.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lees</inline> to move on Monday, 1 December 2003:</para><motion><para>That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</inline> to require commercial TV licence holders to provide locally produced and locally relevant news and current affairs, and for related purposes. <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services (Safeguarding Local Content and Local Audience Needs) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, any legislation that implements any of the proposed Australia-United States free trade agreement (FTA) should not be supported if the FTA does not contain an exclusion clause protecting present and future Australian cultural content.</para></motion></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Postponement</title><page.no>17526</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>An item of business was postponed as follows:</para><para>General business notice of motion no. 646 standing in the name of Senator Allison for today, relating to a resolution concerning the ethanol industry, adopted at the National Party's Federal Conference, postponed till 1 December 2003. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>17527</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics References Committee</title><page.no>17527</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Meeting</title><page.no>17527</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator MACKAY (Tasmania) (3.56 p.m.)—by leave—At the request of the Chair of the Economics References Committee, Senator Stephens, I move:</para><motion><para>That the Economics References Committee be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate today, from 7.30 pm, to take evidence for the committee's inquiry into whether the Trade Practices Act 1974 adequately protects small business.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENT HOUSE: CURRAWONGS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>17527</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator LEES (South Australia) (3.57 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes:</para><para>	(i)	the death of at least 14 currawongs around Parliament House during the last 2 weeks of October 2003, and the subsequent absence of most magpies and currawongs,</para><para>	(ii)	that the likely cause of the bird deaths is their consumption of contaminated bogong moths,</para><para>	(iii)	that the contamination of the bogong moths is most likely due to the application of Cislin, a pyrethrum-based spray, around Parliament House, to kill bogong moths, and</para><para>	(iv)	that the data sheet prepared by the manufacturers of Cislin notes that it is highly toxic to fish, aquatic organisms and bees and also toxic for birds in various concentrations;

The title <inline font-style="italic">Bridging the skills divide</inline> sums up the main messages of this report. Employers, unions and educators agree that Australia is currently facing serious skills shortfalls which are set to worsen over the next decade unless action is taken. The report found that, apart from the well-known and persistent skills shortages in the health and education sectors, there are many skills shortages which are not properly recognised. Many of these are in the skilled trades and in occupations at associate professional levels.</para><para>The government insists that it is on track with training at middle skill levels and that training in the skilled trades remains strong, given occupational decline in the trades relative to substantial employment growth in non-traditional traineeships. In fact, numbers in training in the metal trades, engineering and manufacturing sectors have fallen disproportionately since 1996, according to the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research. Shortages in the metal trades, engineering and manufacturing, and electrical have become endemic during the last five to 10 years. This points to a serious erosion of the skills base in areas of strategic and economic significance which continues unabated despite the restructuring of the training system.</para><para>Because skills development in skills shortage areas has not been a policy focus there are now too few people with the required levels of skills and knowledge to fill available positions across regions, occupations and industries. Far too many industries have sacrificed investment in the recruitment and training of skilled people for the sake of short-term cost savings. Too many individuals, including the growing band of casual and contract workers, are being denied opportunities for training, to the detriment of their future employment prospects.</para><para>With this in mind, the committee majority concluded that Australia needs a new and refocused policy on skills formation. Far from finding that the government's approach to skill shortages is satisfactory or sufficient, as asserted by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in his media response to the report, the committee majority found that substantial or significant adjustment to the employment and vocational and educational framework is needed if systematic failings are to be addressed. The large number of recommendations in the report—some 52 in all—reflects the breadth of issues covered and the extent of necessary change. Many recommendations relate to the training needs of the traditional trades, skilled vocations, young people and the unemployed. Others are directed at providing a foundation for a more equitable and effective investment in skills formation, including training of the existing work force.</para><para>A major issue for employers was the need to improve information gathering and the national coordination of existing data to better identify, predict and respond to present, emergent and cyclical skill needs. The Australian Industry Group was particularly concerned about the effect of major resource and construction projects scheduled over the next five to 10 years, given that the skills pool in the engineering, manufacturing and parts of the construction trades is almost empty.</para><para>The committee is aware that predicting future needs is an inexact science. Nevertheless, employer and industry associations' requests are legitimate. The report recommended that the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research should be the collection point and clearing house for nationally consistent and integrated data on skill shortages and labour market developments. NCVER should also establish a database for analysis of key trends, with updated information accessible on a web site. Employers and unions—and the range of stakeholders generally—are also looking for more tangible progress towards a national framework for skills formation. This includes a more consistent approach to New Apprenticeships incentives and better targeting of incentives for higher level skills formation in national priority sectors. </para><para>More fundamentally, the committee came to the view that current reliance on the market and employer demand with some targeted innovation initiatives is not an adequate basis for skills formation policy. Academic and other experts pointed out that the current competitive business environment and policy settings create a disincentive for many employers to invest in skills formation and that training incentives under the New Apprenticeships system were not effective. Instead, it was argued that New Apprenticeships, which are supposed to fit individuals with industry training needs, may be driving the massive growth trend in low skilled, part-time traineeships at the expense of more costly, longer term and higher value training. Most of the short-term traineeships do not provide the necessary foundations for higher skill development at Australian Quality Training Certificate level 3 and above. While the committee sees the importance of providing flexible working and training arrangements to meet the needs of business and the community, it believes that any stimulation provided by government should be targeted to achieve the highest quality training and employment outcome.</para><para>The report recommended that, as a priority, New Apprenticeships incentives should be made available for traineeships at certificate level 5 and above and that for skilled trades and higher level traineeships the bulk of the payment should be made on commencement of the training contract, contingent on compliance with a negotiated individual training plan. This should go a long way to assist industry offset the costs of taking on apprentices in the traditional trades in the early stages of training. The committee also recommended that the government should support partnerships between the TAFE, universities and industry to expand opportunities for building existing skills and acquiring new skills in skilled trades and vocational professions.</para><para>One of the most frustrating issues was the coexistence of skills shortages and high levels of unemployment particularly amongst young people. Demographic changes over the coming decades, including the declining cohort of young people, make it more important than ever that all individuals are trained to the level of their potential and a firm basis for lifelong employability. Poor education and employment outcomes for a significant minority of young people has emerged as one of the most crucial economic and social policy issues facing Australia.</para><para>Another concern in relation to vocational outcomes is that current funding arrangements do not encourage collaboration between schools and TAFE in sharing facilities. The committee recommended that the MCEETYA Taskforce on Transition from School and ANTA, which are considering new funding models for VET in Schools, should evaluate and remove any disincentives to collaborative training arrangements with TAFE to facilitate programs in a broader range of industry and occupational areas. Fees and charges should not be a barrier to student participation in any VET in Schools program. Consistent with its view that all young people should have a right to 12 years of school education, equivalent VET or decent full-time employment, the committee also recommended that all young people under 21 who have not achieved this outcome should have access to career counselling to reconnect them with education or full-time employment. </para><para>An additional provision should also be made through the Job Network job seeker account to support 15- to 24-year-olds to obtain employment related training that leads to national qualifications, particularly in the traditional trades and areas of skill shortage. The report anticipated and reflected the findings of the recent evaluations of Job Network and Work for the Dole in recommending that these programs require more adequate and better targeted funding to ensure young people get the training they need to obtain genuine and stable employment.</para><para>In conclusion, let me also take the opportunity to thank the staff of the committee secretariat for the work they put into this report. It was pretty long and arduous at the finish trying to get the report tabled in time for the recommendations to have an impact on the recent ministerial council meeting and, hopefully, to generate some initiatives arising out of that meeting to deal with the issues canvassed in the report. I know that a number of the secretariat put in a lot of long hours well into the night completing the writing of the report in time for that to occur. On behalf of the committee I wish to express the committee's appreciation to all of them for the effort that they put in. I just hope that at the end of the day the outcomes will prove the effort to be worth while.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title><page.no>17531</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>17531</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>17531</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Hacking Australia's future: threats to institutional autonomy, academic freedom and student choice in Australian higher education</inline>, along with the transcript of evidence and the documents that have been presented<inline font-style="italic">.</inline></para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>As honourable senators would know, this report is the result of a lengthy inquiry over many months on the proposed higher education legislation bill. The committee received more than 486 submissions in addition to supplementary submissions. The committee was charged with examining the legislation to discover whether or not it would be deleterious in terms of the impact on quality, access, equity and a range of other factors in relation to our higher education sector.</para><para>During the year before last, the Democrats initiated a comprehensive Senate inquiry into universities. The result of that inquiry was a report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Universities in crisis</inline>, which looked at the decline in funds that we have seen over the past 14 years in the higher education sector. It also looked at the issue of fees and charges and the general issue of cost shifting in relation to students, and it came up with a series of comprehensive recommendations as to how we could improve the sector. They were to: invest in the future and not treat higher education as a cost; develop business and industry links where appropriate; and look at the issue of corporatisation and why it is not working in our institutions, particularly the marketisation of university courses, both undergraduate and postgraduate. </para><para>That report looked at innovative ways of expanding the sector in a way that did not hit hard at students, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and other disadvantaged backgrounds, such as Indigenous students, students from rural and remote regions and students with disabilities. Unfortunately, the government chose to ignore that committee report and its recommendations, just as it really ignored the comprehensive Crossroads process of consultation that it initiated at the beginning of last year in relation to higher education. Instead, it has come up with a series of bills and guidelines that are still incomplete. That debate is obviously taking place but I will restrict myself to this current report and its various recommendations.</para><para>This report argued that the legislation should be either rejected out of hand or so substantially amended that the government should go back to the drawing board. The report examined the issue of disincentives, both financial and psychological, for people participating in the higher education sector. It looked at the reasons for the introduction of HECS, even though many of us still do not believe in fees for higher education; we believe education should be publicly funded and accessible to all and that, in a progressive taxation system, graduates will pay and contribute to that system. However, this report looked at the motive behind the introduction of HECS and, inasmuch as we can examine it in Australia today, looked at the impact of the distortions to HECS—that is, the changes that were made in 1996 by the coalition government.</para><para>We looked at research—we looked at AMP-NATSEM research, at Dr Bruce Chapman's work and at ACOSS's information and we received submissions from individuals, organisations and research bodies and we were able to see that debt aversion is a big factor in determining whether or not students will go to universities and that the most debt averse of all are students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The report concluded that this legislation or the policies that have been put forward would not `back Australia's future' but, as we have said, `hack Australia's future'. The report's examination of the legislation indicated that institutions, such as the VCA and UWS, would be worse off, that the transitional funding arrangements would not be appropriate, that regional institutions would be the biggest losers, and that, overall, the lack of indexation was one of the biggest factors hindering the expansion of and the quality in our university sector.</para><para>This report also looked at how the Commonwealth Grants Scheme is funding the $404 million extra that this government is purported to be providing to institutions—although when I say `extra' I should recognise the report's finding: that most of this money for the overall changes to operating grants is back ended. Most universities, if they do feel any benefits, will have to wait until 2007. This report also concluded that the tying of that Commonwealth Grants Scheme money to coercive workplace practices was outrageous; not only that, it represented the single biggest intrusion into university autonomy in our nation's history. Beyond that, the report examining this legislation discovered that the privacy of individual students would be compromised—in fact, breached—as a consequence of some unprecedented proposed changes in law. So on privacy grounds, on institutional autonomy grounds, on financial grounds, on social, equity and access grounds, this legislation was examined and rejected by a majority of senators who participated in the inquiry.</para><para>There have been supplementary reports and I have done a supplementary report on behalf of the Australian Democrats. But in relation to the government's minority report, very few constructive comments were forthcoming. What I would like to see is recognition, even belated, from the government, in this report or in the future from the minister's mouth, that people will be worse off under this legislation. Some institutions have done modelling; some have not, such as Melbourne University, because they do not feel that they have enough facts and figures at their disposal to actually do the required modelling for the future funding of their institution—there are too many contingencies. Will they get the workplace relations money—that is, the Commonwealth Grants Scheme money? No, they will not if they do not institute the workplace practice reforms. How can you calculate that in your modelling for between now and 2007? That is not all—there are the incomplete guidelines. </para><para>This report found—I welcome Senator Tierney to the chamber—that there was an almost unprecedented level of ministerial discretion and, in addition, a lot of the aspects that will be enacted by the legislation that was examined by this committee are in guidelines that are still incomplete. It was difficult enough to hold an inquiry that had only the shell of this legislation without the delegated legislation that accompanies it. It is only in dribs and drabs that those draft and incomplete guidelines have come out. So the report into this legislation, the legislation that we are being urged by the minister and by some sections of the AVCC—albeit the AVCC has called for radical amendment—to pass so swiftly, is not only fundamentally flawed but also incomplete.</para><para>It is incomplete and it has some aspects that are unlike probably any other legislation we have seen relating to this sector—for instance, the radical interference in institutional autonomy, interference in student private records and a student learning entitlement that is basically cut off after five years. This report also found that the HECS hikes, which will see fees increase by up to 30 per cent for students studying at universities around Australia, and the fee increases—these being a doubling in the number of full fee paying undergraduate places—will see higher education in Australia priced out of the reach of many students and many communities.</para><para>The Democrats have made strong recommendations in this report that relate not only to the specific legislation but also to student income support, because the Crossroads inquiry, Backing Australia's Future and the legislation accompanying that process are miserly when it comes to student income support. In fact, student income support issues were off the agenda. It is argued, of course—and I believe the research—that student income support is probably a more pivotal factor in determining participation in higher education than fees and charges, particularly for disadvantaged groups. What has the government done? It has run down income support. It has made it harder for students to access it. It still has disparities between Austudy, common youth allowance and unemployment benefits when it comes to rent assistance and other things. When the government has read this report, perhaps it could come back in the new year with a much better proposal, a better set of guidelines and a better piece of legislation or two to tackle the issues confronting our universities—because they are in crisis—and do something that invests in our future instead of hacks at Australia's future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>17533</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also wish to speak on this report and I begin by expressing my dismay at the disgraceful abuse of parliamentary process in referring this piece of legislation to the references committee. This is legislation. We have in this Senate two types of committees: references committees and legislation committees. This abuse of the processes of the Senate to send legislation for inquiry to a references committee is something that the Procedures Committee should look at. This negates the whole purpose of the division between the committees in this place. </para></talk.start><para>Why did they do it? The whole thing was a cynical political ploy because the references committees are controlled by the ALP. So what the ALP did was set up the terms of reference for the inquiry, they called the witnesses and they set up where the inquiries would be held. As a matter of fact, there was such a lack of interest by students in this inquiry process, with so few turning up to actually protest at the inquiry, that they got desperate in Adelaide and held the inquiry in the middle of the student union. They still could not get any students to turn up except a few interested in the processes of government who sat up and listened to a Senate inquiry procedure. There were no protests. When we went to the very first hearing—this was to be their centrepiece, this was to be the big media event—at the University of Western Sydney on the first day of the inquiry, I turned up at 8.30 and the only one standing out the front was the vice-chancellor. There were no protesters. They did turn up at lunchtime. Sixty turned up at lunchtime but 20 of them were members of the AMWU who had their banners up. There were only 40 students out of a student body of 37,000, and this was repeated right around the country.</para><para>Before the inquiry started, the opposition parties had made up their minds. They said so. Senator Carr is on record as saying, `We are going to oppose this legislation.' I shared a platform in Sydney at the end of August with Senator Stott Despoja and she said, `The government has got to go back to the drawing board and start again.' This was before we had had one day of hearings. What was the point of having the process if the parties that set this inquiry up had no intention of listening to any evidence or changing their minds having listened to all the evidence and having read the submissions? All those people put all that time in, gave us submissions, turned up to the inquiry and gave their evidence sincerely, but the group that set it up had no intention of listening to them. They had made up their minds and they had done it for cynical political purposes.</para><para>They have done this before. At the end of the year 2000 there was yet another inquiry into the university system. They came out with a report called <inline font-style="italic">Universities in crisis</inline>.

That is a significant public investment in higher education. What does the Labor Party have in its policy? What is it proposing in Aim Higher? It says that it is going to fully index. In the way it works its figures, it is all due to full indexation of the grant for universities. But all indexation does is maintain current value. There is no real increase in money at all. You have to be a game person to believe the Labor Party when it says that it will fully index. We are just taking it at its word. The Labor Party got rid of full indexation.

The original terms of the motion supported a moratorium in respect of live exports but Senator Bartlett amended his motion at Labor's request. No-one—and certainly not the government—should misinterpret Labor's action as representing a blank cheque on the industry's future. The fact is that we have just about run out of patience with the minister's neglect of industry standards and his contempt for Australians' concern about animal welfare in the live export trade. Labor understands how much this industry matters to Australian sheep and cattle producers. That is why we are committed to industry reform—and the program I released on behalf of the opposition in July this year proposes just that. That is why Labor continues to scrutinise the industry and highlight the manifest inadequacies in the minister's portfolio administration. It is scrutiny the minister wishes he could avoid.</para><para>Almost three months ago I placed a question on notice directly related to the veterinary report subject to the Senate resolution. As is often the case, Minister Truss has been unwilling or unable to provide a response to my question on notice about this important matter. It is a matter, I might add, that has been repeatedly brought to my attention by Australians who have written to me expressing their disgust at the government's failure to enforce minimum animal welfare standards in the live export industry. Almost three months ago I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry what action he had taken to investigate claims of serious animal cruelty involving Australian export cattle slaughtered at the abattoir in Bassatin, Egypt. I asked the minister when he became aware of the claims of animal cruelty at this abattoir. I also asked what action he had taken to improve animal welfare practices at the abattoir and what improved animal welfare practices had resulted from this action. Labor will look carefully at the terms of the minister's response to the Senate resolution, but I would be surprised if any Australian were satisfied with his action. Words are no substitute for action, and weasel words on animal welfare in the live export trade are fast becoming Mr Truss's stock-in-trade. </para><para>None of the crises that have engulfed the live export industry over recent months are unrelated. The common link is the woeful performance of the minister, and no incident better captures the inadequacy of his performance than his response to last week's alleged sabotage of an export feedlot in Portland, Victoria. Today the ABC <inline font-style="italic">Country Hour</inline> program reported that no export permit would be issued for the sheep stranded at the Portland feedlot until the government got a watertight guarantee that the importing countries would accept them. It has also been reported that the government believes action on this guarantee is a matter for the exporter, and not the government. That is, Mr Truss is doing his level best to avoid any responsibility associated with the resolution of this latest crisis. He is the minister for agriculture but sometimes he seems to be minister in name only. Action is nearly always a matter for others. Unfortunately for Mr Truss, on this issue he can run but he cannot hide. He has a direct responsibility to assist in the resolution of the Portland incident. He is clearly responsible for the export permit required to send the affected sheep on their way to the Middle East, and clearly he has a responsibility to secure a market for these sheep.</para><para>Mr Truss might have forgotten about this, but a few weeks ago he was telling us how many countries he had consulted in an attempt to resolve the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo</inline> fiasco. The figure Mr Truss quoted equalled about a third of all sovereign nations on the face of the earth. A few weeks on, and with another trade crisis on the minister's hands, I now say to him, `Don't hide your diplomatic talent under a bushel. Take charge. Pick up the telephone.' The problem Mr Truss has is that he knows what the rest of us know, and that is he did not take effective action to resolve the fate of the Australian sheep stranded aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>. He tried to ignore the rejection of the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> sheep in the vain hope the problem would go away. He only acted in response to a demand from the Prime Minister, and then every action he took was overseen by a departmental committee coordinated by the secretary of the Prime Minister's department.</para><para>For many livestock producers and exporters, Mr Truss's action in the Portland incident has a ring of deja vu. To ignore his responsibility in this regard is to repeat his failings in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo</inline> fiasco. Tens of thousands of sheep are stranded at the Portland export feedlot, clocking up a bill of tens of thousands of dollars a day, and the minister has elected to look the other way. Mr Truss has sought to avoid his responsibility to secure an export market for Australian produce. He has also sought to pretend that Victorian government tests on the sheep have some bearing on his capacity to authorise an export permit. I understand that the testing required to determine the nature of the contaminant and its impact on the sheep was completed last week. I understand that testing currently under way does not directly concern the suitability of these sheep for export. I further understand that late last week both the Victorian chief veterinarian and his Commonwealth counterpart attested to the suitability of these sheep for export.</para><para>This minister is becoming adept at lapsing into inaction when direct action is required and sticking his head up when he should not. Last Wednesday at 5.12 p.m. AAP ran a story on the Portland incident titled `Animal rights campaigners try to sabotage sheep shipment.' A spokesperson for Mr Truss told AAP that if claims by animal liberationists that meat products had been fed to the sheep were confirmed it was `likely the 70,000 sheep will have to be destroyed'. There has, of course, been considerable international media interest in this latest saga. In fact, stories about disasters in the Australian live export industry are becoming a staple of the international news diet. Comments from Mr Truss through his spokesperson that the sheep would have to be destroyed have unnecessarily complicated an already complicated situation. Those comments incorrectly endorsed the claims made by the animal liberationists that their actions would prevent the export of these sheep. </para><para>It appears the opposite is the reality. Tests undertaken by the Victorian government found that a meat product had been fed to a small number of sheep. But those tests also confirmed that the sheep were in good condition and fit for human consumption. Irresponsibly, Mr Truss leapt into the headlines to link any confirmation of the nature of the material allegedly fed to the sheep with the destruction of all 70,000 of them. Minister Truss should have waited until the testing was completed. When the testing was completed, he should have announced the action he was taking to resolve their fate. What he did was seek a cheap headline at the expense of the producers and exporters involved in the Portland establishment. Yet when I asked him to guarantee the security regime at Australia's other export feedlots, to prevent a repeat of this incident, the minister responded with dumb silence.</para><para>On animal welfare and trade grounds, Mr Truss must muster all resources necessary to resolve the fate of the sheep now at Portland. He must not repeat the inaction that characterised his response to the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express </inline>rejection and leave these sheep stranded for another 80 days. The live export trade is under considerable and growing pressure, and that is largely due to the man in charge: Minister Truss. I suspect that his response to the Senate today will give me no comfort that he has any greater understanding of the job that needs to be done than he had on the day that the Senate resolved to demand action in the vacuum of his inaction on animal welfare in the live export trade. One hopes that we receive the document expeditiously.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>17539</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not speak long on this response from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, despite its importance, because of the pressing other business before the Senate over the next two weeks. As Senator O'Brien mentioned, this response from the minister is to a motion that I originally moved in the Senate that was supported by a majority of the Senate. The minister's response is about 1½ pages long, and I guess we can be thankful that the minister has responded to some extent. I believe that the response is still not satisfactory, particularly in addressing the component of the resolution which urged the government to do more to promote the refrigerated and processed meat trade to help move away from the live export trade, which is clearly unacceptable in animal welfare terms and is in many respects unnecessary.</para></talk.start><para>The minister's response to that is inadequate. It continues to run the suggestion that there will always be a market for live animals and therefore we may as well keep doing it. Firstly, whilst there may be a small irreplaceable market in live animals, it is nowhere near as large as the existing market. Secondly, I would suggest that running the line: `If we don't do it, somebody else will,' which is what the minister is stating, is simply not sufficient. You could use the same argument in relation to growing opium crops—which are in great demand and which we could make a lot of money out of—for processing and export, but we do not do it, because we do not support it, except for appropriate legal means. We could—and unfortunately do—use the same argument in relation to uranium exports, much to the opposition of many Australians, including the Democrats. There are any number of other industries that we do not engage in, certainly not to an unlimited extent, because we do not believe they are appropriate, including components of the arms industry. </para><para>I am not trying to equate the live animal trade with the arms trade or the drugs trade; I am simply saying that the logic of saying: `If we don't do it, somebody else will, therefore we're not going to do anything about it,' is inadequate. There clearly are enormous animal welfare problems that are not able to be adequately addressed, and they are certainly not being addressed. I would suggest that, if you look at the totality of the trade, it is simply impossible to address them. There is no doubt that a lot more could be done to promote an alternative trade, which also of course would provide extra value to Australia.</para><para>So there is an inadequacy in terms of the minister's response. I would urge him to give further thought to these alternative approaches, which I suggest would meet the widespread support of the Australian people. It is quite clear that a very large number of people in the Australian community are concerned about the unnecessary and unavoidable cruelty involved in the live animal trade. I have mentioned before this is the largest petition by quite a way that has been tabled in this chamber so far this year, which contains over 20,000 signatures so far from people expressing opposition to the trade and, I might say, seeking a Senate inquiry into it. That is something that I will pursue a little bit further down the track. I anticipate as many signatures again, if not quite a number on top of that, some time before the end of this sitting fortnight. I anticipate that 40,000 or 50,000 Australians will express their views on that matter by that means. It is a matter of concern to the government. I suggest that if they treated it more seriously than they are and went beyond some platitudes then they would actually get a lot of public support. I would urge them once again to consider acting further in relation to this area, beyond what is contained in the minister's response.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>17540</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The matter before the Senate deals with the response by my colleague the Hon. Warren Truss, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to a request from the Senate. As the response clearly indicates, most of the issues raised by the Senate have already been put in place, and had been before the Senate passed the resolution. Mr Truss's response very clearly and precisely indicates the government's view on the issues raised. I think it is a very clear exposition of the actual situation, devoid of any political points. I simply cannot understand why Senator O'Brien continues the campaign to vilify Mr Truss at every occasion, whether it is Mr Truss's fault or anyone else's fault.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—He's a very good minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—Mr Truss, as Senator Ferguson is saying, is a particularly able minister, a very hardworking one and one who, because of his background, intimately understands not only agricultural matters across the board but particularly these very difficult and complex issues concerning the export of live animals.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Bartlett, I know, is concerned about the welfare of animals, but he is not on his own. He makes a big thing about it, and good luck to him for it. I would venture to say that almost all senators in this chamber would be concerned about the welfare of animals. I think you, Acting Deputy President Watson, originally started the animal welfare committee, which became the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee in a later iteration. We are concerned about animal welfare. But we all do like eating meat. I accept that you do not, Senator Bartlett, but most Australians do like eating meat. To eat the meat—whether it is red or white, fish or chicken—those animals have to be slaughtered. In Australia we make sure they are dealt with in a way that is as humane as possible. Similarly, with the export of live animals, we want to ensure that they are dealt with humanely in transport and so far as Australia has any authority. That is the goal. </para><para>Certainly the live export trade is worth a lot of money to Australia—$1 billion annually—and that supports a lot of jobs and a lot of communities in rural and regional Australia. We care about animals but we also care about people, Senator Bartlett, and people have to have jobs. We care, as well, about country communities. There has got to be a reason for them to exist. All forms of agriculture, particularly the live animal export trade, create employment and ensure the continuation of many of these communities. I have to say in response to Senator Bartlett that, with respect, he seems to lack an understanding of international trade matters. If buyers want frozen meat or value added meat then they will obviously buy it and Australia will supply it. But many buyers in many countries prefer to have the animals arrive live, and then they want to deal with them. That is a fact of nature. If everybody wanted processed meat then Australia could supply it, but everybody does not. Some people prefer the live animals and that is why Australia is in that business, as are many other countries in the world.</para><para>Senator O'Brien, again with respect, raised a whole heap of issues—and somehow they are Mr Truss's fault. If the live animal trade is under pressure then the people to blame for that are the Australian Labor Party. We have never quite understood what their position is. I do not think they do have a position. Their only approach is to pick whichever approach will get them a headline and will allow some friends in the media to point a finger at the government. Whether they destroy the live animal export trade in the process does not really seem to matter. As I have said on many an occasion in this chamber, if Senator O'Brien has a good idea—and it would be a refreshing change if he did—why doesn't he tell us about it? From the government's point of view there are no particular politics in the live animal trade. If there is a difficulty and Senator O'Brien has the solution, let us hear it. But we never hear it. We always get pinpricking, political point scoring and doing what the union might have directed him to do that day.</para><para>I did not listen closely to everything Senator O'Brien said, but it became Mr Truss's fault that there was no security at the feedlots. Do we expect Mr Truss to go out with a team of armed people to surround the feedlot and look after it? I would have thought security was a matter for the state police forces. If Senator O'Brien has a complaint about state police forces, he should get on to the governments of the states. They all happen to be Labor Party governments, so it would be easy for Senator O'Brien to speak to his mates in the Labor Party and get them to beef up some security. The action in Portland has been shown to be a deliberate criminal activity. I am not quite sure why Mr Truss is responsible for that. I am not quite sure how Mr Truss can look after security. What we need, perhaps, is the Victorian police force to beef up security in these places—or perhaps it is the Queensland, New South Wales or South Australian police force; I do not know. If you have a problem with the police forces, Senator O'Brien, speak to your mates in the Labor governments in those states and get them to beef up security. </para><para>Again I cannot quite follow Senator O'Brien's argument. I understood him to be saying that we should let most of the sheep go. Senator O'Brien would know as well as anyone in this parliament that if these sheep then get to a destination in the Middle East and some prominent person in the Middle East gets up and says, `These sheep are contaminated,' then we have got the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express </inline>all over again. That would suit Senator O'Brien because he could stand up during every question time, he could make speeches here and he could blame the government and Mr Truss. That is what he is urging us to do. If we do that then we get into that same problem.</para><para>Unfortunately, running a government, particularly with international trade, is not a matter of political point scoring; it is all about trying to get a good outcome for Australia. That is exactly what Mr Truss has done. Again, it has to be very carefully looked at. It is not directly my portfolio and I have not had an opportunity to speak to Mr Truss, so I am not absolutely certain of what approach he has taken. But commonsense would tell me, as it would tell Senator O'Brien, that with this criminal activity and people who are deadset out there to destroy the live animal trade—that is what they are out there doing—that we have to ensure that the government of the country of proposed destination guarantee to take them or deal with them if they get there and some prominent person in that country convinces the consumer that they should not be accepting them. That is what commonsense would suggest you have got to do. You cannot do that overnight—it is a long and difficult process. That is what we had to do with the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>. Mr Truss had a magnificent outcome there. It was not easy—it was very complex, but he got there.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—I think you are right, Senator Ferguson: the Labor Party were a bit disappointed that it did end as well as it did.

The regulations have received widespread public coverage, and this is the first opportunity the Senate has had to disallow them. It is fairly clear from the public responses of the Democrats, the ALP and the Greens that there was wide opposition to these regulations.</para><para>I could, and have a desire to, speak at length about the matter, because it is a very serious matter and an area of great concern to me. I do note that we have only two weeks of sitting left and a lot of legislation to go through and that it is a matter that, to some extent, has been debated before. For that reason, and for that reason only, I will try to keep my remarks shorter than they might otherwise have been. I should point out that the government had the opportunity to have this debate when we had the special urgent sitting last Friday week. If it had been agreed to at that time then these current two weeks would not be taken up with this debate. I certainly feel it is very much the government's fault that time in these final two sitting weeks, when time is at a priority, is being used up on this debate when it did not need to be. However, all of us, not just the government, have to deal with getting through the business without sitting ridiculously late hours so, for the benefit of non-government senators rather than government ones, I will try to keep my remarks short.</para><para>These regulations do not just excise Melville Island and Bathurst Island from the migration zone, as I certainly thought from initial reports and as others may still believe. These regulations excise many thousands of islands off the coast of Australia, as far down as the Whitsundays, in my home state of Queensland, all the way across the top of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and quite a fair way down the other side of Western Australia. They were obviously introduced specifically to deal with the situation on Melville Island. There has been an enormous amount of debate and, indeed, coverage of the government's actions in relation to that, including the blatant misleading of the Australian people about the actions of some of the Kurdish people who arrived on the boat.</para><para>I would like to say a couple of things about this specific situation before talking more broadly about the excision of islands. Firstly, we had a pretty clear inference from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, that there could not really be a problem; that the people were from Turkey, Turkey is pretty okay these days and so they could not be refugees—and I will find the direct quote for my concluding remarks if senators wish me to do so. But quite clearly—and I am quite sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs knows this—Kurds in Turkey are still having a pretty hard time of it, as they are in Iran, and as they still worry they will be subjected to again in Iraq in the future. </para><para>Currently in Australia we have a small number of people, but nonetheless a number of people, from Turkey who are on temporary protection visas, according to figures provided by officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at Senate estimates just a couple of weeks ago. I think they numbered in the thirties, but I might be wrong there—maybe it was in the low twenties. I do not know whether or not those people are Kurds, I do not know how they arrived here and I do not know when they arrived, but it must have been within the last three to four years if they are on temporary protection visas, because that was when those visas were introduced.</para><para>Clearly, conditions in Turkey have been dangerous enough in recent times for at least some people from Turkey to be given asylum in Australia. For us then, to not just turn Kurds from Turkey around—and we all know they are subject to persecution there—but also turn our gaze away from people who clearly could credibly have been seen to be in need of protection from persecution is an extremely dangerous act, compounded by the fact that obviously Indonesia was not aware that that was what we were going to do.</para><para>Initial indications were that the Indonesians were sufficiently annoyed by this that they were going to take these people and shunt them all the way back or off to somewhere else—and it did not really matter where, just that it was out of Indonesia. My understanding is that that is why the UNHCR spoke out so publicly in opposition to the government's actions, which they do not normally do. They certainly express a view, but they are usually fairly diplomatic. They were much less diplomatic than usual, such that the government sent in a representative of their own to express concern to the UNHCR in Geneva, as I understand it.</para><para>The reasons why the UNHCR were much less diplomatic than usual were that they were genuinely scared and concerned that this group of people, having been forced back to Indonesia, might then be forced onwards again by Indonesia because Indonesia was so annoyed at what had happened. That would have been direct, blatant refoulement of people who, as I have said, quite credibly could have been seen to have had a genuine claim of a need for protection. That is a strong and very problematic aspect of the government's actions in this regard.</para><para>While I am on that specific instance, I should say that, from my point of view and from the Democrats' point of view, it is preferable for people to be assessed by the UNHCR in Indonesia than for them to get on very dangerous boats to come to Australia and be assessed here—as long as the process in Indonesia provides a reasonable prospect of resettlement if they are found to be genuine refugees. Some of that work is being done, and I support that aspect of the government's policy, which they have worked on in recent years. It is better all round, as long as the people are safe in Indonesia and as long as there is some prospect that they can be resettled in a reasonable time if they are found to be genuine refugees. We should continue to encourage that process, as long as Australia keeps taking its fair share of those refugees. I think the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs referred to that herself in one of her answers in question time today.</para><para>That is very different from, if they do get here, putting them at risk, turning them around and, as I understand from statements is what happened, leaving them in Indonesian waters to sail off to some port—particularly when as far as we can tell, as close as we can get to the truth of the matter, the Indonesians were not consulted. They certainly were not consulted in terms of: `What do you think we should do? Let's work something out together.' They were just told. </para><para>We were told that these people were not asylum seekers when quite clearly they were. I find it impossible to believe that anyone could think that they would not have attempted to ask for asylum. I remember the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs—with a previous hat on—when there was a lot of push from Labor to talk about a coastguard a few years back ridiculing that proposal a number of times. It is not one I support either—in the context of this debate, anyway. The reason why she used to ridicule it was that people who come here on boats come here, as she would say herself, to be found. They ask to be found; they seek to be found so that they can ask for asylum. She knows that herself; she has said it many times.</para><para>So the suggestion that somehow this group of people might have sailed over here and forgotten to ask for asylum—or did not think of it or were never going to ask—is ludicrous. That extent of willingness to weave a fabric of deception around so many aspects of this policy area is, I believe, one of the reasons why it is so problematic. That is a commentary on, or criticism of, the broader government policy. I have spoken on it many times before and I will speak on it many times again, but I will not go into it further now.</para><para>Moving on to the specifics of this regulation, I have spoken about the incident to which the government has sought to apply it. That incident has already happened. The people are now out of Australia again. There has been some legal opinion that the regulation may not be legally valid in relation to the Melville Island situation because, as far as we can tell, it was brought in a couple of hours after the people landed on the island. I do not know whether that is the case or not; it is a matter of legal opinion and interpretations of the act. At the end of the day the final interpretation of an act is not going to be decided by argument between senators; it is going to be a decision of a court, and until a court makes that determination it is a moot point. Given that the people are already out of the country it is even more of a moot point, other than to consider whether or not it is an issue to be addressed for future eventualities.</para><para>Another aspect of this is the broader issue of the regulations. The Melville Island incident has happened. There are still a lot of questions that need to be asked about it. I know that many in this chamber, including opposition senators—and Senator Faulkner has spoken about it—want to ask questions because it is an important issue of public policy and of transparency. But the incident has happened. We will investigate it; we will look at it as an incident. As they stand, the regulations leave in place the excision from the migration zone of thousands of islands around Australia. I believe on principle, and the Democrats strongly believe, that if you have a legal regime that provides certain restrictions, entitlements, rights and rules it should apply across the country and not only in certain parts of the country—depending on where you happen to be standing—unless there is a very good reason why it should be specific to a certain geographic location.</para><para>If you are talking about something as basic as what people's rights should be under a migration act—whether they are entitled to protection from persecution—then the idea that you can get protection from persecution in one part of Australia but not in another is extremely offensive. There is no logical reason why it should apply to islands and not to other parts of Australia, and I would suggest that there is no logical reason why the government could not simply seek to excise all of Australia for the purposes of application for protection visas. Maybe that is what they would like to do down the track: prevent people from even being able to lodge a protection visa claim onshore if they arrive without a visa. There is no rhyme or reason in terms of legal principles why you can do that if you get to one part of the country and not if you get to another. So on principle I think it is very dangerous. As one component of the Pacific solution it is something the Democrats have opposed across the board, so obviously we oppose this extension of it. </para><para>We opposed the initial excision of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Ashmore Reef when it occurred in 2001 and we opposed the insertion into the act of the power Minister Vanstone has now used to further excise other parts of Australia by regulation. Obviously we were not in a majority on that occasion, which is why we are having this debate today. Since that time the government, via the previous minister and the current minister, have attempted repeatedly to excise large numbers of islands—they might be slightly different islands in each case—first via regulation, which was disallowed; then by legislation, which was defeated; then by a second attempt at legislation, which was defeated. That of course now constitutes a potential trigger for a double dissolution, should the Prime Minister wish to use it.</para><para>Technically, under the law, the minister can gazette every six months regulations that do the same thing, if she chooses, and the Senate can keep disallowing them. While it may be technically legal, I would suggest that to do so is not within the spirit of that power when you have before the parliament legislation that does effectively the same thing that has been rejected twice. That gives a pretty clear sign that the Senate does not agree with it. Unless there is some reason to think that the situation has changed, it is flying in the face of the will of the Senate to continue to introduce regulations that produce the same effect. That is a reason why I think it is inappropriate for the government to continue to seek to introduce these sorts of regulations. Nonetheless, they have that power and obviously they can use it. If it continues to happen the Democrats will continue to disallow such regulations. There is always the problem that in the period between a regulation being gazetted and the Senate having an opportunity to move to disallow it these sorts of unjust and inequitable provisions can have legal force.</para><para>That is a problem that can only be overcome by removing the relevant provision from the Migration Act. That is something the Democrats would certainly like to achieve. We are always supportive of any moves to do that when we believe there is a majority in the Senate to do so. I certainly urge other parties—in particular the ALP—to give that matter some further consideration and remove that relevant provision from the act. Otherwise we could quite possibly be in this situation any number of times in the future whereby another group of people are treated the way this group have just been treated and all of the various questions and doubts about the legality as well as the morality of the situation will arise again. It is best if we remove the power once and for all, but in the immediate circumstance all we can do is disallow this particular attempt and seek to use other mechanisms to get answers to some of the questions that still need answers in relation to the specific Melville Island incident. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>17548</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor oppose the government regulations seeking to excise thousands of Australian islands from our migration zone. Labor have opposed the government's attempt to excise islands before. We will do so on this occasion, and we will do so again. The reasons Labor will vote to disallow these regulations are simple: they are not an effective way to protect our borders and they simply do not make sense. Furthermore, Labor will not vote for regulations that are based on lies and misleading the public.</para></talk.start><para>In the weeks since these regulations were rushed into law, the Liberal government experts have woven another web of deceit. If the government's strategy is so good, why does it have to lie to the public about the facts? If the legislation was really about border protection and national security, why did the first press release on the issue by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, run under the heading `Labor must decide on illegal immigrants'? The reality is that these regulations are all about politics of the worst kind and provide nothing about effective measures to protect our borders.</para><para>Whichever way you look at it, the government's proposal is wrong. It does not protect our borders and it does not treat people fairly. It is an admission that the current border controls do not work and that our existing migration system cannot cope with processing 14 people's claims. Most importantly, the government has not taken any steps to really combat people-smuggling by detaining and prosecuting the crew involved. The government has jumped straight to this diversion of excising our island territories—cutting them out of the Australian jurisdiction—which will not deliver security or equity. We saw Senator Vanstone admit today in question time that the government had let the crews go. The people that you need to provide evidence about the people smugglers were let go. It let the crooks go back to Indonesia, where there are no anti-people-smuggling laws. What an incredible indictment on this government that claims to want to protect against and to put a stop to people-smuggling. You let the crooks go. If the crooks are not kept here, you do not have any witnesses to provide evidence about who is engaged in the people-smuggling exercise. What a weak and pathetic government we have got: sending the crooks back, letting them go, knowing that they will not be prosecuted in Indonesia.</para><para>The regulations would have had the impact of cutting out thousands of islands not just to our north but all along the coast of Queensland as well. All of the Torres Strait islands plus islands as far down as off Mackay on the Queensland coast, including Magnetic Island off Townsville and many of the tourist resort islands along the Great Barrier Reef, would be excised—cut out. Clearly, none of these are relevant to the seas between Australia's northern coast and the people smugglers' source country of Indonesia, yet they are included in this regulation. The Liberal government's immediate reaction to news of a boat off Melville Island was not to ask why it had not been detected, nor to ascertain who the people were or what claims were being made. Its immediate response was to change the laws affecting our territory and sovereignty, giving away bits of Australia. That is the Liberal Party's strength—giving away bits of Australia.</para><para>We know that the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> travelled all the way from Indonesia without once being spotted by Australian surveillance—not once. It is almost unbelievable that this boat was able to land less than 80 kilometres north of Darwin without a single Coastwatch vessel or border patrol aircraft seeing it. Labor has already exposed through the Senate estimates process that this Liberal government has severely wound back its primary tool for detecting people smugglers through the Defence Force's Operation Relex. The Liberal government has cut the budget for coastal surveillance in this area by 40 per cent compared to the previous year. What another example of a weak and wimpy government and a weak and wimpy minister! It has cut by 40 per cent the moneys allocated to watching and protecting our northern coastline by winding back on aircraft and seacraft that were at the front-line of surveillance and interception. This Liberal government has put up the white flag to vessels both big and small coming across the seas to our northern coastline. </para><para>From initial reports, it appears the closest navel vessel to Melville Island was more than eight hours away. Eventually two naval vessels were deployed and a host of other agencies were brought together to deal with this breach of our borders. However, it hardly inspires confidence that the seas to the north of the capital city of Darwin are being closely monitored. Yet the Liberal government has ignored this central issue. In fact, Senator Vanstone's comments have made it quite clear she believes Australia cannot patrol all of our northern border. Labor is totally committed to strong border protection, but, simply put, you do not protect your borders by surrendering them, by removing your borders and cutting out islands.</para><para>The Howard government is running up the white flag. Far from protecting our borders by excising these islands, it is encouraging people smugglers to be more audacious and inviting them to head for the mainland. If you know a bit of Australia has been excised or cut out, you will head for the bit that has not been cut out—mainland Australia. It is logical. In fact, the minister responsible for border protection even admitted the government's new policy is going to encourage more boats to come directly to the mainland. In a media interview a day or so after the boat landed the minister said:</para><quote><para>If you want to come in illegally you have to make it to the mainland.</para></quote><para>With this policy of excising and cutting out islands, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is saying that he will decide which bits of Australia to hand over next to the people smugglers and how much will be handed over each time.</para><para>Labor say there is a better and more effective way to protect our borders. We want laws that stop people smugglers leaving countries, not invite them to head for Australia. We want laws that process asylum seekers in the country they first land in, not the last country they head to, putting their lives at risk and allowing people smugglers to rip them off by thousands of dollars. We want the people smugglers arrested before they leave Australia and if they do get here we want them prosecuted—put in jail, Minister, not just sent back home to Indonesia ready to ply their trade again. There are no anti-people-smuggling laws in Indonesia. Labor want a US style coastguard patrolling our borders. Any of these options could have had an effect in helping to stop unauthorised entrants. But the Liberal government's answer is to cut out bits of Australia—let us flick away the islands that are part of Australian territory, part of this nation, and have been since European settlement.</para><para>Instead of tackling content and substance the government opt for lies and diversions. We know the Howard government cannot be trusted on these issues. They lied about the children being thrown overboard. They lied about the full knowledge of the sunken vessel SIEVX. Now we can add the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> to the list. The government claimed Melville Island is a convenient spot for people smugglers to drop off their cargo—but the government were not patrolling the area. There were no patrol vessels there. Yet, supposedly, it is a convenient area. </para><para>The government claimed they detected a pattern of events that suggests people smuggling was involved in this incident and then they failed to even question or charge the crew involved, who could provide evidence about people-smuggling into this country. Several ministers advised that the people did not seek asylum, including the minister sitting here in the chamber today, Senator Vanstone. She said they did not seek asylum. And the PM thinks that it is `irrelevant'. It seems ministerial standards are now so low that the Prime Minister cannot see a problem with his ministers lying to the public. The government say they have an agreement with Indonesia and Indonesia say that they would not have a bar of it.

Why does the government think it is okay to lie about asylum seekers? On top of the lies we have inaction too. According to media reports, each of the people on this boat paid about $10,000 to the people smugglers to get them from Turkey to Australia via Indonesia. That is $140,000 that went into the pockets of various people along the way, including the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline>. Whether or not they were the `Mr Bigs' of the operation, it is fair for the Australian public to expect that the crew of this boat would at least have been held for questioning by the Australian authorities. If the Howard government is so keen to deter people smugglers from seeking out our shores, you would think they would use the domestic powers that they have to at least apprehend and put into custody and question these individuals. If the Howard government was so serious it would use its powers to charge these people with people-smuggling under Australian law and they would face fines of up to $110,000 and time in jail. But they are not even questioned and not even detained. However, this government seems to think that returning the little fish back to the seas in order for them to become bigger fish is a more effective treatment. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor says this is simply not good enough and it highlights the lack of the Liberal government's real commitment in this area. Staggeringly, the Howard government do not even appear to know where the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> or its crew now are. But the one thing that they did know right from the beginning is that Indonesia does not have any legislation for charging people with people-smuggling and therefore by returning the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> crew to Indonesia they have guaranteed that these people smugglers would never be charged. </para><para>The extraordinary chain of events that led this crew to be towed back to Indonesia and let off scot-free also involves a further murky chapter concerned with whether or not the Howard government misled the Indonesian authorities and other international agencies about their intentions in this matter. Indonesian immigration officials clearly believe they were misled about the Australian government's intention when they turned this vessel around. They advised that they would be launching their own investigation into Australia's actions, particularly those that led to Indonesia, as a non-signatory to the refugee convention, being left with 14 potential asylum seekers to protect and process. Unhappy about their deception in this matter, one Indonesian official commented:</para><quote><para>What do they think Indonesia is—a trash bin for these people?</para></quote><para>Today in this chamber I am going to spell out briefly for the Liberal government yet again what the real solutions—Labor's solutions—involve. The first part of the solution is to deal with people smugglers at their country of source. We must get countries in our region to sign onto the relevant international conventions that aim to prevent the flow of asylum seekers. More importantly, eight countries in the pipeline between the Middle East and Australia are not signatories to the 1967 protocol to the refugees convention. Seven of them are Commonwealth countries. The eighth is Indonesia. These countries form a continuous chain between the major source countries in the Middle East and Australia. This is the pipeline that needs to be shut down.</para><para>The Prime Minister has had numerous opportunities to press this with these countries, including at the Bali conference in February last year and at the CHOGM last March, but he has failed. The process must be reactivated. Labor have made the offer countless times over the past two years to the Liberal government to work with us to find a comprehensive solution that will stop the people smugglers, and on behalf of Labor I again make the offer.</para><para>The second part of the solution is to get Indonesia and other transit countries to make people smuggling a crime and to arrest people smugglers. Already, several people smugglers have been arrested in Thailand and in Australia, and no doubt this is already having an effect on the flow. Apparently Indonesia has such legislation drafted and Australia should be working with them to get it into law, not pressuring the relationship with the bungled handling of this case. The People Smuggling Task Force has told us that arresting people smugglers is the best deterrent. Yet we saw in this instance there was absolutely no attempt to arrest the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> crew so it seems the Liberal government's handling of the matter was a total rejection of this most effective tool in dealing with people smugglers.</para><para>The third part is to create a coastguard to intercept boats before they get here. It is affordable. Look at how much the Pacific solution has cost. We are now talking about something like $1 billion allocated to this farcical non-solution. A coastguard is needed not just for people smugglers. It is also to get the drug runners and the quarantine evaders. It is about making our country safer and more secure from those events and people seeking to threaten our sovereignty and break our laws. The fourth part of the solution is to ensure that the asylum seekers are processed in the countries they first arrive in, not in the country they last head to. The fifth part of the solution is to better handle claims that are made in Australia. We must improve the processing of asylum seekers' claims and the system of mandatory detention.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—What was the second part?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Senator Kemp should concern himself with protecting Australian artists and the Australian film industry rather than making stupid interjections like that.

The detention centres must be returned to government control and opened to public scrutiny. We must also get children and their families urgently out from behind the razor wire.</para><para>The sixth solution is to quickly repatriate people who have been found not to be refugees. This is a comprehensive plan of action that does not involve giving away territory or legal nonsense. Not one of these steps outlined above is being taken by the Liberal government. Excising islands from Australian sovereignty is just the start. What will come next? The Liberal government is saying to the people smugglers, `The more you come, the more we will give up.' Once the people smugglers start coming to the mainland the next logical move in this game is to excise parts of the mainland. That is not pride in your country. It is defeatism in the name of politics. People will get border protection from Labor but they will also get a fair system and they will get the truth. Under the Howard government they will get none of these. These regulations fail on all tests and Labor will not support them now or in the future. That is why we will be voting to disallow the regulations presented before the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>17552</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens strongly support the disallowance of these migration regulations and, like the Democrats, have moved in that direction.

No other country in the world does it like this—and it is for politics.

And it is done in a way that does not apply, for example, to the many more numerous people who overstay their visas and therefore come with illegal intentions and stay illegally in this country—but come by plane.

There is a great self-investment in what is happening here. It is inhumane, it is unbecoming and it is not, in my book, part of the Australian ethos. We saw how small-minded the Prime Minister can be about other people and their wish for success at the end of the Rugby World Cup on Saturday night, where his performance let down Australia and it let down the great Australian ethos of sportspersonship and the ability to admire other people for who they are and for their excellence of performance in whatever endeavour on our soil.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is the same small-minded nastiness of this government that we saw from the Prime Minister on Saturday night that is manifest in these particular regulations.

Why else did the minister and others connive to keep secret what was happening with that boat over some days after the asylum seekers had been taken from Melville Island? The whole action was unethical at best and, I believe, outside the law as well. I challenge the minister to table her legal advice at the time on that.

Mr Acting Deputy President, I thought you just might be interested in a meeting I had in my office this afternoon with some people from the Tiwi Islands council, in particular a Tiwi Islander called Gibson Farmer. Gibson had a gift for me, which was very kind of him. Gibson Farmer is the local islander who was on the beach and told these people to get back in the boat and shove off. Let me assure you, the Tiwi Islanders are very much in support of these excision regulations. They said in the past when we were trying to do it by way of legislation and regulation, and they have subsequently said, that they are in favour of it. And, unlike Senator Sherry, they understand that it does not mean they are surrendered from Australian territory. I do not know whether Senator Sherry ever did any law subjects, but I am surprised that whoever wrote the speech he conveniently read bothered to put that misunderstanding in there. Excision of islands from your migration zone has got nothing to do with surrendering borders or surrendering country. In fact, Senator Sherry probably knew that because he could not go on and say to whom these islands would allegedly be surrendered.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will deal with Senator Bartlett's contribution first. In commenting on the fact that two ministers said that the people had not sought asylum, he sought somewhat to twist the words and say that one or other of us had said that they were not, in fact, asylum seekers. I think Senator Bartlett needs to look carefully at what has been said in that respect. The government was always of the view that when boats coming here look like Indonesian fishing boats with Indonesian crew and people of some other origin on board it is likely the people will be seeking to come to Australia without the appropriate visas and will, when they get to Australia, either make an asylum claim or some other application for a visa. That has always been our clear understanding.</para><para>It was only Nicola Roxon, the spokesperson for the Labor Party, who was bold enough to assert that these people might be coming here to watch the rugby grand final. She, as I understand it, is the only person who did not understand that there was a real possibility these people would make an asylum claim. The point the two ministers made was: on the advice they had at the time, and on the advice that the People Smuggling Task Force had at the time, no such claim had been made. </para><para>I want to go back to Gibson Farmer, who, as I have mentioned, was the Indigenous fellow on the island who told these people to get back in their boat, pushed them off and organised for assistance with another local fisherman so that they could be towed away. Mr Farmer had a gift for me. His gift was a carved boat with a couple of carved boat people in it. He gave it to me as a reminder that the Tiwi Islanders are very much in support of these regulations. </para><para>Senator Bartlett said there was no logical reason why these islands should be excised from our migration zone and asked the question: why would you not therefore excise other parts of Australia? It is obvious to anyone who looks at a map that there are thousands of islands to the north of Australia. If you allow them to remain in the migration zone, you make it easier for people smugglers to get here. Excising these islands from the migration zone does not excise them from Australia. It does not excise or surrender any territory to anyone else whatsoever; it simply makes it harder for people smugglers. It says: `I'm sorry, Jack, you've got to come a little bit further. You've got to come a little bit closer and run a greater risk of being caught.' That is, of course, this government's policy. We will continue to make it harder for people smugglers.</para><para>Before I comment on Senator Sherry's contribution, I will conclude my comments on Senator Bartlett's contribution. I understand that he does not agree with some of these things and I have no reason to suspect that he is other than genuine in saying he thinks the regulations would not stand a legal test. The government disagrees and they are the facts of the matter. If he wants to fund some action to put it to the test, he is welcome. He is not going to do that, of course; he is going to use the power of the Senate, which he is entitled to do, to disallow the regulations. Nonetheless, they were validly made, because we have always said: `If you do not agree to excise these islands, this is the warning we gave you. People smugglers will try to bring people down from the north to land on these islands from which point they will make claims.' All that the Labor Party and the Democrats are very upset about is that this recent boat has proved exactly what we said would happen. I think the Australian public are very grateful that they had a government that was ready, had regulations signed and ready to go and could, within a matter of hours, bring together an executive council meeting to have the regulations gazetted on that day so that they would take effect on that day. That point leads me to the situation of the people in the boat.</para><para>Because the regulations took effect on that day, these people were never—never—in Australia's migration zone. They were not in a position to make any claim and that is a point that some members opposite seek to brush over or ignore. Senator Sherry thinks that in excising the islands we are saying that it is not possible to provide proper border protection. That is not the case at all. What we say is that in excising them you do provide much stronger border protection. Senator Sherry then went on to make a series of remarks about what he sees as being lies and as misleading the public and described this as being a murky episode. I reflect back on things that happened when Labor was in government that Senator Sherry would be fully familiar with and I am frankly surprised at the confidence with which he comes into this place, in particular, and refers to murky episodes, but I will say no more about that.</para><para>Senator Sherry then went on to make some remarks about what he described as a Labor policy, and I will come to that briefly in a minute. Before I do, let me make this abundantly clear, because it is very clear to me that no speaker who has spoken thus far wants this to be clear to the Australian public: Australia lives up to its responsibilities in terms of people who are seeking asylum. Our offshore protection policy means that anyone who wants to make a claim for asylum has the capacity to make it and have their claim heard. If it is decided that they need protection, that protection is offered. If it is decided in Indonesia that people are refugees and therefore in need of protection, they are given that protection and Australia takes its fair share of those people. </para><para>Let us not have any suggestion that we have some policy that is cruel and harsh—that does not allow for people who want to make a claim to make it and that does not somehow provide protection for people who need it. Our policy expressly provides for that to happen. Under the regional cooperation arrangements we have with Indonesia, thousands of people have been processed. We have accepted some of those as our fair share. There are others who have been rejected by the UNHCR as not being in need of protection. Many of them are still in Indonesia and still present a risk as people who may seek to come down through these islands to Australia to make another claim here. It is a fair bet that, if they are successful and they have been rejected by the UNHCR in Indonesia, they will be rejected when they come here. It is important to make the point that our policy does provide very adequately for people who are in need of protection to make their claim and to get that protection.</para><para>The other point that needs to be made very clear is that people who are in need of protection obviously have a right to make that claim and have a right to have that claim heard. There is no dispute about that. What they do not have is a right to pick and choose who will hear the claim or who will provide the protection. The international community must hear the claim and the international community must provide the protection. It is not like a box of chocolates where you can pick the caramel, the pineapple cream or the coffee cream. It is not as though you can pick whichever place you want. If you are in need of protection, you should be able to make a claim and it should be properly heard, but you do not have a right to say which country will hear it and into which country you will go for the protection to be provided. That is very clear.</para><para>Equally, it is important to make a point in relation to the suggestion that there has been some sort of reduction in coastal surveillance. Customs Coastwatch flights were reduced at one point, but not by much. It is important to understand that in one month or another there might be some 500 of these small Indonesian fishing vessels. I am told there are just over 300 in our economic zone. Let us say it is 300. What is Labor's coastguard policy going to do? Stop and interfere with every one of the 300 Indonesian fishing vessels that are passing around? Do we think we have the right to be the police of the oceans north of us and to stop people going about their legal business in international waters? Do we think we have the right to say, `Sorry, we're Australian; you're in international waters; stop, we want to search your ship'? Are we going to say that there might be no prima facie case, no intelligence, no reason for doing so, but we are going to provide enough vessels to search 300 Indonesian fishing vessels each month? Are we going to say that it is bad luck if somebody comes onto the west coast or the east coast—that we will use a few more boats there? It is a completely impractical policy, as Labor well understands.</para><para>Many of these people—hundreds of them—are good and decent people going about their proper and lawful business. They are engaging in trading between the islands, fishing or normal travelling between the islands for their daily activities. To suggest that all of these boats ought to be turned over regularly by an army of boats that the Australian community buys is, with respect, simply to misunderstand how effectively we can work by working with other countries, as we have been—that is what our regional cooperation arrangements are—and ensuring that people who want to make a claim can make a claim, that the claim will be properly heard and that people will get protection. </para><para>One of the speakers made the suggestion that the government has not paid attention to other people who come into Australia or stay here—who come in in another way or arrive legally and overstay. In 2002-03, the department located over 21,000 persons who either had overstayed their visa or were in breach of their conditions. That was an increase of 24 per cent over 2001-02. The figure then was just over 17,000. It is very clear that, with a very substantial increase in compliance—an increase of 24 per cent—we are interested in people who want to come in illegally by boat but we are also very interested in people who overstay.</para><para>Last, but not least, let me turn to Labor's suggested alternative. It is clear to me that these regulations are going to be disallowed. The Senate is going to send a signal to people smugglers that people do not have to bother coming all the way. People can land on the most remote island of Australia and from that point they can make their migration claim. The Australian community will go to the expense of getting them off that island, bringing them to the mainland, looking after them while the processing takes place, giving them access to the Australian legal system and then, if necessary, paying the costs of repatriating them back from where they came should that be possible. This is Labor's policy: bring them on in; bring them to the mainland; we will deal with them here.</para><para>I have looked at the items proposed as Labor policy. One was to work at the country of source. Of course we would like more countries to sign up to particular conventions, but we do not see ourselves as dictators to the rest of the world about what conventions they ought and ought not to sign. We do not take very kindly to other people telling us what to do, and we should not assume that other countries do either. People want cooperative arrangements, working together with other countries and encouraging people to take a particular course of action. But do we think that is a solution that is going to work in the short term? No.</para><para>The second proposition put forward was that we would deal with people smugglers in the country they are in. As if people smugglers march around a country they are in—a country from which they are going to send people to Australia—and identify themselves as people smugglers who wish to be dealt with! That is just a complete folly.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Bizarre.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>—It is bizarre, as Senator Kemp says—absolutely bizarre—to imagine that people smugglers will self-identify in other countries—or, for that matter, that other countries can easily identify them in advance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then we come to the good old chestnut of the coastguard. One senator rightly said that in the past I have disparaged the coastguard policy and that I continue to do so. We have resources: we have naval vessels, Customs vessels, Air Force aircraft and Customs Coastwatch. We say that all of these can be brought together and deployed at an appropriate time in an appropriate way. The reality of Labor's coastguard proposal would be the spending of many hundreds of thousands of dollars—last time I looked it was a billion dollars over a forward estimates period—basically to buy more boats. With 3,000 or 4,000 islands you will never buy enough boats to monitor every island. It simply will not work. Since Labor's policy now appears to be to bring them onshore, consider any claim they might want to make here and process them, the only purpose of these hundreds of extra boats that we presume are going to be required is to usher through the back door to Australia—indeed, escort—boatloads of people who do not have visas. We will open it up and welcome them in. </para><para>The fourth part of the policy is to process people as soon as they come. Of course that happens. Our processing times are very good. We are constantly working at reducing processing times. There is a misunderstanding in the community, which Labor promulgates day after day, and that is that refugees are locked up. In fact, as soon as it is ascertained that someone is a refugee they get a visa and they are out in the community.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—It takes years and years.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>—It does not take years and years, Senator. With respect, the processing times are very quick and not at all far off the times suggested by Labor. The people in detention are the people who do not accept the primary assessment that they are not a refugee. They want to go then to the tribunal, then to the Federal Court, the full Federal Court and the High Court. They are the people in detention. The last figures I looked at showed that we had just over 1,100 people in detention in Australia of which 11, at the time, had not had a primary decision. Only 11 had not had a primary decision. In addition to saying that there would be a quicker process, without identifying how one does that when people quite deliberately arrive without a visa and without papers, Labor is yet to spell out in detail how one quickly ascertains who these people really are and where they really come from. That is why this policy is a bizarre fantasy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor says they will work to find a better way to look after children. Welcome on board! Welcome on board a policy this government has introduced and which the Labor Party never did. The Labor Party introduced detention of suspected illegal immigrants, including women and children. The advice I have is that while the numbers were smaller at that time the proportion of women and children was higher, and the Labor Party did nothing. We, on the other hand, have a variety of ways of looking after women and children, largely by their choice as to whether they move out of the centres into residential housing projects. The bottom line is this: these regulations will protect Australia's borders. They make it harder for people smugglers and that is what this government is about. By disallowing these regulations you make it easier yet again for people smugglers, and I will remind you of that when the next boat arrives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>17558</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to add a few remarks on this debate on the disallowance of these migration regulations. I am pleased to hear that Gibson Farmer met with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs this afternoon. Gibson is in Canberra for the Australian Local Government Association annual conference as he is a member of the Tiwi Islands Local Government Council. In a radio interview on 5 November on 8DDD in Darwin on ABC radio, Fred Mungatopi, who is Chairman of the Tiwi Land Council—and would therefore be the most senior person representing the traditional owners on that island—was asked by the interviewer, Julia Christensen:</para></talk.start><quote><para>What is the reaction on the Tiwi Islands to the arrival of this boat with people on it who say they are from Turkey?</para></quote><para>Mr Mungatopi said—and I think this is one of the most ironic twists of this debate, which nobody has picked up: </para><quote><para>The Tiwi people do not want people to come here without our permission.</para></quote><para>He means the Indigenous people's permission. He means nobody is welcome on the Tiwi Islands at all—in fact, that goes across all of the Northern Territory with respect to Indigenous land—unless they have a permit from the Tiwi Land Council. The reporter then asks Mr Mungatopi:</para><quote><para>Do you support the migration exclusion zone?</para></quote><para>His answer is no. Not quite satisfied that he fully understands, she asks: `You do or you don't?' He says, `No.' She asks, `No?'

In fact, they make no distinction up there between asylum seekers, migrants, Chinese, Australians, or other Indigenous people. Coming onto their land without a permit is just not on. What they do not support is the migration exclusion zone being enacted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—The Tiwi council do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—I am talking about the land council. Your government has never come to terms with the difference between a local government council and the land council—the land council are the senior traditional owners and they have a say over the land on that island. Five times this man was asked by the reporter whether they supported the government's actions; five times he said no.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has never given the people on this island any explanation as to why they were not informed that this was going to happen. There was no prior warning and no consultation. There was no consultation with the Northern Territory government either and I understand the Chief Minister has taken that issue up with you. There was no explanation to the community in the Northern Territory or the people on these islands as to why the air space over the island was locked down for three hours. No-one was allowed to fly over the islands and no-one was allowed to land on these islands for three hours. No explanation was given to these people as to why that was the case. There was just a total shutdown. It was almost like a police state. No explanation has ever been offered to these people as to why that action was taken.</para><para>There has been no explanation to the community in Darwin as to why, when these people landed only 20 kilometres off the northern coast of Darwin, they were not brought to Darwin, where the government has spent $7.4 million building a temporary processing centre which has never ever been used. It has never, to this very day—and it has now been three years since construction—had one asylum seeker sleep one night in any of the 120 beds in a centre that cost $7.4 million.</para><para>We had the ironic situation where there was razor wire at the top of the fence, the community were in uproar about it, and the next day the razor wire was put at the bottom of the fence, at a cost of $38,000. The Darwin community complained about what an eyesore the temporary processing centre was, and the next day, $16,000 worth of palms were planted along the front so that it was somehow a little bit more acceptable to us as we drive along the Stuart Highway. And now corrugated iron has been put up between the demountables so that as we drive past we cannot get a little peep in to see what actually might be happening in this temporary processing centre. The latest I hear is that none of it is built to cyclone code. None of it will be secure enough in our coming cyclone season. If we have a cyclone, the $7.4 million demountables will go up in the air like Dorothy's house in <inline font-style="italic">The </inline><inline font-style="italic">Wizard of Oz</inline>. Maybe they will land on the Wicked Witch of the West, if we are lucky. </para><para>The issue with this government is that there is no consultation and there is an incredible amount of money wasted—$7.4 million on a processing centre only 20 kilometres from these 14 people from Turkey. All of the Darwin community is saying to me: `This is a government that is not tough on border security. It's got so many holes in its policy that you could use it as a tea strainer. It builds this detention centre and it never brings people to it. The next thing you know Darwin will be excised. If these people were smart enough and wise enough, they would've travelled the extra 20 kilometres and landed at Nightcliff Beach as they've done in the past.'</para><para>This is not a government that is tough on border security; this is a government that has a policy that is in absolute shambles. It cannot consult with the traditional owners, it cannot let the people of the Darwin community know what is happening and it has a huge white elephant sitting on the Stuart Highway at a cost of $7.4 million, which has never been used and was never intended to be used. How many houses for the Indigenous people on the Tiwi Islands could have been built with $7.4 million? It is a waste of money. It is a real smoke and mirrors trick by this government in terms of wanting the Australian public to believe they have this all under control.</para><para>The only thing you have under control, Minister, is the number of times you can pull the wool over people's eyes, con them, and get them to believe you are doing a good job. You are not doing a good job. If you lived at the top end of Australia, you would see that almost on a daily basis. No-one is at all fooled by the fact that you think that you have the asylum seeker problem under control. Now, of course, you have sent them all back to Indonesia without consulting that government and without bringing the people smugglers to account. You had them there on the shore, 20 kilometres from Darwin. The AFP could have brought those people ashore and held them in the courts, and we could have dealt with them. You could have actually questioned those people smugglers and stopped them, but you sent them back to get out the map, have another look and say: `Oh, my God, if we'd just gone another 20 kilometres, we would've been right there at Casuarina Beach. Let's not make the same mistake twice, guys; we'll head for the mainland in future.'</para><para>You do not have a policy that is under control. People are starting to wise up to the fact that this policy is not working. I think the events of November in relation to these asylum seekers and the Tiwi Islands showed the fundamental flaws in your policy. This is a disallowance motion that is well worth supporting, until the Australian people finally realise that there is a party out there that has a decent policy that will get this whole situation back on track.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>17561</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In conclusion, and as a perfect segue from Senator Crossin's comments, there is a party out there that could sort this out. Of course, I would suggest that party is the Democrats. Nonetheless, in relation to this particular measure, it is pleasing to have a commonality of views from the ALP, the Democrats, the Greens, and, I am sure, some of the Independent senators. As I said at the start, I will not use up all of my time. That does not mean that it is not an issue that I have very strong views about, but I will try not to add to the time pressures in this final fortnight. </para></talk.start><para>There are a couple of points that I think do need emphasising. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs spoke about the cost and how, if we disallowed this, it would mean that the Australian taxpayer would have to pay the cost of bringing people to the mainland and `looking after people'—as she put it—while we determined their claim. I think it is more commonly known as putting people in detention than looking after them. That insistence by the government on detaining people is very costly. The insistence by the government on having excised offshore places such as Nauru and paying for them through the taxpayer is very costly. The cost of shifting all of the Vietnamese boat arrivals that came a few months ago from right next door to a detention centre in Port Hedland to Christmas Island, where they still reside, was very costly and utterly unnecessary.</para><para>Senator Crossin spoke about the cost of the Darwin detention centre that has never been used. A huge, or fairly sizeable, detention centre is planned to be built on Christmas Island that will be incredibly expensive—far more so than if it was built on the mainland. Accommodation has already been built for the detention centre that does not exist yet on Christmas Island that has to be maintained. It is very expensive. All of that cost is unnecessary. So to suggest that somehow the Senate's disallowance—the removal of the excision—is a problem in terms of cost, I would suggest, is a farce. It is the government that are expending millions and millions of unnecessary dollars purely because of their wrongheaded approach to dealing with asylum seekers and people who arrive without visas.</para><para>We need to be accurate in our language. It does not mean we have to necessarily accuse people of deliberately misleading, although there clearly has been some of that in this debate over time. The Democrats believe excising islands does not protect our borders. To use the phrase `border protection' is simply a misnomer. Treating somebody differently when they get here does not make us less or more safe, or our borders less or more protected. As we have seen with this case, the issue is how they are treated when they arrive rather than whether or not they are some sort of threat that we need protection against. It is pretty clear, I think, to Australians now that any alleged or possible threats to our security from people who arrive here from overseas come from people like the Frenchman who received some publicity in recent times, Willie Brigitte. He was in this country for over six months and allegedly was a trained terrorist looking to do some very nasty things. That is where the threat to our security is and that is where I would suggest the money needs to be spent, rather than on all of the surveillance that is continuing to be spent in our northern areas. I would also apply that to the expense of a coastguard, at least as far as it relates to people who are arriving here seeking protection. The real people we need protection from are those who are potential terrorists, and that is where the resources should go.</para><para>The minister said, `Anyone that looks at a map can see why we would excise islands and not the mainland.' My understanding is that these regulations excise islands all the way around the east part of the Queensland coast down as far as the Whitsundays, but they do not excise Darwin. It is a lot easier for this group of people we are talking about to get to Darwin than to the Whitsundays. I hasten to add that I am not suggesting we should excise Darwin, but I think the suggestion that islands have some special character just because they are closer is not borne out by geography either. It is simply a matter of extending the principle, and the principle is one that the Democrats do not support. </para><para>In responding to some of these issues I am trying to keep the debate as much based on facts as possible without getting too much into emotional rhetoric. To try and increase the community's understanding about the facts behind this issue it is sometimes harmful to get too worked up—although I must say I find it difficult not to get worked up about it when I see what the human consequences are. The minister spoke about this making it harder for people smugglers to ply their trade. I do not know whether or not excising these islands that are contained in the regulation makes it harder for them. It is acceptable to suggest that one could at least try to argue the case that it does make it harder for people smugglers—maybe it does. I will tell you who it makes it even harder for: refugees and asylum seekers. If we have a policy that makes life harder for people who are innocent, who are guilty of nothing other than fleeing persecution, then I do not believe it is a policy that should be supported. I think we need to find another way. A policy that makes life harder for people who have already suffered so much is one that should not be supported, even if it does make things a bit harder for people smugglers as well.</para><para>The minister also said the purpose of this is to put people in a position where they cannot make a claim.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—No, I didn't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I thought the minister said that the purpose of excising things was to put people who arrive on those islands in a position where they cannot make a claim.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—On the islands, yes.

What we are doing is sending them back for somebody else to deal with. I do not believe that is an appropriate response. As I said in my earlier remarks, if we have an opportunity to get people assessed in other areas, that is good—it saves them risking their lives getting on boats. But if they have done that and they have got here then we should not add to it by turning them around again, particularly where we do not have a guarantee that they will not to be further moved on. That is particularly my concern in relation to this Melville Island incident, and I would suggest that it was the concern of the UNHCR.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other aspect that I want to emphasise again and clarify from what I said before is that assessment in Indonesia by UNHCR is fine as long as people have a reasonable chance of resettlement. They do not actually get resettlement in Australia if they get a temporary protection visa. That is, in the cases of many of them, all that we offer them. They are denied resettlement assistance because, according to the logic of a temporary visa, they are not settling but are just here temporarily. So they actually do not get a chance to resettle. The minister said in her comments, `This isn't a cruel and harsh policy.' I am sorry, but it is. </para><para>There were many people here today in this parliament who are temporary protection visa holders. They wanted to send a message of thanks to the people of Australia, for having had the opportunity to be safe here, for being welcomed by people and for being supported by people in the community. But the fact is—and this is the fact that they wanted to emphasise—they are not secure and their future is not safe. They live in fear of being sent back to a place which our own system has recognised as a place where there is a genuine fear of persecution. They have had their futures stolen from them. They would like to have a clear future—one other than living in perpetual fear of being sent back to somewhere that our own system has recognised is a place they have very good reason to be fearful of.</para><para>You simply cannot deny the suffering that those people are going through. There are thousands of them in Australia—I think over 6,000. Some of them were here today, firstly, simply to say thank you and, secondly, to try and give people—parliamentarians, the media and others—the opportunity to look at it in terms of the human cost to these people. It is fine to talk about overall policy, intent, what it is going to do, what it means for people smugglers and all of that, but what it also means for individual human beings—for the children and some of the young girls that were there today singing our national anthem—is that they are going through hell. They are going through hell because of our policy—our country's policy, I hasten to add, not the Democrats' policy.</para><para>We simply cannot pretend that it is not a cruel and harsh policy. It may not be the government's desired intent, but it is a consequence. As I said before, any policy that, as one of its outcomes, generates enormous extra suffering for people whom we recognise to be refugees is a policy that must be changed, whatever else it achieves. That is broader than just the excision we are talking about today; that goes to temporary protection visas. Temporary protection visas through designated offshore places are a key part of this government's strategy. Excising islands is another part of that, and temporary protection visas are a key component of that. Even with them getting assessed in Indonesia it does not guarantee them a reasonable chance of resettlement inasmuch as those who do get to come here are still liable to be in a position where they are temporary.</para><para>Those facts of the situation do need to be recognised as part of this debate. I would hope that as we genuinely seek to wrestle—and the government and the minister no doubt will be forced to wrestle—with the dilemma of the thousands of temporary protection visa recipients in Australia who are genuinely fearful of returning and are simply looking for a clear future, one where they can actually contribute fully to the Australian community, we will have to look at a policy shift somewhere along the way. Excising islands is, in some ways, a small component of that. It is almost peripheral to the trauma of those thousands who are already in Australia, but it is part of the policy that has led to this situation and it is part of the policy that the Democrats certainly believe needs to be changed. For that reason, I am pleased that the anticipated successful outcome of this disallowance motion will occur.

It also ensures that Australia remains an international leader on action to preserve the Earth's ozone layer by implementing the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</para><para>We are all aware of the threat that damage to the ozone layer represents to the personal health and economic wellbeing of all Australians. The ozone layer protects life against the damaging effect of the sun's ultraviolet radiation and is being destroyed by emissions of ozone depleting substances. Australia is particularly susceptible to the increased health risks and potential economic damage to our primary industries as a result of our proximity to the greatest area of depletion and our outdoor lifestyle.</para><para>Australia's ozone protection legislation has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone depleting substances. Through cooperation between Government and industry, the legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by over 80% since its enactment in 1989, resulting in estimated savings to the Australian economy of some $6.4 billion by 2060.</para><para>To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone-benign substances and technologies, including the synthetic greenhouse gases—hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. These gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer, but are potent greenhouse gases with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. For example, the hydrofluorocarbon 134a is thirteen hundred times more potent than carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. Although these gases currently comprise only a very small part of Australia's overall greenhouse gas emissions, their use and emissions are on the rise as substitutes for ozone depleting substances. </para><para>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the CSIRO have concluded that the likely impacts of climate change for Australia include a warmer and drier climate, with more extreme hot days, cyclones and storms, droughts and floods. These changes are expected to be widespread, and may significantly impact on our society and economy.</para><para>As a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Australia is required to adopt policies and measures to mitigate climate change. The amendments introduced by this bill will deliver on this Government's commitment to manage synthetic greenhouse gas emissions, as detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The amendments also implement the key recommendations of the Government's review of the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation under the National Competition Policy. This review involved extensive consultations with governments, community and industry stakeholders.</para><para>Specifically, the bill extends the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone depleting substances to also include their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. However, it is important to note that synthetic greenhouse gases emitted as byproducts during the production of aluminium and magnesium, which are being addressed through voluntary programs, are not the focus of this legislation and will therefore be exempted by Regulation.</para><para>The bill also simplifies the current regulatory arrangements for end-use control of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives by replacing existing State and Territory legislation with a single national framework.</para><para>The framework will allow the Government to enact regulations to target preventable emissions, and adapt these controls over time to reflect changes in technologies and practices. In implementing these controls the Government will draw upon industry expertise and experience, including through the use of industry boards. The States and Territories agree that replacing existing controls with the proposed nationally uniform approach should deliver environmental gains more efficiently, and realise benefits to industry in terms of increased certainty and consistency.</para><para>The bill reforms the current financial arrangements for the ozone protection program to establish the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Account. The reforms will accommodate the additional regulatory responsibilities assumed by the Government under this bill and increase transparency by consolidating all financial arrangements into one account. The new arrangements will, on a cost recovery basis, fund administration of the amended Act and programs to reduce the environmental impact of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements.</para><para>The bill also ensures Australia remains at the forefront of global ozone protection by implementing the Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The Beijing Amendment requires a ban on the trade in and manufacture of bromochloromethane, and a ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries not committed to its phase out.</para><para>All of the amendments in this bill follow extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders over the last four years and have received widespread support. Industry views them as providing necessary certainty and consistency in regard to its obligations to effectively manage ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements.</para><para>This bill demonstrates the Government's determination to further advance its practical and effective approach to managing ozone depletion and climate change. Close collaboration with affected stakeholders in the development and implementation of the approach minimises its commercial and administrative impact, while delivering real environmental benefits. </para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1818">OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</inline></para><para>This bill forms part of the legislative package of reforms to the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation, which is designed to create a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases where they are used as a substitute for ozone-depleting substances. </para><para>This bill will extend the existing levies on imports of ozone-depleting substances under the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Act 1995 to the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements for ozone-depleting substances.</para><para>Levies collected under this bill will enable the Government to administer, on a full cost recovery basis, the licensing and quota scheme of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 as amended by the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003.

While it focuses primarily on enhancing domestic arrangements it will, through the examples it sets, also contribute to parallel international objectives. </para><para>The bill will amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 which implement a range of Australian policies and treaty commitments promoting non-proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons.</para><para>The measures in this bill will strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities, material and related information, and for application of non-proliferation safeguards to them. They will also enable Australia to bring into force legislation banning nuclear weapon tests ahead of entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and will implement changes to the machinery of government which will improve the effectiveness of each of the Acts affected.</para><para>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act gives effect to Australia's safeguards commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under our safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Further, it provides a framework for implementing our network of bilateral agreements concerning transfers of nuclear items.</para><para>These arrangements continue to serve Australia well. However the measures in this bill increase their effectiveness, important at this time of proliferation uncertainty.</para><para>The class of material which may be declared as associated material and thus regulated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act is broadened. This will ensure effective controls on the full range of materials which are specially suited for use in nuclear fuel cycle activities or prohibited activities such as the production of nuclear weapons.</para><para>A permit requirement is introduced for the establishment of any new nuclear or related facility. This will ensure that non-proliferation safeguards measures can be fully integrated into the design of any new facility. The new provision will also underscore Australia's ability to apply the principle that planned nuclear activities are fully transparent to the International Atomic Energy Agency.</para><para>Measures to prevent unauthorised communication of information that is proliferation sensitive, or that is critical to the physical security of nuclear material, are strengthened by the introduction of two new offences. The first new offence applies to conduct which breaches procedures set as a permit condition and intended to protect proliferation sensitive information. The other new offence applies to the unauthorised communication of information which could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material.</para><para>In order to improve the security of locations where nuclear or related material is held, the bill introduces provisions which will allow a permit under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act to prescribe an area to which the permit holder must restrict access. A new offence is introduced for unauthorised entry to such an area.</para><para>In strengthening measures designed to reduce the risk of proliferation, this bill updates penalty provisions contained in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act to bring the setting of fines into line with current legislative practice.</para><para>The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 gives effect to Australia's obligations under the CTBT. The Treaty bans nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions, and requires that a global monitoring network is established to verify compliance with the Treaty. In addition, States Parties are obliged to allow on-site inspections to clarify whether or not a nuclear explosion has been carried out in violation of the Treaty.</para><para>While the CTBT has widespread support, with over 100 nations having ratified to date, the very specific requirement that 44 particular countries must ratify to trigger entry into force remains more distant than the Government would wish. Australia continues strongly to support and promote entry into force of the CTBT, and already has in place 15 of the 21 treaty monitoring facilities it will host.</para><para>This bill offers an opportunity to make one additional and very clear gesture of support for the test ban. The bill amends the commencement provisions of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Act so that key provisions of the Act can be proclaimed in advance of entry into force. When these amendments are in place the Government will immediately bring into effect provisions which ban nuclear testing in Australia and any contribution to such testing by an Australian citizen. </para><para>The bill effects a number of amendments to provisions in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Act to better enable Australia to respond effectively to any request for clarification or for an inspection to demonstrate compliance with the CTBT. </para><para>Whilst an on-site inspection is very unlikely in Australia, this is an important aspect of the CTBT, and our national legislation should be fully consistent with treaty obligations.</para><para>Each of the primary Acts amended by this bill is administered by the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO), however each Act adopts its own name for the office which will implement it and for the title of the Director of that office. The bill provides in the case of each Act that the Office of its Director may be referred to by a name or title specified by the Minister in the Gazette. This will facilitate practical naming arrangements under the umbrella of ASNO, or of any future administrative structure.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1782">TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</inline></para><para>The Prices Surveillance Act 1983 was legislated twenty years ago. It was one element of the then Government's prices and incomes policy. Just as the economic environment has changed markedly since that time, so too has the role of prices surveillance. No longer is prices surveillance properly seen as an adjunct to an incomes policy. Rather, in a modern, open and flexible economy, the role of prices surveillance is to complement a vigorous competition policy. This bill seeks to reflect this reality.</para><para>As the Prices Surveillance Act deals with matters that restrict, or could restrict, competition it was included on the Legislation Review Schedule and reviewed by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission recommended, and the Government subsequently accepted, that the Act be repealed and replaced with a new part to be inserted into the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>Schedule 2 of this bill gives effect to that recommendation, but preserves the existing powers relating to prices surveillance. Transferring those powers to the Trade Practices Act is consistent with the view that prices surveillance is now an element of competition policy.</para><para>Like the Prices Surveillance Act, the proposed Part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act provides for selective surveillance of the prices of certain goods and services, at the discretion of the Minister. Declared companies and authorities are required to give notice to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission before increasing the prices of notified goods or services and to wait a statutory period before implementing an increase. The inquiry body, at the direction of the Minister, may inquire into prices charged and conduct certain other inquiries, such as investigating options for pro-competitive reform. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is to be designated as the administrator for the prices monitoring provisions of Part VIIA.</para><para>The Minister would determine who would undertake an inquiry, according to the relevant circumstances. An inquiry body separate from the regulator would be appropriate where the Minister considers there is a possible conflict of interest involving the regulator. However, in other circumstances, the expertise of the regulator may help to expedite an inquiry.</para><para>Under Part VIIA, the Commission, or other body in the case of certain inquiries, will be obliged to take steps to protect the confidentiality of certain information that could damage a competitive position. Part VIIA also provides that an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of a decision by the Commission to make information public, if a person subject to price notification claims the information is confidential.</para><para>Prices oversight is to be made more effective, but not more onerous, with enhanced compliance mechanisms. A Chief Executive Officer of a company subject to prices oversight, or a person nominated by the Chief Executive Officer, would be required to sign a declaration stating that the information they give is true and correct. A new sanction is provided against a person who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading monitoring data to the Commission. </para><para>Most businesses operate in competitive markets and price controls can worsen existing inefficiencies and deter investment. Part VIIA provides that prices surveillance will only be applied in those markets where, in the view of the Minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. However, the Government would retain its ability to protect consumers where appropriate through the mechanisms contained in Part VIIA.</para><para>Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 concerns access to services of facilities and regulates access regimes. Schedule 1 of this bill proposes to amend Part IIIA to clarify the ability of State and Territory access regimes to confer duties upon the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also seeks to clarify the conditions under which a law of a State or Territory may confer functions, powers and duties upon the Commission or Tribunal.</para><para>I commend the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1843">FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM AMENDMENT BILL 2003</inline></para><para>The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSR Act) has put in place a harmonised licensing, disclosure and conduct regulatory framework for financial products, markets and service providers.</para><para>These reforms are intended to promote investor protection and improve market efficiency. The reforms embodied in the FSR Act, once fully in place, will deliver significant benefits to both consumers and industry participants.</para><para>The FSR Act provides consumers with enhanced protection due to improved conduct and disclosure requirements. The reforms will provide an environment in which investors can be confident that those who provide financial services and products are effectively regulated and have appropriate training, competence, skill and integrity.</para><para>The enhanced disclosure regime is designed to ensure that investors will be better able to compare products and services and make investment decisions through the provision of timely, reliable and clear information.</para><para>The reforms introduced by the FSR Act also provide significant benefits to industry participants through establishing a common regulatory regime across all financial services. They replace a fragmented patchwork of industry-specific arrangements with a uniform framework that allows the provision of innovative financial services and compliance with only one regime across a variety of financial products.</para><para>In recognition of the magnitude and scope of the changes and the work entailed in their implementation, existing industry participants were provided a two-year transition period to move into the new regime commencing on 11 March 2002.

Let me take one of Australia's finest regional universities, the University of New England, in Armidale, as a case in point. Since 1996, over $128 million has been torn out of the university. Student to staff ratios have exploded by a staggering 30 per cent in the last few years, to the detriment of both the overworked staff and the learning environment of UNE students. The Howard government has declared war on regional Australia. Not content with destroying Medicare—the safety net that provides Australians in rural and regional Australia with affordable, quality health care—as well as selling off Telstra when communications services in the bush are unacceptably poor, the government is moving to downgrade the educational infrastructure servicing the regions.</para></talk.start><para>Unlike the government, Labor recognise the valuable contribution institutions such as the University of New England make to Australian regional communities. Labor's Aim Higher package provides $150 million for a community engagement fund that will support our regional and rural universities. We are committed to putting money into regional universities, just as we are committed to providing the funds our entire higher education system needs. Labor will invest $2.34 billion into our TAFE and university system. This will include a $450 million universities of the 21st century investment fund to reform and modernise Australian universities. Labor will repair the damage this government has caused to institutions such as UWS and the University of New England.</para><para>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, my voice is but one of many that have spoken against this bill and all of its previous incarnations. The loudest voice of unrest has been that of students and their student organisations, so it is not surprising to see that the government has used every opportunity to raise the issue of voluntary student unionism. It is precisely because student organisations do such an excellent job for students that the Liberal Party wishes to disband them. The Liberal Party has previously moved legislation to that effect and lost in this chamber. This issue has been to the High Court and the ACCC. Not once has the right of students to organise and defend their rights been dismissed. Vice-chancellors welcome the culture that student organisations create on campuses and the services that they provide to students. Everyone benefits from universal student unionism, and not one court, commission or inquiry has found otherwise. The Liberal Party's attacks on student-controlled unions are only intended to silence student voices against the government's blatant attacks on them and their universities.</para><para>No less vindictive is the government's attack on staff unions. Let us face it: this government has never believed in the right of workers to bargain collectively. As far as Minister Andrews and his bully boys are concerned, the law of the jungle must prevail. They are so determined to turn this country into an industrial battleground that they are willing to sacrifice our education system to fulfil their anti-union, anti-worker agenda. Tying $400 million of university funding to an industrial relations agenda is both cynical and cruel. What do bans on handing out union membership forms, reducing union involvement in the dispute resolution process and threatening the level of redundancy payouts and maternity leave of our hardworking academics have to do with improving our higher education system? This part of the bill alone casts grave doubts on the government's commitment to quality higher education. This government is playing politics with our education system, and future generations will pay the price for its selfish games. </para><para>An inquiry has just been completed into skills shortages in Australia. The inquiry's report, <inline font-style="italic">Bridging the skill</inline><inline font-style="italic">s divide</inline>, contains some extremely disturbing findings. Australia is in the grip of a skills crisis thanks to the lethargic inaction of the government. This bill will only serve to take that skills crisis to an unheard of intensity. One of the most urgent shortages facing Australia is in the health and education sectors. We are desperately short of nurses and teachers, and the government's attack on both VET and our higher education system will exacerbate this crisis. How can we expect to overcome this skills crisis when 20,000 Australians miss out on university places every year?</para><para>According to the OECD's <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance 2003</inline> report, Australia has the second lowest increase in the rate of enrolment in universities in the OECD. This government just does not seem to care. It refuses to offer any assistance for funding unmet demand at TAFE and thinks it can fool the Australian community by claiming to have created new places for nurses and teachers at our universities. In reality, it will not. These extra places will only replace already existing enrolments that the government underfunds, and it will actually reduce the number of places overall.</para><para>Only Labor have the vision this country needs to arrest the skills crisis. We are committed to creating 20,000 new full- and part-time TAFE and university places every year. Labor will encourage the take-up of maths and science based courses by reducing HECS fees for these courses by $1,600 per annum. What is more, we have in place a detailed plan to specifically combat the shortage of nurses in our community. We will fund an additional 1,100 new undergraduate nursing places and 500 additional new full-time HECS-funded postgraduate nursing places every year from 2005. We will also increase teaching places by 1,700 at an undergraduate level and provide 500 extra places at the postgraduate level every year from 2005.</para><para>How is it that the government is only willing to offer less than 700 extra nursing and teaching places over the next four years—especially when those places are, as I have already said, make-believe? Once again, the government has been exposed as tricky, mean and lacking in policy vision. The difference between Labor's education policies and those of the government are like night and day. We are proud of our commitment to higher education. On the basis of this bill, all that those opposite can do is hang their heads in shame. This bill is not just an attack on universities; it is an attack on Australia's future. The rhetoric of quality, diversity, specialisation and choice belie the harsh reality of exclusion, intervention, expense and elitism that will prevent many Australians from going to university. The bill is a hidden dagger to universities and should be known as `backstabbing Australia's future'. For all of these reasons, I and the Labor Party will vote down this legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17574</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline>. In particular, I want to address the issue of Indigenous people and the compounding effect that this bill may have upon their access to education. I suppose the reality of the Indigenous experience is entrenched in inequality, particularly with the historical legacy of social, economic and cultural exclusion. I think those things alone provide the context in which Indigenous issues as they relate to education also need to be dealt with.</para></talk.start><para>There have been some recent studies that talk about the issues between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Even though this government has spoken about the practical reconciliation agenda, which was supposed to be looking at fixing the areas of education, health, employment, housing and so on, it is important to remind ourselves that since it came to power in 1996 there has been a relative decline across most of those areas. Full-time employment for Indigenous people has declined in absolute and relative terms. In relation to the rest of the population, the average income of Indigenous adults has declined in that same period. In education, there has also been a large decline in school retention rates, particularly participation in tertiary education. And, of course, the issue we know about the most is that the relative life expectancy of Indigenous people has worsened over the Howard years, mainly due to the improving status of the non-Indigenous population, and now stands at 20 years and growing.</para><para>I think when you look at the bill it is important to look at all those indicators of how well or badly things are going and what sorts of things the government might do to have an understanding and a vision of what is required to make universities better institutions to respond to the questions that confront Indigenous people and what is required to improve educational outcomes for our youth, especially the disadvantaged students from the low-income areas and, more particularly, Indigenous students.</para><para>I want to focus on the participation of Indigenous students in higher education, as the effects of government plans on Indigenous students are exacerbated by their already marginalised position in Australia's educational landscape. The education statistics for both young Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians are of concern. A recent report by the ANU highlights that the educational outcomes for Indigenous people have, as I have said, already worsened under the current government. I have highlighted before on many occasions that we are not talking about problems that cannot be fixed. The Indigenous population contrasts significantly with the rest of the population. Of the 410,000 Indigenous people in Australia, about two-thirds are under the age of 25. This means that 240,000 are under the age of 25, and most of them are under the age of 18. That fact alone should highlight to the government that it needs to strengthen its education initiatives for Indigenous people. Less than half young Indigenous people aged 15 to 19 are attending secondary school. Consequently, only about 10 per cent are completing their higher school certificate. For non-Indigenous Australians, 70 per cent are attending secondary school and about 30 per cent are completing their HSC. Also, almost one-third of Indigenous students had no formal qualifications of any sort before they entered higher education, compared to only 7.7 per cent of non-Indigenous students. In 2001, some 70 per cent of all those commencing Indigenous students gained admission through special entry arrangements, compared to 20 per cent of non-Indigenous students. </para><para>Arguably, this highlights that higher education is about making up for the shortfalls in primary and secondary education for Indigenous people, which highlight a failure on the part of state and federal governments to look at using a coordinated approach to address Indigenous education levels. Also, problems in educational outcomes need to be addressed in the light of other areas of Indigenous life—those things that I have already mentioned: employment, health services, breaking out of the existing cycle of poverty and so on.</para><para>It is for this particular reason that special entry programs for Indigenous students in higher education are important, but they can only be part of the answer to delivering better education outcomes. These programs cannot be used in isolation, and ongoing support to Indigenous centres and Indigenous staff is vital if institutions are going to see great improvements in retention rates of students and staff and in student outcomes. Indeed, the Australian Council of Social Services in their submission to the Senate inquiry on this particular bill claimed that poorer students already have a significantly lower level of university participation and that this is likely to worsen under the government's approach. ACOSS argues that the package will contribute to a growing divide in three particular areas: a divide between those people able to attend universities and those who are not; inequality between the universities that poor and wealthy students attend; and a disparity in the capacity of universities to deliver quality education.</para><para>Indigenous support centres across all universities are feeling the pinch of tighter funding by the government towards higher education. Whilst these latest reforms are likely to have a profound effect on all students, the effect on Indigenous students will be compounded because the government's higher education reforms provide a limited and token gesture, in my mind, to giving support to Indigenous education. Those working in the higher education sector are sending the message that the current initiatives coupled with the overall package will do little to increase Indigenous people's participation in higher education, and the reforms do not provide the support needed to improve educational outcomes.</para><para>The reforms I refer to include the additional $10.4 million funding for Indigenous students. It is the first increase in funding since 1996. I would not want to see this injection in jeopardy but I do believe it is long overdue. The reforms also include staff scholarships. There is a grand total of five to be given across 38 universities, worth only $20,000 for one year. For even the most low paid academic or higher education worker this is a small incentive to stop work and concentrate on studies. It is inadequate to meet the financial needs of one person, let alone an entire family. It forces universities to compete for the small number of places. I believe the number and size of the scholarships needs to be increased. In relation to establishing a council to advise the minister, the minister so far has been supportive of recommendations put forward regarding the composition of that council and this is the first time Indigenous people have had a voice in higher education since the 1980s. I would hope that the minister ensures that the council has a strong role so that they might redeem something out of the government's reforms.</para><para>Commonwealth learning scholarships are worth about $2,000 and $4,000 per year. They are not necessarily specifically targeted at Indigenous students, which is something that does need to be addressed, and the tax implications are uncertain. Clearly, the government is out of touch with the reality of university costs for students, as $80 per week is barely enough to cover rent these days, and it would be impossible to cover rent for students who live in places like Sydney. In relation to the five-year learning entitlement, the government restriction on the length of time a student can receive student allowances is of course likely to have a harsh effect on Indigenous students who often take longer to complete their degrees for a variety of reasons, such as family and community commitments. This restriction, in my mind, is unnecessary and will cause an increased financial burden on Indigenous and non-Indigenous students who already face massive HECS debts. </para><para>There is one issue, however, out of these reforms that I would like to explore further and that is regarding the tying of funding allocations to workplace reform. I would expect that the $10.4 million Indigenous student funding is not tied to workplace relations; however, $404 million of university funding is tied to workplace reform, which I think illustrates a desire for micromanagement on behalf of the government. If the government is committed to backing Australia's future I am puzzled to understand how moving to AWAs or individual staff contracts can either improve the experience of the first-year university student or make teaching and research better.</para><para>What the government have done is to make funding contingent on an arrangement that staff are ideologically opposed to. The government say that they are creating a more flexible and effective workplace and work force, yet the logistics and the practical application of their agenda would lead to the exact opposite if you asked universities to make individual staff contracts with every single staff member. I think it could amount to an administrative nightmare.</para><para>Some of the initiatives aimed at improving Indigenous participation in higher education not only require a holistic approach but also need to have the support and the commitment from the most senior levels of the institution and the community in order to succeed. It is becoming increasingly difficult to rely on the present government in relation to improving educational outcomes for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. So each university also needs to look at their own commitment to Indigenous education and ask whether they are providing adequate support for the needs of their students as well as the needs of their Indigenous staff. This commitment will not only come in the form of special entry programs and funding for support centres which recognise the degree of difficulty about access as it currently stands but institutions, I think, should also look at the way they deliver their courses and whether there are opportunities to include block release courses or to utilise Internet technologies. Most importantly, institutions need to show their commitment by looking at the attitudes that they portray to the wider community and certainly to their corporate partners. </para><para>Institutions will be able to ask for up to 30 per cent more for student fees in particular courses. This could change the composition of students so that only the wealthy will be able to access higher education. If this is the case, the educational future for Indigenous people will be marked by even more uncertainty than what we currently see. It means that Indigenous people will have to rely on the goodwill of each of the universities to show a commitment to a diverse student body and, hopefully, consider channelling these funds into a special entry program or programs aimed at delivering outcomes and trying to improve access for Australia's most disadvantaged students. So often universities talk about their commitment to reconciliation, and I believe it will be initiatives like those I have just mentioned as well as scholarships and ventures with the business community and alumni that will demonstrate this intention.  </para><para>I think that inroads do have to be made in relation to Indigenous educational opportunities to ensure that a new generation of leaders is able to emerge and be nurtured. We cannot go on and on with the litany of statistical disasters that we see in the Indigenous communities. Education is one of the government's pillars of `practical reconciliation', and in order to demonstrate that I believe we need to see more proof than what appears in the current bill. The effect of the bill will be to compound the problem for many of the students that are there and deny access for those that may think about that possibility in the future. If the government is serious about joining Indigenous people in trying to fight poverty to overcome the circumstances of welfare dependence, I think it is up to the government to provide leadership. Indigenous people are certainly sending out the right message so it is not a question of needing more research. It is a question of political will and action. </para><para>We can address these issues. I do not believe that the nation can afford a future generation of Indigenous people missing out on a solid education and the subsequent employment opportunities that it generates. So I think that, if we are talking about Backing Australia's Future, it really does come down to looking also at the context in which that is done, particularly for those at the low end of the scale—low-income earners and, more particularly, Indigenous people and those that aspire to take up studies in the universities in the future—so that they have an opportunity to take up professions in Australian life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>17577</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given the time, I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill.</para><para>This is a bill that has the potential t irrevocably change the higher education system as we know it and which will lock thousands of young Australians, particularly those whose families are living on low to middle incomes, out of higher education forever. It is a bill that has the capacity to particularly disadvantage those living in my home state of Tasmania.</para><para>We have been hearing a lot in recent days about proposed changes to the bill before us. Changes Minister Nelson has been forced to make because of the overwhelming clamour of voices telling him that this is a fundamentally flawed bill. But nothing I have read to date—even were it all to be true and were the Minister to deliver on it all—none of it amounts to anything more than fiddling around the edges of an abhorrent piece of legislation.</para><para>None of the proposed changes will impact on the fact that Australian students will pay more, and in most cases a lot more, for the right to realise their full potential by attending further education. None of the proposed changes will impact on the huge lack of equity inherent in this bill. The Minister is not proposing to remove his power to dictate what courses a university can teach, nor the link between university funding and this Government's obsessive, ideologically driven, industrial relations agenda. And there is no provision for indexation of funding to universities—no certainty into the future.</para><para>As a participating member of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee, I took part in the hearings into the Government's higher education package that were held in my home city of Hobart back in September. I must say, that as much as we can learn from reading Committee reports and submissions, nothing quite compares with being able to hear people speaking in their own voices about issues that concern them. The people who attended the hearings that day were united in their opposition to the Government's package and in some cases visibly distressed by the impact that they could see that this legislation would have on universities and community life in this country were this bill to pass. </para><para>One of the major flaws in the Government's plan for higher education is that there are simply not enough HECs places for the number of young Australians who want, and should be able, to continue to higher education.</para><para>In Hobart both the Vice Chancellor of the University of Tasmania and the Deputy Secretary of the Tasmanian Department of Education told the Committee how Tasmania has been dudded by 1000 places. Mr Michael Stevens, Deputy Secretary of Education explained very clearly how this was the case, he said</para><para>“Tasmania has 2.42 percent of the 15 to 64 age cohort, yet the university only receives 2.29 percent. That includes both the University of Tasmania and the Australian Maritime College. If you take out the Australian Maritime College, on the basis that it is a national institution rather than a Tasmanian higher education provider, that reduces to 2.18 percent—which, if you follow the maths through, is a shortfall of about 1000 places at the University.”</para><para>This problem is further compounded in my home state because of the remarkable success of the Tasmanian Labor Government in improving student retention rates. From 1996 to 2002 there has been an increase from 54.2 percent to 75 percent of students continuing to year 12. Unfortunately in that time there has also been a reduction equivalent to 650 places at the University of Tasmania. So the State Government should be congratulated for its success in encouraging young Tasmanians to take the first step towards realising their true potential whilst the Howard Government stands condemned for refusing to support them further.</para><para>Whilst I am on the subject of Tasmania, it needs to be pointed out in no uncertain terms that this package could result in the total demise of the Australian Maritime College. This institution which provides training to students from across Australia ran a deficit of $200 000 last financial year. This is on top of deficits in previous years as well. Under these proposals, the Australian Maritime College would face a cut of around a third of its funding, or $10.3 million over the term of the package.</para><para>Senator Barnett, who also participated in the hearings, asked one of the witnesses if he thought that Minister Nelson were lying when he had guaranteed that no institution would be worse off under the proposal and cast doubt on the veracity of those figures that had been proffered by my colleague Senator Carr who was chairing the Committee. Unfortunately for Senator Barnett, the figures came from the Department of Education, Science and Training and had been published on the front page of the Australian's Higher Education Supplement.</para><para>We haven't heard a lot since then from Senator Barnett about the fate of the AMC or Minister Nelson's supposed “no disadvantage clause”.</para><para>When asked how the AMC might survive such a cut the Vice Chancellor of the University of Tasmania, Daryl Le Grew said “it will be extraordinarily difficult for them”. Mr Stephens said “that would be extremely difficult” and Jeffrey Watts, President of the AMC Branch of the National Tertiary Education Union, suggested they might resort to “lamington drives perhaps”.</para><para>This package will result in staggering fee hikes, with universities being able to increase HECS fees by up to 30%. This will ensure that young Australian's start their working life crippled by debt and severely limited in their choices whether it be to start a family or to purchase a house or whatever other path they may want to take in life.</para><para>Without any provision for indexation, it is certain fees will have to rise. As Professor Bruce Chapman told the Senate Inquiry on 10 October:</para><para>“... if there is no change to the indexation—and this sort of price instrument [30 per cent HECS increases] inevitably means a radical change in the burden of financial resources—no institution will be able to survive down the track without increasing their HECS charges ... All the institutions down the track in my view will have higher HECS arrangements.”</para><para>For those who are also unfortunate enough to have to enter into a FEE-HELP loan, they will be forced not only to have to pay interest on these loans at 3.5% above CPI but to repay their HECS loans first—thus accumulating a greater debt whilst they do so. </para><para>As Mr Benjamin McKay, President of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations told us in Hobart,</para><para>“The most basic financial planning rules would direct a person to clear their interest bearing debts first...... But the Government wanting to force students to accrue interest on a FEE-HELP debt while repaying their HECS debt can only be interpreted as a blatant attempt to suck more money from those least able to pay. The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 obfuscates this issue. Be wary, Senators, and do not let such a proviso through, whether as a regulation or as legislation. The student fee stone is dry; no more blood can be sucked from it.”</para><para>Well Mr McKay can rest assured I for one am remaining very wary. In fact it would be safe to say I am more than wary, I am both alert and alarmed.</para><para>So we have a situation under this bill where those who are lucky and smart enough to get one of the limited HECS places face paying 30% extra for that place and a further likelihood of incurring a market rate interest bearing debt as well. Meanwhile, those who can afford to pay up front will be virtually guaranteed a place regardless of ability and pay less in the long term to boot.</para><para>And who is likely to suffer most from this blatant inequity? The same marginalised groups who always get hung out to dry by this Government—those who are living on low incomes, women, Indigenous Australians, people with a disability and those living in rural and regional Australia for starters.</para><para>Last Wednesday (19 November), new figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that Australian women's total wages are now less than 65 per cent of male total earnings, the lowest level in seven and a half years—wage equality in Australia is going backwards under the Howard Government.</para><para>When the Howard Government took office, men on average earned $229.10 a week more than women. Seven years later the average gap has widened to a massive $308.70 per week.</para><para>The gap between men's and women's average full time earnings has also widened from $163.20 in 1996, to $194.90 in May 2003.</para><para>These figures are important in the context of these planned changes to the funding of university places as it is blatantly obvious that women will be saddled with debt for far longer than men as it will take them longer to repay their debts due to this income disparity.</para><para>In New Zealand where the Government deregulated university fees and introduced interest rates on student loans in 1992, the Government has already had to implement changes to write off interest rate payments for low-income students after repayment times had stretched to 17 years for men by 1999 and a staggering 51 years for women. Despite these interest rate write-offs, repayment times are still estimated at 15 years for men and 29 years for women.</para><para>Whilst women have made considerable inroads into higher education, the fact remains that a newly graduated woman cannot expect to earn the same as a newly graduated man and that income disparity continues over the course of a woman's life. We are hearing much from Minister Nelson of late about boys' education and the need for change there because boys are slipping behind girls in educational attainment, but we don't hear much from him about this other end of the equation where women are still not reaping the benefits of their so-called advantage and systemic discrimination still leaves them behind at the end of the day.</para><para>Women will be further disadvantaged by the imposition of the five-year learning entitlement. The Howard Government has made much of its claim to be committed to increasing numbers of health professionals and yet for example, a woman wanting to achieve post graduate nursing qualifications in say midwifery or mental health, will exhaust her learning entitlement and incur FEE-HELP debts or have to find the money to pay up front. Labor will impose no such time limit on learning.</para><para>I also note that this package makes some pretence at addressing equity issues in employment within universities for Indigenous Australians. The package offers five, yes count them, five postgraduate scholarships for Indigenous staff around the country. </para><para>As Mr McKay from CAPA told us in Hobart, in response to a question from my colleague Senator Crossin,</para><para>“There is not really much we can say to that, except phrases like `tokenism' and `too little too late' come to mind. ...... When the Minister gets up and talks about a commitment to improving Indigenous access to education and the role of Indigenous educators in the system and then comes out with five—Hansard might like to record I was speechless on that”.</para><para>I should point out here that Labor's commitment in the same area is to provide 200 such scholarships as well as nearly double the amount of funding to support participation in higher education by Indigenous Australians ($20m as opposed to $10.4m).</para><para>I will not speak at length on the Howard Government's plans to link university funding to compliance with its industrial relations agenda. Many of my colleagues have and will address this issue. Suffice to say, this is yet another example of this Government's indecent obsession. As Vice Chancellor Le Grew told us in Hobart, ,.,.we do not know why there is a continuing and obsessive commitment to something which appears to be more ideologically driven than logically driven at the present time”.</para><para>Well those of us on this side of the chamber do know why. Because obsessions are by definition not rational or logical and this Government is completely obsessed about ripping away by whatever means it can, the capacity of working Australians, be it on building sites, on our wharves or in our universities, to collective bargain to ensure good conditions and safe working environments. Enough said.</para><para>I will end with what may seem to some like a minor issue in the overall scheme of such an appalling piece of legislation but it is an issue that goes to the very heart of university education and community values.</para><para>As long ago as the year 1200, after a 3 way struggle between city authorities, the bishop and the masters and scholars of Notre Dame, the king conferred a charter protecting the independence of the masters and scholars from the townsmen. In 1988, some 400 university leaders, including some from Australia gathered to celebrate the ninth centenary of one of Europe's oldest Universities, Bologna. They set down their views as to the requirements for a successful university. Their Magna Carta included the statement “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of University life, and governments and universities, each as far as in them lies, must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement”.</para><para>And yet here we have Minister Nelson with the stroke of his pen wanting to interfere at the very heart of a university; at a university's right to determine what to teach—and to give this power to any future minister. I am certainly wondering what would have been the fate of many of the women's studies courses that helped shape much of our thinking on issues relating to women had a minister of the day been allowed to knock off that type of subversive course. The same could be said of many other courses that may not get the ideological tick—perhaps some of those teaching industrial relations better start rewriting their course content if they want to continue to receive subsidised places. Similarly people who are doing research that may not sit neatly with a future minister's religious beliefs—they can forget that PhD I'm afraid.</para><para>The Minister is keen to knock off courses that can't readily have a dollar value attributed to their outcomes, what he has called “cappuccino courses” and yet it wasn't so long ago that he was telling people that there is more to life than the markets.</para><para>In a speech he gave to the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy Northern Region Supporters Forum in May 1999, Dr Nelson told those gathered:</para><para>“Much to the bewilderment of some of my parliamentary colleagues, I have said that the destiny of this country will be determined not by the economic indices with which we are so understandably obsessed, but by our values and our beliefs—the way we relate to one another and see our place in the world”.</para><para>Well if Minister Nelson truly believed what he was saying, then he should keep his hands off universities' autonomy. Because when it comes to our community values and our place in the world, universities are like miners' canaries. The canary dies and everyone else better get out as fast as possible because the environment is toxic. </para><para>Australia needs a robust, independent university sector which can both lead and reflect the cultural concerns of our community. We need a university funding system that guarantees access to students based on ability not ability to pay. Only Labor will deliver those things because only Labor believes in them. This Government certainly doesn't as this atrocious bill testifies.</para><para>I will not be supporting this legislation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17581</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> I want to commence by sharing with the Senate what Minister Nelson said when he was promoting the legislation to a group of university students. He actually said that what this proposed legislation does is offer the community, students and the wider group of Australians real choice. I think what we should do is look quite clearly at what those choices are.</para></talk.start><para>What indeed is being offered to students who are looking at taking up study—maybe for the first time—and to people who are looking at funding study for members of their family? What we have seen, through this legislation, is a choice for those who can afford to pay for education. We already know that Australian students are now paying a higher contribution towards current courses than are most other students across OECD countries. The percentage is already too high. In fact, when the system of HECS was introduced it was a contributory system; it was never intended to pay for over 50 per cent of the cost of education. But, increasingly, over the last seven or eight years HECS has been rising, and people who are looking at education now are being asked to pay, through their own contributions, way too high a price—and we know the cost of that.</para><para>What the legislation before us this evening does is, in effect, make that choice harder because the proposal accepts that the HECS payments will increase and it deregulates the payment of the student contribution—the expectation is that these increases will be great. Already through this proposal there can be an increase of up to 30 per cent on the current rates of HECS in universities across our country. We have already seen one major university accept this challenge—and a challenge and a choice it is—to raise HECS contributions. According to the government, what we could also see is the option for universities to lower these charges. So far, that choice has not been offered to any student in Australia. So, through this legislation, the choice for families who want to access higher education is that they must pay. There is no option.</para><para>Not only will HECS fees be increased but, through this legislation, there will be a greater offering of full fee paying places in universities. So those people who are fortunate enough or who have the choice to access funds will be able to buy education as a marketable commodity. People will be able to make a choice, according to the Nelson plan, to take up education, but it will be at a cost. Already, through the process of the Senate committee hearings where people across the country were interviewed about the proposed legislation, we have heard that studies by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training have found that, under the current system, annual student expenditure exceeds their income by about 21 per cent and that seven out of 10 students are now in some form of paid employment. They are working to help fund their education, and the number of hours that the students are working is greater. So, as well as the load of obtaining an education and fulfilling the dreams that they and their families have, they need to work to maintain an income so that they can survive through the period of study. </para><para>This is even before any element of HECS debt comes in; this is just to live during the period they are studying to obtain a degree, a diploma or some form of education. The number of hours that students are working on average is increasing so, as well as a full study load, students are balancing full workloads. There is extensive research that shows the impact on students of trying to make this balance, of trying to fulfil the increasingly onerous requirements of the education plans they are undertaking and the expectations of work. Anyone who visits a university in our country would see the flow of students in and out of the campuses—particularly the people who are doing study outside normal hours.</para><para>There is no such thing as a `standard student'. The persons who are looking for an education are all ages, they have families, they have children. One of the more confronting experiences I had over the last couple of months was talking with a group of students at one of our Queensland campuses who were raising children as well as balancing their study. They were having to work out the demands of child care as well as working, attending classes and tutorials, and trying to fulfil the demands of their normal lives. This particular situation has been studied quite comprehensively in some areas because of the absolute lack of paid child-care places, particularly out of hours. We heard of students who are already struggling with decisions about whether they can fulfil their study requirements while wondering about whether they can do it at the same time as looking for child care for their kids.</para><para>There is something quite exciting about seeing families where a mum or a dad is making the choice to attend university studying in the library with their kids beside them playing quietly, as they must in a library, because there is no available child care on the campus in the evenings or because they just cannot pay the extra up to $190 a month to cover their child-care requirements. That particular issue is one that must be considered in the overall issue of looking at the choices that people have when they are looking at taking up university study.</para><para>When the process of this particular legislation was being discussed through the Senate committee, we met with students and educationalists across the country. At the hearing in Brisbane, I was particularly taken by a young man who looked at the issue of balancing the threat of the new legislation with his requirements for study. He said:</para><quote><para>Throughout my degree, I have had to take on additional work to supplement my income just to survive. This has, without a doubt, affected my capacity to concentrate on my studies. I'm making a submission to this committee for the first time. I've made the choice to come and talk to a Senate committee because I feel that I've been one of the many students that have genuinely struggled under the current system of deferred HECS and youth allowance.</para><para>Further I feel that if HECS payments are increased and scholarships are to affect the capacity to receive other government assistance then there will be many genuinely worthy students turned away from university. What particularly bothers me is the capacity of someone with money to enter into a course on lower academic levels.</para><para>I can genuinely say that if HECS payments were increased at this institution that I am studying at I probably would not have chosen to study. I would probably have ended up working at the meatworks at home because that was a job I could get. I don't pretend to be really hardly done by nor do I argue that I am a special case. I know that there are many others within the university who have had to struggle in the same way.</para></quote><para>The threat of the legislation changes before us now were so real to that student that he felt he had to share his story with the committee and also with the community. We have seen people who have experienced their own choices and found that they have been limited. They believe that their stories can have an impact on people in this Senate who can vote to accept the changes or not. </para><para>When Minister Nelson was consulting over the last 18 months leading up to this legislation, there was genuine hope in the community that there would be a chance for real change in the higher education area. There was agreement that there needed to be changes. The experiences of people in the system now are difficult. The experiences of university vice-chancellors and boards trying to make the budgets meet to ensure that we can have a dynamic university sector are difficult. But there was hope that there would be a chance to make cooperative changes.</para><para>What has happened with the legislation is worse than having no consultation at all, because hopes have been built up, expectations have been created and there does not seem to be much change. As I have said, we have the choice to have a pay-as-you-go education system: if you can afford to pay, you will be able to access the brave new world of the higher education scheme. The legislation we have combines changes within the university system with some very strong philosophical issues that we have faced under the current government in other fields. In particular, in this legislation there is the linkage of changes to the university system with funding threats linked absolutely to a change in the industrial relations system within the university sector. Numerous commentators have questioned how the proposed changes to the industrial relations system genuinely impact on university reform. </para><para>If Minister Nelson is putting before university communities a genuine choice, why then is there only the government's industrial relations plan to access the additional funding? Why then is there no choice for universities in that process? Why must there be the standard industrial relations process, which we have seen before from the current government linking the process of AWAs and forced bargaining that does not include communal activity through unionism or through community activity in any way? Anything that is not through the standard industrial relations process that has been favoured by the government has been taken away. It is one thing if there is an option but the choice put before the governing bodies of the universities is that if you do not accept the offer given to you by the government—which follows the standard industrial relations mantra—you will not be able to access this particular pot of money. That is not freedom of choice; that is clear direction and moulding in a set image which will be laid down, and there will be no choice.</para><para>I think what disappoints me most about this legislation is that it has been packaged in such a way that desperation has been created amongst the people in the university sector. There is a genuine fear that, if this legislation is not passed by a certain date in exactly the way that it has been imposed on the Senate, people will miss out. Fear has been created. What I cannot balance is the acceptance that there was going to be positive consultation and that there would be understanding and cooperation, when genuine negotiation is where people of true trust and common purpose can sit together and find common ground, but what has happened instead is that that has been removed. </para><para>Instead, we have almost desperation being expressed by university communities which say on record, `We don't like the package. We don't like the threat of the industrial relations proposals. We don't like the attempted bullying of changing the size of our governing bodies. We don't like the linkages of different aspects and we certainly don't like the intrusion of the government in the day-to-day activities of the university. We don't like any of that. But if we are to receive the necessary funding—the funding that we have all agreed across the community is necessary to enthuse and grow and make the Australian education system positive and dynamic—if we are going to obtain that part of the deal, we must accept all the other parts.' That is not negotiation and that is not free choice; that comes damned close to blackmail and bullying. I would have thought that the best way to keep people together and on side is to have the openness and the choice that was so promoted by Minister Nelson in his consultations with the community. That would be the way that that would be achieved. </para><para>When we spoke with students at the University of New South Wales, they were talking about their hopes for the future. When we talk about the issue of the third level of education in our community, we should look at not only the students of today but also the students of the future who are coming through the system. In this place tomorrow we will be having a meeting of Youth Parliament. Young people have chosen to be part of the wonderful experience of learning about how our political system works and to take part in the activities of Youth Parliament. Those young people are the students of today and tomorrow. What choice is this legislation providing for them and their families? Must they continue to make choices that will limit their ability to go into the particular fields of study that they think will best suit them? Must their families take out extra loans—and this is happening now—to help fund university studies? Must we have the situation where, through their study, students take on pre-acquired debt that will hang over them for the rest of their lives? We have found cases where, on current earnings levels, people will be looking at a debt that will grow and stay with them for 15 or 20 years into the future. That process is added to when people take on other levels of debt through normal living expenses.</para><para>Taking on long-term debt to fund their education cannot be seen as a choice that people must make. This was not the intent of the original HECS; it was not the intent of the changes to HECS in the past. But it is clearly the reality of this legislation. The expectation is that some courses will cost up to $100,000. We have not found too many students who can afford that. Kids across the country have before them critical choices that they face now as they are finishing school. Last week young people were finishing off their grade 12 or equivalent studies and they were looking towards their tertiary education. It is tough enough in 2003, but, should the changes proposed in this legislation come in, their choices will be narrowed. As I said earlier, the focus will be on the idea that those who can pay will succeed.</para><para>Through the Senate process, we have found that knowledge creation and knowledge transmission must become essential for collective social and economic wellbeing and progress. If our community truly believes that—if we truly believe that the concepts of growth, knowledge and the sharing of knowledge are the way towards social and economic wellbeing in our community—we must be able to offer access to education to people who need that chance. We must be able to offer that not just to school leavers but to people who want to come into the education sphere at any level of their life. The current legislation will make that more difficult. That choice will be more difficult.</para><para>What we must have—and what the proposed consultation around this legislation was claimed to be about—is sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. They were the catchcries of the consultation. Our education system will not be able to be sustained if it relies on inbuilt wealth. The quality of education is something that we all agree must be maintained and enhanced. That requires from governments at all levels—particularly the federal government—a genuine commitment to invest effectively in our future. The equity aspect of education has been discussed by a number of previous speakers. The small number of scholarships that have been put before us in this legislation and that have been touted as adding the aspects of equity and diversity are not good enough. The choices around those scholarships do not provide the options that our students require. </para><para>The government may have had some plaudits for the conduct of the Crossroads inquiry. Indeed, many people felt stimulated by the chance to look at the future of education. What has happened, though, is that the reality and the fear of the changes involved in this legislation can lead to only one thing: removal from education and a lack of choice for our students rather than the enhanced choice which was the intent when the report was put out in 2002.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>17585</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As so many speakers before me have emphasised, the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> are no solution for our higher education system. They are simply another nail in the coffin of an equitable and accessible higher education system in this country. Since coming to power, the government has cut $3 billion from higher education. By and large, students are being forced to make up for the shortfall in fees and to take the negative consequences of inadequate funding with a generally lower quality of education, overcrowded classes and overworked academics.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Labor Party opposes the move of Australia's higher education system towards the American style system where money matters more than marks in opening university doors. Since 1998, full fee payers have been able to buy a university place at an Australian university ahead of people with higher marks, people with greater intelligence. Degrees costing as much as $150,000 are available to those who can afford to pay this large amount. Under the legislation we have before us, up to 50 per cent of all university places available will become full fee paying. Students will be encouraged to take out interest-bearing loans to cover the costs of taking up a full fee place.</para><para>I believe—and the Australian Labor Party believes—wholeheartedly that all Australians should have an equal opportunity to get into university based on their ability, not on their ability to pay. No Australian should be given preference simply because they can pay more. Labor believes that access to university should be based on a student's achievements and his or her potential, not on how much his or her family can afford to pay. The coalition government has stated its vision for the future of Australia's university sector. Its vision is one that would see an end to equal access to education through a system that is based more on ability to pay than on the merit of the individual student. </para><para>Between 1996 and 2002—since the Howard government has been in office—universities in my state of South Australia have seen a reduction in funding of $390 million. The cuts just keep on coming and under this government it is estimated that a further 862 university places will be lost across South Australia if this legislation is passed. That means 862 students—who otherwise would have had the benefit of a university education—will be excluded from this opportunity if this legislation is enacted. I will quote at length from the submission of the University of Adelaide to the Senate inquiry into this bill because I think it covers a lot of very important points that are important to a lot of universities, particularly to the University of Adelaide. The submission said: </para><quote><para>A further reduction in the number of fully funded higher education places available to students will result in even more eligible South Australians moving interstate in order to obtain a fully funded place in their chosen degree, with the very real risk that these students will not return to South Australia at the conclusion of their studies. This in turn will have a deleterious effect on the South Australian economy and labour market, unnecessarily perpetuating the rationale for removing these places in the first place.</para><para>Should South Australian universities be forced to reduce the level of overload without being compensated with fully funded places, cut-off scores for programs will inevitably rise. Preliminary data analysis conducted by the University of Adelaide has shown that with a reduction in the number of offers in more popular programs of between 10-20%, cut-off scores will rise substantially. This will create a domino effect, as unsuccessful eligible students will then be forced to accept places into their lower preferences, which will in turn result in the increase of cut-offs for many other programs. Some students may miss out on a place altogether, or be forced to move interstate. None of these outcomes is beneficial to South Australia.</para></quote><para>As I said, I think that passage from the University of Adelaide's submission highlights the deleterious impact that this legislation will have upon South Australian students and also on the South Australian economy and labour market if students from South Australia are forced to go interstate in order to study and choose not to return at the completion of their studies. The committee recommended in its report:</para><quote><para>The phase out of overenrolled places should not result in a reduced number of places for Australians nationally or regionally. </para></quote><para>In other words, the committee really took up the points that were raised in the University of Adelaide submission and made the point that the phase-out of overenrolled places should not result in a reduced number of places in the regions. However, it is clear that exactly the reverse will occur under this legislation. </para><para>According to the Department of Education, Science and Training, last year there were 32,232 marginally funded places nationally. The number of new fully funded places under the legislation is only 24,883. This is around 6,700 fewer existing HECS places than last year's numbers. Those figures speak for themselves: 6,700 fewer HECS places. To get the extra funding for fully funded places under this initiative, universities must reduce their overenrolled load to two per cent of the agreed undergraduate target load over the three-year transition period or they will face severe financial penalties. </para><para>This means that universities must begin cutting HECS places next year rather than in 2007, when the replacement funded places become available, in order to avoid these penalties. This will be necessary in order to allow those students currently enrolled to complete their degrees. After 2007 publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. This means that because of the government's policies a diminishing proportion of Australians will be going to university. In contrast, Labor's package, Aim Higher, will create over 20,000 new full- and part-time university places every year for Australians starting a degree. This legislation means that increased numbers of eligible school leavers will miss out on a place at university. </para><para>In my home state of South Australia, one of the other universities, Flinders University, currently has around 729 marginally enrolled places. In order for it to reach the two per cent target load that I referred to—which is 144—without substantial additional funding, the student association estimates that the university may need to scrap at least 585 HECS places. Such pressure to shed additional students may mean measures such as increased preclusion, failure and the cutting of `unprofitable' courses at the university.  </para><para>Not only will students find it more difficult to get a place at university, they are also likely to have to pay much more for one. Under this legislation, the Commonwealth Grants Scheme will replace the current base operating grants system from 2005. The Commonwealth will provide a contribution, set by discipline, towards the cost of an agreed number of Commonwealth supported places actually delivered in a year. The remainder of the costs of providing each student place will be funded by the student through a HECS contribution.</para><para>This aspect of the government's package has serious consequences for access and equity in the higher education sector. Students from low socioeconomic backgrounds will, like other students, face stiffer competition for university places. However, these students are statistically less likely to achieve the marks required for a HECS funded place and, in addition, will be unable to afford the full fee places. Consequently, these are the students that will find themselves using FEE-HELP, as it is known, to put themselves through university, paying for their education at market interest rates and saddled with a lifetime of debt.</para><para>It is likely that under this government's policies our publicly funded education system will end up with the poor paying far more for their education than the wealthy. It is also most disappointing to see that the government's package does not propose any increases in income support for students through the social security system. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee report of 2000, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university student finances, </inline>found that students are increasingly needing to engage in some form of employment in order to subsidise their studies at university and that many students' financial circumstances are having a direct impact on their mode and location of study and choice of course. As a former university lecturer at the University of Adelaide, this was something that I saw increasingly—students not being able to complete assignments and do other sorts of work as a consequence of them having to work part time, and quite often full time, in order to support themselves at university.</para><para>Student debt has more than doubled under the current system. If the government's agenda is implemented, cost will become a barrier to a university education for Australians. Already young graduates spend a large part of their working lives weighed down by massive debt, with consequences of reduced home ownership and delayed parenthood, and this is only going to increase if we follow the path that the government is proposing.</para><para>While we do welcome the government's proposal of scholarships for Indigenous students, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and rural and remote students, the sums in question are too insignificant to provide adequate incentive. In addition, the government's proposal to treat the scholarships as income for assessing eligibility for youth allowance and other government income shows the government's gesture for what it is: totally inadequate. While giving with one hand, the government takes away with the other.</para><para>The New Zealand experience indicates that high fees encourage a short-term approach to education by students. In order to maximise their financial investment, students will choose degrees that are perceived to lead to high-paying occupations and that involve relatively minor costs while studying. This has had the effect of distorting enrolment in degrees with high course material costs, such as science, which is not seen as rewarding graduates with high-paying careers. Such trends should be worrying for the government, as such distortions have serious consequences for the labour market and for our economy. </para><para>It is also important to note another aspect of this legislation. The HECS-HELP program, by which universities will be able to charge a fee of up to 30 per cent above the current HECS rate for any given course, will give Australia a partially deregulated higher education system. The effect of this will be to open up competition between universities for market share, and it will move the cost of training and education further away from government and industry and onto students. Under the government's legislation, universities will be able to increase HECS fees by 30 per cent. This means huge HECS debts of up to $50,000. An arts degree could cost $15,000; a science degree, $21,000; and a law degree, $41,000. If a student wants to do a combined degree or an honours year then of course they will have to pay even more for their studies.</para><para>As a consequence of the competition that will emerge between universities, high prestige universities may well implement the fee increase across the board, as has recently been done by the University of Sydney. Other universities, on the other hand, suffering from years of underfunding, have not built such reputations and resource infrastructures as some of the high prestige universities. These universities will not benefit from banking additional student fees. In all, these measures seek to create a couple of world-class universities rather than a world-class university system for all Australians. The effect of these policies amounts to inadequate funding and a second-class education system for those who cannot afford high fees or large debts. Labor will not support any measures to increase fees for Australian students and their families.</para><para>In its submission to the Senate inquiry, Flinders University, in my home state of South Australia, raised concerns with the government's refusal to recognise the need for appropriate annual indexation of the operating grant to match rising salary costs. It stated:</para><quote><para>The cost of education is increasing due to rapid advances in technology and equipment, developments in on-line delivery, demands for greater support services for students, spiralling non-salary costs such as insurance premiums, and the difficulties of attracting and retaining staff in an increasingly competitive global environment. The modest salary increases which have been awarded to staff since 1995 have been largely unfunded.</para></quote><para>Adequate remuneration for staff is, of course, a vital aspect of maintaining morale amongst academic staff. Unless a university has good morale amongst its staff, its teaching standards are likely to drop, as is the research output from such a university.</para><para>In years of cuts under this government the higher education system has suffered body blows to its prestige. Our system is not only underfunded; it is also undervalued. As it currently stands, academic staff are simply not able to do their work properly. In a recent survey commissioned by the NTEU, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Unhealthy places of learning: working in Australian universities</inline>, 83 per cent of academics reported increased workloads, mainly due to increased student numbers, often as a result of the loss of staff. Over a third of academic staff reported that their workload in research and reading had decreased owing to the immediate demands of teaching and administration. Such conditions mean that it is incredibly difficult for staff to maintain high-quality teaching, no matter how good their skills and credentials. </para><para>If an academic is unable to conduct research then obviously they are not going to be able to keep up with developments. This will affect their teaching, which of course in turn will affect the quality of education received by students in their classes. We have seen that classrooms are often overcrowded, and science and engineering faculties report shortages of both space and equipment. Such conditions are clearly not conducive to a high-quality education system in this country. Yet this package's lack of adequate indexation means the government is not offering any kind of long-term solution to this problem.</para><para>These are just a few of the negative aspects of this legislation. In summary, the package will stifle student choice; increase the cost of education; lumber students and their families with the kind of debt that may well stop people from having children and purchasing assets; hit those who are less well-off the hardest, reducing their chance at getting a decent education; deepen divisions in society and compromise our economic and social prosperity; undermine academic freedom, which is of course the cornerstone of a modern democracy; intrude into university autonomy in a way not seen before in this nation; allow the minister to determine what courses a university can offer, who teaches them, and what research will be undertaken and where; and allow the minister to lock Australians out of courses, because he or she will have the power to make them 100 per cent full fee paying. In short, these measures will degrade our university system and make it harder for our children to get access to it. Labor agrees that the university system requires a long-term solution and that the status quo is not sustainable. Therefore, Labor will move substantive amendments to revoke the worst aspects of the government's higher education policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17589</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, let me make it very plain that the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> are bad news for universities. They are bad news for students and their families. They are bad news for our economy. Most importantly, they are bad news for Australia's future as a learning community. At its core, the government wants to increase student university fees by up to 30 per cent. Further, the government wants to double the number of students paying over $100,000 for their university degrees. It is a classic case of degrees for those with the money to pay for them and either a `no vacancy' sign or a massive debt for those who cannot.</para></talk.start><para>Labor, on principle, will not support any increase in the number of students paying that sort of money. Labor will not, on principle, support Mr Howard's and Mr Nelson's agenda to create an American style system where money more than marks opens doors to degrees. Labor will not support a system that encourages price tags to become associated with entry to various degrees at our tertiary education institutions when Australians are already contributing to the higher education sector through their taxation system. Labor will restore merit as the only criterion for getting a university place. Only Labor will abolish full fees for Australian undergraduate students.</para><para>Australian students are already paying some of the highest university fees in the developed world. I remind all senators of the very high levels of debt that our students are already carrying. If this legislation goes through, Australia's tertiary students will be paying over $20,000 for a basic science degree, so they will start their working lives with a $20,000 debt. I do not know many parents who think that is a good idea, and there are not too many students who think that is a good idea either. </para><para>I note today that the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations has called this legislation a test of nerve for the Senate. CAPA says:</para><quote><para>... on the one hand there's a future in which Fee-HELP will mean that poorer students will pay more to undertake fee-paying courses than rich students, and in which the partial deregulation on HECS will ensure that the sand-stone uni's are for rich kids and the poor can fight over the rest.</para></quote><para>The president went on to point out:</para><quote><para>On the other hand, the senators can listen to almost everyone actually in the higher education sector, including most of the VC's, and dump the whole package. Some groups are having a hissy-fit, saying that if the Bills are not passed it'll be the end of the world. That's just rubbish. It's bad legislation, and there's far more good than harm in scrapping the lot.</para></quote><para>He has warned some Democrats senators that if they:</para><quote><para>... do a GST on these higher education bills students will be absolutely disgusted.</para></quote><para>This is advice, I say, which should be heeded. He has urged Independent senators to reflect on the important position that they hold in this place and think first of students and universities.</para><para>It is little wonder that he is concerned. If the main bill is passed, postgraduate students undertaking course work programs—who in most cases already pay substantial fees—will be charged 3.5 per cent interest, on top of CPI, on loans to cover those fees, meaning in reality about six per cent or effective market interest. Labor will abolish the real interest rate on postgraduate loans. The main reform bill will ensure that students will pay different amounts for their education depending on how rich they are. Most postgraduate courses are fee paying. If these students are well-off and can pay their fees up-front, they will pay one amount. If they cannot afford up-front fees and take out an interest-bearing loan from the government, they will pay much more.</para><para>Students will not pay off their interest-bearing loans until they have cleared any existing HECS debts they may have. This regressive element of the bill, which runs counter to basic financial planning, will add an average of $4,500 to these students' debts. The government's $150 million funding injection has come very late in the day and does not go anywhere near far enough, because the government must supply the universities with enough funding to make sure they do not need to increase student fees by another 30 per cent. The only reason universities are going to increase their fees is that the government will not provide sufficient funding. If the government's extra funding injection was intended as a sweetener, it leaves a very sour taste in the mouth indeed.</para><para>Australia will pay a very high price if the Howard government gets its way and this bill is passed. Australian students will be paying increased fees for their university education and they will be starting their working lives with very high levels of debt. We will not have enough university places if this legislation goes through. There are already 20,000 students who miss out on a university place—20,000 young people who have the talent but who cannot go to university because the government does not provide enough places. This is potentially devastating for regional communities, where too many talented young people stand to miss out on a place, either because of the government's policy of overenrolments or enrolments on the cheap. Many of these are young people applying to become teachers and nurses in areas where Australia needs more, not fewer, skilled professionals. We have the second lowest rate of enrolments in the OECD and we have seen the number of Australians starting an undergraduate degree dropping for two years running. </para><para>What does this bill offer to create more fully funded university places to maintain current numbers? How does it address the fact that thousands of school leavers will miss out on a place because universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007—and it is projected that places will not even keep up with population growth? This bill fails on each key point. By contrast, Labor will create over 20,000 new university places to ensure that all of our best and brightest young people have no financial or supply constraints to further study.</para><para>Let us have a look at what is in this bill for universities. The opposition support the provision for the indexation of Commonwealth funding for universities in this bill but, in doing so, we make strong representations to the government that the level of indexation in the bill is inadequate. Those of us with close relationships with our local universities know that the government's inadequate funding and the significant cuts to universities over the last seven years have led to overcrowding in lecture theatres, a very strong decline in staff morale and mounting threats to standards in our universities. Figures from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee show that, nationally, the number of students per teaching staff member has increased by 31.3 per cent since the Howard government took office. As a former teacher I have to say that that is a disgrace. It is almost impossible to believe that James Cook University has seen a 57.1 per cent rise in students per staff member. My own home state of Queensland has been the hardest hit, with a huge 39.2 per cent increase in the student to staff ratio statewide.</para><para>These figures expose the detrimental impact of the Howard government's $5 billion cuts to universities since 1996. Higher student to staff ratios mean overcrowded lectures, huge or nonexistent tutorials, reduced interaction, compromised teaching and learning and, I have got to say, very stressed staff. Alone, these student to staff ratios give us the proof that the Howard government has neglected universities and their students. As I have said, we will support the provisions for indexation in the bill to at least give some additional funding to the universities, which they so desperately need, but we call on the government to adopt Labor's policy to put in place a proper process of indexation that would see the universities' operating grants from the Commonwealth keep up with costs.</para><para>The bill before us makes a disgracefully inadequate provision for growth in the higher education sector, especially in the period 2004-07. Rather than a proper indexation process we have a linkage between additional funding and the adoption of an ideologically driven set of industrial relations reforms that have been universally condemned. This is, quite frankly, an extraordinarily heavy-handed way to treat our nation's premier educational institutions. It is little wonder that staff throughout the higher education sector went on strike on Thursday, 16 October.</para><para>At James Cook University's Douglas campus in Townsville, hundreds of picketers, led by the National Vice President of the NTEU, Mr Paul Reser, greeted buses empty of students at the entrance to the campus. The member for Townsville, Mr Mike Reynolds, said on the day:</para><quote><para> ... this obsession to force academics and researchers into individual workplace contracts with their employers is rubbing salt into the wounds of the same regional universities that have been long starved of funds.</para></quote><para>It seems that that mood was the same right throughout North Queensland. In Mackay it was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mercury</inline> that: </para><quote><para> ... industrial blackmail could turn Mackay's Central Queensland University into an elitist playground catering only for the rich.</para></quote><para>The NTEU CQU representative, Mr Shane Hopkinson, said that the government was hell-bent on using industrial blackmail to force the loss of lecturers' and students' power of collective bargaining, which he feared: </para><quote><para> ... would be replaced on campus by business and community representatives.</para></quote><para>He also pointed to the increased difficulties that regional campuses like Mackay would have in attracting quality staff. In Cairns, the president of NTEU's James Cook University branch, Ms Jan Wegner, said all four unions at the Cairns campus were represented at the strike in response to Minister Nelson telling universities to introduce Australian workplace agreements in exchange for $404 million. She made the very valid point that the union had been progressing extremely well in negotiations for an EBA and were `only a few weeks off from signing off' before the minister's announcement.</para><para>I note in a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> the Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University claimed that JCU would be a winner if the government's package were to be passed by the Senate. This is not consistent with a key argument in the university's own submission to the Senate inquiry. Any short-term increase in Commonwealth funding through highly conditional schemes such as the regional loadings will be rapidly eroded by the failure of the government to adequately index funding. The JCU's submission to the Senate inquiry made it clear that increasing indexation to a realistic level—commensurate with other government funded enterprises, such as schools—was required for the long-term stability of universities, rather than contingent funding or arbitrary competitive funding pools. JCU has a bitter experience of arbitrary competitive funding pools. This year it received $700,000 to compensate for its losses in the government's discredited competitive funding regime for research and research training. However, compensation concludes in 2004 and, unless there is significant change in policy, JCU's research activities must suffer.</para><para>I understand the desperation of the VCs. Any increase in public funding must look attractive, given the systematic attacks they have endured under the Howard government. But there is no doubt that the government's proposals will threaten the quality and the accessibility of higher education in North Queensland. A significantly high percentage of students from disadvantaged backgrounds attend James Cook University. According to the department's data, in 2000 the number of Indigenous students at JCU, as a percentage of all domestic students, was 3.3 per cent compared with the national average of 1.2 per cent. The percentage of rural students at JCU was 46.2 per cent compared with the national average of 17.6 per cent. The percentage of isolated students was 12 per cent compared with the national average of 1.8 per cent. The percentage of low SES students was 24.1 per cent compared with the national average of 14.8 per cent. The percentage of students with a disability was 3.4 per cent at James Cook University compared with the national average of three per cent. A very high number of students at James Cook University are the first in their family to attend a tertiary education institution.</para><para>It is well known that students from disadvantaged backgrounds require high levels of support, but there is no recognition of this in the government's package. The high level of students from disadvantaged backgrounds at James Cook University creates a huge dilemma. Far North Queensland has much lower participation rates than the rest of Queensland or even Australian averages. Thus, as JCU point out in their submission: </para><quote><para>It would be counter productive to substantially increase the fees required of students. Indeed an increase in fees would be likely to reduce participation. For this reason, JCU is unlikely to increase the HECS component of undergraduate student fees over the next few years.</para></quote><para>The submission goes on to state:</para><quote><para>The impact of increasing fees is therefore likely to be minimal in our catchment.</para></quote><para>However, as the value of the Commonwealth's funding continues to erode, the pressure to increase fees or reduce costs will increase. As it is, according to AVCC data JCU has a worse staff-student average than the national average. Over time, James Cook University will have no options. If students are the only source of additional funding, the university will have to charge higher fees if it is to try to maintain a credible learning and teaching environment. The necessary pressures on participation may seriously undermine the social, cultural and economic development of North Queensland. Any win for James Cook University in this package will indeed be a Pyrrhic victory.</para><para>Given the opportunity to do so in the House of Representatives, not one of the government members supported Labor's amendments to remove the linkage between funding and industrial relations or, in fact, the 30 per cent fee hike. Mr Entsch, Mr Lindsay and Mrs De-Anne Kelly have betrayed the students of North Queensland and, importantly, their parents. Not only has the government tried to force its extreme ideological IR conditions onto campuses throughout the nation; it has threatened the independence of Australia's researchers.</para><para>The level of incursion contained within the package gives unprecedented ability to the government of the day to intervene in the day-to-day running of higher education institutions. As well as the traditional right of academics to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself, it is important to recognise that our academic institutions, notably in collaboration with CRCs, are now routinely conducting a wide range of commercially sensitive research on behalf of Australian business.</para><para>This package goes well beyond what would be considered acceptable governance in our nation's schools, banks, hospitals or, in fact, our homes. Rather, this government's track record when it comes to the regulation of detention centres would more naturally fit into the higher education management framework that is being proposed. The whole approach has been labelled as `meddling micromanagement', an `interventionist regime' and `bureaucracy run riot' by various commentators.</para><para>When it comes to course content all is not well either. The bill links course content with a financial mechanism to be known as `funding clusters'. This means that different levels of funding will apply per course. The level of funding to apply to universities choosing to focus on funding clusters that do not attract significant levels of funding per place will be totally dependent on the discretion of the minister. Universities choosing to specialise in entirely reasonable areas of focus for their region—for example, in our case, tourism—could be economically disadvantaged. And the minister's discretion does not end there. According to departmental evidence given at the Senate inquiry, with one stroke of a ministerial pen a course could become 100 per cent fee paying, locking out all except those who are well cashed up. This legislation, if allowed to pass, will remove institutional autonomy and introduce a level of ministerial intrusion never before seen in Australia's universities.</para><para>This bill is fatally flawed. In my view it showcases only one government policy well: make students pay more. Oscar Wilde said once of fox-hunting that it was `the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable'. This bill is like a fox hunt—a fox hunt with Australian students and lecturers being hounded by a government hell-bent on an ideological chase. I say to minority senators: do not run with these government hounds. Politically, you will find the kill as unpalatable as the provisions of this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17594</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> is part of a package that has the potential to shape higher education in this country for years to come. At its heart, this debate is about who in Australia can access higher education; it is about whether we will have a world-class university system accessible to all Australians primarily on the basis of merit or a two-tiered system—one system for the wealthy and another for the rest.</para></talk.start><para>I am gravely concerned by the state of higher education in this country. I am even more concerned about the proposals put forward by this government to the parliament. These changes will do nothing more than deepen the crisis in which our universities and our communities find themselves. I want to deal with three broad themes which are relevant to this debate—first, why we need a strong and accessible education system; second, the exclusion effects of the increased cost of education under these government proposals; and, finally, the implications for our nation of the exclusion and exclusivity that is inherent in the government's proposals.</para><para>It is essential not just to talk about the nuts and bolts of education policy. Obviously that is the end result, but before you get to that point you need to have some basis for your policy. You need to make decisions about what your principles are, what your philosophy about education is and what you are trying to achieve—what needs are to be addressed by government. For Labor, the principles are constant and the needs are clear. The fundamental differences between Labor and the government when it comes to education are many.</para><para>I come from the perspective that government's key role is building a nation. Like most people on my side of politics, I believe that education is not only a cost—although there are costs associated with it—but also an investment in the future. If we are all to share in that future, we all have to share in making the investment. When I say it is an investment I do not simply mean that it is an economic investment, although it is certainly that; it is also an investment in the social fabric. A broad education is the foundation for a community of people built on understanding and respect. It is the foundation of critical thinking and it is therefore the foundation of democracy.</para><para>Democracies depend on a number of things, but essentially they rely on people being given the transparency, accountability and information they need to make good decisions. To make sense of it all, you need to have a well-developed skill in critical thinking. This certainly does not mean that individuals cannot function in a democracy without a higher degree in the liberal arts. A number of prominent people in the Labor Party, including Curtin, Chifley and Keating, proved that beyond doubt. But unless you are armed with useful information and know how to use it, it is hard to make good decisions.</para><para>This democratic role of education is clearly part of what the Liberals see as the problem. They have nothing to fear but an informed electorate, and that is why they run on an agenda of resentment. This resentment is fostered by the government by pitting people against each other. We have seen this government do it time and time again, with Prime Minister Howard drawing himself as the champion of the battler in a world he sees as one of `bums, freeloaders and criminals'. Howard divided Australia on Indigenous issues, he did it with asylum seekers, he did it with trade unionists and welfare recipients and he is trying to do it again with students. The privileged, lazy student is positioned against the hardworking taxpayer. </para><para>Minister Nelson and Prime Minister Howard are asking us if we want to be subsidising the slovenly life of the ratbag student. Even if it is not put in such caricatured terms, it is at least implied that a student will become wealthy as a result of their studies and therefore should not expect to get a free ride from the government. The implicit message of the government is: `Why should you be paying for someone else's health or education when they are the one who benefits?' The perverse irony is that, with the government's policies, the most privileged students will continue to be subsidised by the government but the strugglers, the battlers, will have to pay more—more than they can afford.</para><para>We on this side of the parliament believe that education must be made more, not less, affordable. Since the Howard government came to power in 1996, $5 billion has been cut from higher education. The average HECS debt has increased by 85 per cent and student debt has doubled to $9 billion. On top of this, the government now seeks to deregulate university fees so that institutions can increase their fees by up to 30 per cent. It will allow a doubling of the number of Australian students who can pay full fees of up to $150,000 for their undergraduate studies. As has been said before in this debate, Labor will continue to oppose outright the deregulation of university fees and will abolish full fees for undergraduates. The Howard government seeks to impose new loans for students, charging real rates of interest, and to impose interest on postgraduate loans. Labor are committed to opposing and abolishing these loans. We will also lift the HECS threshold from the present level of $25,000 to $35,000.</para><para>Regardless of what you think about the need for a broadly accessible education on a philosophical level, there can be no doubt that as individuals and as a society we are increasingly reliant on education and on skills. What I fail to understand in this area is the lack of pragmatism from the government in this respect. It seems somewhat odd to say that of a government that is generally extremely pragmatic, but even if this government believes in a user-pays system it must recognise that if Australia is not to be left behind we need to open up our schools and our universities.</para><para>Gone are the days when a nation could afford to educate a privileged few while the masses laboured. If Australia is to maintain its economic position in the world and remain a high-skill, high-wage economy we need accessible education as a bare minimum. Even more, we need incentives for people to study. Research compiled by the Productivity Commission highlights the fact that work force demand growth is highest in the high-skilled end of the labour market. That is exactly as it should be in Australia. Anyone who believes in building our nation to its maximum potential will want us to be aiming to have a highly skilled and highly paid work force.</para><para>The problem is not on the demand side; rather, it is on the supply side. I refer in particular to research by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—a body you would think has the ear of this government, partial as they are to keeping big business happy ahead of everyone else. However, the chamber tell us that there is a shortage of suitably qualified employees. They consider it to be the most significant constraint on investment. Mr Peter Hendy, the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has described this as:  </para><quote><para> ... a matter of high significance, a reminder of the importance of skills development and training if the economy is to continue to grow.</para></quote><para>Even the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia have also raised concerns about skills shortages and their effect on business and investment.</para><para>In the recent Senate report <inline font-style="italic">Bridging the skills divide</inline>, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations stated:</para><quote><para> ... in the professions, the occupations or specializations of electrical or electronic engineers, accountants, registered nurses, midwives, mental health nurses, development disability nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, speech pathologists, medical imaging professionals, and secondary school teachers ... have been in short supply either continuously or in all but one year, since 1996 (and before, in some cases).</para></quote><para>The report also says:</para><quote><para>Information from DEWR indicates that skill shortages are currently evident in many child care occupations and the health professions, and are particularly severe for nursing, apply to some specialisations within secondary teaching and ICT ...</para></quote><para>Add this to what our vice-chancellors are telling us—that they turn away 20,000 prospective students each year. We do not have enough skilled and educated workers but we are shutting the doors on people's learning. It is absurd and totally counter to the national interest. This government is going to make it harder for people to get to university. It seems that this government so often neglects any concept of nation building. Progress made in this country is so often made in spite of, rather than because of, Howard government policies.</para><para>Labor have made a number of commitments about the focus of our education policy, with a strong focus on the national interest. We want to shore up Australia's place in the world. We believe that maths and science are integral to delivering a high-wage, high-skill, productive and innovative society. The reality is that Australia is facing a serious shortage of teachers over the next decade. The teacher work force is ageing rapidly and more than 40 per cent of the current teacher work force—that is, over 100,000 teachers—will retire in the next 10 years. But under the Howard government nearly 30,000 potential teachers were turned away from our universities just between 1997 and 2002. Labor will take similar action to create more nursing places—another area where there is a chronic shortage. We will fund over 3,000 new undergraduate nursing places by 2008, as well as creating 500 more postgraduate places.</para><para>We know that Australians without a TAFE or university qualification are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those with further training. Youth unemployment is stuck at over 20 per cent—and in some parts of my home state of South Australia it is over 30 per cent. We need to build a nation where young people are engaged and optimistic, not disillusioned and dejected. The Productivity Commission has found that more Australians must attain higher skill levels to maintain and raise current living standards. Yet the government's proposals fly in the face of these imperatives. The changes it seeks to impose are unworthy, unfair and contrary to Australia's requirements as a nation.</para><para>We know that universities want their futures assured. That does not mean that we should pass this legislation. There is a range of views within the sector about the details of this legislation, but two of the common complaints are that it is excessively bureaucratic and centralised, giving the minister power to determine what courses a university can run, who teaches them and what research will be undertaken, and that it makes Australian students pay far too much. It is also widely seen as unacceptable—particularly by the vice-chancellors—that their governance regarding industrial relations should be tied to funding. This is outrageous coercion by the most ideologically driven government in our history. Professor Alan Gilbert of the University of Melbourne has said the industrial relations provisions are so heavy-handed that they are probably not worth the money the government has tied to them. This aspect of the government's proposals is simply heavy-handed bullying tactics that seek to impose the Howard government's narrow and radical industrial relations agenda. The tactics are of no benefit to the universities, are detrimental to university staff and are entirely unproductive. </para><para>Too often we are seeing highly qualified, talented people moving abroad for a better future. That is not how it should be. Australia should be a country that attracts skilled and talented people from around the world to help make this a better place. That our young people are moving overseas in large numbers to make a future is a sad indictment of our attitude towards achievement and innovation. We know that the vice-chancellors and their universities understandably want increased funding—they have suffered $5 billion worth of cuts from the Howard government. But this legislation is no way to build our national future. It appears that the Senate is agreed that the status quo is not sustainable. The question for us is whether the government has offered us the answer to the problem. We on this side of the parliament consider that it has not.</para><para>In closing, I want to make one final comment that relates to my own family's story. My father was the first person in his family who had the opportunity to go to university. He studied at the University of Adelaide under a Colombo Plan scholarship. The fact of his completion of a university degree fundamentally changed for the better the opportunities that I and my brothers and sisters have. This is the hope that many battling Australians have—that their children will have the opportunities that they did not. I consider governments should be about making sure that hope is a real possibility, not simply a pipedream that may never eventuate because of a family's economic circumstances. Governments should be about creating opportunities. This government's proposals are not about creating more opportunity. Instead, they are about rendering university education more exclusive.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>17597</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will start by acknowledging Senator Wong's final contribution where she talked about recognising the importance of opportunity. The stories of how people end up in this place are interesting. Certainly in my case my father never got to university although he would have liked to. He did not even get to high school. It is significant that I got through the university system as a result of the fact it was free and then HECS liable. It is important that we recognise that when we are talking about university we are talking about how people get ahead, how people develop a future for themselves and their country, and the contribution we can make to that as legislators. It is very important.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> are very complex. The headline we hear time and again is about the $1.5 billion in extra funding. But this package of bills has a darker purpose. It seeks to continue the trend over the last 14 years of reducing the proportion of university funding coming from government and increasing the proportion coming from students. Like all Democrat senators I will be voting against the bill at the second reading stage. In my view this package falls well short of world's best practice. It does not provide sustainable funding increases to universities, and certainly does not do anything to improve equity outcomes in terms of disadvantaged students getting into universities. World's best practice is what countries like Canada and Ireland are doing—increasing public investment in education as a key strategic investment in the nation's future. World's best practice is not starving universities of needed core funding and asking students to make up the difference.  </para><para>In voting against this bill I want to urge the government to do better. I believe there is a majority in this Senate to support a bill that puts more sustainable funding into universities but does not push poorer students out of universities. I urge the minister and the government to adopt the same flexibility it adopted with its first Medicare package—a preparedness to listen to the parties in the Senate and the community and produce a better package. `Universities-plus' could be a name for it, so to speak.</para><para>In this speech I want to outline my key concerns with the current bill and suggest what measures could be included in a fairer, more sustainable, revised higher education package. The Democrats have long campaigned on the merits of public investment in higher education. We have long argued for a reduction in student fees and charges. Led by Senator Janine Haines, the Democrats opposed the introduction of HECS in 1989—the only party in the Senate at the time to do so. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja has consistently railed against increases in student fees and charges. Unfortunately, in legislative terms we have not won that argument, with the coalition in opposition voting with the Labor government to introduce HECS in 1989 and to increase it in subsequent years. It was the Labor education minister Simon Crean and finance minister Kim Beazley who changed the indexation of university grants in 1995 to underfund salary increases by one to two per cent a year. The result of the Crean-Beazley indexation formula has been, according to the Phillips Curran report, a cumulative reduction in university funding of $535 million a year by 2001. In fact by 2005, when this package cuts in, that reduction will be up over the $700 million mark.</para><para>The growing gap in public funding since 1995 has been made up with increased charges on students in HECS, postgraduate fees and overseas student fees. According to the OECD, between 1995 and 2000 Australia had the biggest real terms cut in public funding of universities—a fall of 11 per cent in real terms—and one of the biggest increases in funding from students—up over 100 per cent over the same period. Between 1995 and 2000, the proportion of university funding coming from public sources in Australia fell from 64 per cent to 51 per cent. That is way below the OECD average of 78 per cent. In fact, only three countries in the OECD—the US, Korea and Japan—ask their students to shoulder a heavier burden of the costs of their education than Australia does. This package, instead of easing that burden, instead of shifting Australia back towards the OECD benchmark of increased investment in higher education, seems to run in the other direction.</para><para>The government's own policy paper concedes that the proportion of course costs coming from students will rise from 26.1 per cent to 27.8 per cent under this package. Others estimate that the percentage will be much higher. The Phillips Curran report suggests that it currently ranges from 28.4 per cent in nursing to 30.9 per cent in science, to 48 per cent in arts, to 69 per cent in business and to 81 per cent for law. All of those percentages are about to rise as a result of this package. </para><para>At the heart of the problem with university funding is, as I said, the Crean-Beazley indexation formula which robs universities of around $80 million a year. The package we are debating tonight takes effect after the next federal election. In the term of this parliament, the Crean-Beazley indexation formula will rob universities of a cumulative $480 million—$80 million in 2002, $160 million in 2003 and $240 million in 2004. Over the following three years that blows out to a cumulative loss of about $1 billion. Between 2005 and 2007, under this package the government puts back only half of that amount in increased spending on operating grants—about $404 million. There is an additional amount for partly funded places, but these are growth places which should really have been funded anyway. Overall, universities under this package will in 2007 still be worse off financially than they were when Dr Nelson was sworn in as a minister in 2001. We are told that this is an advance.</para><para>I make it quite clear that the indexation formula needs to be fixed. Without proper indexation the funding increases in this bill are meaningless in the long term. Without fixing the funding formula for indexation, universities will be looking again to their students to shoulder more and more of the cost of education through higher HECS fees and more domestic and international full-fee student places. This legislation sets up a carrot and stick approach to encourage a more accelerated push to full-fee places. The stick is the two per cent real cut in funds each year under the indexation formula. The carrot is a combination of the doubling of the number of potential full-fee places and a HECS style fee help mechanism to help pay for it.</para><para>How much is it appropriate to ask students to pay for their education? This is the key question, and one which I do not think the AVCC has answered in any of the papers coming from it that I have read. The government claims that HECS represents 26.1 per cent of course costs and under this package it will rise to 27.8 per cent. In calculating this percentage the government assumes that the entire $6.2 billion of funding for universities is to support teaching. It also assumes a 25 per cent discount coming from the HECS payment deferral mechanism. If you exclude research grants, which do not benefit students directly, the percentage rises to 38 per cent of course costs. Even if you include research block grants, on the basis that they support the underlying faculty costs, the percentage is still 32 per cent of course costs. By world standards Australian students are paying very high course costs in terms of the proportion of total course costs.</para><para>So, is any increase in HECS justifiable? Certainly not if it increases the proportion of university course costs borne by students—and by world standards they are already paying too much. The next question has to be: what impact has HECS had on students participating in university. Quite surprisingly, the answer is: not very much, at least not yet. As Griffith University's Gavin Moodie put it in last week's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> `Higher Education' supplement:</para><quote><para>Enrolments of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds did not increase when tuition fees were abolished from 1973 to 1985, they did not fall when fees were reintroduced in 1986, nor did they fall when fees were increased in 1989 and again in 1997.</para></quote><para>Professor Bruce Chapman has come to a similar view in his analysis, as did the Curran Phillips report. Indeed, the most recent higher education report from the government shows the percentage of students from a lower socio-economic status is almost the same now—14.5 per cent of students—as it was in 1991. But significantly, the proportion of students from a rural background has fallen from 18.4 per cent to 17.4 per cent, as has the number of students from a non-English-speaking background—down from 4.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent. The number of Indigenous students rose from 1991 to 200 but has fallen sharply since the cuts to Abstudy. </para><para>Research commissioned by the department and by the Centre for Higher Education Studies indicates that since the rises in HECS since 1997 the impact has fallen adversely on certain groups of students. The rises particularly in the repayment thresholds have impacted on mature aged enrolments, particularly part-time enrolments, and students who are risk averse and debt averse such as rural students. Departmental research shows a significant movement in male students from higher cost courses to lower cost courses. This data certainly suggests that HECS is getting close to the point where it could be starting to deter at-risk groups of students already under financial pressure from accessing university.</para><para>In my view the government needs to ensure that students likely to be discouraged from participation in education—that is, poorer students—are exempted from any increases in HECS arising out of this package. This could be done by a government guarantee to pay the additional HECS charged by any university to a student from a lower socio-economic background with the costs of the guarantee recouped through a levy of any additional HECS charged by universities across the board. Such a mechanism would be particularly important to my home state of Queensland where universities have the highest proportion of students from a lower socio-economic background—some 23.4 per cent—than any other mainland state. It would also be important in levelling the playing field between older, richer universities like Sydney—with just 6.4 per cent of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and a senate determined to increase fees by the maximum—and newer universities like Western Sydney with 11 per cent of its students coming from a disadvantaged background.</para><para>The Democrats have long opposed the introduction of full fees for undergraduate courses—and I think one of the worst aspects of this package is that full-fee courses are being promoted. Certainly the Senate should oppose the use of public subsidies through the fee help loans scheme to support the growth of full-fee places. The proposed 3.5 per cent real interest rate on loans for postgraduate courses should also be opposed as quite unfair.</para><para>My colleague Senator Stott Despoja has outlined in some considerable detail why the other parts of the package, particularly the conditions attached to the increases in funding, are unreasonable, and I do not propose to add to them. Having said that, I do have some sympathy with the view that Australia cannot afford to have 39 world class universities, and some specialisation and differentiation between universities is appropriate and should be encouraged. As Minister Nelson said in releasing his university package:</para><quote><para>We must appreciate that these changes are driven by a world of higher education on which increasingly the only benchmarks that count are international ones.</para></quote><para>And that is true. But every other country in the OECD bar the US, Japan and Canada have much higher public subsidies than our universities do. Even in the US, the subsidies are often higher than in our universities. For example, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, a middle ranking state university, has roughly the same enrolment as the University of Melbourne. The University of Michigan in 2000 received a public grant of $716 million, three times the grant received by the University of Melbourne at $224 million. All told, the University of Michigan with 38,000 students has a total budget of $1.7 billion, while Melbourne university with 37,000 students has a budget of $450 million. You would wonder how our universities can ever compete in a world against those sorts of resources. Yet that is what we are up against, and that is what we really have to talk about and think about when we are looking at the sorts of funding figures in this particular package. </para><para>So what should a replacement bill have in it? First, it should replace the Crean-Beazley indexation formula with something that reflects real costs so that universities are not suffering year in, year out funding cuts. Second, in terms of HECS, it must ensure that students are not asked to pay a higher proportion of course costs than they do now. Third, the HECS repayment schedule needs to be revised so that repayments only become payable above the median salary for new graduates, currently $35,000. Fourth, it needs to include new equity measures such as more learning scholarships and more equity program funding and exempt students from a lower socio-economic background from above standard HECS increases.</para><para>Fifth, it needs to address the income support arrangements which have left most students on income support living below the poverty line, forcing students to work on average an equivalent of 2 days of full-time work a week to survive—full-time students. Let us recognise that we need to do more to get mature age students back into university and at least make them eligible for rent assistance as mature age unemployed are. Sixth, the package needs to ensure that universities balance their enthusiasm for full-fee places with increased funding for equity programs and other improved equity outcomes, the same way that the Blair government has done in terms of its requirements for universities.</para><para>Seventh, the Postgraduate Loans Scheme should be retained in its current form and not extended to full-fee undergraduate places as suggested by the government. Eighth, the link with workplace relations reform has got to go. Encourage better performance review by all means but do not dictate to universities how to run their employment relationships. Ninth, the link with voluntary student unionism has got to go. Focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of student unions by all means but, given the ACCC has already found that compulsory campus fees meet the public interest test under its act, leave that issue alone in terms of taking it further.</para><para>Tenth, rework the governance reforms. For three years I was a member of the largest university senate in Australia—there were 36 members—at the University of Queensland, one of the targets of reforms under this package. I have to report to the Senate that it works extremely well; it has a lot of very active committees doing a lot of work and one of the best audit and accountability records of any university in the country. Why change what is not broken? Eleventh, forget about the five-year learning entitlement proposal. By all means keep the pressure on universities by improving the reporting of completion rates of degrees—but a five-year cap on university courses will have the opposite effect of forcing many students to drop out of university long before they have settled into the regime of what they want to study and what they want to be when they grow up. Twelfth, cut the red tape in terms of the bureaucracy in this package and ensure that the independence of universities is better respected.</para><para>In conclusion, while there are some elements of the Nelson package that have quite a bit of merit, I think the overall design carries very serious risks for Australia. Were the government to substantially alter its package, I think the Senate would be more likely to look on the package favourably, recognising that the opportunity for a major advance in higher education funding and reform might not come again for some time. But, to date, the government has shown no preparedness to do so and, as the package stands, I do not believe that it deserves or will receive majority support in the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>17602</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate my speech.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>I rise today to speak about the Government's Proposed Higher Education Package.</para><para>This Bill will fundamentally change this country and it is my firm belief that this change will be for the worse.</para><para>There are several obvious differences in the core values of the Government and Labor Parties.</para><para>This bill makes this very clear.</para><para>The Government believes that education is a privilege based on your ability to pay.</para><para>We saw this in their disgraceful funding arrangements for Category 1 Private schools and if this bill is passed we will see it in our universities.</para><para>It is important that the institutions that provide education be free from Government interference as much as possible, thus allowing environments that nurture creativity and innovation.</para><para>The Government believes that if you have the cash, but not the brains, that you should be able to buy your way into university and take the place of a person with more mental merit.

Despite their names, the bills we have before us today make no positive contribution towards higher education. In fact, they seek to dismantle some pretty fundamental concepts which have been inherent both within the higher education system and throughout Australian society for many decades. To name them the higher education support bills is a most disingenuous and misleading exercise, but it is well in step with Howard government practice. This debate highlights some fundamental differences between Labor and the conservatives; it has for a long time and I suggest it will continue to do so into the future. Labor believes everyone has an equal right to maximise his or her potential, to contribute to society and to lead a fulfilling life. That is why Labor believes it is the responsibility of government to ensure that everyone is provided with equal opportunities in life, such as an equal opportunity and access to education.</para></talk.start><para>Education is a key to wealth, prosperity, social equity and tolerance. Everyone knows that a highly educated population brings about better national outcomes, higher productivity, higher wages and, in turn, higher living standards. That is why everyone, regardless of wealth, must have equal opportunity and access to education. These bills are an affront to Australia's historically egalitarian society and they fly in the face of the Aussie `fair go'. They seek to enshrine a system of education where the rich have access and the less well-off are kept in their place and well and truly out of universities. Quite clearly they demonstrate just how unsympathetic, class driven and neo-Liberal the Howard government is. While everyone agrees that the current higher education system is in need of serious reform and reinvestment, these Howard government bills fail in far too many respects. These bills fail to address the critical problems existent in the system, most of which are a result of this government's seven-year long regressive approach to higher education. However, of more concern is that, if implemented, this legislation would exacerbate existing problems and create new and much greater ones for universities, staff, students and their families, and society more widely. </para><para>Let us now turn to examine what has led to the situation we find the higher education sector in today, and why it is that we must now act to rescue it. Since the Howard government came to office in 1996, $5 billion has been ripped from the higher education sector. The government is now spending more money on private schools than on public universities. Prime Minister Howard's record on higher education is a national disgrace. Between 1995 and 2000 Australia's public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent, more than any other country in the OECD. Average OECD growth in the sector was 21 per cent. In my home state of Victoria, according to the AVCC, between 3,300 and 7,300 eligible applicants failed to receive an undergraduate place at a Victorian university in 2003. Government figures show that the number of Australians commencing an undergraduate degree has actually dropped for the past two years running. This is an absolute disgrace and is due solely to the Howard government's totally inadequate funding of the sector. According to the OECD's <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance 2003</inline> report, Australia now has the second lowest increase in the rate of enrolment in universities in the OECD. This is despite greater numbers of students wanting to attend each year.</para><para>Between 1996 and 2002, the number of students per teaching staff has blown out by 31.3 per cent; at some institutions the increase has been over 50 per cent. This has led to a deterioration in the time and individual attention given to students, fewer tutorials, larger class sizes and a greater dependence on Internet based learning and compromised learning for too many people. Overcrowded classrooms are commonplace at universities, as is infrastructure in serious disrepair. There are now insufficient student resources flowing into universities for our community and business leaders of tomorrow to be receiving the high-quality education we, as a nation and a society, expect and deserve them to possess.</para><para>It is hard to understand how the Howard government could justify even to itself the level of destruction it has descended upon the higher education system in its seven years, particularly in light of Australia's clearly identified national skills shortage. Skills growth as a driver of productivity has dropped 75 per cent in the last 10 years, from 28.6 per cent of productivity growth in the late eighties and early nineties to just 2.9 per cent in the late 1990s. Moreover, Australia's brain drain has seen many of our cleverest people being pushed out of Australia and moving overseas. Many are pushed out as a result of the inadequacy of Australia's higher learning sector which fails to support or reward our academics and the institutions that facilitate their inquiry and teaching. Many are being lured to overseas institutions where world-class learning and teaching is sufficiently funded and supported, enabling them to undertake their work with the support and reward they deserve. This exercise is costing Australia dearly. One report found that 61.5 per cent of academics surveyed have lost talented researchers to overseas universities in the last five years. We must be doing more to keep our smartest people onshore researching and teaching for Australia's benefit.</para><para>The continual shift in the cost of education from the state onto the individual under the Howard government has seen students paying more and more for their education. Australians now pay some of the highest costs in the world to undertake higher education. Student debt has more than doubled under the Howard government and is now more than $9 billion. Many students are saddled with massive HECS debt and remain in debt well into their working lives. Some will never earn enough to ever repay their debts. This is particularly true for certain equity groups. According to the National Union of Students, 93 per cent of men but only 77 per cent of women will have paid their HECS debt by the time they are 65. These debts will have a serious effect on our young people and their capacity to fund home ownership and families into the future. </para><para>The higher costs associated with studying at universities today mean many students have to work excessive hours in conjunction with study, which is having a compromising effect on learning capacities. According to the department's own figures, the average full-time student is working 15 hours a week. However, 40 per cent work more than 16 hours and 18 per cent work 21 hours or more. Some students have to work full-time jobs on top of studying in order to fund their living and studying costs. Income support is inadequate and tied in too much red tape. As numerous reports have identified, many students are living well under the poverty line and regularly fail to amass the cash to adequately feed themselves and pay for life expenses.</para><para>On top of these financial pressures, I cannot forget to mention the introduction of the outrageous domestic undergraduate full fee places in courses, which the Howard government introduced in 1998. The existence of domestic undergraduate full fee places is ghastly. If your child cannot attain the necessary marks to gain access to a publicly funded university place like the rest of the student populace, under the Howard government you can fork out $80,000 and your child can receive a Bachelor of Law from Sydney University just like someone with merit. The concept is abhorrent; it is a blatant safety net for the rich and it must be abolished.</para><para>So the overall report card for the Howard government in the area of higher education is bad enough. However, when we turn to the proposals contained in the bills before us I cannot help but be frightened by the senseless system they seek to turn higher education into. When Minister Nelson said higher education was at the crossroads he certainly meant it. The legislation before the Senate today is an atrocious attempt by the Howard government to make a positive contribution towards higher education. The proposal—a miserly $1.5 billion package aimed at fixing many of the problems caused by this government—includes only a net extra 5,500 full-time and part-time places by 2008. In reality, this package fails to expand the system at all. Universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because the government will not fully fund enough student places. After 2007, publicly funded university places will not even keep up with the rate of population increase. This package is flawed.</para><para>The package seeks to allow universities to set aside half of all places in courses for domestic undergraduate full fee paying students. This, in itself, is a national disgrace. The government argues that Australian students should be able to access full fee university places just like international students but what that fails to recognise is that Australian students already do and will continue to contribute to the higher education system in this country through their taxes. International students make use of the resources not having contributed to them through any taxation in the past and then return home after study not contributing anything further into the future. Australian students should not be able to jump the queue, as they say, by paying higher fees to access places at the expense of others with marks and merit but less wealth.</para><para>This legislation seeks to overhaul the current higher education fee system. Firstly, the procedure for HECS fee collection and distribution will be altered. Universities will now become full commercial entities and will receive HECS fees direct from students, unlike now where students pay HECS to the government which it then disburses as funding to the universities. Universities will be made to act as businesses providing education services. </para><para>The legislation allows for the partial deregulation of the HECS fees themselves. Universities will be allowed to charge 30 per cent above the current HECS rates. This means that students and their families can expect that an arts degree could cost them $15,000; a science degree, $21,000; and a law degree, $41,000. If a student wants to do a combined degree or an honours year, they will have to pay even more. As I noted before, the spiralling level of student debt in this country is already out of control. These measures will simply exacerbate this problem. The situation can lead to only one of two outcomes and both are not good. Either a two- or three-tiered higher education sector will emerge where the traditional sandstone universities will be able to charge the full increased 30 per cent HECS rate to everyone in every course because the student demand for places at universities such as Melbourne and Sydney will always be high and they will never have a problem filling courses. Smaller and/or regional universities with less prestige may struggle to fill HECS places in some courses or all courses and may have to reduce their charges just to attract students. This will, in turn, lead to a substandard level of education being delivered to students at these universities. The other option is that universities will act as a cartel and up prices across the board. In turn, many students from lower socioeconomic status groups and equity groups will be kept out of the system due to the even higher costs associated with access.</para><para>The legislation introduces a new Higher Education Loan Program, called HELP. Students will have access to one of three HELP strands: HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP or OS-HELP. HECS-HELP is much the same as the current HECS system, but the repayment threshold has been increased to $30,000. FEE-HELP, on the other hand, is designed for full fee paying students of which, under this package's design, there are bound to be many more than there are today. Students will have access to an up to $50,000 loan from the government. The money attracts interest at a rate of CPI plus 3.5 per cent for 10 years, which then reverts to just the CPI increases after the 10-year period. Students must repay all HECS-HELP debts before repaying the interest accruing FEE-HELP debt. </para><para>Not only will these loans drown our young in debt; they do not even go near the cost of accessing a full fee paying university place. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor Alan Gilbert, has priced a full fee medical degree at $150,000. Under this government's proposal, students are expected to fund the remaining $100,000 from bank loans or by other means. This proposal is a disgrace.</para><para>Under the legislation, the learning entitlement afforded to students is to be radically tightened. The measure will place an extremely high and unreasonable level of stress on students because of the pressure to pass all of their subjects first time. It is simply unfair. Figures reveal that Australian students already spend the shortest amount of time at university out of those of any country in the OECD; only four per cent of all students enrolled last year already held an undergraduate degree. These loans schemes, the restructuring of the HECS system, the deregulation of university courses and the reserving of half of all places for full fee paying students is forcing our young people to make a choice they should never have to make—to drown in debt or to miss out on a university education. This government ought to be condemned for expecting young people to make such a decision. </para><para>Under the package, universities will now have to negotiate with the minister for education for funding from the federal government under what is to become the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. This scheme is extremely prescriptive and threatens the autonomy and viability of universities. The minister for education, through the CGS, will be able to tell institutions what they will be funded to teach and what they will not be. He will be able to tell them who can teach, what research is undertaken and where it is to be undertaken. It threatens the autonomy of universities in a way never before seen in this country. Many small and/or regional universities may be told to specialise in particular vocations. If they choose not to, it will be done at their own peril and their own expense.</para><para>Under the proposals, the minister or department will be empowered to send investigators onto university premises for compliance searches. Moreover, universities will have to adhere to new governance procedures that seek to limit the influence of staff and student representative voices on university councils. In its submission to the Senate committee, the National Union of Students said that it would be:</para><quote><para>... very disturbed at a university governing body that would not want to hear the perspectives of those who teach and those who are taught ... The underlying assumption is that students are self-interested when they advocate on behalf of the student body or community expectations on equity, but business leaders are simply reflecting community values when they advocate for their own class interests.</para></quote><para>These measures are inappropriate and cannot be supported.</para><para>One of the other proposals contained in the bill, and one that has received quite a bit of press coverage, is the $404 million in extra Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding attached to industrial relations conditions. Under this gun-to-the-head proposal, the government promises to release extra and much-needed cash to universities, following the adoption of extremely harsh anti-union workplace practices. The conditions are transparently ideological, and some comprise absurd attempts at micromanagement. Not one of the conditions has one bit of relevance to universities' core functions of teaching and research. They are just more blind ideology seeping out of a wretched package.</para><para>Overall, this package, titled Backing Australia's Future, offers nothing enticing for universities, students or their families. Unfortunately time will not permit me to address any more of the problematic elements of this package, such as the new regional loading scheme tied to the CGS. However, most issues seem to have been addressed by previous speakers and I am sure that those following me will ensure that all have been dealt with by the conclusion of the debate.</para><para>Students and parents have condemned this package. The only endorsement that it has received has been from a few university vice-chancellors who, after seven years of harsh attacks, have been forced to accept it as their only option for survival. Now that Labor's Aim Higher package—a real alternative—has been released, people are embracing that. Labor's package offers them a real alternative as it seeks to rebuild Australian universities and opportunities for young Australians, following years of Howard government neglect and attack.</para><para>Labor will contribute $2.34 billion over four years to rebuild, reform and expand our universities and TAFEs to ensure a better quality education for Australians. Our goal is the creation of a world-leading system of lifelong learning. Labor will create 20,000 new, fully publicly funded university places and 20,000 new TAFE places by 2008. Labor will not allow HECS fees to increase by 30 per cent and we will abolish up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. We are going to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients and we are going to reduce the age of independence for students on youth allowance to 23 years. </para><para>Labor will not impose a time limit on learning at university. In addressing areas of urgent skill shortage, Labor will create over 3,000 new full- and part-time places for nurses and around 4,600 places for teachers. Labor will also reduce HECS fees for science and maths students by $1,600 per annum. Labor will index university operating grants to ensure that funding levels meet real and growing costs. Labor's policy will deliver an extra $312 million over four years to our universities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>17610</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. We usually declare interests in this place. I can declare interest in education. I have been a beneficiary of both the current system and the previous system. I came from a rural background, and there was no easy way to get to university. I did not come from a privileged position, like those who sit on the other side. To get to university, I went through a cadetship to do a TAFE college course first, did additional studies and eventually managed to go to the Queensland Institute of Technology, as it was then, as a part-timer, to the University of Queensland as a part-time student to do a Bachelor of Arts and finally to the Queensland Institute of Technology to do a Bachelor of Law, also part time. I suspect that I have also participated in lifelong learning through continuous study for some 20-odd years as a part timer.</para></talk.start><para>What concerns me about these bills is that without proper scrutiny from the government the system we have now will be radically altered to this new system and people like me who come from rural backgrounds—and places that are not as privileged as those places which people who sit on that side come from—will not have the ability to go to university and study part time or full time as the case may be. There has not been proper scrutiny by the government to ensure that these bills provide greater opportunity for students to participate more fully in different pursuits in life—as I did, as a public servant, then later as a union advocate and now as a senator representing Queensland.</para><para>When you seek to change a system as radically as this government proposes to do in these bills, you should pause to reflect on what you currently have: can it be improved rather than trying a radical change where you are unsure of the direction you may take? It is important to consider not only the direction you may take but also those who you may disadvantage. You may leave some behind and you may not give them such opportunities as I had to fulfil some of the goals and aspirations that I had in participating in education and lifelong learning.</para><para>The major purposes of these bills are to introduce new funding arrangements for the higher education sector, provide for the approval of higher education providers, and provide for the regulation of higher education in Australian external territories. While Labor agree that the status quo needs to be addressed, we believe we need to secure a future for our universities. Labor's view does not include massively increasing student debt, though. On the other hand we have the government's plan, which falls far short of the mark. The government's plan is to increase student university fees by up to 30 per cent. The average wage earner is already struggling to pay fees. It is a struggle to send students to university and maintain them in their family life, let alone contemplate a 30 per cent increase in the already high cost of university and leaving that debt to a young wage earner just finishing university. </para><para>Is it reasonable for a government to pass a bill that would cause students and their parents severe financial hardship? That is a question this government has been unable to answer in this debate. This government has not been able to provide cogent reasons why this bill should pass in its current form. People within our communities expect—in fact, I think they demand—affordable education for their children. They do not want to see their children start their working careers with debts that are equal to or, in some instances, more than what they will receive in the first year of their working careers.</para><para>If those on the other side do not think it is a significant impediment, let me tell them that it is. I can speak with some experience in respect of this. In going to university part time I had to consider the amount that I had to pay to buy the books. At the time I was a public servant and I had other responsibilities and there were other dibs on the money that I had. I really had to consider what the benefit might be and then look at how I was going to afford it in the here and now—and I was not trying to defer the debt to a future time.</para><para>If you do not take some of those things into consideration—and I think this government has not done that—you might dissuade those people who might be at the margin. Those people who might have been able to contribute greatly to Australia and the institutions that we have, and to industry and Australia's productivity, if they are at the margin, might decide that it is not worth it. They would do themselves a great disservice. One wonders whether this government really understands that social capital is important and that education is important. It is important that education is for all, not just for the elite, because that means greater diversity and greater energy is put into Australia, rather than when students come from the small portion of the population who can afford it.</para><para>It is perhaps the parents who ensure that they can afford it and not the students, who might not be making the conscious decision: `Yes, education is important and I want to contribute. I want to be able to go down a path—a career—of my choosing not of someone else's.' I am concerned that the government bills might dissuade our youth from choosing careers that they might otherwise have wanted to pursue. While the opposition have made it very plain that we have very strong ideas for education, the government has presented us with bills that make university education unaffordable and in some instances unreachable for many within the community.</para><para>Major elements of the government's bills include a new Commonwealth Grants Scheme for universities. This will consist of a new funding formula for Commonwealth operating grants based on student numbers and discipline mix from 2005. These increases will be conditional on institutions complying with a Commonwealth model for institutional governance and workplace relations policies. The government have a favourite way of doing business: they tie disparate issues together and package them up. They say, `We want you to accept this package with this tie.' It is not a new way of doing things but it is inappropriate and sometimes it sends the wrong message. In this instance it does send the wrong message. It ties two different issues together to provide a new shift. I would not mind if there was going to be a net benefit but I do not think the government have been able to show that it is going to provide a net benefit. Tying is a way for the government to get an issue up that they otherwise would have failed to get up because they had not been able to convince Australians—nor us, the Greens or the Democrats—that their industrial policies are worth while. </para><para>Mind you, this government often reminds me of the Menzies era, when the government would cut and slash in one area and then after a couple of years—when people got used to that—would give a little bit of it back. This government still seems to be following the same cycle. It has ripped $5 billion out of universities since 1996 and now it proposes to put some of it back. But the government has ripped it out over a couple of years so that people were more likely to get used to it or they might not have noticed as much or felt the pain as much as they might today. It then says, `We'll give you some back.' The government makes a song and dance about it and says, `Look how generous we are in terms of providing increases to universities.' But, if the government had maintained the funding levels, we might be in a different position now.</para><para>Students attending regional campuses will also attract additional payments for the institution depending on the location and size of the campus. Questions, of course, remain. What about the University of Southern Queensland, located in Toowoomba? Can the government assure the students that their university will see an increase in funding? How much will the funding be? When will they receive it? Is there a cap on the amount they can receive? All of these questions should have been asked by the government senators who purport to represent Queensland. The opposition reminds government senators that it is their bill and they should support it. I suspect Senator Tierney will speak on the bill. I will wait to hear from him. But I have not heard Queensland senators speak on the bill. I had hoped that all of these questions would be answered by Liberal or coalition senators from Queensland, but I suspect I will not hear from them.</para><para>What do you suppose the reason might be? Perhaps they do not want their comments to be on the record. Perhaps it is not ABC funding that they are interested in. Or are they concerned that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>might reflect that they are incapable of indicating that students are better off under this plan? Perhaps they do not want to say that. Perhaps I will leave it at that point. Is it because they fear a backlash by students and parents in their local communities? It is more likely that that is the underlying reason we will not hear from them.</para><para>Further changes the government propose include major changes to HECS and new loans schemes. Currently there are three HECS bands, each with a fixed rate of student contribution. From 2005, these fixed rates will be replaced by a range. This range will be from 30 per cent above the current rate to zero per cent above the current rate. Institutions will be able to set the student contribution at any point within this range. The opposition raised the issue that, in effect, it gives the individual universities the ability to put fees up by up to 30 per cent as they see fit. Some argue that the top universities will all put up fees by the maximum amount. The effect of that, of course, will be that all other universities will be in a bind. Do other universities follow and put up their fees by 30 per cent to follow the top 10, or do you create a two-tiered, or multi-tiered, system of universities? Do you create a system where those universities that may not fit into the top 10 end up in a price-cutting war, in a brand market? Is that the concept of a university system that the coalition want?</para><para>It is not the university system that I envisage. What I have been trying to say—and I think the coalition have failed to listen—is that I think education is far more important than selling detergent in a supermarket and allowing universities to enter a price-cutting war. But clearly the coalition do not think that. In fact, the coalition think it is acceptable to allow universities to do that. I do not think it is what our communities expect. Do Queensland government senators have any comment on the prospect that within months we could have brand-name universities in a two-tiered system? I do not think they have much to say about it. </para><para>What will future employers look at when assessing someone for a position? Will the university name be a factor when deciding employment, rather than qualifications, skills and experience? I hope it would be the latter. Is the government relying on market forces going against the trend, which in this instance will create a massive divide between the top 10 universities, who have enough demand for places to warrant a 30 per cent increase, while the rest—including small and regional campuses—will be disadvantaged as a result?</para><para>The Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University said in a local meeting that Griffith will be forced to put fees up by 30 per cent. He said the realities of competing in the market for education would force them to follow suit and that to not put fees up at Griffith while UQ did would make Griffith look, probably, inferior. With $5 billion being ripped from university places, vice-chancellors are hanging out, of course, for whatever extra cash they might be able to get. That is not surprising. I cannot see why they would not choose to increase their fees if they still could fill all their places.</para><para>In addition, a fourth band will be established, called `national priorities', which will consist of education and nursing courses. The range for this band will be from zero to the current level of HECS for band 1. The minimum repayment threshold will be lifted from $24,365 by three per cent to $30,000 and by four per cent, and the maximum rate will be increased by eight per cent to $60,000.</para><para>The government also claims it will reduce the discount from 25 per cent to 20 per cent for up-front payments and from 15 per cent to 10 per cent for partial voluntary payments. It troubles me that wage earners might have to be able to afford $100,000 up front for their children's or child's education. Will the market be skewed as a consequence of the new government initiatives that are contained within this bill? Is it appropriate in this instance to use these sorts of benchmarks to change the system without adequate examination? I do not think it is. I think this government has failed to make its case. I hope Senator Tierney can enlighten me on some of the questions that I have raised in this. But I do not think, unfortunately, that he will be able to resolve some of the issues that are within it.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name></talker><para>—No, that is probably right.

I would like to hear you argue why it will. It is unlikely to and you know it. That is why I am here talking about that. If you think I should not be talking about education then you are in the wrong place. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Another issue is learning entitlements. There has been considerable debate about the source of increased funding to the education system. The major sources of university revenue are the Commonwealth government and students through HECS and fees. The debate about the relative contribution of the Commonwealth and students tends to focus on a number of issues. It tends to focus on the possible deterrent effect of increased HECS on participation. That is one of the issues I have tried to use my own personal experience to highlight. But Senator Tierney wants to shut his ears because the substance of this debate is not with him. Other issues are the costs and benefits of a higher education for the individual in society, the financial circumstances of students and the Australian situation compared to that overseas.</para><para>One of the justifications for increasing the cost of higher education for students is that they obtain substantial lifetime benefits from such education. But there is always another side to the debate. `Lifetime' is a good word to use because in some of these cases it will take a lifetime of sacrifice, or the better part of their younger years, to pay off these massive debts. You can never track some of the consequences that that may have. People may choose to marry later in life, they may have children later in life, or they may make other decisions because they have to pay off extraordinary debts during their early years. For example, they might make career choices to increase their personal income, whereas they might otherwise have made career choices to increase the benefit they can offer to society. These are the choices that the government argues are available to students.</para><para>These bills that the government have put forward do not increase choice but in fact limit choice. They know that and they recognise that. They limit the choice to a small section of the population, the population that they tend to want to favour. That is what this government are all about. They are not about increasing choice; they are about limiting choice. They use that label—although `misuse' is perhaps a better word. That begs the question as to why the average worker should subsidise the education of someone who will eventually earn substantially more than them. Those arguments are always put up. In September 2001 the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee published <inline font-style="italic">Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university student finances, </inline><inline font-style="italic">2000</inline><inline font-style="italic">, </inline>by M. Long and M. Hayden. Much of that struck a chord with my own experiences.</para><para>In the end you have to examine the important parts of the government's legislation and come to a balanced view about what it will actually do. In this instance it will stifle student choice, as Senator Kim Carr said in his chair's remarks on the committee report. It will lumber students and their families with the kind of debt that may well stop people from having kids. It will hit those who are less well-off the hardest and reduce their chance of getting an education. It will deepen divisions in society and compromise our economic and social prosperity. It will undermine academic freedom. It treats universities with contempt. Senator Carr said it well and succinctly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>17614</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to also speak on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> and how they provide a comprehensive and integrated framework for the benefit of our university system.

Labor are very happy to sit there and criticise this bill—they have been doing this all night—but I would ask government senators to reflect on the alternatives that have been put forward by the Labor Party. Can we recall in the debate today an actual alternative policy—a vision for higher education—being put forward by the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats? The Labor Party have actually had a shot at preparing policy, but no-one has mentioned that tonight.

They carp about what we are doing in this bill, but what are they going to do? Senator Stott Despoja, before we had even debated the bill, said that we should go back to the drawing board. What she wanted was a totally government funded approach to higher education—free universities for everyone. This utopian view of the way we should finance higher education is the reason why the sector got into such strife financially in the first place. It goes back to the Whitlam era of free universities when resource levels declined, class sizes grew, academic workloads went up and waiting lists grew.</para><para>The Dawkins reforms in the 1980s realised that this was unsustainable: they were mugged by economic reality and they brought in the HECS system of that time. They recognised the need for a public-private funding mix. This was introduced by a Labor government. This bill actually builds on those reforms. We are not introducing a dramatic new model here; this was the model the Labor Party devised. We are extending it, making the private-public funding mix work better, funding the sector better and giving the universities the flexibility to fulfil their mission. </para><para>When the Prime Minister commissioned Dr Brendan Nelson as the Minister for Education, Science and Training he gave him a very clear mandate: the government's higher education policy should position Australia to meet the current and future needs of the community. Commentators within the sector and other analysts agreed that a significant number of issues needed to be addressed to position Australia properly in the new century with a university sector able to fulfil the needs of an information society. These issues included: the need for universities to have greater scope to raise revenue from diverse sources; the desirability of greater specialisation and diversity within the sector; the need to enable higher participation in higher education, particularly of equity groups; and the need to maintain and enhance the capacity of Australian universities to offer quality educational services and respond to the widening demands of living in a globalised, interconnected world.</para><para>Other factors of concern to the government have been that institutions have had little control over the number of undergraduate students they enrol and the fees they pay, irrespective of demand, course cost, private gain or public good; that current arrangements overly restrict the number of Australian full fee paying students that universities can enrol; that regional universities and campuses face significantly higher costs as a result of their geographical locations; and that there have been few incentives for universities to collaborate with other universities. Our ability to maintain our competitiveness as a nation will increasingly depend on the knowledge, problem-solving skills and innovative nature of our work force, and that, in turn, is largely dependent on the quality and effectiveness of our education, training and research systems. Irrespective of their circumstances, Australians need to be able to fulfil their potential for learning, facilitated by universities offering teaching of the highest quality and deeply rooted in scholarship.</para><para>Australia now has a mass higher education system, and this change to the nature of the demands made on universities creates great challenges for the future. We now need universities not only to help students acquire the knowledge and skills required by employers but to meet society's broader needs. In order to be able to do this, universities must be able to establish closer and more responsive relationships with their communities. This is particularly true in the case of regional universities where, because access to higher education is more limited, getting this relationship right is more crucial. The government is absolutely committed to ensuring that all Australian students have equal opportunities in accessing higher education and fulfilling their potential, regardless of their personal circumstances and backgrounds. These principles have been central to the development of the higher education reform package. For these reasons the government is providing in this package 31,600 new places over a four-year period, an increase in its contribution per student for those places and the continuing provision of free university education at the point of access. </para><para>In addition to the measures I have just outlined, the government will commit $160 million to introducing 25,000 new scholarships over the next four years. These scholarships will help students from disadvantaged groups and rural and regional areas with their study and accommodation costs. It is interesting to note that scholarships in this country actually disappeared when the Whitlam government brought in free universities. But when the Hawke government brought in fees again, they did not bring back the scholarships. One of the most significant measures in this reform package is the fact that we have reintroduced the scholarships that have been missing for so long. These scholarships will help disadvantaged groups, particularly in the rural and regional areas, with their study and accommodation costs, and priority will be given to full-time students from low socioeconomic and Indigenous backgrounds. </para><para>A best practice higher education sector is about more than providing funding. The government will require substantial reforms to the sector into which we are putting these additional funds, and one of the most important of these is industrial relations measures. The government have provided $55 million in extra incentives for workplace reform. There has been considerable angst on the other side and within groups in the community about these workplace measures. There have been strikes and demonstrations, and one would wonder over what. If you look at the actual nature of the measure, then what we are requiring is nothing particularly revolutionary. We have had Australian workplace agreements in this country for some time. All we are saying in this bill—and this is what the Labor Party really has to address: the essence of industrial relations reform—is that Australian workplace agreements be available to staff if they want to access them. There is no compulsion.</para><para>We were roundly criticised in editorials in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> because this did not go far enough. They thought we should have AWAs right across the sector. We are not proposing that. We are proposing a very modest measure: that these AWAs become available. We get a song and dance from the other side on this, because it upsets the cosy arrangement that currently exists between the unions and management in this sector. But it is one that has not done any good in terms of developing a dynamic university sector.</para><para>These reforms will enable universities to retain highly qualified staff, to facilitate capacity and diversity in course offerings and to respond to the changing demands of the community, industry and students. Institutions will be encouraged to tailor enterprise agreements to the particular needs of each institution and its employees, and will need to show that they are complying with the Commonwealth's workplace relations policies. This does not mean that the Commonwealth will be twisting the arm of institutions to ensure that everyone takes up AWAs. It does mean that universities will be expected to expand the range of employment options open to staff, including the offering of AWAs. This will provide staff with the right to choose genuine freedom of association, and a Liberal government makes no apology for such a policy.</para><para>Governance is also a first-order issue and critical to the reform of Australia's universities. It is true to say that in many cases the current university governance structures are anachronistic. They were simply not designed to support the nature and complexity of the activities that universities now undertake. The government considers that this can best be achieved through national protocols that set minimum standards.</para><para>Finally, I would like to refer to perhaps the most spirited defence of these higher education reform measures. This was offered not by the Liberal Party and not by people out in the community but by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, which is not often seen as a friend of this government. In its editorial of 20 September this year, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> had this to say: </para><quote><para>If, by blocking them—</para></quote><para>that is, the higher education reforms—</para><quote><para>in the Senate, the Opposition and minor parties prevent the three Higher Education Support bills from becoming law, they will have harmed, not helped, the cause of higher education and damaged, not improved, the prospects of a generation of students.</para></quote><para>The article continued:</para><quote><para>Reforms such as those now given shape in these bills are needed to restore financial stability to the tertiary education sector. That stability was destroyed by measures introduced by Labor in the late 1980s which saw a rapid conversion of tertiary institutions into universities. The rising costs and drift in standards which have followed have been threatening the health of the tertiary education system ever since. Without the reforms now proposed by the Education Minister, Brendan Nelson, the capacity of tertiary institutions in Australia to operate at the levels expected of them, in research and in teaching, will remain compromised. The current proposed Higher Education Support Bill is the university sector's best chance at achieving reform that is sustainable and fair to staff and students alike.</para></quote><para>The article concluded—and it is a pity that Senator Ludwig is not in the chamber to hear this, given his earlier remarks:</para><quote><para>Reckless obstruction of the Nelson reforms does more harm than good.</para></quote><para>This package of reforms is the best opportunity that the universities have had in 25 years.

This legislation is fatally flawed, and the impact of passing these bills most certainly means the destruction of one of the most important foundations of a modern civil society—an education for all Australians. These bills propose to further increase the cost to students of higher education, to place strict limits on the amount of time students can have a HECS place, to impose a regressive industrial relations environment on university staff and to destroy student unionism and they set women up to be the worst affected.</para></talk.start><para>The question the Howard government is asking of Australian society today, through these bills, is: what price will you and your family pay to get an education? Equality of access to education will effectively have been thrown out the window, and students and their families—because, let us face it, families will end up shouldering much of the burden under this agenda of the Liberal Party and The Nationals—will be forced to bear the brunt of staggering fee hikes. The fact is that, in order to make up for the government's $5 billion worth of cuts from our universities since 1996, this government is making students pay. It is pulling that money out of families to fill the hole that it has created over the years.</para><para>Australian students and their families now pay some of the highest study costs in the world, whilst this government makes the fifth smallest contribution to universities as a proportion of GDP amongst the OECD countries. How backward an approach this is! The Howard government embarked upon this trail of destruction in 1996 and still does not get it. As every other comparable developed economy saw the wisdom of investment in education in a modern society and an information society, Australia bucked the trend. For some reason the Howard government looked backwards rather than forwards and started pulling money out of our higher education system. I do not know what they were thinking—that somehow Australia would miraculously not have to rely on clever people and the knowledge jobs of the future, those high-wage, high-skill jobs that we all believe are the foundation for future economic and employment opportunities in Australia? I cannot believe the Howard government squandered Australia's future in such an appalling way. </para><para>Specifically, these bills seek to introduce the partial deregulation of HECS. This means that universities will be able to increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent on top of the already massive blow-out in HECS rates since 1996. This will mean huge HECS debts. You can imagine a student completing their degree owing $50,000. Yet the Howard government could not care less about the added financial burden that this legislation will place on these people. Instead it chooses to ignore the fact that student debt has more than doubled, hitting a staggering $9 billion, and that student contributions to HECS have jumped to over 85 per cent since 1996. Students are already required to work multiple jobs and longer hours in order to support themselves. This can only compromise the quality of their education. Like many others in society they become time poor and struggle to make ends meet in their education, their households or their jobs that are necessary for their survival.</para><para>Once they graduate, young Australians are thrust into working life—if they are lucky, if they have a job to go to—but they will be weighed down by massive debt. Reduced home ownership rates, delayed parenthood and the increasing brain drain are just some of the impacts of the Howard government's quest to maintain high student debt as a result of its higher education policies. How hypocritical it is of the Howard government to start lamenting these side effects, to say how devastating it is that—shock, horror—young people are not having babies anymore or cannot afford a home. This government contributes to all of those issues, and one of the contributing factors is the high cost of higher education in Australia.</para><para>These bills mean only to increase educational opportunity for those who can afford to buy it, not for those who earn it. The Howard government is intent on discriminating against people who gain entry to university by the merit of their academic achievements. Since 1998, full-fee-paying students have been able to buy a place at university ahead of applicants with higher marks. Any extension of this scheme, as is proposed by the Howard government, will mean the Americanisation of our education system. Money, more than marks, will open university doors, and with this will begin the era of $100,000 degrees.</para><para>Our universities will revert to their historical role, becoming the domain of the elite. But that is precisely the intention of the Howard government, which is proposing to increase the number of full-fee-paying places—which could cost up to $150,000 each—to half of all university places. Thousands of students who have met the academic requirements for university entrance will miss out to those who are less capable but who have more money. Australians should not have to pay exorbitant fees to buy a university place when they are already contributing to our tertiary system through tax and other forms of support.</para><para>Labor believes that access to university should be based on your achievements and potential, not on how much you or your family can pay. The government stands up and defends these actions by saying, `All right, if you can't afford a degree we'll lend you the money by implementing a new loans scheme.' Under such a scheme, students would be encouraged to take out huge debts like $50,000 at six per cent interest. Even if such debts are paid off in 10 years, students could be slugged with a $16,000 interest bill. It does not sound like a good deal to me. </para><para>This is not help. It spells financial disaster for many students and their families, and especially for women. Since 1996, under the Howard government the situation for Australian women has worsened in all areas: education, employment, health, child care—the list goes on. The proposed changes to the higher education system will continue the decline in access to quality public education for all Australians who cannot afford to pay full up-front fees, and this particularly affects women.</para><para>With many students set to leave university owing more than $40,000, and because on average women still earn around two-thirds as much as men, by definition it takes years longer for women to repay their study debt. Even in full-time employment, the difference between male and female earnings is now greater than it was in 1996. In 1996, women in full-time employment earned $163.30 less each week than men. By 2003, this figure increased by $25 a week. It is no wonder then that at the moment around 65 per cent of women will never pay off their HECS debt, meaning that women will be paying thousands of dollars in interest alone.</para><para>But wait—as with most things in this draconian legislation, there is more. The Howard government also proposes to increase HECS fees again, despite the fact that under this government the top rates of HECS have more than tripled, from $2,442 to $8,355 per year. This means that students, and in particular women, will be hard-pressed to ever be able to afford to pay off their HECS debt, leaving many with a debt hanging over their heads for 30 years or more.</para><para>This has been made even more difficult by the fact that, back in 1996, the Howard government cut the HECS repayment threshold, which means that university graduates have to start paying off their debts sooner. Again, the lower threshold disproportionately affects women who are working part time or who are earning less money but are still forced to repay that debt. The proposed changes announced by Minister Nelson in this package seek to increase the threshold to $30,000. If the original cuts to it had not been made by the Howard government, it would now stand at $39,000. So this change goes no way to addressing the damage that the Howard government has already done. It is like taking with one hand and then giving a bit back with the other and pretending that it is somehow a positive outcome.</para><para>Minister Nelson has also proposed the introduction of a five-year learning limit, which means that if you are lucky enough to achieve one of the reduced number of HECS places in universities and cannot afford to pay full fees, your HECS entitlement runs out in five years. This proposed change is very much an anti-learning stance and takes no account of the different pressures facing Australian students or the unique circumstances that can affect their lives. It makes no allowance for the 85 per cent of Australian students who work part time to put themselves through university. It makes no allowance for parents or guardians, who, again, are overwhelmingly women, and the pressures facing them when they undertake study.</para><para>By making access to quality education increasingly difficult, the Howard government is simply saying yet again that it does not value the advancement of women. The Howard government has done nothing, and will continue to do nothing, to address the issue of gender equality in Australian society. This has been made even more evident by this legislation. The impact upon universities themselves of the mandatory industrial relations regime the government proposes also disproportionately affects women. The government's agenda is aimed at decreasing job security and workers' entitlements by increasing the number of casual and part-time jobs—positions which, again, are predominately filled by women—and decreasing more secure, full-time employment. </para><para>Thousands of university academic and general staff have protested against the regressive industrial relations agenda contained in these bills before us; they have marched against the destruction of the higher education system that it proposes to introduce. The bills mean the end of any sort of protection of university staff's right to collective agreement, linking university funding to the industrial conditions of university staff. In particular, the bills seek to enforce the government's ideological objection to unionism by tying $404 million of university funding to the employment of university staff on AWAs. This means that some staff will be denied the opportunity to sign collective agreements, thus guaranteeing better wages and conditions, by universities who are being blackmailed by funding pressures.</para><para>Students, too, have marched in support of university staff whose quality, wages and conditions they know are essential to the provision of quality tertiary teaching and education in Australia. These students are voicing their protests over the other elements included in these bills—increased fees, massive debt burdens and, as I said, the destruction of student unionism. Staff and students alike have had to organise in order to demonstrate to the Howard government that university staff are an asset to the education system and society—not just a commodity—and to defend what was once a quality and accessible education system. I commend every academic staff member and student who has taken the time to voice their opinion through their attendance at student action days and rallies.</para><para>In my electorate of the ACT, staff and students from the University of Canberra and the Australian Catholic University protested against these draconian bills and in support of their right to collective agreement. They rallied outside the office of my Senate counterpart from the ACT, Senator Gary Humphries, demanding the withdrawal of the offensive bills and an end to the Howard government's attack on higher education. They were joined in the march by university staff from the Australian National University and the Australian Defence Force Academy.</para><para>The staff and students demanded the independence of Australian universities in the negotiation of staff wages and conditions in research and teaching. They believe that the quality of education in these institutions is threatened by this legislation. As National Tertiary Education Union spokesperson Mr Mike Donaldson commented at the time that the Howard government is:</para><quote><para>... turning our workplaces into very unpleasant places and obviously that's having an effect on the quality of education.</para></quote><para>I think that is an understatement. I am happy to say that university staff from the Australian National University in my electorate have recently signed off on a union-negotiated heads of agreement with the university. It is a credit to the university that they have done so. The agreement guarantees, among other things, increased pay and increased access to paid maternity leave. The positive outcomes of this agreement were the result of the collective bargaining of the university staff and a university administration that recognises the value of those staff and the tremendous asset that they are to the ANU. </para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>17622</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>—Order!

Right from the outset, let me say that SBS provides a wonderful service to Australians. It helps to refresh and renew the unique Australian culture that has sprung from the wellspring of cultures and traditions from all around the world. It helps to introduce Australians of very different cultures to the driving motives and life forces of other cultures. For me, as an Australian born in Italy, SBS is a wonderful way to keep in touch with the language of my original homeland—a dynamic language that, like English, constantly changes in response to both internal and external influences. For example, it is a godsend to my mother and to people like her, who have come to this country relatively late in life—that is to say, not as yet to be moulded children—and for whom English is always going to be a second language. I am, and my family is, part of the natural SBS audience. I would not be without it.</para></talk.start><para>But, at the same time, SBS operates on public money and must meet the requirements of its public charter. One of those requirements is accountability. Another is to provide programming that would not otherwise be available. That is why, when my attention was drawn to a forthcoming program with the come-on title of <inline font-style="italic">Desperately Seeking Sheila</inline> and which SBS had publicised, shall we say, rather breathlessly, I commented publicly to this effect. I said:</para><quote><para>“Some people may be asking the question `Why have SBS at all?'.”</para></quote><para>Of course, the question was rhetorical. There is every reason to have SBS and absolutely no reason not to.</para><para>We need to recognise that it is a niche provider, and I think most Australians appreciate and recognise that it is a niche provider. It is not a commercial broadcaster—that market, the market for tabloid television, is very well served in Australia by other broadcasters. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper said in an editorial comment shortly after this and other arguments broke out about SBS programming choices, Australia gets good value for its SBS dollar. On only $130 million a year, SBS provides quality documentaries, news from around the world in languages from around the world and other first-class programs.</para><para>When I commented publicly on <inline font-style="italic">Desperately Seeking Sheila</inline>, SBS moved swiftly to put me right. It was not some sort of inland <inline font-style="italic">Temptation Island</inline>, I was informed by Glenys Rowe, General Manager of SBS Independent. Having had that conversation with Ms Rowe, and because I believe above all in being scrupulously fair in making judgments, I am prepared to give the program the benefit of the doubt. If it is a new experiment in the advocacy of social advance, then fair enough. We shall see. If it is not, more people than me will be asking for their money back.</para><para>There is one other aspect of SBS's programming that is worrisome. It also relates broadly to the issue of judgment. On the one hand, it is expressed in terms of SBS's apparent willingness to broadcast communist propaganda from Vietnam in the guise of news. On the other, it is found in the capacity of SBS to virtually demonise the Israelis, who have to deal almost daily with the obscene results of homicidal terrorism and still do so very largely under the independent rule of law in a parliamentary democracy, while giving those who shelter and nurture the terrorists a virtual dream run. Granted, it can be very hard to judge who is right and who is wrong, who is telling the truth and who is lying, when the story that has to be told is developing, fast moving and almost inevitably contentious. </para><para>I want to focus briefly tonight on the Vietnamese news broadcast issue because it seems to me that this is a matter of such important concern to Australian Vietnamese and potentially of such direct impact in our bilateral relations that it deserves a good airing again in this place. On 28 October in this place I made a speech that identified what I felt was a core issue in this debate. SBS management had said that before it agreed to the <inline font-style="italic">WorldWatch</inline> program taking a direct and unedited—and I stress unedited—satellite feed from Vietnam's VTV4 channel its content had been vetted and found not to be classifiable as propaganda. There was an attempt—a not-so-subtle implication, you might say—that critics should give the product of VTV4 the same news-value ranking as news programs from Italy, France, Germany and Spain. The SBS decision to screen a 30-minute daily dose of communist propaganda downloaded unedited from a satellite and broadcast free to air in Australia is a very curious one indeed, to say the least. It indicates that SBS either does not know what propaganda is or, worse, that it does not care. It is important to remember that we are dealing here with a television broadcaster that openly says on its web page that it `follows the Vietnamese Communist Party's policies and propaganda directives'. In this context, too, it is instructive to remember that SBS is broadcasting, as news, material that passes muster on the nod of a national leadership that routinely—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—You heard what they said.

I would like to speak about the proposed Australia-United States free trade agreement that is currently being negotiated behind closed doors by this government. Last May the then shadow minister for trade, Mr Craig Emerson, and I travelled around Tasmania and met with a number of groups including interested trade unions and many members of the public to discuss the implications of the Australia-United States free trade agreement.</para></talk.start><para>I must say I was surprised at the level of interest in this issue from the general public as at that stage it had not received much coverage in the media. But the people of Tasmania are very well informed, as you know, Mr President. They have listened to the Prime Minister and they are staying alert to any attempts by this government to give away what is in this country's best interests, given Mr Howard's increasingly sycophantic relationship with President Bush. Perhaps the Prime Minister should take some advice from the wife of a former president instead. As Nancy Reagan put it, `Just say no.' Say no to anything that is not in our best interests and say no to anything that will jeopardise our interests into the future.</para><para>Last Friday night we saw the creme de la creme of the Australian film industry going public with their concerns about the security of their industry in light of the impending free trade agreement. We all know that it is much cheaper for Australian broadcasters to show American programs than it is to produce their own. America, having such a huge domestic market for its locally produced programs, is able to recoup the costs of production within the United States. Anything that can then be made selling the product overseas is a bonus and programs can therefore be sold relatively cheaply, certainly at a much lower price than it costs Australian production companies to produce our own local drama and other programming. It was heartening to see the unity shown by those attending the AFI awards. Green and yellow ribbons were on practically every lapel signifying the opposition to any watering down of our ability to tell Australian stories and reflect Australian culture in our film, television and new media. </para><para>We heard in question time today and when a number of my colleagues, including Senator Lundy, took note of the answer given by Senator Kemp that there has been no guarantee given by the government that our national cultural interests will be protected into the future. Minister Vaile has in fact already flagged concessions regarding new media and new types of digital media, concessions that represent the surrendering of future Australian local content rules. He has flagged the acceptance of `standstill', the US government objective. Standstill allows us to keep what we have currently got—and that is generous—but not add to it in the future. As Simon Whipp from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance said last Friday:</para><quote><para>Existing protections such as local content quotas for free-to-air commercial TV won't be affected, but this is like protecting gas lamps in the face of electrification.</para></quote><para>Unlike GATS, the general agreement on trades and services, a multilateral trade agreement, which is a `positive list' agreement—in other words, one in which rules apply only to those services or goods that each government actively chooses to include—the free trade agreement has a `negative list' structure for services and investment. Only those things that the government lists as exemptions will actually be excluded. So it is an opt-out, opt-in situation. This makes it extremely difficult to get it right for now and for our future.</para><para>There are a number of other concerns I have with the United States free trade agreement, or what I know about it—and that is a concern that many others share. We do not know what it will be until it will be too late. The only say that people through parliament will get is if we are asked to vote on the legislative changes that may be necessary for the implementation of the free trade agreement. But we all know how mean and tricky this government can be and we believe it will do everything to ensure that the people of Australia do not get the opportunity to have their say, certainly not if the say they will want to have in any way interferes with something our Prime Minister's new first best friend may want. </para><para>Any agreement signed will become binding on all levels of Australian government—federal, state and local—upon signing. This is contrasted with the situation in the United States where the congress has the right to scrutinise, debate and vote on any trade agreement and has a 90-day period for congressional review. </para><para>I am still concerned about the future for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We all know that this government wanted to increase the price of medicines but was thwarted by those of us who wished to protect the ability of all Australians, particularly those living on low incomes, to access the medicines they need not just those that they can afford. With a standard antibiotic costing about $60 in the United States, the pressure from the US drug companies for the buying power—and therefore the cost controls—of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to be neutralised is huge. Again—and I quote Nancy Reagan to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, `Just say no.'</para><para>It is also vital that we do not give up our right to determine our own quarantine regulations based on good science, not political interference. This is an issue that is well understood in our home state of Tasmania, Mr President, where we have had to fight very hard in recent years to keep our aquaculture industry safe from the risk of disease from imported uncooked salmon. We are told that any free trade agreement signed with the United States will be of huge benefit to our agricultural sector and yet the experience elsewhere and with our own recently concluded free trade agreement with Thailand is that long phase-in periods have been the order of the day.  </para><para>In the Australia-Thailand FTA, some barriers applying to Australian beef, sugar and dairy products will not be phased out until 2020, and tariffs on our milk and cream will not be eliminated until 2025. The National Farmers Federation say that phase-in periods of up to five years are acceptable—but not 20 years or more. If the agreement gives either party a `get out' clause, as may well be the case, providing a negotiating period of notices given, we could make many concessions now and a future congress could then decide to pull out of the agreement before a single benefit is felt by our farmers. We also know that US producers are unhappy with our single desk arrangements for the marketing of wheat. This in no way affects our trading relationship with the United States and therefore should have no place in the agreement. </para><para>I am also concerned about the risk to Australia Post. We have seen the United Parcel Service of America challenge Canada Post's public service monopoly claiming this enables Canada Post to unfairly compete in express delivery. They are claiming $160 million compensation in a tribunal hearing that is yet to be finalised under the notorious chapter 11 provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Chapter 11 provisions allow corporations and private investors to directly sue governments in the event that legislation, regulations or administrative decisions affect the value of the foreign investors' assets. In the light of this, I share concern of many of my constituents about the impact of the free trade agreement on our ability to legislate to protect our environment or to allow consumers to make informed choices.</para><para>It is no secret that US producers of genetically modified crops do not like labelling. In the absence of long-term studies on the effect of GM technology and for other reasons as well, many consumers, if given sufficient information, choose not to buy products with GM content. We should not be giving away the right of Australian consumers to make informed choices. These are some of my concerns, ones I share with many Tasmanians as the attendance at the forums mentioned earlier and correspondence received on this issue attest. It is not possible to resolve these concerns because of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations and our lack of ability to trust what we are told by this government. In the meantime, all I can do is stay alert and alarmed and keep posted on the free trade agreement. I urge the people of Australia to do the same.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Research: Embryos</title><page.no>17626</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17626</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier this month the Department of Education, Science and Training attempted to cover up its failure to honour a firm commitment given to me and to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee in June last year.

In fact, in the tradition of <inline font-style="italic">Yes</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Minister</inline> they invented a new strategy for breaking commitments. I am publicising the strategy not to endorse it or to suggest to others that they use it but to warn the public and senators that they should beware. The strategy is quite simple. You say that, at the time, your statement was accurate. You then say the situation has changed—perhaps citing changed commercial arrangements and changes in legislation—then you follow that up with superfluous advice that the minister has written to advise of this change. So what could be wrong with that? The departmental officials told me, without the hint of a smile, that `Basically, the situation has changed but Dr Shergold's statement was certainly accurate in the light of the information he had at the time.'</para><para>By this shaky standard any commitment can easily be disregarded. The great benefit in using this strategy is that you can also pretend that the matter was out of your hands and that you could not have taken action to avoid it, even if you wanted to. But this is a very serious matter; it goes to the very heart of this chamber's responsibility of review and scrutiny of executive government actions. The biggest disappointment to me is that the Minister for Science was dragged into this deception. He was not willing to challenge the departmental advice and apparently decided that human embryo research should take priority over a commitment to colleagues. The interesting question is: did his senior minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, also agree to this action? Trust is an important social good. The currency of political life and negotiation is trust. Without trust I will find it very difficult to deal with this portfolio. In the interests of saving time, I seek leave to incorporate the speech I have prepared on this issue.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>Earlier this month the Department of Education, Science and Training attempted to cover up its failure to honour a firm commitment given to me and to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee in June last year. Those more cynical than me may think such an experience is par for the course for politicians. Those with low opinions of politicians may also think it is some justice. But strange as it may seem, I think it's unusual.</para><para>I'm used to Ministers and public servants being careful, obtuse, and even evasive with their answers. But I'm not used to being misled.</para><para>Last year during routine questioning of officials from the Education, Science and Training portfolio I sought and was given a commitment by the then Secretary of the Department, now head of the public service, Dr Peter Shergold.</para><para>As you might imagine, public servants do not give commitments easily to non-government senators. Especially wily public servants like Dr Peter Shergold. But after his officials checked, and after two hours consideration, Dr Shergold made a commitment to me that “harvesting activity will not take place in either facility”. That is, he made a commitment on 5 June 2002 that human embryos would not be destroyed in experiments to extract human embryonic stem cells in two buildings the government is funding. </para><para>Now I should go into some background to demonstrate what a firm commitment this was. Early on in the questioning I asked Mr Grahame Cook, Group Manager for the Science Group, to confirm what he had told me at an earlier estimates hearing.</para><para>“Are you then ruling out completely the use of that building for anything other than the multiplication of stem cell lines, as understood at the time of the last estimates committee?”</para><para>Mr Cook replied: “that would be my understanding”.</para><para>I then asked “could I have that confirmed by Dr Shergold? Could I have that absolutely confirmed, because that is not my information from elsewhere”.</para><para>I then asked Professor Vicki Sara, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Research Council “... would you confirm what Grahame Cook said a moment ago—that is, the building would not be used for the purposes that I mentioned?”</para><para>Professor Sara said cautiously “what I can confirm is that the building will not be used to conduct any research that does not fall under the legislative framework which the government will put forward.”</para><para>By mentioning the legislative framework she made it very clear that the Department was aware of the qualifications they might have to make in any commitment to the Committee and to me—qualifications Dr Shergold did not make.</para><para>I replied to Professor Sara: “that is not answering my question, with due respect. Are you able to confirm that the facilities of the building would not be used for the purpose of harvesting stem cells from so-called surplus IVF embryos—human embryos?”</para><para>Mr Cook then volunteered that one of his staff “has just gone to get a definitive answer”.</para><para>A definitive answer.</para><para>Approximately two hours later, just before a short break for afternoon tea, Dr Shergold made his commitment, saying with prompting from Professor Sara, “I am able to confirm that harvesting activity will not take place in either facility”.</para><para>Immediately after Dr Shergold's statement Professor Sara took the opportunity to clarify an unrelated point with me, but she did not take the opportunity to clarify Dr Shergold's statement. Remember this is the same Professor Sara who had earlier raised legislation as a possible issue before Mr Cook offered to get me a “definitive answer”.</para><para>I could go into some detail about human embryo research and the activities of the National Stem Cell Centre using buildings financed by the Australian Government to the tune, in the case of this particular grant, of $5.5 million on top of $46 million of scare government funds they already received, but that is not relevant to my complaint.</para><para>My complaint is that just over 12 months after the commitment was made, I received a letter from the Minister for Science, Peter McGauran, in June telling me that in fact the Government had decided to do exactly the opposite of what it had told the Committee. It would allow human embryo harvesting in the two government-funded buildings. A succession of correspondence followed, but the Minister was not willing to stand by his Department's commitment.</para><para>I am not aware of any attempt by the Minister for Science or the Department to inform the Committee of their decision to break a commitment.</para><para>During this month's estimates committee hearings I finally had the chance to talk directly to the public servants from the Education Department. Dr Shergold had moved on to a more senior position, but the public servants who did turn up demonstrated a high degree of skill, imagination and front in explaining their actions.</para><para>In fact, in the tradition of Yes Minister, they have invented a new strategy for breaking commitments. I am publicising this strategy not to endorse it or to suggest to others that they use it, but to warn the public and senators that they should beware.</para><para>The strategy is very simple. You say that at the time your statement was accurate. You then say that the situation has changed—perhaps citing changed commercial arrangements and changes in legislation.

So what could be wrong with that? </para><para>The departmental officials told me, without a hint of a smile, that “basically, the situation has changed but Dr Shergold's statement was certainly accurate in the light of the information he had at the time.” By this shaky standard any commitment can easily be discarded.</para><para>The great benefit in using this strategy is that you can also pretend that the matter was out of your hands—that you could not have taken action to avoid it even if you had wanted to.</para><para>But of course they could have taken action. And they didn't want to.</para><para>Quite simply, this change brazenly breaks a commitment given to a Senate estimates committee and to myself. What the Department fails to make clear is that it had the opportunity to put a provision in the funding agreement to make good its commitment, but it chose not to. It pretends that the fact that commercial arrangements and legislation changed, obliged it to take a particular course of action. The commercial arrangements were not binding on the government. The legislation allows some embryo research, but does not oblige the government to fund it.</para><para>There is also the pretence by the Department in the estimates committee earlier this month that Dr Shergold and his department may not even have been aware of the draft Research Involving Embryos Bill. Remember Dr Shergold made the commitment on 5 June 2002 and the bill was introduced into the House two weeks later.</para><para>One week earlier than Dr Shergold's commitment, on 30 May 2002, the Australian Government had announced $46 million in funding for Alan Trounson's National Stem Cell Centre. This involved funding from the Australian Research Council in Dr Shergold's portfolio area. Dr Shergold was also a member of the ARC's board. The funding announcement was controversial and attracted media attention because it was made ahead of Parliament's decision on the Research Involving Embryos Bill. Dr Shergold and his department were certainly aware of the bill. They could not have failed to be aware of the legislation.</para><para>The controversy also meant that Dr Shergold would have to have been particularly aware of the implications of what he was saying to me at the Senate estimates committee the following week. Shergold's department, while considering my question for two hours, must also have been aware of the sensitivity of the issue before advising the secretary.</para><para>And of course Dr Shergold was present when Professor Sara mentioned the government's legislative program as a possible qualification.</para><para>But after all that, Dr Shergold's answer was unequivocal. He said “harvesting activity will not take place in either facility”. He did not say “harvesting activity will not take place in either facility, provided current legislation and commercial arrangements do not change”. He could have said that but he didn't. In fact, in a controversial area like this you would expect him to be careful.</para><para>The only significant thing that appears to have changed between Dr Shergold's commitment and the Minister for Science notifying me that they had gone back on their word was the convenience of the commitment. Quite simply, a commitment was made to the Committee because it was convenient to placate me. The commitment subsequently became inconvenient and it was discarded. No government should operate that way.</para><para>The biggest disappointment to me is that the Minister for Science was dragged into this deception. He was not willing to challenge departmental advice and apparently decided that human embryo research should take priority over a commitment to colleagues. Did his senior Minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Training also agree to this course of action? Trust is an important social good. The currency of political life and negotiation is trust.

Regular exercise, whether as organised sport or other forms of physical activity, is of immense benefit to health. Research indicates that regular exercise can reduce risks for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, it can help to improve mental illness and it can improve the quality of life after strokes and heart attacks. </para></talk.start><para>The link between physical activity and improved health outcomes is not a new concept. Doctors, allied health professionals, sports scientists and fitness enthusiasts have known for many years that the human body responds positively to physical activity. What is new is the massive impact that the increasing incidence of preventable lifestyle diseases, like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, are having on the general health of this nation. These lifestyle diseases are so named because they can develop as a result of unhealthy lifestyle habits—namely, eating a diet that is too high in overall energy content and failing to maintain adequate exercise levels.</para><para>It is truly ironic that at this time, when we understand more than ever before the value that physical activity offers to both individuals and communities, fewer Australians are exercising regularly. While on the surface the statistics seem to indicate that Australians are physically active, closer examination indicates that participation levels are dangerously low.</para><para>The Participation in Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey, ERASS, collects information on the types of exercise, recreation and sports activities Australians aged 15 and over have participated in during the past 12 months. The latest ERASS report showed that last year 77.8 per cent of Australians were physically active. This statistic would lead you to believe that the majority of Australians are reasonably active. In actual fact, this statistic, although accurate, is entirely misleading. What this statistic shows is that 11.9 million Australians, or 77.8 per cent, participated in at least one physical activity in the past 12 months. The true story is revealed in participation frequency statistics. They show that in actual fact only 38.8 per cent of the Australian population aged 15 or over participated in exercise, recreation or sport activities an average of three times a week or more—the bare minimum recommended for maintaining good health. Only 50.7 per cent participated an average of two or more times per week, and 59.9 per cent once a week.</para><para>In reality, participation rates in this country are grossly inadequate. Unfortunately, these misleading participation statistics and all of our enthusiasm for our elite international sporting successes have lulled us into a false sense of superior fitness. While elite sport has flourished, participation has floundered as people have grown more content to support our national heroes from the stands or the comfort of their own lounge room rather than participate themselves.</para><para>The Howard government have not helped the participation cause; in fact the evidence shows that they have gone out of their way to hinder the growth of participation. A grand total of 13 per cent of the government's entire sports budget for this country was spent on encouraging participation programs in 2002-03—only 13 per cent. This was down from 19 per cent in the 2001-02 budget. In order to make it appear that the decreased funds still reached the majority, the Howard government pared down their sport and recreation funding mandate to include only organised sport and to exclude recreational pursuits. This has left a massive hole in the broader recreational sector and indeed in promoting participation. The latest ERASS report shows that the activities most Australians participated in regularly were walking, aerobics or fitness workouts and weight training. These are hardly activities that fit into the Howard government's very slender definition of sport. </para><para>In aggregate terms, people relying on clubs, schools or associations to organise their sport and recreation are indeed in the minority. The majority arrange their activity independently of these types of organisations. The Howard government's narrow and narrow-minded perception of recreational activities as a second rate cultural pastime has resulted in the millions of Australians who regularly engage in recreational and semi-structured physical activities effectively being ignored by public policy.</para><para>Participation in any kind of physical activity, be it organised sport or personal recreational pursuits, is critical to the health of this nation, and more funding and support needs to go towards the participation activities that currently do not fall within the Howard government's narrow definition of sport. The opportunity to participate in sport and recreation activities, particularly at the community level, is a basic right of every Australian. It is an elemental expectation that we, as the elected legislators of this country, must deliver.</para><para>The need for a coordinated approach to encouraging participation is more important now than it ever has been before as lifestyles become more sedentary. A major pillar of policy must be participation in physical activity and our goal must be to get more Australians physically active. The need for a strategically focused, federally coordinated approach to tackling this issue has never been more important than right now.</para><para>There are two key elements for change. One is a change in the concept of physical activity away from an oversimplified mainstream sport definition to a broader physical activity mandate. All physical activities must be considered eligible for funding if we are to see the required massive increase in physical activity participation rates across all demographics in Australia. The second element is interaction, and by that I mean that we need to strengthen the links between federal, state and local governments, communities, the education system and the private sector. The key to success is to get these sectors working together towards a common goal.</para><para>The Healthpact Australian Masters Games offers an excellent example of the health and sport industries working together to promote participation. The Masters Games promote the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle to all participants with the emphasis being not on winning or having the fastest time but on participation, having fun, feeling good and enjoying yourself. For many the Masters Games becomes the motivation to step up the amount of physical exercise or perhaps get involved once again after a period of not doing anything.</para><para>The Australian Masters Games, now in their ninth year, have continually grown and now attract over 10,000 participants in more than 50 disciplines. The Masters Games encourage the over 30s in most sports to stay active by providing participants with the opportunity to compete on a national level. The Masters Games have shown that by working together we can increase the participation rates. I would like to congratulate organisers, volunteers, participants and sponsors for the excellent Masters Games that was conducted in Canberra just a few weeks ago.</para><para>Overall, the decline in physical activity participation rates cannot be allowed to continue. Less than half of Australia's population are as physically active as is recommended. This is not only having an impact on our health care system and health care costs but, more importantly, it is having an impact on the quality of Australians' lives. Participation in physical activity is an important part of life that brings a wide range of health and social benefits to individuals, to communities and overall to the nation. </para><para>Promoting better health and wellbeing for all Australians is a fundamental government responsibility and it is essential that we provide easily accessible and affordable participation opportunities for all Australians. That is one reason why Labor have released our policy on tackling obesity and improving overall community wellbeing. Our policy is built around a community development model that will help communities empower themselves and organise the sorts of events that suit them in their own communities to increase physical participation levels.

The Tasmanian Forest Practices Board employs specialist scientists in the fields of botany, zoology, archaeology, geomorphology, landscape, soil and water to provide expert advice and input to forest practices plans.

The main advantage of satellite broadband technology is that it enables the delivery of broadband to all Australians, in both urban and regional areas.</para><para>	Reduced infrastructure and ease of deployment: With a terrestrial network, deployment and installation at new locations can be a complicated process. In contrast, a broadband satellite Internet connection is relatively simple and can be installed quickly as no additional infrastructure (other than customer premises equipment) is required.</para><para>	Superior economics in certain situations: In less populous areas, broadband satellite technology can be much less costly to deploy, maintain and operate than terrestrial broadband network technologies.</para><para>	Multicasting compatibility: Applications relying on multicasting information from one point to many users are best suited to satellite delivery systems, for example, webcasting conferences.</para><para>The disadvantages of satellite broadband technology include:</para><para>	Costs: While the use of satellite technology to provide broadband services in some situations is more cost-effective than terrestrial solutions, the unit cost of two-way satellite services is relatively high compared to situations where wireline technologies can be economically deployed.</para><para>	Inherent latency: Real time services like on-line games and voice or video-conferencing over the Internet are affected by unavoidable data latency. This is primarily due to the physics of operating a geostationary satellite 36,000km from Earth. However, some latency issues can be overcome by smart processing. Web surfing, file downloads and video-streaming are satisfactory using the latest satellite systems. </para><para>	Inclement weather and obstructions: Rain, high-wind and snow may cause periodic lapses in service. Trees, mountains, or tall buildings interfering with the line of sight between the user's satellite dish and the orbiting satellite can also interfere with satellite signals.</para><para>(b)	Yes, satellite services do offer Australians in regional, rural and remote areas services similar to those available in metropolitan areas, subject to the issues discussed above. In many circumstances, satellite technology is the only economically realistic solution. </para><para>Australians in regional, rural and remote areas have a choice of one-way and two-way broadband satellite packages to suit a range of residential and business needs. As noted above, the cost of satellite services is generally higher than services available in metropolitan areas. For this reason, the Government has established the Special Digital Data Service Obligation (SDDSO) and is now establishing the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme (HiBIS). </para><para>(c)	The Australian Government, like many commercial service providers, has long recognised the ability of satellite to provide access to higher bandwidth and broadband services in less populous areas such as regional, rural and remote Australia. This Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve access in regional, rural and remote Australia to higher bandwidth and broadband services delivered by satellite. In particular:</para><para>(1)	Special Digital Data Service Obligation (SDDSO)</para><para>The Government introduced the Digital Data Service Obligation (DDSO) in October 1999. The DDSO consists of a general and special obligation. The general obligation requires Telstra to provide a 64 kbps ISDN service, on request, to the majority of the population. The Special Digital Data Service Obligation applies to the rest of the population that is unable for technical reasons to access the ISDN service.  </para><para>The special obligation provides for the supply of a one-way satellite service that compares to the ISDN service. A rebate of 50 percent of the price, capped at $765, may be payable in relation to satellite equipment and installation.</para><para>(2)	Extended Zones Agreement (EZA)</para><para>The Government committed $150 million from the proceeds of the second partial sale of Telstra to provide Australians who live in `Extended Zones' access to telephone calls and connection to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP) at the untimed local call rate. The `Extended Zones' are large Telstra calling areas covering the most remote geographic areas of Australia (some 80 per cent of the landmass). </para><para>Telstra was selected through a competitive tender process to provide untimed local calls and undertake an upgrade of the underlying infrastructure used to provide services to Extended Zone customers. Part of this upgrade included ensuring that customers on Digital Radio Concentrator Systems (DRCS) could access the Internet at speeds of at least 14.4 kbps, and untimed local call access to the Internet be provided in a competitively neutral manner. Telstra also committed to install two-way satellite services for Internet use, on a concessional basis within the Extended Zones, for a limited time period that has now closed.</para><para>(3)	National Communications Fund (NCF)</para><para>The $50 million National Communications Fund (NCF) is assisting in the rollout of the infrastructure and applications to enable high-speed telecommunications networks to deliver education and health services in regional Australia. The NCF's objective is to achieve significant improvements in service delivery in the education and health sectors through funding large-scale telecommunications projects in regional areas. </para><para>The eight successful projects will improve the delivery of broadband education and health services in regional areas of Australia, including services such as clinical diagnosis and counselling (for example, teleradiology and telepsychiatry) and improved online delivery of primary, secondary and vocational courses to students. For example, one NCF project will install broadband satellite infrastructure to enable School of the Air Students in New South Wales and the Northern Territory to see, as well as hear, their school teacher and classmates for the first time.</para><para>(4)	Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme (HiBIS)</para><para>The Regional Telecommunications Inquiry recommended that the Government establish an incentive scheme to enable Australians in regional, rural and remote areas to have access to higher bandwidth services at prices comparable to those in metropolitan areas.</para><para>In response, the Government will spend $107.8 million over four years on the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme (HiBIS). HBIS will be a pro-competitive and transparent scheme aimed at improving equitable access to broadband services. It will provide incentive payments to higher bandwidth service providers to offer services in regional, rural and remote areas at prices comparable to those in metropolitan areas. A one-off per customer payment will be made to providers of higher bandwidth data services in areas where a defined minimum level of service, in terms of price and functionality, is not available. This will stimulate the take-up of higher speed services, enabling users to experience the economic, social and cultural benefits of the information economy.</para><para>A key principle of the HiBIS is technology neutrality.

The devices were contained in aircraft baggage that was lost in transit but as that equipment was only used for testing there was no need to take any further action to prevent any subsequent breach of security.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Australian Government Solicitor</inline></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Year</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1(a)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1(b)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1(c)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1(d)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>1(e)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2(a)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2(b)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2(c)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2(d)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>3</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>4</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>5(a)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>5(b)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>6</para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2001-02</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>10 computers</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>$21,638</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>$2,294</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>replaced</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>10</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>n/a</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>10</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>see note</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>n/a</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>see note</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2002-03</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>nil</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><quote><para>Note: Q4 - All the computers were stolen from the business support services area of an AGS office.

While it is within my powers to cease the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) funding, it is not within my powers to appoint an Administrator to a Migrant Resource Centre. That decision would be one for the Management Committee of the MRC to take. </para><para>(2)	The Department has been encouraging South Metropolitan MRC to seek an alternative location for the past two years.

The task force comprises representatives of the Northern Suburbs and South Metropolitan MRCs, as well as my Department.</para><para>(5)	I am not phasing out MRCs. The Government is committed to the continuing development of a strong and effective network of settlement service providers, including the Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) and Migrant Service Agency (MSA) network. The amalgamation of the MRCs in Perth is taking place in order to position a single, stronger MRC to serve new arrivals from all over Perth, as is the case in Brisbane and Adelaide where centrally located MRCs provide services across those cities. The new Perth MRC will determine its own location and outreach circumstances, taking into account the imperative for the MRC to be close to transport and services relevant to the client base.</para><para>(6)	The practice of placing non-voting departmental staff on the management committees of MRCs has principally been for the purpose of performance monitoring. This approach was reviewed as part of the recent Review of Settlement Services. The Department is currently working to develop alternative mechanisms for monitoring performance, which would allow it to withdraw from participation on management committees.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: e-Defence Project</title><page.no>17747</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2112)</subtitle><id.no>2112</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17747</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With regard to the e-Defence project (Project Joint 2054) in the Defence Capability Plan: </para><para>(1)	Can a description of all the phases of this project be provided.</para><para>(2)	What was the original timeline for the completion of the project, including the dates for completing each of the phases in the project.</para><para>(3)	What was the original budget for this project, including the budget for each of the phases.</para><para>(4)	What is the current schedule for completing this project, including the dates for each of the phases.</para><para>(5)	What is the current budget for the project, including the budget for each of the phases.</para><para>(6)	What has been the cost of this project to date, including the cost for each phase completed.</para><para>(7)	What are the reasons for the delays being experienced with Phase 1 of this project.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>17748</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Project Description:</para><para>The e-Defence Project (JP2054) seeks to provide a secure e-mail based messaging environment for Defence through the implementation of security services to the desktop.

The advice emphasised that ATSIC Commissioners and Regional Councillors would continue to determine policies and priorities for the allocation of program funds, with the new Agency, ATSIS, managing the programs and making individual funding decisions in line with these policies and priorities.</para><para>To facilitate this, extensive instructions were provided to ATSIS staff and delegates (see Attachment A).</para><para>ATSIS directly funds over 1000 Indigenous organisation in any one year for around 3,000 individual activities. It also indirectly funds numerous other organisations through arrangements with the States/Territories. </para><para>It is not an unusual occurrence for funding to particular organisations to change from year to year. This is also not unique to ATSIC. In situations where funds are provided for ongoing operational costs, the amount of funding may vary from year to year, based on a number of factors including changes to identified need, past performance of grantee organisations in managing financial aspects and achievement of outcomes, one-off funding for infrastructure or capital purchase and changes to ATSIC policies and priorities. </para><para>Given the range and number of grants, ATSIS is unable to undertake a detailed examination and comparison of funding provided in the financial years 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 and include a comprehensive analysis of reasons for such variations in the timeframe available for response to this question. </para><para>With the establishment of ATSIS on 1 July 2003, ATSIS delegates were required to formally make all 2003/2004 funding decisions, including those already taken by ATSIC Regional Councils prior to that date. In a relatively small number of cases, ATSIS made decisions different from those of Regional Councils.</para><para>In addition, in an effort to improve the delivery of services to clients by funded organisations, a number of entities were offered funding in 2003/2004 for a limited period in order that a more in-depth assessment of the delivery of those services could be made.</para><para>(2)	As indicated earlier, there are in excess of 1000 Indigenous organisations funded for over 3000 individual activities in any one year. A full and comprehensive examination and analysis was not possible in the timeframe allowable and would absorb considerable scarce resources. If essential, ATSIS could undertake the work to provide a listing of decisions taken by Regional Councils which were subsequently amened by a Delegate following the establishment of ATSIS. </para><para>(3)	(a)	All organisations that have had their funding altered have been notified, except in a small number of cases where a delegate is still considering submissions.</para><para>(b)	Currently, the majority of funding decisions are made annually. For the bulk of recipient organisations, the funding level remains unchanged for the financial year. There are, however, a number of cases in any one year where particular funding arrangements are altered for reasons largely relating to performance of organisations and, in some cases, redirection of funding. Procedures have been in place since the commencement of ATSIC and these procedures have been carried over to the operations of ATSIS. </para><para>(4)	The reasons for the changes to funding levels vary considerably and include:</para><para>	changes to Board of Commissioner and Regional Council priorities and policies;</para><para>	changing circumstances of funded organisations;</para><para>	changing circumstances in relation to needs in a particular region;</para><para>	overall levels of program funds available; </para><para>	decisions to introduce contestability and market testing into the delivery of some services; and</para><para>	a renewed focus on organisational capacity and performance based contracts.</para><para>(5)	Organisations are free to appeal funding decisions to the Minister if they so desire. Organisations are also at liberty to seek review of funding decisions through the Federal Court. </para><para>(6)	The policy objective to be achieved, where ongoing funding arrangements have been reviewed, is to ensure effective and efficient use of public moneys and improved outcomes for Indigenous peoples through ensuring value for money in program delivery.</para><para>(7)	There have been no `costs savings' per se resulting from the introduction of the ATSIS decision-making arrangements. </para><para>(8)	(a)	ATSIS has no surplus funds.</para><para>(b)	Any reductions in particular program areas have been allocated to meeting other program priorities.</para><para>ATSIC had a cash carry forward as at 30 June 2003. The ATSIC Board has determined how those funds should be used to meet program priorities and a Ministerial Estimates Variation has been signed by Minister Ruddock approving the expenditure in 2003/04. These funds are to be transferred to ATSIS, enabling the program delivery to be done via ATSIS.</para><para>(9)	(a)	No. ATSIC assets have been transferred to ATSIS. ATSIS has care, custody and control of ATSIC administrative assets but title/ownership remains with ATSIC. With ATSIC's consent, certain contracts which were due to be renewed by ATSIC after 1 July are being renewed in the name of ATSIS. </para><para>(b)	An agreement between ATSIC and the Commonwealth represented by ATSIS sets out the administrative arrangements governing the relationship between the two bodies.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ATTACHMENT A</inline></para><para>“When exercising delegations in relation to grant decisions, staff must take into account:</para><para>	ATSIC Board and Regional Council priorities and polices;</para><para>	Funding decisions, commitments or endorsements made already by Regional Councils in relation to 2003/04 Grants;</para><para>	Information provided by National Program Managers;</para><para>	Project eligibility against Program guidelines;</para><para>	The capacity of the grantee organisation to deliver the services; </para><para>	Conflict of Interest Directions; and</para><para>	Any subsequent directions from the Minister.</para><para>	Where delegates decide they cannot approve a grant previously approved by Regional Council, the Regional Manager should take the following steps:</para><para>	clearly establish that the project is one which was not previously recommended by staff; </para><para>	revisit the recommendations and justification and consider the reasons why the Regional Council made its decision;</para><para>	consider the relevance of the project to the Regional Council Plan and established Council policies and priorities and identify alternative ways of addressing the Regional Council priority;</para><para>	consider implications and options where an organisation has expectations about the level of ongoing funding, and determine how this may be best managed.

The Department endeavours to incorporate the National Packaging Covenant principles in its operations, and routinely takes opportunities to influence purchasing decisions by its outsourced providers by ensuring they comply with the Australian Government procurement policy to consider all relevant environmental policies, programs, costs and benefits when making purchasing decisions. </para><para>The Department is in the process of developing its Environmental Management System (EMS) and, through the preliminary environmental audits, has identified that it can have an impact on the consumption of paper and paper products. To date the Department has focused on purchasing paper sourced from recycled pulp and new pulp from sustainable managed plantations within Australia. However, the Department is currently engaged in discussions with outsourced providers (such as the cleaning contractor) to encourage them to routinely seek out paper products sourced from more sustainable processes. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment and Heritage: Paper and Paper Products </title><page.no>17791</page.no><subtitle><inline font-weight="bold">(Question No. 2251)</inline></subtitle><id.no>2251</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17792</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 October 2003: </para></talk.start><para>For each of the financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03 can the following details be provided in relation to paper and paper products:</para><para>(1)	How much has been spent by the department on these products.</para><para>(2)	From which countries of origin has the department sourced these products.</para><para>(3)	From which companies has the department sourced these products.</para><para>(4)	What was the percentage of the total of paper and paper products in value (in AUD) sourced by the department by country.</para><para>(5)	What was the percentage of the total of paper and paper products in value (in AUD) sourced by the department by company.</para><para>(6)	What steps has the department taken to ensure that paper and paper products sourced by the department from other countries comply with the ISO 14001 environmental management system standard. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>17792</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Department of the Environment and Heritage spent $548,300 in 2001-02 and $471,900 in 2002-03.</para><para>(2)	Almost all paper and paper products procured by the Department are sourced in Australia.

The IGA makes it an offence to provide an interactive gambling service to customers in Australia and to advertise an interactive gambling service - including online casino-style services involving games of chance or mixed chance and skill, such as roulette, poker, craps online poker machines and blackjack. </para><para>Subsection 68(1) of the IGA requires the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to cause to be conducted, before 1 July 2003, a review of issues related to the Commonwealth's interactive gambling legislative framework. </para><para>On 12 January 2003 the former Minister instructed the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to conduct the review and consider a broad range of issues, including the operation of the IGA and its effectiveness in dealing with the social and commercial impact of interactive gambling services, among other matters.</para><para>In response to a discussion paper, over 40 submissions were received for the review from a wide range of stakeholders. The Allen Consulting Group has also provided research, analysis and other technical supporting material.</para><para>Subsection 68(3) requires the Minister to cause copies of the report of the review, once completed, to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House. The Minister expects the Department to provide a report of the review later this year and will table the report in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</para><para>(3)	The Australian Federal Police (AFP) have advised that they are not currently investigating a complaint concerning a breach of subsection 8A(2) of the IGA. The AFP are investigating, however, the potential breach of sections 15 and 61EA of the Act. These sections prohibit the provision of an interactive gambling service to customers located in Australia and the publication of an interactive gambling service advertisement in Australia respectively. The AFP have advised their investigation of the complaint is currently ongoing.</para><para>(4)	The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer informs me that the ATO have advised that there are no specific investigations into this matter.  </para><para>(5)	The IGA does not limit the operation of a law of a state or territory, to the extent that that law is capable of operating concurrently with the IGA. This is reflected in section 69 of the IGA.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education, Science and Training: Alternative Dispute Resolution</title><page.no>17813</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2353)</subtitle><id.no>2353</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17813</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 3 November 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Does the department use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in an effort to avoid litigation; if not, why not; if so, are there specific guidelines for the Department to follow when using ADR.</para><para>(2)	If the department is not using ADR provisions, what process is used in cases that require resolution.</para><para>(3)	Has the department been advised of any development of guidelines for the use of ADR.</para><para>(4)	Does any of the legislation for which the department has responsibility contain ADR procedures; if so, (a) can each relevant provision be identified (eg. by statute name and section number); and (b) are guidelines provided for the use of ADR provisions in these instances; if so, can a copy of the guidelines be provided.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>17813</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Education, Science and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Department is involved in very few disputes where ADR is available as a resolution option. All Departmental standard form contracts include clauses mandating alternative dispute resolution processes to avoid litigation of contractual matters. The Department is also required to comply with the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney-General under the Judiciary Act 1903 in relation to all claims and litigation by or against the Commonwealth. In particular, the Directions require the Department to act as a model litigant in handling claims and litigation brought by or against the Department by:</para><para>(a)	paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid; and  </para><para>(b)	endeavouring to avoid litigation wherever possible. </para><para>The Directions also require the Department to consider settlements of monetary claims in accordance with legal principle and practice.
