The present pager system is more than 15 years old and has reached the end of its serviceable life. The pagers are no longer manufactured and are becoming increasingly unreliable. The unavailability of components makes repairs difficult and at times impossible, and the number of spare pagers available is rapidly diminishing. The Whips' offices have played a major role in the selection, testing and implementation planning for the new system. The roll-out for senators started today, with pagers being given to the Democrats, Greens and Independent senators. Government and opposition senators will progressively receive new pagers from 27 October 2003.</para></talk.start><para>Individual training will be offered to all senators before they are issued with the new pagers. Documentation will be provided and, on the day of each roll-out, senators will have easy access to support staff should assistance be required. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff is responsible for the new pager system. Should honourable senators have any questions on the planned roll-out, advice is available from the department's client services desk, on Parliament House extension 2020.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>12937</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Leadership and Office Holders</title><page.no>12937</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>12937</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a revised list of the shadow ministry, including shadow parliamentary secretaries and representation in both chambers.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SHADOW MINISTRY </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2 July 2003 </inline></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>PORTFOLIO</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>SHADOW MINISTER1</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>OTHER CHAMBER</para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Leader</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Hon.

The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil are part of the Measures for a Better Environment package, which forms a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. This package includes the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, CNG and LPG vehicle conversion, the development and commercialisation of renewable energy, and diesel and oil recycling measures. Although Labor will support this bill, we do not support the fact that the MBE package has been consistently and massively underspent, a point I will get back to in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>The Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 impose a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil—the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, known as the PSO. The intention of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil is to reduce the environmental impact of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tiered differentiated scale, with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities. Multi-use oils that are used in a specific way, either in the manufacture of another product or in a process that does not create a recyclable waste oil stream and is considered to present a low level of risk to the environment, are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. This bill provides the mechanism for exempting such oils from the levy.</para><para>To effect this exemption, a new category of benefit, to be known as the category 8 benefit, will be paid under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 at the same rate as the levy for uses of oil approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice. The purpose of this bill is: to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 to provide an effective exemption for certain multi-use oils and uses of multi-use oils from the product stewardship oil levy; to introduce a mechanism that will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the uses of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit; and to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000 to enable category 8 claimants to register for PSO benefits. </para><para>Clearly, the destination of waste oil in Australia is a cause for concern—quite simply, it appears that we do not seem to know where it is going, so it is highly appropriate that measures are taken to address this issue. In her press release of 11 June, Dr Sharman Stone, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, outlined the scope of the problem. She said:</para><para>More than 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold each year in Australia, over half of which is collected and recycled after use. Still, a large percentage of this used oil remains unaccounted for, and it could be hurting our environment.</para><quote><para>Waste oil contains hazardous materials that are toxic and carcinogenic, and is harmful to the environment when irresponsibly discarded. These materials include benzene, toluene, dioxins, and other light hydrocarbons.</para></quote><para>Dr Stone went on to say:</para><para>Recent figures suggest that more than 100 million litres of waste oil goes missing each year, which can be harmful to humans and the environment. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate a million litres of drinking water ...</para><para>Naturally this is of concern to the Labor Party, and that is why we are supporting the bill. However, Dr Stone's next statement in the same press release highlights one of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party keep finding ourselves in conflict with the coalition over environmental issues—that is, the practice of the Howard government to consistently underspend on their environmental promises. They say one thing and do another. Dr Stone went on to say:</para><para>The Howard Government has allocated $60 million to the Product Stewardship arrangements for waste oil, which began in January 2001.</para><para>No doubt the coalition thought that this would have been well received by Australians genuinely concerned about the impact that waste oil is having on our environment. However, we will never get a chance to find out, because it did not take long before these commitments were exposed as mere rhetoric and hollow promises of funding which were broken.</para><para>In this year's budget the government cut $40 million from the original $60 million transitional assistance component of the federal government's used oil recycling scheme, as the funding was considered no longer necessary for program implementation. The <inline font-style="italic">Environmental Manager</inline> journal of 20 May 2003 reported:</para><para>A `reprioritisation' will see some funds originally intended for the $60m transitional assistance component of the Fed Govt's used oil recycling scheme now go to other environment protection initiatives, the Budget papers show.</para><para>An EM source said the oil stewardship advisory council had been assured funds would not be redirected. However, the minister's office said no such undertaking was given and the council has been informed the scheme may be amended.</para><para>This latest cut to environment spending by the Howard government is, sadly, but one of many examples of the government's record of cuts and underspending.</para><para>I opened my comments on this bill reflecting on the fact that the government's Measures for a Better Environment package has been consistently and massively underspent. The original MBE commitment was $896 million over four years from 2000-01 to 2003-04. However, we have now discovered that this commitment, like so many of the coalition's commitments, has been watered down by the Howard government. For a start, funding over the life of the program will also be cut from a promised $896 million down to $812 million, a cut of some $84 million. It may seem like a proportionally small cut, until one realizes that the total funding period has been pushed out until 2014. In other words, funding intended to last four years will now be stretched to 14 years. That is a significant change. So the funding over the original four-year period has been revealed in Senate estimates hearings to be, in reality, only $297.6 million, a cut of 67 per cent. </para><para>It is a very cynical trick from this government to promise a huge amount of funding, undoubtedly to win the support of Greens colleagues on the crossbenches, and to then hold it back and say to the Australian people, who want to live in a clean environment and who want Australia to play its part in reducing greenhouse emissions, `You can't have this money for another 10 years beyond what we originally promised.' I certainly hope it will not turn out that this money, which was pencilled in to fund measures to protect the environment, has been siphoned off to fund the government's profligate spending in Iraq regarding nonexistent, it seems, weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>When the government is not cutting the environment budget, it seems as though all sorts of rorting activities are going on. Earlier this year, my colleague in the other place Kelvin Thomson revealed how the federal Liberal-National Party government has directed over 76 per cent of the $20 million Envirofund, a Natural Heritage Trust program, to Liberal and National Party electorates. In fact, Liberal and National Party electorates received 76.28 per cent of the Envirofund grants; Labor electorates, 17.88 per cent; and the Greens and Independent electorates, 5.84 per cent. This allocation cannot be defended on the grounds that the grants were allocated evenly around the country and that the Liberal Party and the National Party represent a larger land mass. The distribution of Envirofund grants was not area based. Queensland projects received less than half the funding of New South Wales, yet Queensland has a much larger area. Western Australia got even less, despite having a larger area than both of them. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp, responded to these revelations. He said:</para><para>An Australian National Audit Office report of late 2001 found no bias. They are assessed in an apolitical process on their merits.</para><para>In fact, the Envirofund was announced on 4 April 2002, when applications were first invited—more than a year after that ANAO audit! I believe the environment minister, Dr David Kemp, has misled the public and the media about the auditing of the Natural Heritage Trust's Envirofund by the Australian National Audit Office. Under the Howard government, Natural Heritage Trust funding has never been about achieving the right outcomes—that is, halting salinity, stopping land clearing and protecting threatened species. Instead, the focus seems to have been as a tool of the coalition to buy votes. Dr Kemp should have had the ANAO conduct an audit into what has all the hallmarks of a very big $20 million pork-barrelling exercise.</para><para>However, I think these failures pale in comparison with the Howard government's irresponsible and illogical position on the Kyoto protocol, and I take this opportunity to make a comment on this matter. I mentioned before how the coalition has diluted funding to the Measures for a Better Environment scheme, part of which was the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. But the coalition's disregard for global warming does not end there. Over 100 countries have now ratified the Kyoto treaty, and the ratification by the Russian Federation, expected later this year, will ensure that the protocol will come into international force this year. Australia has been deliberating for far too long.</para><para>With the Kyoto protocol on the verge of coming into force, even Australia's peak business lobby, the Business Council of Australia, has reconsidered its opposition to the ratification of the protocol. It now declares itself neutral, and many of its members publicly support the ratification. Early action will allow Australian industry to take advantage of growing global markets for environmental goods and services and to prepare for the reality of a carbon-constrained future. </para><para>In May this year Kelvin Thomson, the shadow minister for the environment, introduced into federal parliament a private member's bill to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. If passed, this bill will give legal effect to Australia's Kyoto target and will ensure that Australian industry can take advantage of emerging new markets when the treaty comes into international force. Labor is serious about tackling climate change. Labor would ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Labor is also committed to domestic action on greenhouse.</para><para>On World Environment Day, Labor pledged to increase Australia's use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power by an additional five per cent by 2010. A news poll released soon after, on 11 June, showed that 83 per cent of Australians would be willing to pay extra if they got their power from renewable sources. This represented a clear endorsement of Labor's policy. Such a commitment would help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs and attract investment and is estimated to reduce some 17 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The five per cent mandatory renewable energy target has been supported by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and represents a significant increase to the Howard government's existing target. The Prime Minister originally committed to only a two per cent increase, but, since the Howard government announced that in 1997, the contribution of renewable energy has actually fallen by two per cent. </para><para>The MRET is presently under review. This provides a perfect opportunity for the government to respond to the overwhelming community support to increase it. Labor's commitment to an additional five per cent of renewable energy in Australia's electricity supply mix will help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs, attract investment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Labor believes the sustainable energy sector is a growth industry of the future, and by supporting Labor's five per cent target the government can ensure this is the case. </para><para>In conclusion, having taken the opportunity to reflect on a number of current environmental issues, I call on the Howard government to get serious about environment protection and repair, and to spend less time on self-congratulatory backslapping and more time on seeing that money allocated for the environment is actually spent on the environment. On that note, I reaffirm that Labor will be supporting this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>12942</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will also support the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>. The bill grants relief from the product stewardship oil levy for certain uses of multipurpose oils. That is, the bill will apply to multipurpose oils which, when used in a particular way, cannot be recycled and present only a very low risk to the environment—so-called category 8 oils. The government is seeking to exempt the use of these particular oils from the levy because it argues that their inclusion was outside the policy intent of the original product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. </para></talk.start><para>The treatment of waste oil can pose a very significant environmental risk, including to humans. This was identified during the inquiry into the government's legislation which reduced diesel excise. When used in vehicle engines, transmissions and electrical equipment, lubricating oil collects hazardous contaminants that are toxic and often carcinogenic. These hazardous contaminants include metals such as lead and zinc, dioxins, toluene, chlorine, benzene and sulfur. If inappropriately collected, treated and disposed of, waste oil can pollute land, inland waters, including ground water, and the marine environment. </para><para>Taking dioxins as an example, once in the environment dioxins accumulate in the fatty tissues of many species and are known to cause health effects such as cancer, birth defects and reproductive and developmental problems. Their capacity to harm is assisted by the fact that, once in the environment, dioxins break down very slowly and they can travel large distances. For humans, short-term exposure to a high level of dioxins may result in skin lesions and altered liver function. Long-term exposure has been linked to impaired function of the immune, nervous, endocrine and reproductive systems.</para><para>In the main, this amendment bill is intended to apply to paraffinic and naphthenic process oils. These are oils that are included in formulations for personal care products, explosives, paints, agricultural sprays and printing inks. As mentioned, the advice is that the oils for which this amendment bill is likely to apply will present a low level of risk to the environment. That is because there is minimal chance of these oils entering the environment through direct spillage, for example. These oils involve oil formulation that is typically bound to the product and cannot be released for recycling. With respect to printing ink, the oil and other components in the ink are bound to the paper and cannot be recovered. In relation to rubber, once the oils are chemically bound into the rubber they cannot be readily extracted. </para><para>The department informs me that agricultural sprays and explosives use small amounts of the oils of which we are talking. According to the department, the environmental impact of agricultural sprays which are assessed by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will be low because of the low toxicity of the oils used and the low application rates. These oils, again, are not recoverable because they are widely dispersed into the environment. </para><para>The oil levy was developed as part of the Measures for a Better Environment package and is used to fund benefit payments for waste oil recycling and reuse. In addition to the levy benefit scheme, the Democrats negotiated additional funding for transitional assistance to ensure greater collection and recycling of waste oil. The levy is paid by oil producers and importers at a rate of 5.449c per litre on domestic and imported petroleum based oils and 5.449c per kilogram for petroleum based greases. In 2001-02, the levy raised was $25 million, with $8.2 million paid in benefits to oil recyclers. The current benefit rate for rerefined oil products is between 3c and 50c per litre, the highest benefit being 50c per litre for rerefined base oil— that is, oil that is used as a lubricant, hydraulic or transformer oil. </para><para>Each year in Australia, around 500 million litres of lubricating oil are sold, and of these 500 million litres at least 100 million litres are unaccounted for. We simply do not know where that oil is, but the most likely scenario is that it is being stockpiled in garages and sheds, retained in scrap equipment such as old vehicles, put out for rubbish collection, lost through leaks and spills, or illegally and deliberately dumped.</para><para>Since the introduction of the waste oils recycling program, an extra 30 million litres of waste oil has been recovered each year. That represents an 18 per cent increase in the amount of waste oil that was previously being recycled. Oil-recycling facilities have been established in most local government areas. So I think the program is a success. There is more room to move, but so far I congratulate the government on the implementation of the program. The Democrats are, as I said, relatively pleased with the progress and that is why we accepted the government's proposal that $20 million of the funding originally allocated to transitional assistance be redirected to support other so-called sustainable cities initiatives. However, we do have some concerns with the current benefits schedule from discussions that I have conducted with oil recyclers. The current benefits payments for rerefined oil at 5c per litre would still appear to be too low— that is, it does not fully reflect the cost of collecting and rerefining that oil. As such, the grant does not provide the incentive that it should in order to ensure the greater reuse of waste or, more appropriately, used oil in this country. I think there is also an issue with the distance that is now required to be travelled to extract some of that last remaining used oil from storage places.  </para><para>I seek assurances from the minister in this debate that the current review, which I understand is under way, looks at these questions. We do not want to obviously set up disincentives for full scale rerefining with possible reuse at the end of that process as lubricating oil, but we do want to make sure that the price incentives are in place which would ensure that we maximise the amount of used oil that is collected. I am also pleased that, as a result of our talks with the government, the department will be addressing the problem of oil bottoms, which is the material that is left over after rerefining and other processes. It represents a major cost to oil recyclers. The more we rerefine the more oil bottoms will be there and will need to be disposed of. This is another issue I would like to see resolved by the minister and by the department. On that note, I again indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>12944</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought that, as a young mother, Senator Jacinta Collins might get up and talk about oil and bottoms—I think of Johnson and Johnson's baby oil.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—You will have to ask my husband about that!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—That is right.

In response to Senator Lundy's comment about the Commonwealth government's handling of environmental issues since we were elected in 1996, it must be a struggle for the Labor Party. They have had a number of shadow ministers in the portfolio. I did not know—it is not his fault but mine— that Kelvin Thomson was the shadow minister before then. I think Carmen Lawrence may have been a shadow minister at some stage and also Senator Nick Bolkus. I do congratulate Senator Lundy on her promotion to the environment portfolio.

The problem for Labor of course is that the coalition in government have put a lot of energy and a lot of money—more money than any other government in the history of Australia—into this portfolio. This bill amends a product stewardship regime that I am informed by the advisers did not exist. This is a very practical measure. It is not a measure where you would have the minister, as with former environment minister Graham Richardson, going and getting the TV cameras in and saying he is going to plant a million trees, having his picture taken with Sting or undertaking some sort of publicity-grabbing exercise. These are real measures that assist the environment. It is pretty hard to get Channel 9 or Channel 7 interested in taking a picture of Dr Kemp looking at some recycled oil—it is not a pretty picture. But this very program, which did not exist under Labor, is a fantastic example of a government working, and I give credit to Senator Allison—with the support of the Democrats in some of these measures—to make a substantial difference and significantly increase the amount of oil that is recycled in Australia. In fact, the information that I have is that, since the program began, we have achieved an 18 per cent increase: 194 million litres of oil recycled last year compared to 165 million the year before. We have seen $6 million of Commonwealth money spent to assist 270 local councils to build 458 used oil collection facilities. It is probably not even something that you would get the local paper to come and take a picture of, but when you look at those massive quantities of oil that would otherwise potentially harm the environment it is a huge achievement and this bill builds on that success. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The federal government has, across the environment portfolio, massively increased funding to a whole range of programs. I was in the portfolio when we first came into government in 1996. Senator Robert Hill and I sat down with former minister Warwick Smith, who was also in the portfolio, and we went through this plethora of Labor programs. They were probably created in that famous Ros Kelly era when to design programs you figured out where the marginal seats were, you got a whiteboard out and you decided where you were going to spend the money. There was no strategic direction. There was no scientific basis to it. It was all emotionally and politically driven. We saw through the forest debate poor old Senator Faulkner, when he was the minister trying to defend his forest policy, going through day after day of excruciating questioning about which particular forest coupe he was going to protect that day or whatever. It was an excruciating sight during the dying days of the Keating government.</para><para>We inherited this political and emotional imbroglio of policy confusion. We looked at all the programs, we got the best scientific advice from around the world and we put structure into the environment portfolio. As a result of the incredible work done by Robert Hill and his exceptional parliamentary secretaries over time, and the work that is being carried on so successfully by Dr David Kemp, we have achieved real success across a whole range of areas, including endangered species and some of the world's leading programs to address salinity. We are improving in the forest area, where we have had to do the very hard yards of getting sustainable forestry regimes across all of the states— often with no assistance from state Labor governments, which pretend to be green but are usually only green when it suits them for a couple of cheap headlines.</para><para>The coalition does have the runs on the board. In fact, in her speech Senator Lundy referred to the measurement by Newspoll of the propensity of Australians, as polled by that organisation, to pay extra for cleaner fuels. We are not surprised at that, because Australians have indicated year in, year out that they are prepared to support environmentally friendly measures. At about the same time, Newspoll also showed that the coalition was a clear leader over Labor in voter perception of which party is preferred to handle the environment issue. </para><para>That is a historic political shift in this country. I think we all have to be cautious of what the Newspoll tells us about leadership, preferred parties and two-party preferred indications. I tend to agree with Labor leader Simon Crean that, ultimately, the only poll that counts is the one on election day. But, historically, for the Liberal Party and the coalition to be seen to be better managers at the Commonwealth level—better able to deliver environmental outcomes—is a great result. That change took place under Robert Hill's leadership as Minister for the Environment and Heritage and has continued under David Kemp. I think the reason for that is that Australian voters are not mugs. Through the Natural Heritage Trust funding, they have seen over $1 billion worth of extra funding put into the environment portfolio, which is being spent cautiously. It is being targeted, it is based on good science and it is based on sound principles and policy administration.</para><para>That funding involves a series of programs that capture the enthusiasm of local communities, effectively target environmental problems where they occur at the local level and engage communities in solving problems at a local level. These people in the community will not be sold a pup. They know very well, as many of us here know, that you do not solve the world's greenhouse gas problems by flippantly signing a protocol. They know that because they are not silly. They know that a bunch of old European nations and a few others joining together for short-term political reasons to sign a protocol and say it will all be right is not going to solve the problem—unless that agreement and the protocol incorporate and capture the emerging nations and rapidly developing industrial nations, particularly in the Asian region. </para><para>Those communities also know that, unless America signs up to the agreement, it is not going to be effective. You would effectively be drawing up an agreement that excluded two of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions on the globe. If you have an agreement that turns a blind eye to the fact that Australia not only is a very large energy producer and a large per capita greenhouse gas emitter but also produces very high energy efficiency outcomes and exports enormous amounts of clean energy into those newly industrialising countries—therefore making a special contribution to reducing greenhouse gases in those emerging economies—and you have a protocol that pays little cognisance of Australia's special circumstances, then the Australian people know that it is not a good idea to just sign the protocol to make us look greener than we are.</para><para>It is a very cheap thing politically to sign onto an agreement that you know in your own heart is not good for Australia. It is not good for all of those reasons. It is not good because it does not look at the special circumstances of the emerging economies that are not included in it. It is also bad for Australia because it unfairly hurts working men and women who rely on those energy-exporting industries—be they the people who rely on the great gas projects in the north-west of my state of Western Australia or the many families who rely on the coal exporting communities around the eastern seaboard who produce energy which is very efficient greenhouse gas wise compared to the countries we export it to.</para><para>That is one of the reasons the coalition and the Liberal Party in particular—but the coalition government, to be fair to my coalition colleagues—is held in such high regard by the Australian people when it comes to environmental management. We do the hard yards. We do not just sign up to the latest trendy idea, which is not always popular. It would be very popular for Prime Minister Howard to say, `Right, we are going to sign up to the Kyoto protocol now that we are green,' but he does not do that because he knows it is bad for Australia, it is not the solution for the world environment and we have to work a little bit harder to get a good agreement that the United States and China will be part of and which all the emerging nations will be part of. That is the cold hard fact. Either you have to do the hard work and get the results—and that is what this government has been doing—or you just do the easy thing and sign up without much thought and, in the process, jettison the economic hopes and opportunities of thousands of working Australians who rely on the coal industry and who rely on Australia's massive natural gas and gas export industry.  </para><para>Senator Allison raised a couple of questions in relation to the review of the PSO funding arrangements. In response to Senator Allison seeking an assurance that the review will consider price, I am informed that the review of the PSO funding arrangements will fully evaluate the existing funding rates, with particular emphasis placed on burner fuel funding rates, as asked by Senator Allison. The government is also committed to working to find a solution to oil bottoms—the residues resulting from processing waste oil.

I am sure it is useful to have this on the government's great list of environmental achievements—and, indeed, it is one—but it was necessitated by the reduction in excise. I am quite sure the government would not have done it of its own volition.

The area of termination of employment at the federal level—and before this parliament— has a very lengthy history which I will not revisit today, as I think I have on seven or eight previous occasions, other than to say that on this occasion there is no reason to regard this bill any less suspiciously than some of the earlier attempts by this government. I will, however, discuss that the minister has simply added another layer of complexity to an already complex system of regulation. It is clear that this bill is an ill thought out, cheap political stunt cobbled together without the approval of the states in a shifty attempt to steal their industrial powers and entrench them in a substandard—and I stress substandard—federal system.</para></talk.start><para>The principal purpose of the bill is to expand the reach of the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission over unfair dismissals to all employees in constitutional corporations. In addition to groups such as Commonwealth employees, waterside workers, Victorian and territory workers presently, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has coverage of unfair dismissals for employees who work in a corporation and under—and I stress under—a federal award. The key to the expansion of the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction in the bill is the removal of the requirement that a person working for a corporation must also be a federal award employee. The deletion of the federal award criterion would mean that all state award employees who work in corporations would find their primary remedy for an unfair dismissal would lie with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. According to the explanatory memorandum, this would result in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's annual case load in unfair dismissal applications increasing from about 8,000 to 14,000. As well as centralising jurisdiction over unfair dismissals, a secondary purpose of the bill is to effect various changes over the processing of unfair dismissal claims, altering the eligibility for applicants and reducing the remedies available, especially for small business employees.</para><para>With respect to a unitary system, the complexities of federalism have provided for constant debate on both sides of politics— this has not only been an issue for the current government. In the year 2000 Peter Reith favourably explored the concept of the federal government using the corporations power as the principal constitutional plank for workplace relations legislation in his series entitled `Breaking the gridlock—discussion paper 2: a new structure'.</para><para>A fuller use of the corporations power, together with other selected heads of constitutional power, would give the federal government direct legislative control over the wages and working conditions of 85 per cent of Australia's work force. Further, it would allow the federal government to make extensive inroads into the states' industrial relations systems, creating an opportunity to achieve a relatively high degree of centralisation and uniformity. Again I would regard this somewhat suspiciously in relation to the terms and conditions of employment that apply to Victorian workers now caught up within the federal jurisdiction.</para><para>If the Commonwealth wishes to establish a unitary system, the corporations power goes a long way toward that goal. The only other serious rival is the external affairs power; however, the coalition has traditionally shied away from the use of the external affairs power—ironically, because of its potential to undermine the federal balance. Notably, during the debate regarding the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, the member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, the now Prime Minister, said: </para><quote><para>The other objectionable feature of this bill is the unnecessary use of the external affairs power of the constitution. This government has perverted and undermined the constitutional balance of this country by its remorseless use of the external affairs power.</para></quote><para>Contemplate that with respect to the corporations power. Clearly, when the coalition is in federal opposition but holds many state governments, federal and unified industrial laws are objectionable; however, when the coalition is in federal government but state opposition, it is in favour of federal and unified laws.</para><para>This government is not motivated by a desire to positively reform the Australian system of industrial relations for the betterment of all parties. This government is simply motivated by the fact that it cannot control state industrial relations systems. Serious reform of state and federal industrial laws designed to harmonise workplaces must be through cooperation between state and federal governments. Such cooperation involves consultation, negotiation and compromise.</para><para>With respect to consultation with the states, the explanatory memorandum of this bill cites a speech by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, in support of a move towards a unified system for unfair dismissal claims. It is true that the president of the commission did call for serious debate regarding this significant issue. Indeed, he emphasised the importance of consultation and cooperation in achieving greater uniformity in industrial laws. Among other things, he makes reference to how the Hancock report suggested greater comity in industrial laws be achieved. For instance, he said:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government should seek the co-operation of the States in establishing, in both the short term and the long term, a viable, co-ordinated, acceptable and effective industrial relations system.</para><para>As to the long term, the Australian Government should initiate discussions with the States with a view to putting an integrated system of industrial relations into place. The matter is of such importance that it should be raised initially at a Premier's Conference.</para><para>The matter should be treated as a priority item in the Premier's Conference and pursued through the Conference of Labour Ministers. A Steering Committee of the Conference of Labour Ministers should be established to give directions to a Working Party consisting of Commonwealth and State officials and representatives of the industrial parties.</para></quote><para>The president also recounts how a uniform companies law came about: by consultation and cooperation, not by legislative fiat. Notably, the minister's consultation process on this occasion has not in any way reflected the sentiments of the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The minister has seemingly deliberately avoided any real or serious consultation with the state governments. Indeed, this too is evidenced in the explanatory memorandum under the subheading `Policy development and consultation'. It is clear that the government has simply relied upon unidentified submissions to a Senate committee regarding another bill, the `Breaking the gridlock' papers—a product of the government's former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith—a summit held by the Business Council of Australia over two years ago and a speech by the minister to the Australian Food and Grocery Council in May last year. </para><para>Significantly, there was a meeting of the Workplace Relations Ministers Council two days prior to Minister Abbott outlining the essence of this bill to the press. However, despite the fact that this bill had the potential to effect one of the most drastic shifts in state and federal industrial law since 1904, the state workplace relations ministers were given no indication of the federal minister's intentions in relation to this bill. </para><para>It should also be noted that on this occasion the government even seeks to contradict the views of the former New South Wales opposition spokesperson on industrial relations Mike Gallacher, who in 2002 twice publicly expressed support for New South Wales retaining its own industrial relations system. One wonders what Liberal Party New South Wales policy is today.</para><para>This bill is also yet another attack by the government on the rights of Australian working people. The bill reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business—that is, a business with fewer than 20 employees—from 26 weeks pay to 13 weeks pay. The bill extends the qualifying period of employment before an unfair dismissal action can be brought by an employee of small business, from three months to six months. The bill narrows the scope of an employee made redundant by her or his employer to mount an unfair dismissal action. The bill reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered for employees who have mitigated their loss by requiring the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take into account income earned from other employment.</para><para>Notably, however, the bill also contains some measures that appear to borrow from Labor's policy of reducing costs and simplifying procedures for all parties in the unfair dismissal system, such as making reinstatement the primary remedy and discouraging lawyers and agents from taking on speculative claims. While Labor would support these measures, it would be more appropriate for the government to deal with them by supporting the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissal—Lower Costs, Simpler Procedures) Bill 2002, a private member's bill introduced by the member for Hotham.</para><para>Regarding uniform unfair dismissal laws, when a comparison is made of the key features of the unfair dismissal regimes that apply across the states as well as the Commonwealth, one finds—surprisingly, to some—that a relatively high degree of regularity already exists. A comprehensive comparison is in fact contained in an attachment to the Senate committee's report on this bill. Under the different systems, salary caps on claimants are relatively uniform, exclusions for casuals do vary but compromise would not be impossible to bring them into line, and probationary periods and processes generally are similar. Overall, with some goodwill, there would undoubtedly be scope for a lining up of legal remedies for unfairly dismissed workers.</para><para>However, the issues become more complex. Often an unfair dismissal claim may be wrapped up with other matters such as recovery of wages or insufficient notice. In this regard, to effect optimal uniformity there needs to be a voluntary transfer or referral of power from the states to the Commonwealth. Until that happens, an aggrieved employee would be forced to take separate actions under different jurisdictions. This could hardly be considered a simplification of the process. </para><para>The Senate report also contains an extract from the Queensland government's submission that highlights the flaws in this bill insofar as it attempts to create a uniform system. They are: </para><quote><para>• two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;</para><para>• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;</para><para>• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';</para><para>• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; and</para><para>• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).</para></quote><para>A leading labour law scholar, Professor Andrew Stewart, makes a compelling argument. Many employers have historically operated solely or predominantly under state awards and are familiar and comfortable with state laws and procedures. However, under the government's approach, they would have their industrial relations regulations bifurcated: award and agreement matters would continue under state law, and unfair dismissals would become the subject of federal law.</para><para>Another consideration is the cost of pasting a new system on top of an existing structure. The government has allocated close to $17 million to fund an expansion to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to cope with the expected increased workload. But it makes little sense to expand the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry when this would leave many state commissioners idle. Of course, state commission members have life tenure, and the state governments would be required to continue to pay their commission members even if the federal government took away many of their powers and responsibilities. A far more sensible arrangement would be to reach agreement with the state commissions to participate in administering the system. There are already arrangements in place that allow state and federal commission members to work cooperatively, but that should be cooperatively with the state governments. This commonsense approach evades the government's thought processes in this matter.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill is an inept and clumsy attempt to reach a noble objective. A uniform industrial relations system has the potential to save time and resources for industrial associations, employers, employees and taxpayers. A unitary system could simplify the nation's overly complex maze of industrial regulation and bring fairness and uniformity to workers and employers. However, it is not just a matter of a uniform system for the sake of a uniform system. The content of a system—both procedural and substantive—is just as important, if not more important, than the structure. In both these regards, this bill fails the test. Not only does this bill reduce workers' rights and protections but it does not even achieve its stated object of uniformity. This bill fails to meet the requirements of sound public policy and should be rejected—and Labor will reject it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>12951</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with pleasure that I follow my colleague Senator Collins today in this debate on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. You would think that we are discussing something of national importance here that may see the wheels of administration or government grind to a halt. You might think that we are going to discuss a problem with the standard railway gauge or salinity on the Murray, but no—we are talking about some shabby, contemptible attempt by the coalition government to deny workers and their families in the states that have a state jurisdiction for unfair dismissal their ability to go to that commission or court and argue their case. This is the first shot across the bows of the state industrial relations regimes—ones that have ably and fairly looked after the interests of employers and employees for well over a century. It will effectively take away from those jurisdictions the ability to hear unfair dismissal claims. </para></talk.start><para>In my own state of New South Wales, we will be worse off as a result of this, because our unfair dismissal regime—and, as a Labor senator from New South Wales, I am proud of this—is fairer, simpler and easier to use than the federal jurisdiction, and there is much more history and institutional experience with unfair dismissal regimes in New South Wales. Unfair dismissals make up the bulk of the work for the state industrial relations tribunals. If this is taken away from them, undoubtedly the size of resources directed to state industrial relations tribunals will be lessened and their future viability will be in jeopardy. This will be bad for the workers of New South Wales, because the impact will be that the much fairer system will be taken away from them. There are fair provisions in the New South Wales jurisdiction for state enterprise bargaining agreements. Traditional areas of state regulation and enforcement—for example, occupational health and safety and leave entitlements— will be taken away from them. Other unique features of the New South Wales system, such as unfair contract provisions and contracts of carriage provisions, will be denied to them.</para><para>The effects of this bill will be that the federal jurisdiction for unfair dismissals will be extended from four million to seven million Australian workers, and a single dismissal jurisdiction for all companies under the corporations power of the Constitution with the exclusion of state tribunals from hearing most unfair dismissal cases. State termination of employment regimes cover about 40 per cent of employees, with the federal regime covering just over 50 per cent. It is important to note that the federal coverage is so broad mainly because Victoria does not have a state industrial relations system. The bill will remove all employees of constitutional corporations—that is, limited and proprietary limited companies. The only groups still under the state system will be state public servants and employees of non-incorporated businesses, of which there are only something like 1.5 million out of about eight million Australian workers. The immediate effect of these changes will be to make state unfair dismissal regimes unviable. The net effect of this bill will be to create a single system of unfair dismissal laws under the currently less fair and complex federal regime.</para><para>Workers in my home state of New South Wales will be much worse off under this bill. The majority of workers in New South Wales have recourse to a much fairer and simpler New South Wales system. If this bill is passed, most of them will immediately have recourse only to the federal system and, over the longer term, arguably all workers in New South Wales will have no choice but to make a claim under the federal system. The unfair dismissal system in New South Wales is fairer, simpler and easier to use than the complex federal system. Senator Collins quoted Professor Andrew Stewart, and I will quote him again. He remarked:</para><para>The provisions of ... the Workplace Relations Act ... are ... unnecessarily complex and unduly prescriptive. They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and their lawyers to exploit. </para><para>In addition, the federal provisions exclude a broader group of employees—casual employees. The New South Wales exclusion period is six months; the federal exclusion period is 12 months. There is also the continuing drive of the federal government to exclude all small business employees from accessing the federal unfair dismissal laws. Professor Ron McCallum of the University of Sydney has estimated that, if this bill is passed, only 70 to 75 per cent of Australian employees will have access to unfair dismissals of any kind. As I have already outlined, it is complex. </para><para>Under New South Wales law, there is no sharp distinction between unfair dismissal and discriminatory determination. In New South Wales, all matters may be determined simply and centrally by the commission. Under the federal system, only unfair dismissals may be finally determined by the commission—unlawful dismissals or discriminatory determinations may finally be determined by the Federal Court only. This bill seeks to impose on the majority of Australian workers a system that is plainly unfair and unnecessarily complex. </para><para>If you look at the history of the state jurisdictions, you will see that the six different states created their industrial relations systems in different ways, which I think is silly. In New South Wales—and this was explained to me by former Justice Macken— the industrial relations system came about because there were a number of disputes at the turn of the 20th century. Those disputes occurred because of people being unfairly dismissed, mainly on the waterfront. So the New South Wales parliament dealt with it. The first dispute was dealt with in 1896 through `the Wise's Act', which contained unfair determination provisions. In the year 1902, the first unfair dismissal decision, between the Newcastle Labourers Union and Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company Ltd, came before what was known as the Industrial Arbitration Court of New South Wales. In 1912, the Industrial Arbitration Act created a power to make an award determining any industrial matter—where `industrial matter' was defined to include dismissal. This jurisdiction was widened and recognised in the Re Bank Office (State) Board decision of 1921.</para><para>So in the early days of the Commonwealth, unfair dismissals in a state jurisdiction like mine came about because of industrial action and they were dealt with by the industrial commission because it was action taken in that state. But in the history of states like South Australia or Tasmania—or maybe even your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Cook—the industrial tribunals there were simply wages boards, whereas in the other states they came about because of unfair dismissals, in effect, and having to deal with them. I may be taken to task on that, but essentially there have been different pathways in the states leading to an industrial arbitration tribunal of sorts—one dealing with wages and one dealing with how to govern the relationship between the employer and the employee. The paths have been entirely different. So if you try to prescribe or come up with some sort of unique scheme federally, you dismiss the history of over a century of federation in dealing with this matter.</para><para>Let us go to 1971. I know that Senator Forshaw is going to speak later in this debate, and he—like I—would remember a number of the participants in a case where the principle of `a fair go all round' was established. The case was presided over by Mr Justice Sheldon; it was Loty and Holloway v. Australian Workers Union. Then, in 1978, section 20A was inserted into the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940 of New South Wales, establishing the jurisdiction's right to hear unfair dismissal claims. Up until this time reinstatement or compensation was granted only through the dispute settling powers of a New South Wales court or tribunal. In 1991, a simple and easy system to operate unfair dismissal regimes was brought in by a coalition government: the Industrial Arbitration (Unfair Dismissal) Amendment Act 1991. </para><para>It has been a desire of the coalition's to go after some sort of unitary system while they are in power. In fact, former Minister Peter Reith repeatedly argued for a national system of industrial relations. In October 2000 he released a serious of discussion papers entitled `Breaking the gridlock', which argued for a single system. I find it interesting, given the Liberal Party's strong attachment to federalism and championing of states' rights, that they are pushing this. Their only drive must be the fact that, in the Commonwealth of Australia, all the states and territories have Labor governments, and their systems are much fairer, easier and less complex for people who find themselves in the position of having been unfairly dismissed. The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> is an attempt to undermine those systems. As I said, it will make sure that people in those systems are much less well off.</para><para>What I want to talk about in particular in the time I have left is that, in my own state of New South Wales, there are two groups of workers—I suppose that is the right way to refer to them—who do not seem to be covered by the jurisdiction in this proposed legislation. The first are outworkers and the second are what we would call contract carriers or lorry owner-drivers. Under New South Wales legislation, clothing outworkers are included in the definition of an employee under section 5 of the act. The federal Workplace Relations Act does not include clothing outworkers in its definition of an employee. I do not think that anybody would disagree that clothing outworkers are amongst the most exploited and mistreated employees in Australia. Yet there is no reference in this legislation to that particular classification or class of employee—not one reference.</para><para>There is another particular difference in the jurisdiction in New South Wales—which, as you would expect from my background, I am quite familiar with. That is the position of lorry owner-drivers before a state tribunal. New South Wales, as far as I am aware, is still the only state in the Commonwealth in which lorry owner-drivers can have their rates of pay and conditions regulated by a state tribunal. I am not aware that any other state allows that to occur. People are required to present to a company a certain class of vehicle design or type of truck; they are required to paint it; and they are required to present themselves at a certain time every day—maybe every day of the week. From 1978, under New South Wales legislation, a tribunal has been able to regulate their rates of pay and conditions. These people are painted in whatever colours—as we may recall, it goes from TNT to Boral to Readymix.</para><para>Secondly, under chapter 6 of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act, unfairly dismissed owner-drivers can go before the commission and be compensated for their goodwill. That has not been mentioned in this area at all. You may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I have before the parliament—it is in the process of wending its way through the system—a private member's bill to deal with compensation of lorry owner-drivers for goodwill, particularly in the Canberra region. Under the New South Wales legislation, if a lorry owner-driver is unfairly dismissed, he or she may go and argue the case for his or her reinstatement or compensation. I recall that bill being passed, because it was drafted by the Labor member for Auburn, Mr Peter Nagle, and it was passed while the coalition was in power in New South Wales. But, because we do not have that legislation in Canberra, drivers for Boral are involved in a protracted dispute here. Because of the absence of that provision in the Workplace Relations Act they have no recourse to compensation for goodwill or opportunity to be reinstated where they have been unfairly dismissed. </para><para>So I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are just two areas that are open to exploitation by employers: outworkers, and lorry owner-drivers or contract carriers. They clearly have been and are— and will be—exploited unless the legislation is changed, and there is no reference to that in this bill at all. So, as Professor Stewart said, when you come up with a bill to try to come to some sort of all-embracing, all-knowledgeable bit of legislation that will cover everything, it is not there. Maybe that will be answered when the government has its opportunity to speak. But, in New South Wales—one state—if you are an outworker or a contract carrier, you can be reinstated. I do not know how it is in the other states; maybe my colleagues in the other states will make reference to it. But you can be reinstated in New South Wales.</para><para>If we pass this legislation, we will cut away the ability of people who work for corporations—that is, who will be covered by it—to access justice. We will cut away the ability of those men and women and their families to access justice. We will cut that away from them; it will be gone. For what? For some ideological pursuit—for the belief that it is in the interests of our nation to have a unitary system. I do not believe that is the case. It would be just madness for anybody to even consider supporting this bill and consider a situation where, as I said, these men, women and their families would be denied justice. They have it under one jurisdiction, and maybe they will get it under another jurisdiction as those good state Labor governments move to operate in that area. You would have to be mad and bad to support this legislation, as it excludes this class of people. There are already men and women and their families in this capital territory suffering because they do not have access to the justice they would have if they moved and operated a few kilometres across the border.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>12955</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> is part of a package of bills put forward by this government that again seeks to tip the scales in industrial relations even further in favour of the employer. It is apparent whom this government represents and it is not the working people of Australia. At least the former workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, had the honesty to state that he was there simply to serve the interests of employers and no-one else. This bill, in its attempt to force unfair dismissal coverage from the states to the federal system, is fundamentally misconceived. There are four key problems with the bill. One, there has been a complete lack of consultation with the states. Two, there has been insufficient attention given to costing and administrative arrangements. Three, the bill will result in a reduction in rates for workers with unfair dismissal claims. Four, the absence of a cooperative approach means a substantial sector of the work force will remain beyond the reach of federal law. These flaws make this bill untenable, and the reality is that this bill will not result in one new job.</para></talk.start><para>Fundamentally, the federal government has failed to justify any problems with the operation or application of the current state unfair dismissal system. It must be said from the outset that I am sickened by the coalition's hypocritical stance on this issue. For years, a unitary system that upholds employee rights has been the policy province of Labor. The benefits of a unitary system have been ignored by conservatives, who have been obsessed with defending state rights. Now that all state governments are Labor, we find the coalition more interested in industrial relations reform than in state rights. If the government were making a constructive move towards a unified and simplified industrial relations system, Labor might well be interested. But this bill is nothing more than an attempt to reduce the rights and protections currently enjoyed by many workers under the state industrial relations system. </para><para>A speech by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, was cited in the explanatory memorandum in support of a unified system for unfair dismissal claims. However, this speech emphasised the need for consultation and cooperation to be embedded in any attempt to pursue a national system of unfair dismissals. Justice Giudice went on to recount how a uniform companies law came about—by consultation and cooperation, not by legislative fiat. There has been minimal consultation on this bill. In fact, the Workplace Relations Ministers Council met two days before Minister Abbott outlined the essence of this bill to the media and the minister gave no indication to his state counterparts of this bill's existence. I find this particularly outrageous. It simply confirms our claim that this is a political bill rather than a serious attempt to improve the industrial relations system. Interestingly, Minister Abbott's proposal runs contrary to the views of the New South Wales opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mike Gallacher. He has twice this year publicly expressed support for New South Wales retaining its own industrial relations system.</para><para>Very little work has gone into analysing the financial impact of this bill. There will be a considerable increase in work for the commission, leading to greater demands being placed on registry staff and resources and the need for additional courtrooms, facilities, court reporting services and so on. The government has largely ignored the impact of the proposed changes. Furthermore, the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee produced a report on the bill. The Labor senators' report concluded:</para><para>... the bill will actually increase the industrial relations costs borne by business because many who choose to use the state system will now be forced to operate in two systems, a unitary system will not result, and workers will be discouraged from working for small businesses because it offers them less security and fewer rights.</para><para>This bill: one, reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business; two, extends from three months to six months the qualifying period for employment before an employee of small business can bring an unfair dismissal; three, narrows the scope for an employee made redundant by her or his employer to mount an unfair dismissal action; and, four, reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered.</para><para>Just briefly, on the changes to small business employees, this bill suffers from the same problem plaguing the countless workplace relations bills put forward by this government, and that is that there has never been a strong case made for the proposition that employees in the small business sector should possess fewer rights and legal safeguards than people who work in other employment sectors. The references committee conducted a serious inquiry into small business employment and found that the preoccupations of small business differed very little from those of large and medium business—having to do with business cycles, taxation, regulations and general economic conditions. Small business employs to the extent that business levels and business growth strategies determine, not the unfair dismissal laws. Any connection between the fear of unfair dismissal claims and the rate of overall small business employment is extremely tenuous. The Labor Party believe in equal rights; therefore, we believe that, for an employee who is dismissed, the size of the business should not be the determining factor. </para><para>A number of submissions made scathing comment on the methodology of the Harding survey, which was the basis for the government's claims about unfair dismissal laws constraining employment. These submissions found that the conclusions of the survey were badly flawed. Professor Andrew Stuart found that the figure of 77,482 job losses due to these laws was an estimate based on a series of estimates, and a curious exercise providing a weak foundation for government pronouncements on the benefit of the legislation. The onus of proof must always remain with those who desire to strip employees of legal rights to fairness, and this government has failed to satisfy this onus. </para><para>The Democrat senators' report agrees with the view that no hard evidence has been put forward. In fact, Senator Murray stated:</para><para>The experiment under Queensland State laws, when their then Coalition government introduced an exemption for small business, had no evident effect on job creation. </para><para>Even if these laws represented an increase in labour costs, the same could be said about superannuation and occupational health and safety laws. Are we to conclude that these are next on the government's hit list? The references committee's inquiry into small business employment found that:</para><para>Consistent with survey rankings of small business concerns, unfair dismissal did not arise as a major issue during the inquiry ...</para><para>The changes to redundancy obligations are very worrying. Many employers use redundancies to get rid of workers they consider troublesome. Employers must use an agreed and transparent process, otherwise unfair dismissal claims are almost inevitable. There is no guarantee that this bill will finish debate on termination of employment. The federal scheme does not purport to provide a national scheme in which all employees have access. If this bill passes, state termination jurisdictions will need to remain to provide for employees of non-incorporated businesses, and the state appears to have a role, potentially, for 1.5 million or so employees, including state public servants. This bill will simply create another tier of employees with yet another level of rights and protection. The government has asserted, without explanation or justification, that the proposed Commonwealth legislation will be better balanced than current state laws that, according to the explanatory memorandum, contain inequalities which, however, are not identified.</para><para>Furthermore, this bill—overriding state legislation—has been produced without consultation with the states. Hence this bill shows all the signs of failure to deal cooperatively with the states. The bill seeks to override state unfair dismissal laws in favour of a federal regime that is inferior in both design and operation. The proposed amendments would not in fact contribute to the goal of simplifying the coverage of federal and state labour laws. As the Democrat senators' report stated:</para><para>... relying on the Corporation's power alone will still leave large chunks of employees working for non incorporated business, many of these small business, with no protection from State or Federal laws. </para><para>In conclusion, this bill is both a limited and blunt instrument of legislation. It leaves a small but significant group of workers beyond its ambit and it creates legal complications in cases where current state legislation covers regulatory matters affecting unfair dismissal. Labor are not opposed to a more coherent system per se. What we are opposed to, however, is this government's arrogant and unilateral approach and its determination to attack working people's rights and their protection.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>12958</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>12958</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>12958</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Coonan, Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

It is good to have her back in the chamber. The Regional Assistance Mission was deployed on 24 July. Years of lawlessness have had a devastating effect on the Solomon Islands people. The mission's key priority is to support the efforts of the Solomon Islands authorities to restore law and order. The mission comprises police, military and civilian personnel from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. At full strength, the mission will build to about 2,000 personnel. It was put together very quickly and effectively, which highlights both the commitment of countries across the South Pacific to stabilising the situation in the Solomon Islands, and the professionalism of the agencies involved. The ADF's role is to provide protection for the police contingent as well as logistic and operational support.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, Australia's military contribution numbers approximately 1,500. This includes troops deployed in the capital, Honiara, and on the Weather Coast, troops onboard HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline>, and maritime elements conducting border patrols in the Bougainville Straits. The operation is going very well. A 21-day weapons amnesty has been announced. Almost 400 weapons have been handed in or otherwise secured, and many of these have been destroyed. Joint police patrols have begun. Two police posts have been opened in the provinces, and work is under way to complete a new prison at Rove. Contact has been established with key militant leaders to urge them to hand in weapons before the deadline. As I said, Mr President, this is a very good start and a tribute to the different agencies involved, including the Australian Federal Police, the ADF, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and their regional counterparts. It means government leaders and public officers can go about their duty, free from intimidation.

We do not underestimate the complexity of the task or the challenges ahead. All armed groups must hand in their weapons before the amnesty expires, including Harold Keke, who must now deliver on the undertaking he gave Special Coordinator Warner on 8 August. Those who have committed serious offences must be brought to justice, and the Solomon Islands government must press ahead with the difficult institutional and other reforms required for a lasting improvement. Australia will continue to support those efforts but, at the end of the day, the Solomon Islands problems can only be addressed if all of its people make the necessary commitment to stability and prosperity.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Manildra Group of Companies</title><page.no>12959</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>12959</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.

I can check whether that is the exact figure for the time period referred to. </para></talk.start><para>As Senator O'Brien well knows, the government made a formal decision that, rather than ethanol being excise free, we would introduce a mechanism whereby excise would be paid on all ethanol but that domestic producers would receive a production subsidy equivalent to the excise to sustain the excise-free status of ethanol while ensuring that the domestic industry had an opportunity to develop without being destroyed by competition from cheap imports from Brazil, where the industry is very heavily subsidised by the Brazilian government, with its very big sugar industry.</para><para>We think that was an appropriate decision. All it did was maintain the excise-free status of domestic production: producers would pay out the excise but would get a production subsidy equivalent. It is not really a subsidy in that sense; it just means they do not pay the tax that is applied to petrol in this country. We do believe, as the former Labor government did with its assistance to the alternative fuels industry, that we should provide some mechanism—which is effectively an excise-free mechanism up until about 2008, when it will start to wind down—by which the ethanol industry can be given the opportunity to establish itself in the marketplace.</para><para>It so happens that, at the moment, Manildra is by far the biggest producer and supplier of ethanol in this country. CSR is also a supplier. In the parliamentary recess the government announced on 25 July the decision to allocate some $37 million to fund one-off capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity. That is very much in line with our election commitment and, of course, will ensure that there is a greater diversity of production of ethanol in this country. It will give an opportunity for others to enter the ethanol industry.</para><para>As you know, we have also set a 10 per cent limit on ethanol blending into petrol to restore consumer confidence in this product. In the recess we also announced the commissioning of a report on the objective of 350 million litres of biofuels that we had set. We want to look at that target in the light of the latest evidence in relation to the environmental and other benefits that are asserted in relation to biofuels. We are not in the least embarrassed by our continuation of the support which the previous government provided for the development of the alternative fuels industry in this country. We took steps during the recess to increase the likelihood of other producers entering this field. All of the assistance we provide is company neutral and it is available to anyone in this business. But it is an obvious statement of fact that Manildra is by far the biggest producer and therefore, to the extent that we are paying a subsidy to equate to the excise, it is the greatest recipient of that subsidy.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12960</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is to be in place until 31 December 2003, or until a $10 million financial cap is reached. So it is simply a reprofiling of existing production subsidies for existing producers in recognition of the fact that, in order to restore confidence in the ethanol products, we brought in the limit of 10 per cent. That obviously had some impact on the ethanol industry. There was a loss of confidence in the industry, with varying reports—well placed or not—about content higher than 10 per cent and about whether that was causing damage to engines. So we did the right thing by bringing in the 10 per cent limit. That has caused some short-term difficulties for existing ethanol producers.

The facilitator will assess the extent to which we can overcome any difficulties there may be between the major petrol companies and, in this case, Manildra, as by far the biggest producer of ethanol.

It does at least give me the opportunity to address this issue, which has, I think, received some publicity which has not helped the parents of children with disabilities who would maintain their allowance. By way of background, there are some 70,000 people now on a carer allowance who were previously on a child disability allowance some five years ago. Changes were made to the allowances, and all the people who were on the different, older allowance were told that they would be quarantined for five years, with no further reviews in that five-year period.</para></talk.start><para>The new carer allowance, which has now been operating for that period of five years, has two elements to it. First, there is a list of recognised disabilities—or they might be better described as medical conditions—and if you have a child who has one of these then the medical aspect is automatically satisfied. However, if your child has another medical condition—that is, one not on the list of recognised disabilities—then you, on behalf of the child, need to have the child assessed against the capability of a child at that age without any disability. The reason for that is that some specialists who put this together, as I am advised—medical experts, mental health experts and some people involved in the disability area—concluded that there are some medical conditions where it is perfectly clear that you will need this extra assistance and there are others where, perhaps, with age the condition or the capacity to handle the condition improves, or medical science improves. </para><para>Some classic disabilities that might come under that category would be attention deficit disorder—I do not know anyone with it at 25. Kids do tend to grow out of this and to receive medical assistance that helps. Similarly, with asthma—which can of course be terrifying for a young child who does not understand and is not capable of handling the medical assistance that is required—when that child is eight, nine or 10 and at school they may well be able to handle their asthma perfectly well and perform as a normal member of the community. In addition to attention deficit disorder and asthma I would add diabetes as another example of the sorts of things that would be in the latter category. That list of recognised disabilities was reviewed in 1999-2000; some very minor changes, I am advised, needed to be made.</para><para>What I have said is that there are two things happening. Firstly, we will have another review of the recognised disabilities list, and that will be finished by Christmas. That happens every couple of years and is unrelated to matters currently being discussed about this particular group of carers; that would happen in any event. And, in relation to this particular group of carers, no-one will be put off on the basis of medical grounds until the government has had a look to see if we can find a better way. As to specific cases, I will check with my department on the one that you raise. There was one given much publicity last weekend, about a child that had, in effect, blindness.

As a result, the ABC is receiving in excess of $760 million a year, as Senator Eggleston rightly pointed out, for each of the next three years. That is about $2.2 billion. Not only have we maintained the ABC's funding but also we gave it an extra $72 million a year or so back for additional regional programming—and that was the first time in 20 years that content programming was increased outside the budget context.

What emerged at the Senate estimates committee as a result of a number of questions put on notice by Senator Santoro was that the ABC is spending close to $1 million a year on international conferences for senior staff and clothing allowances and some $3 million on motor vehicle allowances. Its self-promotion and advertising budget has more than doubled from $4.1 million to $8.4 million over the last four years.

There are very, very few people who get any form of welfare who do not on some occasion find themselves subject to a review. There are some people on the disability support pension who are marked for no review—and they are very, very tragic cases—but nearly everyone else who gets some form of allowance should expect at some point to have a review. That would include people who care for children with attention deficit disorder; for children with asthma who, when they are in grades 6 and 7, can handle it quite easily; and for children with diabetes, which you could not expect a baby to handle but which kids, once they are at school, can and do.</para></talk.start><para>You ask how to justify a cold-hearted review as though any review is cold-hearted, when in fact what we are talking about here is a review of a wide range of cases with a wide range of disabilities and, within each disability, a range of levels of disability. That is why the advice I have at the moment on the people who have had their payment cancelled is that one-third of them have self-assessed as not being entitled. Something like 80 per cent of the carers who are caring for asthmatics and who have been assessed have been assessed as no longer being entitled. Why? Because a child of three or four would be terrified by asthma, but a kid who is eight or nine might be handling it very well. You describe any review as a cold-hearted review; I think it is a fact of life that these things have to be looked at. </para><para>As to Down syndrome, there are three things I would like to say about that. Firstly, the list of recognised disabilities that says Down syndrome is such a disability up until age six was made by people with far more medical expertise than any of us could put together. They reviewed it again in 1999-2000 and still did not increase that age. The second thing to say to people with Down syndrome is that, of those who have been looked at so far, 98 per cent have maintained their payment. I am sorry that all of them thought that the payment was going to be cut as a consequence of remarks by your colleagues, Senator Bishop, and in particular Mr Swan. Some people will use people with a disability to advance themselves, and Mr Swan has never shown any reluctance whatsoever to do that. But for the cold-hearted government that wants to cut off people who have children with Down syndrome: 98 per cent of those cases have been put back on payment. I am advised that, of the two per cent that have not, they have not been for medical reasons—it might be that the child is no longer in care.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—What's the value in it then? What's the value of the review?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>—Senator Bishop rightly, in a sense, interjects and says, `What's the point?' Indeed, you may ask that when experts have put this together and have twice decided that, after year 6, there would be the possibility of such a level of difference between one Down syndrome child and another. But that would tell me that the next time that group report, they will have the advice from my department about the reviews that have taken place so far—namely, that 98 per cent of those with Down syndrome, who would necessarily be up to 10 years old because of when these cases were saved, have in fact been put on. I think that therefore makes a very good case for Down syndrome for those aged over six up to another age—I am not sure what, because I do not have the age group of people who have been reviewed—to be put on as a recognised disability. My particular concern, as I say, is that Mr Swan has chosen to tell Australia that people with Down syndrome children are necessarily being kicked off when the facts show that 98 per cent of them are not— and, for those that have lost payment, it is because the child is no longer in care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12971</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The first part of the question was:</para><para>Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol or by any representative of his company or the Industry Association before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? </para><para>The second part was:</para><para>If so, when? </para><para>And there was a third part to the question:</para><para>Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive price?</para><para>What was the first part of Mr Howard's answer to these questions?</para><para>Speaking for myself, I did not personally have any discussions, from recollection, with any of them. </para><para>That is what the Prime Minister told the Australian parliament about possible meetings. Two days after that, the Prime Minister told the parliament that he had checked his records and that he had not spoken with the ethanol producer, Mr Honan. </para><para>We all know—courtesy of an FOI document obtained by my colleague Senator O'Brien—that indeed Mr Honan did have a secret meeting with Mr Howard six weeks before Mr Howard's misleading statement to the parliament. We know that the meeting was attended also by a PM&amp;C note-taker. This situation was made even worse, in relation to misleading the public, when Mr Howard was asked in Darwin about the question. He said:  </para><para>But it's false. I haven't misled Parliament. The answer I gave related to the question I was asked, and the question I was asked was in relation to a particular shipment of ethanol from Brazil and at the time I had the meeting I didn't know about the shipment. </para><para>But he was pressed by a journalist on this issue and on the actual question. The journalist asked:</para><para>There were parts to the question though, weren't there? You're talking about the last part of the question. </para><para>PRIME MINISTER: No, I'm talking about the first question that was asked of me. </para><para>Of course, the first part of the first question asked of Mr Howard was about a meeting. The second part asked when the meeting took place. Only the third part mentioned the ethanol shipment to Brazil. Again, Mr Howard has misled the parliament and the public. This is a situation which you get used to, I suppose, with Mr Howard. This is another case of truth overboard from the Prime Minister. His code of conduct—much vaunted when it was tabled in the parliament and now much discredited—provides for any minister or prime minister who misleads the parliament or the public to correct the record. They must not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. We now know that these misleadings of the parliament and the public remain uncorrected—they stand uncorrected. Mr Howard thinks he is above all the parliamentary and the Westminster conventions— the morality and the proper political process. But I say he is not. He stands exposed and he ought to be man enough to acknowledge the mislead and to correct the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>12973</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to Senator Faulkner's motion to take note of answers, the dust has settled on the Labor leadership, six weeks of the winter break have gone by, the Labor Party have returned to parliament for the new session and they have learnt nothing. They have not reassessed or attempted to learn the lessons of their disruptive leadership or their slump in the polls. They have learnt nothing in the six weeks break at all. They have walked straight back into parliament and, in the very first question time, they have returned to their old modus operandi, led no less than by their A1 head kicker, Senator Faulkner. It is slur, it is slander or it is personal attacks on the Prime Minister or any of his associates—no matter how far and distant; it could be anyone who has ever met the Prime Minister. It is slur and slander with absolutely no policy. There is no policy at all.</para></talk.start><para>What we are dealing with here is a policy of support for an industry that the government is injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into. Yet all we get is an attack from the Labor Party upon this somewhat Keynesian policy, which I would have thought would have appealed to some of those on the other side of the chamber. It is government support of an industry, and all we get is the slur and slander led by Senator Faulkner. In question time it was led by the shadow minister, Senator O'Brien, who is, obviously, poorly attempting to rehabilitate his career, which had a near-death experience over the winter break.</para><para>The government has always been up-front about its ethanol policy. It has nothing to hide at all. There is no trick to our policy. It is an out-and-out injection of government funds into an industry so as to produce a clean, green fuel for the future and support the sugar farmers. I should add, Senator O'Brien, that the sugar industry called for this policy, and we delivered it. It is a policy for the long run. In the long run CSR will enter the ethanol market and be in competition with the Manildra Group. In the long run those who will benefit most will be not just the farmers down at the farm gate but the consumers. The consumers will benefit from an alternative fuel that competes against the oil industries—that will, in fact, affect petrol prices. It should make petrol cheaper. </para><para>But not only has Labor come into this chamber and thrown slurs and slanders— weak attempts to accuse the Prime Minister of misleading the parliament—but also it has learnt nothing. It has not learnt that it is not working. What the public want from the opposition is policy—hard policy. You have had the whole winter break to think about that and you have had a leadership challenge to reassess all that, but you have just come straight back in and done the same thing all over again. You will be condemned to opposition for many years to come and you will be a poor opposition for it. The government's policy is one that we are quite proud of. As I say, it is one for the future. It is one that we have been open about. Moreover, it supports the sugar industry, the sugar farmers and the consumer, and it introduces a clean, green fuel.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—Not for ethanol; it's plant based!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—It can be both sugar based and wheat based.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—Which are you giving the subsidy to?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—The subsidy is to the industry as a whole.

A diverse alternative fuels industry in Australia can only be sustained if Australian consumers agree to use fuel containing an ethanol blend. By refusing to cap ethanol content in fuel last year—despite the insistence of the motor vehicle industry, motoring groups and Labor—the government did extraordinary damage to the reputation of ethanol in the Australian marketplace. Its ethanol subsidy regime has done nothing to address that extraordinary damage. A few weeks ago the dominant ethanol producer, Manildra, was threatening to close plants because of the 10 per cent limit, which it said would further dampen demand. But, at the same time, some members of the government and industry representatives are promoting the idea that more plants up and down the east coast are desirable and feasible under the government's expanded ethanol subsidy regime. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The second matter I want to turn to is the alleged benefit to be derived by the sugar industry from the government's package—a matter referred to by Senator McGauran. We should not forget that the government used the plight of the sugar industry as the basis of its changes to ethanol policy late last year. Yet, in answer to a question on notice, Senator Minchin has revealed that more than 96 per cent of ethanol subsidy payments made by the government last year were made to Manildra. What does Manildra produce ethanol from? Wheat, predominantly—grains, generally, but wheat predominantly. The only ethanol producer to use sugar byproducts, CSR, got less than four per cent of subsidy payments from the government last year. The woes of sugar growers have been used to cloak the government's massive handout to a producer that uses wheat, not sugar, to produce ethanol.</para><para>Finally, I turn to the greatest lie of all— that is, the suggestion that the government did not have Manildra's interests at the centre of its thinking when it developed and expanded its ethanol package. The first matter of note is the prime ministerial denial in the other place of a meeting with the Manildra chairman, Mr Dick Honan. Mr Honan had a private meeting with the Prime Minister on 1 August last year. The formal record of that meeting reveals that Mr Honan and the Prime Minister discussed ethanol excise and protection for the domestic industry from Brazilian imports. There is nothing wrong with a businessman seeking a meeting with the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister chooses to provide privileged access to political donors, that is a matter for him. But the Prime Minister is not entitled to deny the existence of that meeting or to pretend that it did not relate to matters addressed by a major policy announcement six weeks after it took place.</para><para>How the other place deals with the Prime Minister is a matter for that place, but it is important that the Senate notes two matters: first, the meeting was revealed only through an application under the Freedom of Information Act, not through answers to questions in the parliament about meetings between the Prime Minister and Manildra; and, second, today's failure by the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue to correct the statement she made to the Senate on 9 December last year when she repeated the Prime Minister's false denial of communication with Mr Honan in relation to ethanol policy. It is not just worth considering the false denial; it is important to look at the range of benefits this government has delivered to Manildra, and I have referred to the 96 per cent of subsidies paid to producers last year going to Manildra—that is, $20.8 million from $21.7 million. Last month, Manildra received an expedited production subsidy arrangement and an exclusive commercial facilitator. Prior to the latest series of announcements, Manildra received $1 million in payments to assist it to develop its fuel ethanol production capacity. In April this year, in the midst of the ethanol funding bonanza, the minister for agriculture announced an $885,000 grant for Manildra under the food industry grants program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>12975</page.no><name role="metadata">Colbeck, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator COLBECK</name><name.id>00AOL</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Again we have a demonstration of the double standards Labor apply to their policy and to their treatment of regional Australia.

They were railing against a Productivity Commission report on the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The members were all eager to get onto the platform to complain about the Commonwealth government and about the fact that the Productivity Commission report was going to promote a reduction in tariff levels for this industry and to say that the Commonwealth government should not support the Productivity Commission report. They were standing in line and eager to get up there to make their point. They failed to recognise that this Commonwealth government is the only one that has provided a freeze in support of the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</para><para>A similar situation exists with the biofuel industry in Australia. The Commonwealth government is prepared to provide support and assistance where it sees a problem, and the opposition is prepared to rail against that and is not prepared to provide that support. The Commonwealth government has an objective to see a productive and competitive biofuel industry exist in this country. It saw a problem, it saw a threat in the form of highly subsidised biofuels out of Brazil and it acted. It made the decision to support a sustainable industry with a sustainable fuel that will provide long-term benefits and assistance to the economy, to Australian industry, to rural Australia and to the environment and to provide assistance to regional Australia and rural Australia. That is quite the contrary to what Senator O'Brien just said.</para><para>The government's decision provides farmers with an alternative market for their product and the general public with an opportunity to purchase a clean, green, domestically produced and, most importantly, renewable alternative to our finite reserves of crude oil. It provides further benefits to the environment through improved air quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions and is a safe replacement for toxic octane enhancers in gasoline, such as benzine, toluene and xylene.</para><para>This government have consistently made a feature of looking after regional Australia and make no apology in this instance for providing a source of support for regional industry, regional businesses and farmers that require that support. As Senator McGauran said, this industry both supports the sugar industry and provides an alternative market for the wheat industry. We make absolutely no apology for that. We have been quite open, quite frank and quite honest about the outcomes and the reasons for supporting this industry. Like when we froze tariffs for the textile, clothing and footwear industry back in 2000—when every single tariff reduction had taken place under the regime of a Labor government—we make no apology for supporting this industry in this circumstance. This issue clearly demonstrates the policy vacuum the Labor Party exist in. It clearly demonstrates the double standards of Labor in their assessment and their approach to regional Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>12976</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to take note of the answers to questions asked of Senator Minchin and Senator Coonan this afternoon in relation to the whole issue of ethanol funding. My concerns are twofold: firstly, the Prime Minister's direct interference in the debate and the decision making on providing the subsidy to the ethanol industry; and, secondly, the fact that his interference will do untold harm to the ethanol industry, which previously held significant hope for both Australian agriculture and the alternative biofuels industry.  </para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to place on the public record that Labor is intent upon—and definitely supportive of—having an alternative biofuels industry, but this is not the way to do it. The government's subsidy has certainly been criticised by other players—other than Manildra, that is, of course—notably CSR, which is the other main domestic producer of ethanol. Recently CSR's managing director, Mr Alec Brennan, was on the record as saying that the government's package provides no long-term certainty for the Australian industry at all, and CSR has indicated that it is unlikely to proceed with plans for another ethanol plant under the current regime. </para><para>The real problem that we have is that, despite all the claims of the government, ethanol may not deliver environmental benefits. Certainly, this proposal does nothing to help struggling sugar growers. It actually supports just one key player in the market, and that is Manildra. Ethanol is actually three times more expensive than ordinary petrol, and so the idea of being able to encourage people to take up ethanol as an alternative fuel is one that both Shell and Caltex have been warning about for some time. They both have said there are significant problems remaining that prevent ethanol being accepted by motorists. Last year we heard all of those complaints about the damage that ethanol was doing to motor vehicles. </para><para>Senator Minchin today was being a bit too clever by half in his response to the questions I asked him about the government's modelling of the ethanol based industry and the decisions of his department. He acknowledged, I think, that there were no benchmarks, no analysis done of the alternatives and no modelling taking place about this process and how this would actually deliver some benefits to the industry at all. This hardly passes the test of good public policy. </para><para>CSIRO, ABARE and the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics are about to embark, or have just embarked, on an investigation of the environmental benefits of ethanol. It would seem very sensible to me that any decision on the precise nature of government support for ethanol production should sensibly await the outcome of that research. That to me would be the foundation of some good public policy for an important environmental industry that we want to promote and support. So rather than being so clever and evading and skirting around the whole issue of accountability by the Prime Minister, and the protection that has been afforded to the Prime Minister by Senator Coonan and Senator Minchin in this chamber today, we need to be very mindful that there are broad ramifications for the kind of interference that has taken place in this debate. We need to be very careful of the increasing power of executive government in making those decisions and overruling and overriding the important work of government departments to ensure that there is some transparency in the processes of decision making. These are the kinds of issues the Labor Party will be taking up at Senate estimates.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Indigenous Australians</title><page.no>12977</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>12977</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to health care for Indigenous Australians.</para></motion><para>I pointed out to Senator Patterson that, on average, Indigenous health is three times worse than the health of other Australians. Commonwealth spending on PBS and Medicare for Aboriginal people is less than that spent on non-Indigenous Australians. The minister outlined some programs which are worthy and I congratulate her for going into Indigenous communities—I have done so myself on numerous occasions—and she must have been impressed about the seriousness of the problems in those communities.  </para><para>Nonetheless, I do not think we are seeing priority being given to this sector of our community. They are the most vulnerable group in society. As was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last week, doctors are being consulted about the so-called Fairer Medicare package to finetune it, in Senator Patterson's words. We have also had statements about the PBS, but whether or not it is on the agenda at the free trade talks with the US is still unclear. But I think it is fair to say that, in terms of priorities, we are not seeing Indigenous health up there with the best of them. </para><para>In fact, reports on Indigenous health continue to be shameful to what is a rich country. It is difficult to improve the health of people whose education and employment levels are so low and whose housing provisions are so poor and so on. It is not simply a case of throwing money at health programs per se to improve health services or health outcomes. But it is the case that simply funding health for Indigenous people at a constant level—or improving it only marginally here or there—means that Indigenous people are unlikely to see any great improvement in their health. </para><para>The health budget this year contained no new money for Indigenous health, nor did it anticipate any new evaluations of existing programs. Does the minister, from that budget provision, suggest that Aboriginal health is fixed and that we have already got the solutions? I think it is clear that we do not. We need to put a few of the facts on the table. According to the last available expenditure report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 406,000 Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people—over a quarter—in 1998-99 lived in remote Australia. That compares with 2.6 per cent of the total Australian population. So we can already see that remoteness and distance are likely to be differential factors in the delivery of health services.</para><para>Total Commonwealth funding for recurrent health services expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, excluding transfers to the states, was estimated to be $267 million. Of this, around one-fifth was for GP services, eight per cent for PBS services and around 45 per cent for Indigenous-specific health services. The remainder—25 per cent, or $66.3 million—was for other health services, including general administration. Per person, expenditure by the Commonwealth for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, excluding payments to the states, was $658 compared with $786 for non-Indigenous people. Of the $658 spent on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Commonwealth contributed $146 to medical services, $50 to PBS and $298 to Indigenous-specific programs. Combined Commonwealth funding for these programs was $495 per person, or approximately 75 per cent of total Commonwealth per person expenditure for Indigenous people. The remaining $163 was spent on high-care residential aged care, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and other health services.</para><para>Of the total $786 spent per non-Indigenous person, almost two-thirds of health funding is through benefits paid for medical services and the PBS, but we know that Indigenous people are more likely to die 20 years earlier than their non-Indigenous counterparts and the infant mortality rate is over three times the rate for all Australian infants. Kidney failure, trachoma, nutritional and drug and alcohol related health problems are manifestations of poor living conditions, much of which can be attributed to structural inequity. I visited the Northern Territory and went into a community health centre a couple of years ago.

Charlie Jones, elected in 1958, was the third member for Newcastle, and a very important part of that great tradition.

All of this meant that he was very well prepared when he became the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation in the second Whitlam ministry in December 1972. He was so well prepared that Gough Whitlam later described him as `the most effective and creative transport minister in Australian history'.</para><para>One of his achievements was the passing of the National Roads Act in 1974, the legislation that authorised a Commonwealth-funded national highway system linking all capital cities—a total of 15,800 kilometres of highway. Of course, Charlie's achievements with road and rail were somewhat overshadowed by controversy over Sydney's airport—I suppose there are a few of us who probably could sympathise. In August 1973, Charlie announced that Galston had been chosen by the Australian government as the site for a new Sydney airport. The Parramatta by-election later that year, lost by Labor in no small part because of the backlash against the airport, saw the end of the Galston airport proposal. A feasibility study in 1975 into the possibility of a Goulburn airport—and Gough did say Charlie was creative—discovered that that was not feasible either. Charlie's plan to reduce aircraft noise in Sydney by asking new applicants for flights into Australia to use Tullamarine rather than Kingsford Smith was greeted with horror by the New South Wales government, as they watched tourism dollars roar overhead, bound for Melbourne.</para><para>Charlie was notoriously plain spoken. Charlie was able to get the last word in, even at times against Gough Whitlam. Former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam tried to subtly—if that was possible—rebuke Charlie for turning up late to a cabinet meeting, remarking, `We were hoping to complete this item before you arrived.' Charlie retorted to Gough, `I was hoping you would too.' Charlie was twice suspended from the House of Representatives: once for calling Phillip Lynch a dingo, and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> published a cartoon of two affronted dingoes vowing revenge; and once for calling Harold Holt a `dirty low mug'. His most memorable parliamentary remarks were not unparliamentary. Explaining PNG aviation policy, Charlie declared, `I told Michael Somare, “Look, Michael, you can argue till you're black in the face, but it's that Ansett who's the nigger in the woodpile.”' Many politicians, of course, have dreamed of bringing the House to absolute silence—Charlie Jones achieved it. </para><para>After Kerr, Barwick and Fraser conspired to bring down the Whitlam government in 1975, Charlie remained in parliament, representing the seat of Newcastle until 1983. When he retired from parliament, he became an official of the retired members association. I know Charlie loved fishing, so I suppose he took time off from that important activity. But he also kept up his interest in transport and civil aviation and, on a number of occasions, carpeted retired members he felt were misusing their gold passes.</para><para>Today in this condolence debate I want to thank Charlie and acknowledge his personal support, particularly during the late 1970s and 1980s. Charlie could be a very difficult character to deal with: stubborn, curmudgeonly and inflexible, he held some quite old-fashioned views. Many could not understand him. Always loyal to the Left of the Labor Party, he was more than capable of expressing quite right-wing views. Charlie explained this approach once to a colleague: `Think Right, vote Left.' When I was the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the ALP, Charlie would often be in contact over the labyrinthine intricacies of Labor politics in Newcastle, which are far too complex to explain here in the Senate chamber—actually, Mr Deputy President, I would have to admit that I have never quite understood them myself.</para><para>The best thing I can say about Charlie, and the thing I am sure that he would want someone to say in this condolence debate, is that no-one could question his loyalty to the Labor Party. He remained a party activist until his death last week. Charlie Jones served the labour movement and the people of Newcastle in many different capacities from 1943, when he first became a member of the executive of the Boilermakers Union. After 40 years of public service, in his retirement he continued to be active and engaged. He was always motivated by his desire to serve and to help the working men and women of Newcastle and their families, whether as a unionist, an alderman or a member of parliament. I will certainly miss him. Many other members and supporters of the Labor Party will miss him. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I express our deep regret at Charlie's death and offer sincere condolences to his wife, Doreen, his children, Fay and Ken, and his many grandchildren and great grandchildren. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>12981</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate the Australian Democrats with this condolence motion. Charlie Jones obviously made a mark on his country, and his friends and family have great reason to be proud of all that he achieved and all the effort he put in. He was elected to the seat of Newcastle in 1958 and served in that seat until 1983. That 25-year service in the House of Representatives is of itself worth noting. Very few senators have served this chamber for 25 years, and I think only a handful of the current members of the House of Representatives have served for that length of time. Twenty-five years is certainly up there in the higher ranks of length of service. </para></talk.start><para>Prior to entering the federal parliament, Charlie Jones was active in the Newcastle City Council as an alderman and then as lord mayor, his service there stretching back a further 12 years. Clearly, he served his community with great diligence and effectiveness and, from the tone and detail of the contribution of Senator Faulkner—who is in a position to know—obviously he was viewed with a great deal of affection by many in his party. To serve a party and a community for that length of time and still be recognised at the end as someone who has done a good job is the sign of a task well done. </para><para>The time of Charlie Jones as transport minister perhaps has had the most focus in terms of the role he played in parliament. As Senator Faulkner mentioned, some of the issues of that period—30 years ago now, when Charlie first became a minister in the Whitlam government, at the end of 1972— are still around today in varying forms. The second airport in Sydney is one such issue that Senator Faulkner mentioned. Some of the trials and tribulations involved in trying to get decisions on that issue continue to this present day. Many an aviation minister—not to mention an opposition leader and various representatives of Sydney based seats—has been caused a lot of angst by the varying proposals for further airports and air traffic in Sydney and the Sydney basin. </para><para>Mr Jones also served as transport minister during the difficult period when the world was confronted by the oil crisis of the early 1970s. Airlines around the world were suffering, as many of them are now. There was talk at the time of merging Qantas with what was then TAA, a move which eventually became reality some 20 years later, although of course under very different circumstances, in a deregulated market. The Hon. Mr Jones was also the minister responsible for making the decision to allow the supersonic Concorde to fly to Australia. It subsequently did make a number of visits to Australia—although, as senators would be aware, there shall be no more Concordes flying into Australia. But Charlie Jones was the person who gave permission for them to come here for the first time. </para><para>Also in the area of aviation, long before smoking was banned on all domestic and international flights, Charlie Jones recognised the health implications of smoking on passenger aircraft and suggested that smoking seats should be segregated from non-smoking seats. This was a forerunner to the subsequent government's later legislative segregation, which effectively banned smoking on domestic flights. So clearly, even in that small number of years as minister, he had a significant role in some issues of the aviation and transport industries that we are still wrestling with today. I am sure that his local community, the proud community of Newcastle—although I must say that after 100-plus years of electing a Labor Party member they might want to consider some alternatives—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—I doubt it; certainly not the Australian Democrats. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—You never know; just you wait and see.

This initiative is long overdue.</para><para>The Bill will provide the means by which the care, protection and use of animals can be coordinated, monitored and reviewed nationally, with the establishment of a National Animal Welfare Authority that has the power to do whatever is necessary in order to achieve a reasonable balance between the welfare needs of animals and the interests of people who use animals for a livelihood; reflect human community attitudes and expectations as to how animals should be treated; and acknowledge advances in the scientific knowledge of animal biology, psychology and behaviour in respect to their needs and care.</para><para>The Democrats' Bill also seeks to regulate the use of animals for all private, commercial, institutional, educational and government research and experimentation to ensure the use of animals for such purposes are accountable, open, ethical, humane and responsible.</para><para>This Bill, in essence, is an extension of the extraordinary work of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. The Bill expands on the legislative reforms and recommendations of that Committee, and brings into focus the major advances in our knowledge and understanding of animal biology, psychology and behaviour. </para><para>In 1982, the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Don Chipp, Senator to Victoria, initiated and founded the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, with Senator George Georges, ALP Senator to Queensland, in the chair—a role he pursued with great commitment. </para><para>Over the course of the Committee's lifetime, it pursued significant and varied animal welfare issues and concerns under its terms of reference, producing 10 substantiative reports during its 8-year lifespan. The more influential of these reports were: Export of Live Sheep from Australia (1985), Dolphins and Whales in Captivity (1985), Animal Experimentation (1989), and Intensive Livestock Production (1990). </para><para>Twenty years on, it's clear that animal welfare needs to, once again, become a Commonwealth priority. </para><para>Animal welfare as practised in Australia is a dog's breakfast of policies from state to state; however, this needn't have been the case. </para><para>The Australian Democrats have, throughout their political life, successfully used Federal Parliament to highlight numerous animal welfare issues. </para><para>The Democrats have been active. They have shown the way on numerous occasions; they have set the lead but too few have followed.</para><para>The Democrats have called for action on: the inhumane culling of New South Wales brumbies; intensive and inhumane farming practices, such as the size of battery hen cages and single sow stalls; the lack of protection for the world's great apes and Australia's cassowaries; the need to ban the elephant ivory trade; calls for an investigation into live animal exports and the commercial utilisation of wildlife; the failure of research institutions to seek alternative methods to animal experimentation; and the importance of protecting our and the world's threatened species.  </para><para>On 25 March 1998, the Democrats' Senate motion calling on all State and Territory Governments to ban the cruel and environmentally damaging practice of duck hunting was passed. And, although, the Senate motion was unenforceable, the decision saw a number of states and territories becoming more mindful of their environmental and welfare responsibilities. The Democrats' motion against cattle face branding successfully passed on 7 April 1998. All cattle face branding in Australia ceased soon after. </para><para>In early 1999, 800 cattle died of asphyxiation on a short journey from Darwin to Irian Jaya; again it was the Democrats who raised the issue in the Parliament, resulting in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority undertaking a full investigation into the tragedy.</para><para>Late in 1999, the Senate supported another animal welfare-related Democrats' motion. This time the Democrats called on the Australian Government to protect great apes, ensuring that none would be involved in medical or scientific experimentation or research in Australia. And around a year later, the Senate successfully passed a Democrats' motion calling for the protection of cassowaries and their habitats from destructive land clearing. </para><para>But possibly one of the most significant Democrats' campaigns was the call for a ban on battery cages through the Free Chook campaign, which was organised in collaboration with many animal welfare groups and The Body Shop. When Australian state and territory agricultural ministers met in August 2000, they did not ban the battery cage, ignoring the concerns of the majority of Australians.</para><para>Egg carton labelling was subsequently introduced nationally which, while not perfect, now makes it easier to find those genuine free-range and free-range organic eggs.</para><para>If the political climate and will had been different, a national approach to animal welfare, care, protection and use could have been realised over 10 years ago, possibly around the time of the cessation of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. </para><para>In May 1999, RSPCA National President Dr Hugh Wirth, said, that the RSPCA was dismayed with the Government's attitude towards animal welfare. The RSPCA President continued: “Does the Prime Minister and his coalition give a damn about animal welfare in this country? The Democrats do, and have offered the RSPCA assistance on several occasions, but the RSPCA National Council has resisted the temptation to play politics.”</para><para>The lack of interest in animal welfare at a federal level meant Australia was forced to continue with its hodge-podge of state and territory animal welfare legislation. Changes, progress and review of state and territorial animal welfare legislation have been slow...almost glacial, in fact. It took Queensland 15 years to finalise its amendments to its 75-year-old legislation, and now it has the most progressive legislation in Australia.</para><para>The vagaries of each state's and territory's animal welfare legislation, and its application, make it virtually impossible for there to be any rapid advancements in animal welfare—a situation that could be improved immeasurably through the introduction of a national approach on animal welfare. Diverse and incongruent state and territorial legislation minimise the opportunity for creating binding codes and practices, reduce knowledge-sharing, render comprehensive monitoring impossible, ensure “uniform standards” remain anything but, and put comparative state-by-state reviews out of the question. But the greatest loss perhaps is in the area of statistical gathering, for without this there will never be a national database on animal experimentation, which would enable researchers to share information across institutions and state and territory borders. And neither will it be possible to establish a national tissue bank, which would've allowed for a significant reduction in the number of animals required for medical and scientific research. </para><para>Much is jeopardised for the sake of maintaining state and territorial political and administrative integrity. Despite most states and territories having revised or enacted their respective animal welfare legislation, it largely remains reactive. Emphasis is on punishing acts of cruelty to animals after the event rather than striving to prevent them, which is not surprising considering the age of some of the legislation. </para><para>The ACT's Animal Welfare Act was last updated in 1992, the Northern Territory's in 1999, Tas-man-ia's in 1993, and Western Australia's in 2002. New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, in contrast, developed a Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act; New South Wales' Act is the oldest having been developed in 1979, followed by South Australia in 1985 and Victoria in 1986. Queensland's unique Animal Care and Protection Act was enacted in 2001.</para><para>Individual state and territory legislation is further complicated by the fact that their animal welfare legislation has a large criminal component within it but, strangely, it is the only legislation that is not driven by their respective state or territory police forces. Instead, we see animal welfare legislation largely being enforced by the RSPCA Inspectorate, with some states and territories also granting special constable status to officers within a state Department of Primary Industries or equivalent authority.</para><para>Despite growing community interest and concern for animals, state and territorial governments largely continue to ignore or push aside animal welfare legislation. It is only in recent years that these governments have started to recognise their responsibilities to animals, and that legislation needs to be broader than just enforcement. And enforcement is impossible when little or minimal resources are made available. </para><para>Lack of resources sees the RSPCA Inspectorate currently consists of approximately 75 full-time and 75 honorary or part-time inspectors Australia-wide. This number is absolutely inadequate considering Australia's extraordinarily high number of domestic animals and production livestock, and knowing that Australia is a vast and challenging continent at the best of times—least of all when there are periods of drought and floods or a combination of both. </para><para>Unremittent drought together with the associated economic downturn has put enormous and unbearable pressures on many rural and regional communities in recent times. This has, in turn, had dire consequences for some domestic animals and production livestock. It is obviously difficult to provide food, shelter, comfort and protection in financially impoverished communities. </para><para>And then there is the matter of Australia's live export trade; this industry I believe should never have gotten off the ground. The live export trade has never been appropriately managed, monitored or enforced, and now grows worse with every passing day. The Howard Government's decision to deregulate the industry in 1998 and its establishment of Livecorp, as the industry management body, has only served to exacerbate the industry's problems. </para><para>Livecorp has repeatedly failed to provide and enforce the most basic of animal welfare standards. And it could be argued that Livecorp itself has been complicit in the maiming, torture and unnecessary deaths of thousands of livestock animals annually and, as such, is in breach of many of Australia's state animal welfare laws and animal welfare codes of practice. </para><para>The application and enforcement of animal welfare legislation is vitally important in the protection and care of all animals, whether they are domestic pets or livestock destined for the dinner table. But the application and enforcement, if and when these incidents are reported, does vary significantly. Variation in the application of animal welfare legislation comes down to self-regulating bodies like Livecorp, individual RSPCA inspectors, Department of Primary Industry (DPI) officers and special constables pursuing enforcement in accordance with their own individual state and territorial legislation.</para><para>Clearly there is a need for proactive intervention—and it is the belief of the Australian Democrats that this can only be provided at a national level.</para><para>Commonwealth legislation would ensure consistency, effectiveness and efficiency. For the first time, states and territories would be able to engage in mutually beneficial transactions that would have an immediate impact on Australia's ever expanding international trade and treaties involving domestic animals, livestock and wildlife. Wherever there are inconsistencies, there are unnecessary complications, confusion, duplications and inefficiencies, none of which are conducive to improved productivity and economic growth, as to optimum animal welfare outcomes. </para><para>The Australian Democrats' National Animal Welfare Bill 2003 would provide all those involved with animals and animal by-products a substantial foundation on which to build a workable and flexible approach to animal welfare nationally.</para><para>On a state and territorial level, the Bill would operate concurrently with state and territorial laws, but where the state or territory laws were deemed more stringent by the Commonwealth Minister, those provisions would prevail over those of the Bill.</para><para>In theory, these measures would make it easier for the Bill to leap the procedural and bureaucratic barrier, particularly if support for the establishment of the National Animal Welfare Authority— a regulatory authority with overarching responsibility for the legislation, its application and implication—is forthcoming. </para><para>The Authority should comprise 13 members—all of whom are to be appointed by the Minister. Three members will represent the Commonwealth; 2 members will represent commercial producers or users of animals and animal products (one intensive and one extensive); 2 members will represent animal welfare NGOs; 2 members will represent community groups; and 4 other members, of which 2 will be scientists; and 1 an animal ethicist.</para><para>The functions and powers of the National Animal Welfare Authority are:</para><para>(a)	the coordination, monitoring and review of Commonwealth responsibilities for animal welfare;</para><para>(b)	functions and powers conferred on it by or under the Act;</para><para>(c)	functions and powers conferred on it by or under other laws of the Commonwealth;</para><para>(d)	functions and powers that are, with the consent of the Ministerial Council, conferred on the Authority by writing signed by the Minister.</para><para>It would also have the power to “do whatever is necessary for, or in connection with, or reasonably incidental to, the performance of its functions” but it must perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with the Agreement, and is to comply in all aspects with the provisions of that Agreement. As is appropriate for the success of such an Authority, it would have far-reaching functions and powers.</para><para>The most invaluable undertaking of the Authority would be the appointment of national animal inspectors, many of whom would be drawn from the existing RSPCA inspectorate and the officers within the various Departments of Agriculture and Primary Industries, and organisations external to these entities, such as Animal Liberation. The appointment of animal inspectors, with functions and powers that go across state and territorial borders, ensures the Bill is not a toothless tiger. Each and every one of the inspectors would have the means by which they could circumvent out-of-date and irrelevant legal obstacles. The focus of the Bill, the Authority and the inspectors is animals—their welfare, protection and rights.</para><para>Authority inspectors require the following powers and need to exercise these powers to fulfil the requirements under the Act: </para><para>(1)	inspectors may undertake random inspections of animals;</para><para>(2)	a person with an animal in their care must permit inspection of the animal as well as of housing, foodstuffs and equipment intended for use with the animal;</para><para>(3)	the animal keeper must be advised of the inspection before or on the occasion of the visit;</para><para>(4)	an inspector may:</para><para>(a)	inform the animal keeper that he or she has 12 hours in which to take action or their animals will be seized; or</para><para>(b)	immediately seize animals; or</para><para>(c)	humanely kill an animal, or take any other necessary steps to relieve an animal from suffering; or  </para><para>(d)	administer analgesics to animals.</para><para>Animals used for scientific, educational and research purposes, for example, would benefit greatly from a proactive national approach to animal welfare. Community concerns for animals used in this area are on the increase with the expansion of biotechnology research, and it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth to address these concerns. But aside from the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) Animal Welfare Code of Conduct, which is only applicable to NHMRC funded projects, there is currently no means by which animals subjected to such use can be readily managed, monitored and reviewed on a national scale. </para><para>The Australian Democrats' National Animal Welfare Bill 2003 emphasises the monitoring of all animals used for scientific, educational and research purposes, irrespective of how the research is funded. Much would be achieved by extending the application of the NHMRC's Animal Welfare Code of Conduct—including meeting many of the community's concerns about the issues of transparency and accountability in research and experimentation. </para><para>Currently, much of the research involving animals used for scientific and research purposes, falls under the `commercial in confidence' category, which denies the community the opportunity to scrutinise the processes and practices employed. The Australian Democrats' National Animal Welfare Bill 2003 seeks to address this and other issues and provides an appropriate legislative framework for investigating and dealing with this and other animal welfare issues at a national level. </para><para>The Bill gives consideration to breach of duty of care, cruelty offences, prohibited conduct (including unreasonable abandonment, prohibited release, baits or harmful substances, and debarking operations), prohibited events (such as cockfights and dogfights), regulated conduct (such as obligation to exercise closely confined dogs, and animals used to feed another animal), live exports (including a limit on live exports, duties of the veterinary surgeons and liability), import of animal products, labelling of animal products, animals used for experimental purposes (including establishment of a data bank, licences, acquisition of animals for research and pain management), funding for animal research, and the administrative provisions relating to the Authority administration and staff. </para><para>The legislation seeks to establish a databank of all experiments using animals carried out in both Australia and overseas, and another dedicated to alternatives to animal research and experimentation.</para><para>This legislation is about recognising the importance, contribution and sacrifice of animals; we, as humans, rely on animals and their products for survival and profit. We are beholden to them, just as they are to us, but unlike animals, humans are in a position of power and influence. Let's use that power and influence wisely. Let's provide animals with greater protection and care for the duration of their lives. </para><para>The successful passage of the Australian Democrats' legislation would demonstrate to the Australian community and our international trading partners that this country and its peoples are committed to meeting community expectations and market obligations in relation to animal welfare issues.</para><para>In the 21st Century, this country's values and our collective community conscience demand better welfare, care, protection and rights for all animals. </para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HUMAN RIGHTS: BURMA</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>12991</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (4.01 p.m.)—by leave—I move the motion as amended:</para><para>That the Senate—</para><quote><para>	(a)	notes the ongoing imprisonment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to urgently increase pressure on the military regime in Burma to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and to restore democracy; and </para><para>	(b)	calls on the Government:</para><para>	(i)	to amend its policy of `constructive engagement' with the current State Peace and Democracy Council (SPDC) regime in light of ongoing human rights abuses, and</para><para>	(ii)	to consider targeted sanctions against members of the SPDC regime, including restrictions on their international financial transactions, a freeze on assets overseas, and travel restrictions against senior members of the regime travelling to Australia.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>12991</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (4.02 p.m.)—by leave—I move the motion as amended:</para><para>That the Senate—</para><quote><para>	(a)	notes:</para><para>	(i)	the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> investigation into the planned field trials of a genetically-modified herpes virus to sterilise mice and thereby reduce their numbers,</para><para>	(ii)	that the mouse plague of 1993, which affected much of Victoria and South Australia, cost in the vicinity of $65 million in lost rural production,</para><para>	(iii)	that mouse plagues often follow drought cycles, placing an extra burden on grain growers and users as they are trying to rebuild after drought, and</para><para>	(iv)	that earlier this year, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) advised that the Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus which had been under experimentation by the CSIRO had escaped from CSIRO research facilities in Canberra, and further, that the CSIRO is unsure how and when the virus entered and escaped its facilities; and</para><para>	(b)	calls on the Government not to release genetically-modified materials to sterilise pest species until the Parliament can be assured that other species, including native fauna and Australia's human and livestock populations, are safe from their effects, and to ensure that research quarantine breaches such as that which occurred with Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus at the CSIRO will not happen again.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PAN PHARMACEUTICALS LTD</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>12991</page.no></debateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (4.02 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Senate calls on the Government to implement urgent measures to assist the complementary healthcare industry to recover from the effects of the Pan Pharmaceuticals affair, including streamlining of approvals to replace products.</para></motion><para>Question put.</para><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator A.B.

The main areas of concern identified in the report are:</para><para>·	the failure of the Commonwealth, States, Territories and the non-government sector to reach agreement on the Disability Standards for Education (the Standards) under the Commonwealth's Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (the DDA); and</para><para>·	that because of inadequacies in university teacher training courses and limited professional development opportunities, many regular classroom teachers do not have the skills or confidence to involve students with disabilities in the full curriculum.</para><para>The Senate Committee made a number of recommendations relating to these issues which together with the other recommendations in the report have been considered fully by the Government in formulating this response.</para><para>The Government has been a driving force in developing draft Standards and welcomes the Committee's call for their finalisation. It is committed to improving the education and training outcomes for all students and people with a disability and ensuring maximum compliance with the DDA.</para><para>The Government is working closely with education providers and stakeholders to address outstanding legal and financial issues associated with the draft Standards with a view to achieving agreement to their implementation.</para><para>Overall, the Government considers that many of the recommendations should be pursued, particularly those concerning definitional issues, issues relating to teacher training and development and the provision of services for school students with disabilities living in rural or remote areas. While these matters are not ones for which the Commonwealth has direct responsibility or could act on alone, the Government undertakes to work with the States and Territories to achieve a more consistent and focussed approach to supporting students with disabilities across jurisdictions, particularly in the school sector. This reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to this group of students. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">School education </inline></para><para>In the school sector, improving the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, including students with disabilities, is a major priority of the Government. The Government makes a significant financial contribution to States and Territories through the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 (the SGA) to assist government and non-government schools to achieve this purpose.</para><para>Commonwealth funding for school students with disabilities is provided primarily through a combination of General Recurrent Grants, the principal source of Commonwealth funding for all students, and additional targeted assistance under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes (SAISO) Programme which education authorities may use to improve outcomes for educationally disadvantaged students, including students with disabilities. The Government is providing $1.4 billion under the SAISO programme over the 2001-2004 quadrennium and in the 2003-04 Budget announced some $172.3 million over the next four years to continue funding at existing levels. State and Territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for the detailed administration of the SAISO programme in their systems and schools, including the quantum of funding allocated to support students with disabilities.</para><para>In addition, the Government is providing approximately $100 million over 2001-2004 under the Special Education—Non-government Centre Support Programme for non-government centres that provide services to improve the educational opportunities, learning outcomes and personal development of children with disabilities. Funding is targeted to a range of purposes including supporting learning and educational development for below-school-age children (0-6), improving school-age children's access to educational programmes and assisting children with disabilities in residential care. </para><para>The Quality Outcomes Programme (QOP) and the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects (NLNSP) Programme support strategic and collaborative initiatives to further the Government's agenda for schools.</para><para>·	The Quality Teacher Programme (QTP) component of QOP, is a key element of Teachers for the 21st Century which is the Government's initiative to improve teacher quality and increase the number of highly effective schools. The programme has been extended until June 2005 bringing the Government's commitment under the programme to $159.2 million. The QTP provides for teachers in disadvantaged schools, as well as other teacher target groups.</para><para>·	In 2002, the Government announced a major initiative to be funded under the NLNSP programme that will focus on more effective teaching and learning practices for students with disabilities and learning difficulties. Funding of $4.5 million will be provided for projects at the national and State levels. The initiative, which will build on recent research projects which have explored issues relating to students with specific educational needs, is currently being implemented. Projects that focus on “what works”, that is, effective classroom practice are being given priority.</para><para>Commonwealth funding for the non-government school sector</para><para>Chapter 7 of the Senate Committee's report includes a discussion of arguments put by the National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC) and the National Council of Independent Schools' Associations (NCISA) for revised funding arrangements to support the education of students with disabilities in the Catholic and independent sectors respectively. The Committee noted that implementation of the proposed funding models would result in significant funding increases to the non-government sector.</para><para>Appendix 6 of the report contains an analysis of the total resourcing for non-government schools. Based on estimates of enrolments and projected levels of total income for the Catholic and independent sectors compared with the recurrent costs of educating an equivalent number of students in government schools, the Senate Committee extrapolated that the Catholic and independent sectors will, in 2004, have a level of total income some 11.7% and 7.8% respectively above the resourcing of a comparable number of government school students. (A Corrigendum issued by the Senate Committee revised these figures to 15.2% and 52.2% respectively).  </para><para>The Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) has examined Appendix 6 and considers that its conclusions are based on a methodology that is significantly flawed. In particular:</para><para>·	the private and state government income for the Catholic and independent sectors has been understated;</para><para>·	figures on total income (Commonwealth, state government and private) for the non-government sector and the government sector are not compiled on a completely comparable basis, in particular, the total income for the non-government sector includes capital funds which is not included in the income for the government sector;</para><para>·	private income to government schools, although modest, has not been included in the figures for the government sector;</para><para>·	supplementation estimates used in calculating the 2001-2004 government funding are conservative; and</para><para>·	the enrolment estimates used were not the latest available at the time. </para><para>Using the underlying methodology in Appendix 6, adjusted for the above factors, DEST estimates that, in 2004, the independent sector will receive total recurrent funding from all sources on par with the government sector, while the Catholic sector will be funded at a level some 20% below the government sector. </para><para>While the DEST analysis presents a very different picture to that in the Senate Committee's report, the Government does not accept that this necessarily lends support to claims for additional Commonwealth funding to be provided to the non-government sector for students with disabilities. </para><para>Nevertheless, the Government acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Catholic and independent sectors in relation to the Senate Committee's comments about the income available to their respective sectors and the sectors' capacity to adequately address the needs of students with disabilities. The sectors will have an opportunity to raise issues relating to Commonwealth funding for students with disabilities in non-government schools in the context of planning for the 2005-08 quadrennium.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Post-school education and training</inline></para><para>In 2000, the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) agreed to Bridging Pathways, a national strategy and blueprint for 2000-2005 with the aim of increasing opportunities for people with disabilities in vocational education and training (VET). The Government has provided $2 million to ANTA for national actions outlined in the Disability Blueprint. Funds have also been provided for ANTA to manage the Commonwealth's Equity Development and Training Innovation Programme which is being used to achieve the outcomes of the Blueprint.</para><para>In addition, the Government funds a range of initiatives to improve access by people with disabilities in VET. These include the Disabled Apprenticeship Wage Support Programme which provides weekly wage support to employers who take on an apprentice with a disability and the New Apprenticeships Access Programme which is designed to assist job seekers, including people with disabilities, who experience barriers to skilled employment. As part of the Australians Working Together package announced in 2001, the Government is providing</para><para>$28.2 million over three years from 2002 to increase participation by people with disabilities in mainstream VET and to improve service coordination. This includes $3.7 million to establish a Disability Coordination Officer (DCO) Programme to assist people with disabilities move between school, VET, higher education and employment, and to succeed in their chosen studies. The programme, which commenced in July 2002, is aimed at increasing the awareness of post-school options, supports and services available for people with a disability, their families and support networks.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government provides the bulk of public funding for universities which are responsible for ensuring that higher education is accessible to people from all equity groups, including students with disabilities, and that these students receive a quality education. Universities are required to report to the Commonwealth as part of accountability arrangements. </para><para>In 2003, the Government is providing $6 million in supplementary funding under the Higher Education Equity Programme (HEEP) to encourage universities to undertake strategies aimed at increasing the participation of higher education students from equity groups, including students with disabilities. As part of the Backing Australia's Future initiatives announced in the 2003-04 Budget, additional funding of $2.3 million per annum will be provided through HEEP from 2005. </para><para>The Regional Disability Liaison Officer (RDLO) Programme, which is funded under HEEP, provides practical support and assistance to students with disabilities making the transition from school to university or TAFE and then on to employment.</para><para>Supplementary funding has also been provided under the Additional Support for Students with Disabilities Programme (ASSDP) to assist universities with the costs of providing high-cost support, such as specialist services or equipment, to the growing number of students with disabilities who are participating in higher education. In the Backing Australia's Future package, funding for this programme has been increased by $1.1 million per annum from 2005, which will take the total funding to $4.1 million per annum.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to recommendations in the report</inline></para><para>The Government's response to each of the recommendations contained in the Senate Committee's report is set out below. Seven of the recommendations propose that action should be taken under the auspices of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). The Government will formally refer these recommendations to MCEETYA, or, where considered more appropriate, to school education authorities and/or peak bodies in the higher education sector. In addition, the Government will refer a number of the other recommendations in the report to relevant bodies for consideration. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>Within a reasonable period, all teacher aides working with students with disabilities should be qualified in special education from an accredited teacher aide training course, and that this should be a condition of additional Commonwealth funding for disability education.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government supports, in principle, training programmes for teacher aides. Accredited training courses for teacher aides represents one means of producing a more knowledgeable and skilled pool of people to support teachers in the classroom.</para><para>State and Territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for the employment of school staff and for determining the qualification required for different categories of staff. Accordingly, the Government will refer the first part of the recommendation to the heads of education departments in each State and Territory, the NCEC and the Independent Schools Council of Australia (ISCA), formerly known as NCISA, for consideration.</para><para>The Government does not support the second part of the recommendation to impose a condition on Commonwealth funding for special education linked to reporting about teacher aide qualifications as this runs counter to the emphasis on student outcomes which has become a key feature of Commonwealth programmes and State-Commonwealth relations in school education.</para><para>Under the SGA, all State and Territory education authorities are required, as a condition of funding, to commit to the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century and achieve any performance measures, including targets, incorporated in the SGA. The Government will continue to support the development and implementation of comparable performance measurement and reporting for students with disabilities through MCEETYA. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>The Commonwealth should commission a study to develop a best practice funding model to support the needs of students with disabilities in schools.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government is providing $1.4 billion over the 2001-2004 quadrennium to school education authorities under the SAISO programme to provide for educationally disadvantaged students. In the 2003-04 Budget, the Government announced some $172.3 million over the next four years to continue funding at existing levels. </para><para>A significant portion of the money provided under the SAISO programme is used by school education authorities to provide additional support for students with disabilities. Moreover, Commonwealth targeted funding is only one source of assistance available to education authorities to provide for educationally disadvantaged students and constitutes a small component of the total resources used to support them.</para><para>The allocation of funding to support the needs of students with disabilities in schools is the responsibility of State and Territory government and non-government school education authorities. While recognising this, the Government believes that processes used by jurisdictions to distribute assistance for students with disabilities should maximise the effectiveness of this assistance for those students most in need of additional assistance and to improve student outcomes. </para><para>The range of models in place across jurisdictions to allocate support to schools reflect the diversity of influences and issues that education authorities must take into account in providing support for this very heterogenous group of students, not least the available resources within a sector to support these students.</para><para>Given the above, the Government believes that the appropriate course of action would be for State and Territory government and non-government education authorities to consider whether a study that informs improvements in the processes used by jurisdictions to distribute assistance for students with disabilities should be undertaken. The Government will therefore refer the matter to MCEETYA for consideration.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>MCEETYA should develop nationally agreed definitions of disabilities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government acknowledges that the lack of consistency in the definitions of disability across jurisdictions has implications for the allocation of resources and therefore for individual students and their families as well. In addition, lack of consistency affects the capacity to monitor the outcomes of students with disabilities at a national level.</para><para>With regard to funding for students with disabilities, there are two elements—firstly, which students are accepted as having a disability, which triggers the possibility of additional support and, secondly, how the levels of additional support provided for these students are determined. The two issues are linked in that the provision of additional support is contingent upon an assessment of the existence of a particular impairment and the extent of that impairment. Differences in the levels of support provided for students with disabilities are due mainly to differences in the criteria used to assess a student's impairment and the resources available to the education system or school to provide additional support for students with disabilities.</para><para>It would be appropriate for MCEETYA to consider the extent to which States and sectors might be prepared to work towards adopting a more uniform approach to defining disability and assessing student needs.</para><para>With regard to the reporting of educational outcomes for students with disabilities, the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century provides the framework for nationally comparable reporting of educational outcomes for all students. The intention is that performance information should be disaggregated by various sub-groups in the student population, including students with disabilities. A nationally agreed definition that can be applied uniformly is needed before comparable data on the educational outcomes of students with disabilities can be collected. </para><para>As noted in the report, the MCEETYA Performance Measurement and Reporting Taskforce (PMRT) has commissioned a project to identify definitional issues relevant to nationally comparable reporting of educational outcomes of students with disabilities. The PMRT's objective is to develop a definition of “students with disabilities” as opposed to a definition of “disabilities” as set out in the recommendation. There are major conceptual and practical issues that need to be addressed in seeking to develop a common definition for reporting purposes, and the process is not a simple one.  </para><para>The Government will refer the recommendation to MCEETYA for consideration.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>MCEETYA should investigate the development of teacher exchange programs for staff of `lighthouse' special schools and mainstream schools.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government considers that this recommendation is worth exploring. Programmes of the type proposed have the potential to improve the quality of the teaching workforce, particularly teachers in mainstream schools. They could provide a useful mechanism for teachers in the various educational settings to develop closer links and collaboration and for systems to make better use of available expertise.</para><para>Arrangements of the kind proposed are primarily the responsibility of State and Territory government and non-government education authorities who employ teachers. These authorities are best placed to develop exchange programmes to address the needs in individual jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Government considers that this is a matter more appropriate for State and Territory education authorities than for MCEETYA.</para><para>The Government supports the thrust of this recommendation and will refer it to the heads of education departments in each State and Territory, the NCEC and the ISCA for consideration. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>MCEETYA should commission an assessment of the outcomes of inclusive policies for students with disabilities; and devise implementation and professional development strategies for teachers and school administrators to improve these outcomes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>MCEETYA should develop a policy on inclusive education that recognises the importance of having a range of schooling options for students with disabilities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>With regard to the proposal to assess the outcomes of inclusive policies for students with disabilities, the Government believes that, until such time as reliable performance outcomes data are available for this group of students (currently under investigation through MCEETYA), any broad-level study to investigate the benefits or otherwise of inclusion versus non-inclusion is unlikely to provide useful information.</para><para>The development and implementation of professional learning strategies that may flow from such a study would be best undertaken by State and Territory government and non-government school education authorities in consultation with their teachers in order to meet the individual needs of their student communities. The Commonwealth could support that process through its QTP.</para><para>The recommendation to develop a national policy on inclusive education needs to be viewed in the context of the fact that individual school authorities already recognise the importance of having a range of schooling options for students with disabilities.</para><para>Notwithstanding these concerns, the proposals contained in the recommendations are matters which should be considered by MCEETYA. The Government will refer them to MCEETYA for consideration.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>Subject to assessment under Australian trials currently being conducted, routine screening of the hearing of all Australian newborn children should be adopted. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The screening for newborn children is a responsibility of State and Territory governments.</para><para>The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) report, Child Health Screening and Surveillance: A Critical Review of the Evidence 2002, recommended that “Hearing screening before discharge for all neonatal intensive care unit neonates, and preferably all neonates admitted to special care nurseries for more than 48 hours, is now accepted best practice and should become a high priority at State level.”  </para><para>The Australian Health Ministers have requested the Medical Services Advisory Committee to undertake a full health technology assessment, including cost effectiveness of a universal neo-natal hearing screening.</para><para>In addition, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing is working closely with States and Territories to progress the findings and issues raised by the NHMRC report. </para><para>Except for Queensland and Tasmania, all States and Territories have implemented or are planning to introduce universal newborn hearing screening programmes, at least in a pilot form.</para><para>The Government supports, in principle, routine screening of hearing of all newborn children and will refer the recommendation to State and Territory departments of health for consideration. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>MCEETYA should examine options to re-introduce some form of regular screening for sensory impairment for school and pre-school age children, either within schools or as part of community health and immunisation programs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>Under the Australian Health Care Agreements, service delivery for community child health screening and surveillance are a State and Territory government responsibility.

It is expected that DEST will participate in this process.</para><para>Support for screening for hearing impairment in the pre-school period has received varied support generally but is strongly supported for Aboriginal children. The Systematic Review of Existing Evidence and Primary Care Guidelines on the Management of Otitis Media in Aboriginal Populations (March 2001) recommends routine screening for otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants both opportunistically and during well baby clinics. The hearing health of older children falls appropriately within the realm of jurisdictional health service provision in collaboration with schools and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health organisations. </para><para>As a result of the findings of the Report on Commonwealth Funded Hearing Services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples: Strategies for Future Action, the Office of Hearing Services is developing options for lowering the eligibility age for Indigenous Australians to access the Commonwealth Hearing Services Program. The OHS is also considering how to streamline access to the Commonwealth Hearing Services Program for Indigenous Australians and is working with Australian Hearing to simplify the processes required.</para><para>In 1998, the Government funded the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Eye Health Program which seeks to increase the capacity of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in eye health. The programme is based on a regional model of eye health service delivery focusing on increasing access to eye health services (particularly specialist support) in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care settings.

The projects, which involve an alliance of education, industry and Commonwealth Employment Placement and Training agencies, have identified a range of models that can be incorporated into mainstream structured learning programmes. These projects will continue to be funded under existing Structured Workplace Learning (SWL) contractual arrangements, following the 2003-04 Budget decision which will result in the transfer of all SWL programme functions from ECEF to DEST. </para><para>In addition, the Government is providing $3.7 million over three years under the DCO programme to assist people with disabilities move between school, VET, higher education and employment, and to succeed in their chosen studies.

For the needs of rural students with disabilities to be better addressed a more holistic, co-ordinated, cross-government approach should be adopted, including health and community services. The Government acknowledges the need for this approach in developing policy directions in a number of areas. </para><para>In 2001, MCEETYA published a report on Demand and Supply of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Australia which found that there were ongoing recruitment difficulties in a number of specialist areas including for schools in rural and remote regions.

The Review of Teaching and Teacher Education, for example, is currently investigating how talented people are attracted to teaching as a career.</para><para>The Government is aware that the integration of students with disabilities into mainstream schools in recent years has meant significant changes for many teachers. In addition, more rigorous curriculum requirements, increased parental expectations, the need to manage students from a wide range of social and cultural backgrounds and problems with teacher morale have increased pressure on all members of the teaching profession. </para><para>However, as responsibility for determining the specific roles and responsibilities and employment conditions of teachers rests with State and Territory government and non-government school education authorities, the Government believes that it would be more appropriate for any work which examines the changing roles and responsibilities of specialist teachers in a detailed way should be undertaken at the level of individual jurisdictions.</para><para>Accordingly, the Government will refer the recommendation to the heads of education departments in each State and Territory, the NCEC and the ISCA for consideration.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>The Department of Education, Science and Training should explore options for the establishment of a scheme designed to assist students with disabilities to purchase assistive equipment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The issue of providing assistance equipment to support the education of students with disabilities is discussed in Chapter 6 of the Senate Committee's report relating to post-secondary education. Given this, the recommendation has been interpreted to relate to students with disabilities in both VET and higher education, but not schools. </para><para>State and Territory training authorities have responsibility for the delivery of VET, including any assistance to individual students. The Commonwealth is providing $24.4 million over 3 years from July 2002 under the Australians Working Together package to increase participation by people with disabilities in mainstream VET.

This draft, and the respective positions of the parties, was considered by the Australian Education Systems Officials Committee (AESOC) at its meeting on 21 February 2003. Following a further request from AESOC, the draft Standards have been slightly amended to better reflect the relationship between some key concepts. This version of the Standards will be considered by MCEETYA at its meeting on 10-11 July 2003. </para><para>While there was broad support for the Standards at the AESOC meeting, the support of a number of jurisdictions and stakeholders was subject to the finalisation of the Regulation Impact Statement (RIS), particularly in terms of a quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits of introducing the Standards. AESOC agreed that the draft Standards would be used as a basis for an independent analysis of the costs and benefits arising from compliance with the Standards over and above the costs of compliance with the DDA. In line with the Government's position that any further work on the costs of implementing the Standards should be independent, robust and transparent, it commissioned a consultant to undertake the cost-benefit analysis, with a view to drawing upon its outcomes to complete the RIS. This matter is discussed further in the response to recommendation 18.</para><para>The major purpose of the Standards is to provide greater clarity of rights and obligations current under the DDA. The draft Standards would vary the operation of the DDA in three areas by extending the defence of unjustifiable hardship beyond the point of enrolment to include other areas of the Standards, by including, in the definition of “education provider”, “bodies whose purpose is the development and accreditation of curricula, training packages or courses” (including statutory authorities), and by broadening the scope of the harassment and victimisation provisions. The Government has received legal advice that the Standards are able to validly alter the operation of the DDA in the ways set out above. However, to put these matters beyond doubt, it will consider the need for any minor amendments to the DDA as part of the implementation of the Standards. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 18</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>Commonwealth, state and territory governments should share the cost of implementing the education standards. MCEETYA is the appropriate forum to determine the extent that these costs should be shared.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response </inline></para><para>In relation to the implementation of the Standards, the Government is aware of the concerns of stakeholders including those of the non-government school sector regarding potential costs to school communities in terms of ensuring access to facilities and supporting the specific educational needs of individual students with a disability. It should be noted that the Standards would only require education providers to take reasonable steps and to make reasonable adjustments. In addition, the Standards seek to extend the `unjustifiable hardship' provision beyond the point of enrolment (as under the DDA) to also apply to the areas of participation; curriculum development, accreditation and delivery; students support services; and elimination of harassment and victimisation. This provision has the potential to minimise costs for providers.  </para><para>As the draft Standards would clarify rights and obligations under the DDA in the area of education and would not alter the definition of `disability', the Government believes that the implementation of the Standards should not involve significant costs for education and training providers who already comply with the DDA. </para><para>The draft RIS, prepared in 2002, included cost estimates provided by a number of state jurisdictions, based on the assumption that 18 per cent of school students would fall within the DDA definition of `disability'. There is no substantiated evidence for this assumption. (State and Territory jurisdictions and the non-government sector currently identify 3.4 per cent of the overall school student cohort as students with disabilities for support under the SAISO programme). As the Standards would not change the definition of `disability', there should not be an increase in the cohort of students with disabilities, and adjustments beyond current provisions would not be required.</para><para>The cost-benefit analysis mentioned in the response to recommendation 17 takes account of both quantitative and qualitative data provided by education providers and stakeholders as well as relevant research and supporting information. In preparing their report, the consultants estimated costs and benefits for each of the areas of the Standards (enrolment; participation, curriculum development, accreditation and delivery; student support services; and elimination of harassment and victimisation), and addressed a number of conceptual challenges in assessing the reasonable marginal costs of the Standards over and above the costs of compliance with the DDA.</para><para>In undertaking their analysis the consultants found that as the definition of disability applying to the Standards is identical with that underpinning the DDA, there is no validity in the assumed increase in the size of the cohort of students with disabilities. They also found that many providers attributed to the Standards, costs that should be attributed to compliance with the DDA. Key outcomes of the study are that:</para><para>·	the net impact of the Standards would be positive with the overall benefits of the Standards exceeding the costs;</para><para>·	professional development to support the introduction of the Standards is a reasonable cost attributable to the Standards; and</para><para>·	the principal impact of the Standards would be to provide increased clarity for education providers as to their obligations under the DDA and for students with disabilities as to their entitlements under the DDA. </para><para>The Government has referred the findings of the independent cost-benefit analysis to MCEETYA for consideration at its meeting on 10-11 July 2003.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 19</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>The conditions on which financial assistance is paid to state and territory education authorities, and the supporting guidelines for quadrennial funding, should be strengthened to include reporting processes that ensure that Commonwealth funds for students with disabilities are spent on students with disabilities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>A key priority for the Commonwealth is to drive improvement in learning outcomes through better accountability and reporting. The National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century provide the framework for nationally comparable reporting of the outcomes of schooling. The MCEETYA Performance Measurement and Reporting Taskforce (PMRT) is responsible for developing and implementing measures in priority areas identified by Ministers. In relation to literacy and numeracy, minimum standards (benchmarks) for Years 3, 5 and 7 have been agreed by Ministers and students are being tested at these year levels using existing State tests.</para><para>Under the SGA, the States and Territories are required to commit to achieving performance targets and measures and to report against these measures through the Annual National Report on Schooling.</para><para>Currently, some States/Territories report an individual student's national literacy and numeracy benchmark results to his/her parents. The Commonwealth is committed to securing State and Territory reporting to all parents of their child's skills in literacy and numeracy against national standards. </para><para>It has also been agreed that performance information should be disaggregated by various sub-groups in the student population, including students with disabilities. Before educational outcomes for students with disabilities could be reported on a nationally comparable basis, an agreed definition for students with disabilities for reporting purposes is required. The PMRT has commissioned a project to examine the feasibility of developing such a definition.</para><para>Given these developments, the Government believes that the way forward is not to impose input reporting requirements but to continue with work to develop comparable performance measurement and reporting in relation to students with disabilities, which would provide an indication of the effectiveness of the targeted funding for students with disabilities. </para><para>The Government believes that strengthening the financial accountability for Commonwealth funding in the way proposed by the Committee would significantly increase the reporting burden on schools and systems for questionable benefit. It would be possible to require schools and systems to report annually on the expenditure of Commonwealth grants for students with disabilities. However, the reporting process would be burdensome for the schools and systems. It would also present a number of practical difficulties, for example, in estimating what proportion of literacy funding at school level has benefited students with disabilities, or identifying what proportion of total funding supporting students with disabilities was provided by the Commonwealth. </para><para>Furthermore, the recommendation runs counter to the broadbanding provisions of the States Grants schools' legislation. It is questionable whether the reimposition of input reporting requirements would assist in ensuring “that Commonwealth funds are being used as Parliament intended” (paragraph 7.54 in the report), given that broadbanding of funds under the SAISO programme is an integral part of the legislation which Parliament passed in 2000. A requirement that schools report to the Commonwealth on expenditure for one specified purpose runs counter to the spirit of operational flexibility contained in the legislation. </para><para>For the reasons outlined above, the Government does not support this recommendation.</para><para>This response is available in electronic form at: http://www.dest.gov.au/edu/gen_ed_pubs.htm </para><para>—————</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT LEGISLATION COMMITTEE Report on the AUSTRALIAN MEAT INDUSTRY CONSULTATIVE STRUCTURE AND QUOTA ALLOCATION</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline></para><para>On 27 June 2002 the following matters were referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry:</para><para>(a)	The performance and appropriateness of the existing government advisory structures in the Australian meat industry; and</para><para>(b)	The most effective arrangements for the allocation of export quotas for Australian meat, both to the United States and Europe.</para><para>The Committee received submissions and heard evidence from interested parties and presented its report in two stages. The first report on the allocation of the US beef quota was tabled in the Senate on 24 September 2002 and the second report on the existing government advisory structures in the Australian meat industry was tabled on 12 December 2002.</para><para>The Government response to both reports is as follows.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">FIRST REPORT: Allocation of the US Beef Quota</inline></para><para>Recommendation 1. The Committee recommends that the following model be adopted as an ongoing model for the allocation of United States beef quota to exporters:</para><para>(a)	Quota to accrue to the company or group of companies and not to the establishment;</para><para>(b)	Company performance to determine quota entitlement rather than shipper or processor of record;</para><para>(c)	The first allocation of quota to a company to be on 1 November, based on the exports for the entire previous shipping year; </para><para>(d)	Quota to be allocated in three equal tranches, ie on 1 November, 1 March and 1 July, with the allocation of each tranche being based on performance over the preceding 12 month rolling period;</para><para>(e)	Both performance and entitlement to be tradeable;</para><para>(f)	Companies to assure AFFA by 1 September each year that their entitlement will be utilised;</para><para>(g)	Where a company cannot use their entitlement, any unused entitlement to be returned by 1 September to a quota pool for re-allocation;</para><para>(h)	Re-allocation of unused quota to be consistent with the EU high quality beef quota scheme;</para><para>(i)	Where a company has failed to notify AFFA and failed to use its quota entitlement, the amount not used in a shipping year will be debited from that company's account in the following shipping year.</para><para>Recommendation 2. The Committee recommends the following transition provisions:</para><para>(a)	As a transition provision for 2003, those companies who were more than 70% reliant on the US market in export year 2001, be allocated the equivalent of their total 2002 US quota allocation, ie their initial allocation and any discretionary allocation that the company may have received;</para><para>(b)	The remainder of the 2003 US beef quota tonnage be allocated on a global basis;</para><para>(c)	As a transition provision in 2004, companies who remain more than 70% reliant on the US market in 2003, the 2004 allocation be 85% of the 2003 allocation;</para><para>(d)	The remainder of the 2004 US beef quota tonnage be allocated on a global basis.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 1(e) is accepted in part but all other sub-sections of Recommendations 1 and 2 have not been accepted. The Government has accepted the model recommended by the independent Quota Management Panel that was set up to advise on quota allocation arrangements for 2003 and beyond. The components that have been adopted by the 80:20 US-Inclusive Model are:</para><para>·	Allocation will be based on shipper of record.</para><para>·	Allocation formula will be 80% US:20% global including US.</para><para>·	Over-quota shipments in 2002 as part of the 378,214 tonne TRQ have been counted towards the granting of quota. However, out of quota shipments will not be counted towards the granting of quota in 2003 or in future years (except where it contributes to the global component of quota entitlement calculations).</para><para>·	Quota allocation will be calculated on a three year rolling average based on the previous shipping year (1 November to 31 October). In 2003, the allocation will be based on the average of 2001 and 2002. In 2004, the allocation will be based on the average of 2001, 2002 and 2003. From then on, quota allocation will be based on the three year rolling average.</para><para>·	As a special “one-off” measure for 2003, 15,000 tonnes of quota will be set aside as a discretionary provision for exporters adversely affected by the change from “processor of record” to “shipper of record” or by abnormal events in the base years.</para><para>·	Quota will be transferable, except for those related to discretionary quota.</para><para>·	Where allocation is made to a shipper of record, the shipper needs to hold a meat export licence issued under section 10 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997.</para><para>Recommendation 3. The Committee further recommends that a review of the necessity for the transition provisions be undertaken within 18 months.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 3 is accepted in principle with the timing for the formal review of the allocation system to be undertaken in 2005. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CONCLUSION</inline></para><para>The Government has not accepted the majority of the Senate Committee recommendations. The Government believes that commercial considerations should drive the establishment of new markets, rather than Government imposed quota allocation systems. A 100% global model would have the effect of forcing costly market diversification practices on certain sectors of the industry and artificially distorting price signals and market forces. In particular, the adoption of the 100% global model would significantly shift quota away from companies that have built a market share in the US and reallocate it to globally oriented companies. A significant number of smaller and mid-sized regional abattoirs with a heavy dependence on the US market would have been particularly affected by this change.  </para><para>The Government believes the 80:20 Model recommended by the independent Quota Management Panel and implemented from 1 January 2003 to be the most efficient, fair, equitable and transparent system to administer. Industry has generally accepted the 80:20 Model.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SECOND REPORT: Existing government advisory structures in the Australian meat industry</inline></para><para>Recommendation 1. The Committee recommends that the Minister initiate discussions with the signatories to the MOU concerning reformed advisory arrangements. The Committee recommends that following these negotiations the Minister engage in detailed and open consultation with all sections of the Australian meat industry on options for a reformed or alternative industry advisory structure.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 1 is accepted. The Government is aware that industry is considering the Committee's report and has written to industry participants seeking their views on the arrangements. As a signatory to the MOU the Government is willing to participate in industry discussions on options for reform, and to consider views put to it by industry participants. The Government notes nonetheless that the main impetus for change should necessarily come from industry given the principles of industry ownership and self-determination underpinning the existing institutional arrangements. </para><para>Recommendation 2. The Committee recommends that any new advisory body established for the Australian meat industry be empowered to initiate advice to the Minister. Notwithstanding this, individual industry participants, whether represented on the advisory body or not, must retain the right to make representations to the Minister on any matter of concern.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 2 is accepted. All sectors of the industry are currently free to approach the Government on any matters of concern.</para><para>Recommendation 3. The Committee recommends that any organisations appointed by the Minister to the list of Prescribed Industry Bodies be eligible for appointment to the industry advisory body, and that the view of existing advisory body members should not necessarily determine the success of the appointment or membership of the advisory body.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 3 is accepted. All parties appointed by the Minister to the list of Prescribed Industry Bodies are presently eligible for appointment to the industry advisory body. The Government, however, is not able to insist that an eligible Prescribed Body should be appointed to the advisory body. This is a matter for the advisory body to determine and is subject to the Prescribed Body becoming a signatory to the MOU.</para><para>Recommendation 4. The Committee recommends that the MLA Board consult with its membership on democratic reform of the MLA's Articles of Association. In the absence of progress on this matter before the 2003 MLA Annual General Meeting, the Committee recommends that the Minister engage in detailed and open consultation with levy payers on reform options for a more democratic board selection process.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 4 is accepted in principle noting that any change to the MLA Articles of Association or the board selection processes is a matter for the MLA Board and membership to consider. The Government further notes that MLA is a company formed under the Corporations Act and the Government has no direct power to intervene on these matters. The Government nonetheless has encouraged MLA to consider making the board selection process more democratic and open to participation by MLA members. </para><para>Recommendation 5. The Committee recommends that the Minister negotiate with signatories to the MOU on alternative arrangements for the disbursement of earnings of the Red Meat Industry Reserve Fund.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 5 is accepted in principle. However, the Government notes that, as an MOU co-signatory, the Commonwealth cannot unilaterally instigate changes to the funding arrangements. The Government nonetheless has encouraged the Red Meat Advisory Council (RMAC) and other industry members to examine these matters and the Government is willing to consider advice received.</para><para>Recommendation 6. The Committee recommends that the advisory body develop a detailed industry strategic plan, and that consideration be given to the use of competitive contract to deliver elements of the strategic plan.</para><para>Recommendation 7. The Committee recommends that the selection committee for the contracts include an independent probity auditor and a representative of AFFA.</para><para>Recommendation 8. The Committee recommends that the size and recipient of these contracts, and outcomes delivered, be placed on the advisory body's web site, and reported by AFFA to the Minister.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendations 6, 7 and 8 are accepted. The Government understands that RMAC is reviewing the existing industry strategic plan. The Government is willing to consider advice from RMAC on the administrative arrangements for delivery of the strategic plan.</para><para>CONCLUSION</para><para>The Government notes that the existing arrangements were put in place to provide for greater industry ownership and self-determination on matters relevant to industry participants. The Government believes that any changes to the arrangements are primarily a matter for industry to consider. As a signatory to the MOU the Government is willing to encourage industry to consider ways of improving its consultative arrangements and service delivery. In this context, the Government has written to signatories of the MOU seeking their views on the existing arrangements, and encouraging them to consider reforms, where appropriate.</para><para>While the Government accepts that the validity of engaging the industry on the issues raised by the Committee, it notes that any actions it can take are limited and that it is ultimately up to industry to carry forward any reforms. </para><para>—————</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT LEGISLATION COMMITTEE Report on the Introduction of Quota Management Controls on Australian Beef Exports to the United States</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline></para><para>On 15 May 2002 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced the introduction of quota management controls on Australian beef exports to the United States. On 16 May 2002 the matter was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee (the Committee).</para><para>The Committee received submissions and heard evidence from interested parties and presented its report to the Senate on 26 June 2002.</para><para>The Government response to the Committee's report dated 26 June 2002 on the Introduction of Quota Management Controls on Australian Beef Exports to the United States by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is as follows.</para><para>Recommendation 1. The Committee recommends that:</para><para>a)	The proposal for the current quota year formulated by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry be varied in that a discretionary tonnage be allocated from the remaining unfilled quota to current US suppliers which is sufficient to minimise disruption to the Australian beef industry. The Committee considers this tonnage should be in the order of 30,000 tonnes. This discretionary tonnage approximately doubles and replaces the `hardship' tonnage allowance contained in the Minister's 2002 scheme.</para><para>b)	For US beef quota years 2003 and beyond, in lieu of the Minister's May 2002 proposal, a new proposal be formulated by the Minister convening a round-table forum of all industry participants. </para><para>c)	This forum should have as its principal task the formulation of a management plan for quota year 2003 and following years.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 1(a) is accepted. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Beef Export to the United States of America) Order 2002 gazetted on 1 July 2002 specifies an amount of 30,000 tonnes for discretionary assignment in 2002 in accordance with the Committee's recommendation.</para><para>Recommendations 1(b) and 1(c) are not accepted. The Government established an independent Quota Management Panel to provide ongoing advice on quota management issues, including the allocation of the discretionary US beef quota. The Panel reported on their assessments and recommended amendments be made to the arrangements for distribution of the 2003 US beef quota. </para><para>Recommendation 2. The Committee notes the difficulties that re-allocation of beef quota will pose for industry in the current quota year and recommends that the Australian Government actively pursue with the United States Government the allocation of the US discretionary tonnage of beef to Australia.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 2 is accepted. The Government has continued to seek the US Government's agreement for additional in-quota access to the US beef market as an ongoing priority.</para><para>Recommendation 3. The Committee notes that the United States has been reported as having increased its share of the Japanese beef market recently and the Committee recommends that, in light of this development, and evidence to the Committee during this Inquiry of strengthening demand in Japan, that the Government support intensified Australian beef marketing initiatives in Japan.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 3 is agreed. On 11 July 2002 the Minister announced that the Government had allocated $5 million to support Meat and Livestock Australia's Japanese market recovery campaign.</para><para>Recommendation 4. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Beef Export to the United States of America) Order 2002, when prepared, complies with the recommendations made by the Committee in this report.</para><para>Government Response. Recommendation 4 is accepted in part. As noted in the Government response to Recommendation 1, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Beef Export to the United States of America) Order 2002 gazetted on 1 July 2002 specified an amount of 30,000 tonnes for discretionary assignment in 2002 in accordance with Committee's recommendation. The Order did not comply with Recommendations 1 (b) and 1 (c) as the Government rejected these recommendations. The Government also did not believe it appropriate that the Order include any provisions in relation to Recommendations 2 and 3.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CONCLUSION</inline></para><para>The Government's US beef quota management system for 2002 commenced on 15 July 2002.

The matter referred to the committee was a proposed agreement between Australia and the United States under which Australia would agree not to surrender US nationals to the International Criminal Court if it were alleged that they had committed war crimes, crimes of genocide or other serious crimes against humanity. After waiting an extraordinary eight months for the committee to take any action on the inquiry, the Senate has now finally received this letter from the secretary of the committee advising that as far as the committee is aware, there is no such proposed agreement between the United States and Australia and that it proposes, therefore, to defer the inquiry until the terms of such an agreement have been finalised. This was despite the fact that the committee has conceded that it has the power to inquire into any question referred to it by either house of parliament relating to a treaty or other international instrument whether or not negotiated to completion. </para><para>I think it is quite bizarre for the committee to claim that it is unaware of any proposed agreement between the United States and Australia, given that there is overwhelming evidence to show that the government is currently negotiating on such an agreement. I take this opportunity to review just some of that evidence. Firstly, as early as 27 August last year, almost a year ago, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, indicated to the chamber that Australia had been approached by the US to enter into an article 98(2) agreement and that the government was carefully considering the US proposal. The following day on the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program on ABC radio the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, confirmed that the government was sympathetic to the US request. Then on 8 September last year the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, confirmed on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> TV program that the US request was `presently under consideration' and that `in principle, the Australian government have no objection but we are still working out the details'. Further, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>newspaper reported on 10 July this year that the Attorney-General's office had the day before confirmed that the government was continuing its negotiations with the US to sign an article 98(2) agreement.</para><para>There can be no doubt, therefore, that the government is currently negotiating such an agreement with the United States. So I think we can safely conclude that the committee's decision to defer this inquiry is yet another example of the Howard government conducting negotiations with the US behind closed doors away from the scrutiny of parliament and the Australian community generally. The committee's decision to defer the inquiry is unjustified and certainly unacceptable to the Australian Democrats.</para><para>Given that the United States has entered into similar agreements with a number of nations, the committee could refer to the terms of those agreements as indicators of the type of agreement that the US might be seeking with Australia. In fact, the input of the committee and the Australian community is I would argue more critical at this point in time than before, when the terms of agreement have been finalised, rather than afterwards. </para><para>Leaving aside the exact terms of any such agreement, we Democrats argue that what we have at stake here is a fundamental question of principle—whether Australia should consider entering into such an agreement at all—and it is this issue that should have been the central focus of the inquiry by the treaties committee. There is no good reason for the committee to defer its consideration of this issue. Already there is considerable opposition to such an agreement within the Australian community—voices that the government is refusing to listen to as it continues with secret negotiations and discussions with the Bush administration.</para><para>Let us have a look for a moment at the US attitude towards the International Criminal Court and exactly what it is asking Australia to agree to. The ICC was established to put an end to impunity for the worst crimes against humanity, including genocide and war crimes. As Minister Downer has previously observed, the ICC was set up to ensure that the butchers of the future do not get away with the sort of butchery we saw perpetrated by people like Pol Pot and President Milosevic in Yugoslavia. Australia's ratification of the Rome Statute obliges us to hand over those accused of crimes against humanity to the ICC if we are unable or unwilling to prosecute them under Australian law. The US believes that special exemption should be made for American citizens who commit such crimes. It wants its citizens accused of war crimes and of perpetrating genocide to be exempt from that system of justice. The Australian government has made no secret of the fact that it is sympathetic to this US proposal.</para><para>There are two more disturbing aspects to this story. Firstly, the US has resorted to bribery and coercion in its attempts to buy impunity for US citizens. Just last month the US suspended $47.6 million in military aid and some $613,000 in military education programs to 35 of the world's poorest countries which refused to enter into article 98 agreements with it. Secondly, the US has passed legislation which enables US military personnel to invade other countries for the purposes of retrieving US citizens who have been referred to the court. Given the location of the ICC, that legislation has been widely dubbed the `Hague Invasion Act'.</para><para>Of course, in recent months, the hypocrisy of the US request has been highlighted by the way in which it has treated Australian citizens David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib. While it wants Australia to simply hand back any US citizens accused of terrorism, it has absolutely no intention of releasing Australian citizens in the same circumstances. Moreover, the Australian government has been content to sit back and allow its citizens to be locked up in cages for almost two years with no charges being brought against them and, at the very best, the opportunity to be tried before a US military tribunal whose practices and procedures are abhorrent to Australian concepts of justice and a fair trial.</para><para>I would argue that the failure of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to commence this inquiry is an abdication of its responsibilities and of parliamentary scrutiny and cannot be justified. We Democrats will not let the matter rest here. The Australian people deserve more than to be fobbed off on critically important matters such as this, especially given the key role and enthusiasm that Australia has showed in both initiating the notion of the International Criminal Court and then advocating its necessity and integrity. We will be looking for and, I believe, implementing opportunities for us to do this so that the parliament and the Australian people can know what it is that is being negotiated, for what reasons, by whom and when. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13014</page.no><id.no>R1766</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>EXPORT CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1771</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1831</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION LEGISLATION BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1800</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>13014</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator ABETZ (Tasmania—Special Minister of State) (4.24 p.m.)—I indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together.

Specifically this bill will amend and improve the Civil Aviation Act 1988 by:</para><para>·	assisting in the development of regulations dealing with aircraft maintenance;</para><para>·	altering certain definitions in the Act, such as those of “Australian aircraft” and “state aircraft”, to remove ambiguity and to align them more closely with internationally used definitions; </para><para>·	appropriately transferring the function of entering into 83bis agreements with other countries, from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, to CASA as the national airworthiness authority in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) recommendations; </para><para>·	amending certain provisions to harmonise these provisions with the Criminal Code; and</para><para>·	amending other minor provisions, such as those relating to goods seized as part of an investigation, to facilitate smoother operation of CASA. I note that legislative changes to CASA's structure and governance arrangements are contained in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003, also being introduced into Parliament.</para><para>This bill will also amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to ensure definitions are aligned with those in the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and it will also repeal a redundant section of the Airports Act 1996.</para><para>The Explanatory Memorandum sets out the specific amendments to the terminology and definitions which seek to achieve compliance with Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). These amendments will harmonise provisions with the requirements of other National Airworthiness Authorities by removing maintenance requirements and terminology that are unique to Australia and by aligning definitions with those used internationally. The internationally recognised and accepted terms that will replace existing terminology reflect the requirements necessary for the enabling legislation dealing with aircraft maintenance. </para><para>These proposed changes will have no effect on the current aircraft maintenance requirements prescribed by the Civil Aviation Regulations. They will, however, ensure that new Australian regulations harmonise with international standards and practices and promote the maintenance of air safety.</para><para>The bill also introduces an important measure, that of giving CASA the function of entering into Article 83bis agreements with the National Airworthiness Authorities of other countries such as the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States and the Civil Aviation Authority in New Zealand.</para><para>Under the Chicago Convention a State party to the Convention is generally responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft on that State's register, irrespective of where the aircraft is in the world. </para><para>There are, however, some obvious difficulties in administering safety regulations when an aircraft registered in one country is operated in another for a substantial period of time. </para><para>Article 83bis enables the transfer of safety regulatory functions from the State of registration to the State of operation, on agreement of both States. While at present there are no 83bis agreements between Australia and another country this provision will facilitate such agreements in the future.</para><para>Currently the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has the power to enter into Article 83bis agreements but CASA does not. As ICAO considers that such agreements should be made directly between the relevant national airworthiness authorities, because they are administrative instruments of less than treaty status, this bill appropriately transfers the function to CASA.</para><para>Administrative and technical provisions concerning the implementation of these agreements will be covered in regulations to be developed by CASA and the Department in consultation with industry. </para><para>The amendment to transfer the function of entering into 83bis agreements to CASA is consistent with Australia's objective of harmonising our legislative framework with international standards of safety regulation. Such agreements could also benefit the Australian aviation industry and the consumer in terms of increased economic opportunities and reduced costs.</para><para>For example, domestic operators would potentially have greater flexibility and more cost-effective options in operating their aircraft fleets, and in being able to lease aircraft, that are under utilised in Australia during periods of low demand, to overseas operators. Australian maintenance organisations may also benefit due to increased opportunities to carry out work on foreign aircraft that would otherwise have been carried out overseas. </para><para>Other amendments included in this bill will ensure that aviation operations are regulated appropriately and allow operational flexibility, without compromising safety requirements. Specifically, these amendments will correct provisions relating to the retention and disposal of goods seized by CASA during the course of an investigation. These amendments will enable CASA to carry out its responsibilities more efficiently. </para><para>The repeal of section 192 in the Airports Act 1996 will provide for a uniform regulatory approach to apply in seeking a `declaration' of essential, national interest infrastructure for the purposes of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para><para>As of July 2003, Sydney Airport would become the only airport in Australia that would otherwise be subject to section 192. The section has become redundant in the sense that declaration of airport services is currently available under the provisions of Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Repeal of the section will ensure that all airports are subject to uniform statutory provisions in regard to providing access to certain essential facilities.</para><para>There will be no anticipated added cost to consolidated revenue due to the amendments of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Air Navigation Act 1920 or the Airports Act 1996. There will however, be long term cost-benefits to those aviation industries involved in international trade which will flow from the legislative changes, as Australia's law will reflect the law of major markets for aviation products and services.</para><para>Each one of the amendments in this bill is testimony to the Government's commitment to measured reform which ensures efficient and effective regulation, accessibility and a world class standard of safety for operators and consumers alike.</para><para>—————</para><para>EXPORT CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL 2003</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Export Control Act 1982 (the Act) to:</para><para>(a)	redraft part of subsection 11Q(5) as a consequence of the repeal of section 16 of the Act by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) ACT 2000; and</para><para>(b)	amend section 23 to allow certificates issued in relation to goods for export to describe goods that originate from Christmas Island or from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (the Territories) as goods from those Territories. </para><para>Section 16 of the Act created an offence of making a false or misleading statement in declarations furnished for the purposes of the regulations. This offence was repealed and replaced by offences in the Criminal Code by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud. Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000. This bill removes the reference to section 16 in subsection 11Q(5) of the Act and replaces it with references to the relevant offences provided by subsection 137.1 `False or misleading information' and subsection 137.2 `False or misleading documents' in the Criminal Code. </para><para>Section 23 is being amended as part of the Government's preparation for the extension of the Act, by regulation, to the Territories. In its current form, section 23 would require that goods exported from the Territories be certified as exports “from Australia”. However, as Australia's access to its international markets has been negotiated on the basis of its reputation for freedom from pests and diseases that exist in the rest of the world, including in the Territories, it is important that certificates issued under the Act can make a distinction between goods exported from Australia and goods exported from the Territories. Accordingly, the amendment takes into account the significant difference in the pest and disease status between the Territories and the rest of Australia by enabling certificates issued in relation to goods for export to identify whether the goods come from the Territories or from the rest of Australia.</para><para>This amendment seeks to preserve the many international trade benefits that arise from Australia's unique pest and disease status while helping to create economic opportunities for the Territories by providing exporters in the Territories with the same framework for regulating their agricultural exports as that which applies to the rest of Australia.</para><para>—————</para><para>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003 </para><para>The Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 adds four new subsections to section 196 of the Migration Act 1958. These additional subsections reiterate and clarify the Parliament's intention that an unlawful non-citizen is only to be released from immigration detention in the circumstances specified in section 196.  </para><para>In 1992 the Parliament enacted a series of changes to the Migration Act that introduced mandatory detention. First, changes made by the Migration Amendment Act 1992 introduced mandatory detention of unauthorised boat arrivals. The Migration Reform Act 1992, which commenced on 1 September 1994, introduced mandatory detention of all unlawful non-citizens.</para><para>The Migration Reform Act included section 196, which provides that an unlawful non-citizen must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is:</para><para>·	removed from Australia;</para><para>·	deported; or</para><para>·	granted a visa.</para><para>Subsection 196(3) specifically states:</para><para>“to avoid doubt, subsection (1) prevents the release, even by a court, of an unlawful non-citizen from detention (otherwise than for removal or deportation) unless the non-citizen has been granted a visa.”</para><para>The intention of section 196 was to make it clear that there was to be no discretion for any person, or court to release from detention an unlawful non-citizen who is lawfully being held in immigration detention.</para><para>Mandatory detention remains an integral part of the Government's unauthorised arrivals policy. The Government needs to ensure, as a matter of public policy, that all unlawful non-citizens are detained until their status is clarified. This means that they must continue to be detained until one of three things happens, either that they are removed or deported from Australia or that they are granted a visa. It is not acceptable that any person is, or who is suspected of being, an unlawful non-citizen, is allowed out into the community until the question of their status is resolved.</para><para>Since the latter part of 2002, the Federal Court has decided that the Migration Act does not preclude the court from making interlocutory orders that persons be released from immigration detention pending the court's final determination of the person's judicial review application.</para><para>Such orders mean that a person must be released into the community until such time as the court finally determines their application. The court's final determination of the case can take anywhere between several weeks and several months. Where the person is subsequently unsuccessful, that person must be relocated, redetained and arrangements then made for their removal from Australia. This is a time consuming and costly process and can further delay removal from Australia.</para><para>I understand that there have now been some 20 persons released from immigration detention on the basis of interlocutory orders. In the case of more than half of these persons removal action had been commenced, as they are of significant character concern, and the Government believes their presence is a serious risk to the Australian community.</para><para>In its judgements, the Federal Court has indicated that if the Parliament wishes to prevent a court from ordering the interlocutory release of a person from immigration detention it must make its intentions unmistakably clear. This bill is intended to achieve this.</para><para>The bill amends the Migration Act to make it clear that, unless an unlawful non-citizen is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa, the non-citizen must be kept in immigration detention. This applies unless a court finally determines that:</para><para>·	the detention is unlawful; or</para><para>·	the person is not an unlawful non-citizen.</para><para>The bill ensures that an unlawful non-citizen must be kept in immigration detention pending determination of any substantive proceedings, whether or not:</para><para>·	there is a real likelihood of the person detained being removed from Australia or deported in the reasonably foreseeable future; or</para><para>·	a decision to refuse to grant, to cancel or refuse to reinstate a visa may be determined to be unlawful by a court.</para><para>The bill puts beyond doubt that section 196 of the Migration Act has effect despite any other law. </para><para>I stress that the amendments contained in the bill do not affect the court's powers to finally determine the lawfulness of a person's detention, or to finally determine the lawfulness of the decision or action being challenged.</para><para>They are intended simply to clarify the existing provisions of the Act. They do no more than what the courts have said that the Parliament needs to do. That is make its intention in relation to immigration detention unmistakably clear.</para><para>The Government believes that it is in the interests of all parties that such cases are finally determined as quickly as possible. </para><para>In summary, the bill implements measures to ensure that the Parliament's original intention in relation to immigration detention is clearly spelt out and the integrity of the Act is not compromised. </para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>—————</para><para>AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION LEGISLATION BILL 2003</para><para>I am pleased to introduce this bill, which will continue the Government's reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to provide the Commission with a framework to undertake its future work efficiently and effectively. </para><para>The bill is the result of a detailed examination by the Government of the structure of the Commission and of a consideration of the responses to past efforts at reform. </para><para>The provisions of the bill have already been the subject of inquiry and report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para><para>Before introducing this bill into the House of Representatives the Government was aware of the views of stakeholders subsequently presented to the Committee. </para><para>The Government believes that the bill appropriately implements its policy regarding reform of the Commission.</para><para>However, the Government is considering the Committee's report and will respond in due course.</para><para>The bill implements the Government's 2001 election commitment to reform the Commission `to ensure that it is efficient and focused on educating the broader Australian community about human rights issues'.</para><para>These reforms will build on the substantial focus already given to human rights education by the Commission.</para><para>The protection afforded to all Australians under Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws will be fully maintained, and enhanced, under the new Australian Human Rights Commission.</para><para>The Government agreed to the name, suggested by the former President of the Commission, which is consistent with the names of other human rights institutions in our region.</para><para>The existing Commission's powers to investigate and conciliate complaints will be retained and the bill will complete the task of fully consolidating the complaint-handling functions with the President.</para><para>In order to provide a further option for managing complaint-handling workloads, the Attorney-General will be able to appoint legally qualified persons as Complaints Commissioners on a part-time basis to assist the President with these functions.</para><para>Work will be allocated to a Complaints Commissioner by the President.</para><para>The Government believes that education is the key to a society in which human rights are respected by all. </para><para>The bill provides for the re-focusing and enhancing of the Commission's functions to give greater legislative priority to education and the dissemination of information on human rights. </para><para>This supports the Commission's existing approach to protecting and promoting the human rights of all Australians by a strong focus on education.</para><para>The Commission has also suggested the use of a by-line `Human Rights—everyone's responsibility' with its name.</para><para>The incorporation of a reference to the use of the by-line into the retitled Australian Human Rights Commission Act supports the legislative refocus of the Commission's functions and reflects the common terminology by which the Commission is often referred. </para><para>A new executive structure for the Commission, with a strengthened `collegiate' approach, will assist the Commission in reaching the broad spectrum of Australians. </para><para>The bill provides for three Human Rights Commissioners to replace the existing portfolio specific commissioners. </para><para>The Human Rights Commissioners and the President will have a common responsibility to protect and promote human rights for all Australians.</para><para>These reforms take into account the possibility of new areas of Commission responsibility (such as age discrimination), the fact that human rights issues increasingly crossover the portfolio specific boundaries of the existing structure (such as issues relating to women with disabilities), and the social and economic environment that faces all levels of government and business.</para><para>In addition to the requirements for individual expertise, knowledge or experience, the bill will require that the President and the Human Rights Commissioners, as a group, have expertise in matters likely to come before the Commission. </para><para>The Government is confident that these reforms will assist the Commission to build on its already impressive reputation as a centre of knowledge and expertise. </para><para>The Commission will also retain responsibility for determining its administrative support structure.</para><para>This means that the new Commission can continue to benefit from its specialist policy units if it chooses.</para><para>The bill will also provide for the removal of certain statutory consultative mechanisms which are unnecessary. </para><para>The provision for the establishment of a Community Relations Council, to which no members have ever been appointed, will be removed. </para><para>The provision for the establishment of advisory committees, which has only been used once, will also be repealed. </para><para>The Commission will retain its power to work with and consult appropriate persons, governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations. </para><para>The bill will require the new Commission to seek the approval of the Attorney-General, as First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, before exercising its power to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings. </para><para>This will ensure that the intervention function is only exercised after the broader interests of the community have been taken into account.</para><para>This requirement is not intended to prevent court submissions that are contrary to the government's views, but rather to prevent duplication and the waste of resources and to ensure that court submissions accord with the interests of the community as a whole.</para><para>Where a federal judge is appointed to the position of President, the new Commission will not be required to seek approval from the Attorney-General before seeking leave to intervene. </para><para>In this case, the new Commission will be required to notify the Attorney-General of its intention to seek leave to intervene and its reasons for doing so. </para><para>This ensures that there are no constitutional issues arising from the appointment of a federal judge as President. </para><para>The provision for notification of interventions would apply during the term of the new President of the Commission, Justice von Doussa, who was appointed President of the Commission from 10 June 2003.</para><para>The Commission's function to assist in proceedings, with the leave of the relevant court, as amicus curiae is unchanged.</para><para>The Commission will retain its power to make recommendations to remedy or reduce loss or damage suffered by a person as a result of an act or practice inconsistent with a person's human rights or constituting discrimination. </para><para>However, this power will no longer include the power to recommend the payment of compensation. </para><para>The Government is proud that Australia has a human rights record that is among the best in the world and our national human rights institution is recognised as a leader in our region.</para><para>These reforms will ensure that the new Australian Human Rights Commission is able

Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> has no redeeming features. Indeed, it is just another in a long line of legislation brought forward by this government to reduce the rights and entitlements of workers and to limit the capacity of the trade union movement to represent workers. Since 1996, when the coalition government came to power, there have been over 50 separate pieces of industrial relations legislation introduced by the coalition government. In nearly all cases they have been directed at reducing entitlements for workers, removing their rights, targeting particular groups of workers—such as those in small business— and creating inequitable situations for them. They have been about promoting non-unionism. They have been about limiting the ability of democratic trade unions to function within the industrial relations system. Many, of course, have been given titles which suggest the opposite of what the legislation has set out to do.</para></talk.start><para>We all recall, of course, the legislation introduced in 1999 called the <inline ref="R894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline>. Somebody in the government had an idea for dramatic irony or a sense of the absurd, because that legislation did exactly the opposite. It did not do anything to create more jobs, and it in fact proposed reduced entitlements and reduced remuneration for workers. We have bills such as the <inline ref="R1743">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline><inline ref="R1636">.</inline> That last bill started out as the <inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill</inline>—legislation which, on a number of occasions, has been rejected by this Senate.</para><para>One of the ironies of the bill that we are debating at the moment is that the title actually, for once, gets it right. The bill is entitled the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. It does deal with termination of employment but, if passed, it will terminate the rights of employees under state jurisdictions to seek a remedy for unfair dismissal within those jurisdictions. That is the real impact of this legislation. This, of course, demonstrates the hypocrisy of the coalition government. The Liberal Party particularly, and the National Party, have campaigned for years for the promotion and the protection of states rights. They are the self-appointed protectors of states rights under the Constitution, opposing any concept of centralism, of taking away powers from the states. However, they throw all of that out the window in their ideological pursuit of greater federal control over industrial relations and, in particular in this bill, over unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>The main purpose of the bill is to extend the federal unfair dismissal laws by excluding state jurisdictions from hearing such cases in nearly all situations. The bill relies upon the corporations power of the Constitution. Placitum (xx) of section 51 of the Constitution states:</para><para>The Parliament shall ... have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:</para><quote><para>(xx) foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth ...</para></quote><para>The bill does not use as its head of power the section of the Constitution—placitum (xxv) of section 51—which deals with the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Placitum (xxv) is the power that has been used historically, since the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act came into being in 1904, to regulate wages, working conditions and employment law at the federal level. Consistent with that, it has always been the case that the states have had the right to regulate industrial relations within their state jurisdictions. </para><para>The argument that has been put forward by the minister is that this bill endeavours to bring about a unitary system, a national system, for the country to remove the complexities that are said to exist with six state jurisdictions and a federal system. That is an argument that has gone on for many years. I am sure those who take any interest in, or have looked at the history of, industrial relations issues in this country are well aware of the many arguments that have been advanced over the years and the many reports that have been written on the subject of how we get greater uniformity and a unitary system. There are some who believe that that is a good thing and there are some who argue that it is not, but this bill does nothing at all to advance the cause of a unitary system.</para><para>Let us look at some of the reasons why it does not. First, the legislation deals with unfair dismissals. It deals with the situation that arises when an employee is terminated and believes that he or she has the right to pursue a remedy, either for reinstatement or for damages, because it was an unfair dismissal—a breach of the contract of employment by the employer. That is what the legislation deals with. The legislation does not deal with the whole of the contract of employment. The legislation does not seek to bring those employees who are covered under state awards in respect of their wages and working conditions completely under the federal jurisdiction. It deals only with the discrete area of unfair dismissal. The bill in effect says that if you are an employee under a state award—for example, in New South Wales or Queensland—all of your wages and working conditions will continue to be regulated by that state award except if you get the sack. If this bill becomes law and you get the sack, you will no longer be able to seek a remedy through your state commission or your state industrial court. You will have to apply to the federal commission. No ifs, no buts.</para><para>So this bill in no way advances the cause of a unitary system of industrial relations; rather, it singles out one discrete area and denies the state jurisdictions the power to continue to deal with that. Furthermore, this legislation does not even really deal with the area which regulates wages and working conditions; rather, it deals with what happens after the employee has been terminated. Rather than simplify matters, rather than remove complexities that may or may not exist in the current situation where you have federal and state jurisdictions, this will create more complexity. It will set up a situation in which many employees will be covered by two jurisdictions. Their wages and working conditions—the things they negotiate about or their employee organisation negotiates about on their behalf with the employer— will continue to be covered by a state award but, if they get dismissed and want to take action, they will have to go to the federal commission. As I said, that is creating more complexity. It is placing many millions of workers currently covered by state awards, and currently completely covered by a state jurisdiction, under both jurisdictions.</para><para>The second point is that this legislation does not actually do what its purpose seeks to do—that is, move all employees from a state jurisdiction to the federal jurisdiction for the purposes of unfair dismissal. The government acknowledges that. As the minister himself said in his second reading speech, this will produce a situation where about 85 per cent of workers will be covered by federal unfair dismissal laws. He said: </para><para>This `cover the field' provision means that the percentage of employees covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions should rise from about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent and that the number of workers covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions should increase from about four million to about seven million.</para><para>So the government, by its own admission, knows that the argument that this will bring about or promote a unitary system is false because this will leave, on its calculations, 15 per cent of the work force either still covered by a state jurisdiction for the purposes of unfair dismissal law or possibly in a state of limbo. I say `a state of limbo' because this will inevitably create legal argument about whether or not the federal jurisdiction applies in particular cases. When you set out to pass legislation that purports to cover the field, you immediately raise issues about whether or not that objective is achieved in all cases. If the government's own admission is that 15 per cent of employees will not be covered by the federal legislation if it is passed then there is potential for some, if not most, of those employees not to be covered by the federal jurisdiction and at the same time to have their state jurisdiction coverage removed. I can see a lawyers' feast coming up in respect of some of those disputes.</para><para>A further point—and again, I am sure the government acknowledges this—is that, as the bill only applies to employees of corporations, it still leaves out people in unincorporated businesses such as many small businesses, institutions such as charities and unincorporated associations, and state instrumentalities. These employees are not covered by the bill. So to suggest that this bill is about bringing in a unitary system is a furphy; it is a nonsense. It does not do that. This bill is about Minister Abbott endeavouring to destroy the structure of the New South Wales Industrial Commission and the Queensland Industrial Commission in particular. Those are the two states where the state jurisdictions cover a large number of employees. This is nothing more than a deliberate ideological attack upon the existence and the work of those state commissions.</para><para>It has been recognised by many spokespersons on all sides of the debate—coalition supporters and Labor supporters—over the years that, if you want a unitary system of industrial relations, you have to bring it about by consensus. You have to create it through a cooperative effort. That is the way it has been done in other areas of the law where the corporations power has been used, such as in company law itself. If you are serious about improving the industrial relations framework in this country, you do not do so by trying to ram through the federal parliament legislation which attacks state institutions such as the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, which has existed for over 100 years. It is the oldest industrial jurisdiction in this country, predating the federal commission, and it has a proud record of fairness, equity and providing industrial stability in the state of New South Wales. You could not find a better example of that than the construction of the Olympic facilities only a few years ago on budget, in time and by agreement. The New South Wales Industrial Commission and the employers and unions in that state contributed a great deal in bringing about that result.</para><para>But of course Minister Abbott is not interested in any of that. Minister Abbott is only interested in trying to use a form of industrial blackmail upon companies by saying to them, `You won't get a government contract unless you sign up to our federal construction industry laws.' That is what he is saying to the major construction companies in this country. In other words, you play by his rules or you do not play the game at all. I say to Mr Abbott that we will fight this legislation all the way. There are serious constitutional issues arising out of this bill with potential challenges to the High Court because of its potential invalidity.  </para><para>In conclusion, if this government are really serious about using the corporations power to bring about some reforms in this country, why don't they use that power to do something about the rights and entitlements of employees who are dismissed and lose their entitlements when businesses and companies such as HIH collapse and millions of dollars of employees' entitlements are lost? Why don't they use the corporations power to do something about protecting those innocent workers in those situations? Why don't they use the corporations power to stop some of the fraud and the criminal conduct that have gone on in companies in this country, such as the one I have just mentioned? Why don't they use the corporations power to do something about stopping some of those obscene payouts to failed chief executives? That is what the corporations power should be used for. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13024</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak in opposition to the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. Labor opposes this bill because it is yet another example of this government being driven by anti-worker ideology and political expediency. The bill will not even achieve what it ostensibly aims to do—that is, in the words of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott:</para></talk.start><para>... a more unified national workplace relations system ...</para><para>This would mean, in his words again:</para><para>... less complexity, lower costs and more jobs.</para><para>Those are noble sentiments from the minister, sentiments that no-one on this side of the chamber would oppose, obviously. However, we oppose this bill not only because it will not deliver those aims which the minister has set out but also because it deliberately and unfairly sets out to further erode protection for Australian workers. </para><para>Let me examine in detail each of the minister's claims about this bill. He claims there will be less complexity. Instead of removing complexity, this bill adds to the complexity of the current situation. As the Queensland government's submission on this bill to the Senate committee pointed out, the bill establishes:</para><para>two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;</para><para>different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;</para><para>different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';</para><para>concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial dispute; and</para><para>concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects on the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).</para><para>The Queensland government's submission was far from being the only one to point out the defective design of this bill and the additional complexity that it would bring about for workers and employers alike. Professor Andrew Stewart, in his submission, discussed the complexity of the Workplace Relations Act that many more workers and managers would have to come to terms with should this legislation be passed. In particular, Professor Stewart, writing about the provisions of the act, said: </para><para>They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when Parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and the lawyers to exploit.</para><para>So much for the minister's stated aim of less complexity!</para><para>Let me now turn to the alleged aim of lower costs. I do not need to go into the claim of the minister in detail other than to point out that, given the nightmare of complexity that he is apparently hell-bent on creating, there is no hope of lower costs. In fact, the opposite will result: costs will have to increase for workers and employers alike as they will need to seek legal advice for, in Professor Stewart's words, `even the simplest procedures'.</para><para>Lastly, I turn to Minister Abbott's claim that the passage of this bill will mean more jobs. For some time the government has been holding onto the claim that making it easier for the employer to unfairly sack a worker will make the employer more likely to take the step of employing the worker in the first place. We on this side of the chamber have more faith in the employers of this nation than it appears the government does. Nobody believes for a minute that when considering whether or not to take on a new worker an employer thinks, `No, I won't take someone on because when I treat them unfairly and sack them they might be able to come back at me.' That is not how employers think. That is not how small business employers, whom the government thinks are most likely to want to treat people unfairly, think at all. I think that when deciding whether or not to take someone on a potential employer looks at the turnover of their business and what skills are needed and whether there is sufficient work and resources to allow for an additional worker. But the government does not think that. The government thinks that the only thing holding back small business from taking on more staff is the risk of not being able to unfairly dismiss those workers down the track. I believe that is just not a factor in the minds of small business employers.</para><para>The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee conducted an inquiry into small business in 2002. The committee's findings released in February this year found:</para><para>Consistent with survey rankings of small business concerns, unfair dismissal did not arise as a major issue during the inquiry.</para><para>The committee found that more pressing concerns for small business were the difficulties they faced complying with the government's new tax system, the need for better business management and problems with recruiting suitable employees. Where unfair dismissal laws were raised as a concern, the committee reported that the main issues were a `lack of understanding in how to dismiss staff consistent with the law, the costs and complexities of the current processes for determining claims and the uncertainty for outcomes'.</para><para>The committee noted that what was most lacking were personal management skills in the small business sector, and reported a need for more training and support. But the government does not offer this training and support; what it offers through this bill, as my colleague has already said, is a sledgehammer approach: fix the problem by having yet another go at Australia's workers and remove their protection from being treated unfairly, rather than providing the education and training to employers about their obligations. </para><para>I do not think anybody has forgotten that it was this government in its previous term who turned dogs onto Australian workers under the previous minister, Minister Reith. That image will be seared forever into the consciousness of many Australians, I believe. But just because this attempt by the government to snatch conditions and protection from workers has a less dramatic modus operandi, that makes it no less abhorrent. Minister Abbott, in introducing this bill, was trying to achieve three things: less complexity, lower costs and more jobs. The minister needs to go back to the drawing board, Labor believes, because this bill demonstrably will not achieve any of those things.</para><para>At the risk of teaching the minister how to do his job, Labor suggests that a good place to start would be to consult with the states. This bill will have a considerable effect on states' industrial relations jurisdictions. The rationale for this dramatic change is replete with rhetoric and generalisation but has very little by way of evidence or detailed analysis. As Ron McCallum, Blake Dawson Waldron Professor in Industrial Law and Dean of Law at the University of Sydney, said in his recent speech to the 11th Annual Labour Law Conference:</para><quote><para>If the provisions of this bill concerning the coverage of federal law over employment terminations are enacted into law in their present form, they will strike a blow at the five remaining state systems of employment regulation that may mean the beginning of the end of state employment regulation in Australia.</para></quote><para>That is something I would not have thought the federal government would want. Professor McCallum went on to say that, due to the expanded coverage of this legislation with about 85 per cent of workers having recourse to only federal mechanisms, state regulators would be left with very little to do. He believes that this—and I quote:</para><para>...would have a telling impact upon the viability of these state-based systems of labour relations regulation, especially in the smaller states of South Australia and Tasmania.</para><para>As these state systems do much more than simply regulate laws governing wages and employment conditions, to leave them gutted and unviable would impact on other areas of state law—areas that the Australian parliament has no interest in. So why would the federal government wish to go down this particular path? Their past record would suggest that having a go at workers may be their main motivation; however, some of the more charitable amongst those on this side of the chamber may suggest that the government is attempting to simplify industrial relations law and create a single, national system. So let us assume that that is the motivation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name></talker><para>—Like the tax system!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That's right. Thank you, Senator Murphy. However, this bill, whilst achieving the first, certainly fails to do the latter. In my home state of Tasmania, despite the lack of consultation from the federal government, a considerable amount of work has been done to examine the implications of this bill, and I commend the state government for the quality of their submission to the Senate committee and wholeheartedly support their recommendation to reject these proposals.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As part of the work done on examining the effect of this bill, the Tasmanian Industrial Commission assessed the last 300 filed applications. These 300 applications related to 326 individuals. The results of examining these applications were as follows. Firstly, the Tasmanian Industrial Commission determined that 202 of the 300 applications—67.3 per cent—were possibly applicants employed by constitutional corporations and would therefore be subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Secondly, of the 202 applications, 67—that is, 33.2 per cent—could be excluded from pursuing an application in either the Tasmanian Industrial Commission or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by regulation 30BA and section 170CC of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Thirdly, of the 300 applications, 128—that is, 42.7 per cent—also included claims in respect of underpayment of wages, long service leave and/or redundancy entitlements. A number included multiple claims. Fourthly, 93 of the 202 applications—46 per cent—would require applications to be lodged with both the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Tasmanian Industrial Commission as they sought entitlements as well as a claim for alleged unfair dismissal. </para><para>The Tasmanian Industrial Commission's inquiries indicated that there would be a significant impact on the work of the commission and that the bill would result in a number of potential applicants—33-odd per cent of their sample—not being able to pursue a claim in either jurisdiction. Also, a number of clients—46 per cent of the sample— would need to pursue their claims in both the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. For anybody who is still with me, I think what we have here, from a Tasmanian perspective, is an increase in the complexity of the industrial relations system at both the Tasmanian and Australian level. So much for a more simple method of operating and an aspiration to a unified system. The clear evidence is that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. If Minister Abbott had consulted with the states, including the Tasmanian state government, he would have found this out for himself. I will say again that this bill does not achieve what Minister Abbott sets out to achieve at a practical level. All that we are left with, therefore, is the assumption that this is an ideological obsession with diminishing protection.</para><para>So let me now turn to what effect this bill would have on protection for workers in the event of unfair dismissal. The first and most glaringly unjust provision of this bill is its attempt to treat workers employed by small businesses in a different way from workers employed by medium and large enterprises. None of us on this side of the chamber can see any reason why the size of the business that the employee works for should determine their ability to seek redress in the event of unfair treatment. To argue otherwise is to argue for an inequality of rights and sets Australia on a very dangerous path indeed. As the Senate committee found, one of the major issues identified by small businesses was `problems with recruiting suitable employees'. Creating an environment where there is less security and fewer rights for employees of these businesses will only make it harder, in fact, for them to attract suitable, skilled staff, which is completely contrary to the objective of this bill.</para><para>This bill seeks to differentiate between employees of small businesses and those employed by larger businesses in a number of ways. For an employee of a small business the qualifying period of employment before an application for a remedy can be made will be extended from three months to six months. The maximum compensation payable to a small business employee who has been unfairly dismissed will be reduced from six months remuneration to three months remuneration. I ask why. Is the unfairly dismissed employee of a small business more readily able to find alternative work? Do small business employees have less financial commitments than other employees? Do the children of small business employees have less need for education or health care— things that under this government are costing families more and more each day? Of course they do not. So how can it possibly be fair to discriminate against employees of small businesses in this way? It cannot be. That is why Labor will not be supporting this bill: a bill that attempts to set up two classes of workers in this country and effectively, in the case of small business, an underclass. </para><para>Minister Abbott has made some cursory attempt to justify what would seem, prima facie, to be discriminatory treatment of workers by some relatively poorly explained and ill-defined notions of imbalance. Like my Labor colleagues on the committee, I do not accept this attempted justification. As they noted in their report, there were strong arguments put before the committee:</para><para>... that small business may have compensating advantages that undermine any argument for concessional treatment in regard to employment laws.</para><para>In particular, they noted Professor Keith Hancock's submission in which he stated:</para><para>There is a wide variety of forces at work that determine the `make-up' of the economy between small and large business. Some of these favour large businesses and others small businesses. The oft-cited importance of small business in the overall economy is of itself evidence that by no means all advantages lie with bigness.</para><para>So there goes the final of the minister's arguments. Add to that the lack of protection for that substantial proportion of the work force who will still remain beyond the reach of federal law and those for whom the system will become immensely more complicated and you are not left, on the face of it, with much to support. As I said, this is a bad bill that does not achieve even the less distasteful elements of the minister's agenda. The minister, if he is serious about making some changes to bring about a more coherent regulatory system, has to go back to the states.</para><para>To finish, I would like to return to the words of Professor Ron McCallum, who said:</para><para>We are a federation and will remain so. It is possible to work towards a national system of industrial relations law: However, such a program requires cooperation, discussion and patience on all sides. If this Bill is enacted into law in its present form, then in my view it will ... set back federal and state cooperation on industrial law reform by several decades.</para><para>We cannot afford to do that, so in the interest of future, better-intentioned reform and in the interests of Australian small business workers and Australian small businesses themselves, Labor will continue to oppose this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>13028</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to make a few brief comments with respect to the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. I want to take up the point that it is intended to make a simplified process of and to bring uniformity to industrial relations as it goes to the question of unfair dismissal. This is all very good and interesting; I am sure a lot of people would support uniformity and simplicity if it were actually equitable. I am sure there would be many workers in Tasmania who would be more than happy to see uniformity in respect of wage structures and, in fact, uniformity dealing with the payment systems that some of their mainland colleagues have.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Mackay raised a point with respect to Federation. We are a Federation and it is interesting to note that, in one comment, the Prime Minister strongly supported the issue of Australia being a Federation. He urged Australians to vote against Australia becoming a republic to protect that particular system and yet we have a government minister seeking to undermine it completely in respect of some of the laws that operate within the Federation. It is interesting to note that the government is taking this approach to unfair dismissal laws because it suggests that somehow all of the states' laws in respect of unfair dismissal are fundamentally flawed. Many of them were formulated under conservative governments, so it suggests that the government's own colleagues at a state level have failed miserably to introduce laws that give adequate protection to employees on the one hand and facilitate the process for determining unfair dismissals at the workplace level on the other. </para><para>You really do not have to pull away the cloak here to see exactly what the federal government and particularly the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations are up to. This is a process to try to get at trade unionism in this country. Nothing could be clearer. The facts are that, on the one hand, the minister has introduced bills into the parliament that are inconsistent with bills that he has previously introduced which sought to exempt small business employers from the Commonwealth unfair dismissal laws and yet, on the other hand, here he is seeking to have a cover-all process for unfair dismissal only, which makes it very interesting. He is saying to workers in Tasmania, `You have to be covered by Commonwealth unfair dismissal laws, but you cannot be covered by payment systems in respect of your wages that might apply at Commonwealth level.' Just that example in itself clearly demonstrates what the government is really on about here.</para><para>I think we have had eight attempts to introduce bills in one form or another. Again, I think that is an example of how this government, and in particular Mr Abbott, has been pursuing the issue of trying to reduce the capacity of worker representation in this country. It is clear, both historically and even today, that worker representation is needed. Senator Forshaw may have raised the issue of the use of the corporations power. We did not see the government rushing to use the corporations power in respect of some of the payments that have been made to CEOs, many of whom have proven to be totally inadequate in their job. We do not see an unfair dismissals process applying there to protect the interests of the company or, indeed, the shareholders of the company. No, what we see totally and indifferently is a system whereby these people receive huge payouts for miserable failure. It is hard to see how a government can argue that there is some justice in its approach.</para><para>As I said, I just wanted to be brief and say that I do not and will not support this type of legislation in this place. I do not think it is worthy of support. I do not even think it is worthy of an attempt to amend it. I hope that other senators will take that view. There is no purpose in trying to amend legislation that delivers an unfair outcome to the Australian people, particularly Australian workers. If it is fundamentally unfair, which this is, then it is not worthy of any support and it should be sent back to the government. If the government ever decides that it wants to bring in some genuine reform then that is worthy of debate, but there are many more important issues in respect of matters that relate to the operation of business in this country.</para><para>I note with interest that the government senators said in their majority report that they saw an `urgent need to reduce the burden of regulation on small business'. If there is one thing that this government has successfully done it has been to introduce a tax system that has placed a greater burden on small business in this country than any other government, from a historic point of view, has ever been able to achieve. And we all know what that is: the GST and the BAS. If the government was really genuine about looking after the interests of small business—or indeed any business, but particularly small business—in this country it would embark upon a process of introducing legislation and change into this parliament that would ensure that the 20 days, on average, that it takes for a small business to fill in its BAS forms were either reduced significantly or that the burden was removed altogether. If there were a contribution that this parliament could make to the operation of small business in the country, that would be a very significant contribution. </para><para>If you read various reports that go to the question of the concerns of small business, unfair dismissal laws per se do not rate highly. It is true to say that there is a general lack of understanding with many employers and with some employees, so a much more useful contribution to make to the Australian business community would be for small businesses, in particular, to be informed— and informed in a way that they could understand—about the requirements in respect of unfair dismissal laws. But, as I said, one of the most significant contributions that this parliament could make in respect of doing something for small business in this country would be to amend the tax system to enable small business to get on with the job of operating a small business and not be bound up by a tax system that requires a significant amount of their time to be spent on filling out forms—time that is totally lost to them— at a significant cost.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13030</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> represents something of a crossroads in the development of industrial relations law in this country, because it seeks to cover the field in a manner which has not before been attempted in industrial relations law at the Commonwealth level. The provisions covering termination of employment in the Workplace Relations Act do include provisions concerning unfair dismissals, as do the state regimes, and these have been the subject of intense political and policy debate for the past decade. This bill attracts the Australian Democrats qualified support—I say `qualified' because we are circulating amendments to the bill shortly—because it advances the Australian Democrats philosophy and policy with respect to a unitary industrial relations system. It also revisits a few areas we have previously rejected—and will continue to reject in principle and practice—and it does advance a few process improvements on unfair dismissal.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 of the bill before us is the second major move towards a unitary, or uniform, system. The first was the referral of Victoria's state industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth by former Premier Jeff Kennett and his government. That act of referral will be one of his greatest policy legacies. It is a policy decision that no government in Victoria, whatever the colour, would be keen to reverse. I am sure that every night members of the Labor government in Victoria and countless others in the Victorian community kneel and thank the various gods that industrial relations in Victoria is under one system and not two systems, as it also is in the ACT and the Northern Territory.</para><para>For New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia it is still the Dark Ages of industrial relations, each with a state system overlapping and conflicting with our Commonwealth system. As I have argued before, we need one industrial relations system, not the six we presently have. We have a small population of just 20 million people; we have nine governments, 15 houses of parliament and a ridiculous overlap of laws and regulations. There are areas of economy that genuinely require a single national approach, like finance, the Corporations Law, trade practices law or tax law. Labour law is one of those areas too.</para><para>Globalisation and the information revolution have created competitive pressures that require us as a nation to be as nimble as possible in adapting to changing circumstances. Whatever the colour of the Commonwealth government, we still require just one set of laws for the country. There are areas of policy and jurisdiction the states no longer have sensible involvement in. It took 30-odd years for tax law to become far more national than had been conceived at the commencement of Federation. After 70-plus years we finally got a unitary system of trade practices law. After 100 years states' rights and vested interests finally gave way to one unitary financial system for Australia and although the process was messy in the execution we do finally, after 100 years, have a unitary system in Corporations Law. </para><para>The Australian Democrats have never supported states' rights and, by extension, states' laws therefore, or even the Federation as originally conceived. That long Australian Democrats tradition is repeated in the Democrats' constitutional reform policy balloted in July 2001, which says:</para><quote><para>We strongly hold that the current three tiers of Government in Australia should be replaced by a more representative framework, where the States are replaced by Regional Governments ... </para></quote><para>As an automatic consequence of such a policy position long held by the Democrats, there is therefore explicit backing for national laws on, for example, trade practices, finance, corporations, tax and industrial relations. Regional governments would have no part in such law. Obviously there is absolutely no chance whatsoever, given both the views of the Australian community as a whole and the views of the major parties, that our federal system is likely to be revisited. Nevertheless, the central concept that there are laws which are appropriate to be national and laws which are appropriate to be regional or state is entirely accurate. </para><para>It is time we moved towards a national system of industrial regulation that will do away with unnecessary replications, conflicts and complexity. Referenda aimed at extending the Commonwealth's industrial relations powers failed in 1911, 1913, 1926, 1944 and 1946. It seems unlikely that anyone will attempt a unitary system by referendum again, or at least in the near future. Does that mean it is a policy we should not pursue? No, it does not.</para><para>The referral of the Victorian system to the Commonwealth from 1997 has been a remarkable success with remarkably little aggravation within the community. That is despite the fact that, under section 1A, thousands of Victorian employees still, regrettably, remain under inferior employment conditions. I was very pleased to see that the federal minister had finally agreed with the Victorian minister to end that circumstance. Victoria is much better off, despite the criticisms one might have with parts of the federal legislation, with one system and not two.</para><para>This bill does advance unfair dismissal 85 per cent of the way to a unitary system for unfair dismissal. A nearly unitary system for unfair dismissal would have three prime benefits. Firstly, it would achieve for the majority of Australian workers common human rights across Australia, which differ at present. The second motivation is economic. Common, easily administered rules and laws make for more efficient, competitive and productive enterprises, and this bill moves towards that objective. Thirdly, the bill facilitates more comprehensive coverage for workers. There have been estimates of up to 800,000 employees not covered by federal or state awards or agreements, for example the former employees of OneTel, that would now be covered.</para><para>Unfortunately, the bill cannot go as far as it needs to. Constitutional limitations prevent complete coverage. As we have stated earlier, the Democrats are concerned that relying on the corporations power alone will still leave large chunks of employees working for non-incorporated businesses, many of these in small business with still no protection from state or federal laws. The Democrats also recognise that the federal unfair dismissals law is more complex than in a number of the states and that is because of the competing considerations that exist. A simple system allows far too generous an access; a complex system produces its own costs and difficulties. </para><para>A number of state governments have raised these issues as a concern but have noted that the federal government has yet to make any genuine efforts to attempt to get a uniform system going. Various state governments have expressed a willingness to be involved in discussions about a harmonised national approach so long as it is done in a consultative and cooperative manner, but attempts to do so have met with little satisfaction. My own experience from my reading of the history of attempting harmonisation is that it is inevitably full of rhetoric and very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the Democrats certainly would prefer a cooperative, harmonised national approach to a single IR system.</para><para>I must say I find a contradiction in seeking to extend the coverage of federal law on unfair dismissals while simultaneously proposing to exempt small business from unfair dismissal law through the—again Senate rejected—<inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. Such an inconsistent approach is easily understood when we remember that the sole purpose of the fair dismissal bill, as it is ironically called, is political: to provide an easy double dissolution trigger. We will not support schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 because, if there were to be a double dissolution election and the fair dismissal bill were to pass a joint sitting, effectively we would have facilitated the exclusion of a much greater number of small business employees from unfair dismissal remedies as a large number of small businesses would be brought in under the expansion of the federal regime. So, consequently, we have produced an amendment to prevent this bill coming into operation until 11 August 2004, which is after the final double dissolution date.</para><para>Concerns have been raised by states, unions, some advocacy groups and some academics that some employees such as short-term casuals, those on fixed-term or task contracts and `high earning' non-award workers, trainees and managers who in some states are able to challenge their dismissal would not be covered by the federal system. Since the early 1990s employers have increased their use of casuals, contractors and labour hire forms of employment, often on a long-term basis. Between 1998-99 and 2001-02 we have seen a 29 per cent rise in the number of job placement agencies, many of which specialise in temporary placements. The total number of placements from these agencies comprised 424,400 permanent jobs and a massive 3,314,500 temporary or contract placements.</para><para>The growth in precarious and atypical employment has meant that, increasingly, legitimate workers are being excluded from recourse in the unfair dismissal system. While many state unfair dismissal legislation regimes make an effort to cover legitimate employees in precarious employment, the federal unfair dismissal regime does not. One noted academic, Professor Andrew Stewart, who has been quoted here today, has proposed that many of the problems created by the growth in precarious and atypical employment can be dealt with by a redefinition of the term `employment'. Professor Stewart's definition has been picked up as a key recommendation by the recent Stevens report, which recently reviewed the industrial relations system in South Australia. </para><para>In an attempt to address the changing employee landscape as affected by unfair dismissal, the Democrats propose to expand the definition of employee—and we have put that in our amendments—based on Professor Stewart's recommended definition, to cover contractors and other workers who, under the Workplace Relations Act, might not presently be considered employees. One would assume that the federal government would support such an amendment as the federal system has always supported access to genuine employees, so the government should have no objection to provisions that ensure genuine employees—and I stress `genuine' employees—are captured by the unfair dismissal system. To further make the point: you cannot at one level deem an employee for tax purposes and then for workplace relations purposes exclude them. We have made it quite explicit in our suggested amendments that any person who is categorised as an employee for tax purposes will also fall under this act for unfair dismissal purposes.</para><para>While our proposed amendments will address some of the concerns raised in the states, given that the states' regimes are so varied it would be difficult to satisfy everyone. There are good arguments to rationalise state laws. When we first revised the unfair dismissal regime in 1996, casuals were an entirely different proposition from what they are today. Today the estimates are that there are about 2½ million Australians under casual employment, and most of those fall under the state jurisdictions. In Western Australia and in Tasmania there is a very strange provision in that there is no probationary period for casuals, which seems remarkable to me. In the other four jurisdictions, casuals on probation are excluded from accessing unfair dismissal—rightly, I think. In the Commonwealth, Queensland, Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory the exclusion period is 12 months. In New South Wales and South Australia it is six months. So the question, in my mind, is not whether there should be a probationary period for casuals but what the length of that period should be. In that respect, if we are going to minimise the angst of the states about those who can presently access their regimes and who should be entitled to have access to the federal regime, we think it is appropriate to produce a compromise. Consequently, we are recommending that the standardised casual probationary period be six months.</para><para>Concerns have also been raised that the federal unfair dismissal system would lead to reductions in the resourcing of state industrial tribunals and hence their ability to perform their other roles and that workers in regional and rural areas who currently can attend local courts visited by state commissioners would incur increased costs to attend the federal commission, which some expect will be based solely in capital cities. While parts of the industrial relations system will remain with the states, the Democrats are sympathetic to the states' concerns and propose that federal unfair dismissal cases should also be able to be heard through state commissioners by having dual state and federal appointments.</para><para>In schedule 2 this bill again attempts to differentiate unfair dismissal laws for small business as opposed to large business, provisions that in this case in effect reduce the rights of employees in small business. The coalition has repeatedly sought to justify its attempts to exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws by arguing that they deter small business from recruiting employees and place a greater burden and cost on small business. There continues to be little hard evidence to support the view that fair unfair dismissal laws have an adverse effect on overall employment levels, although there is evidence to show that unfair dismissal laws that are unfair or that allow process abuse do affect business attitudes to employment. Economics aside, fundamentally the Democrats have consistently said that, on both human rights and equity grounds, we will not accept reducing the rights of employees just because they are employed by small business. </para><para>One of the amendments in schedule 2 relates to giving the commissioner the ability to dismiss vexatious and frivolous applications on the papers. There are genuine concerns at the cost to employers and the commission of dealing with claims that are frivolous and vexatious. We feel that these concerns are valid for all sizes of business, not just small business, and therefore if enacted should apply to all business, and that is our amendment. Labor have previously expressed willingness to support such an amendment—I refer to the former shadow minister Robert McClelland in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 5 May 2003—and they have said that they are willing to look at amendments that curb frivolous and vexatious behaviour. The provision provides for employees and employers to give any additional information before a decision is made. Some groups have raised concerns that the provision takes away employees' rights to be heard. We have drafted in consultation an amendment that will enable the employee to be heard by either the commission or registrar without the employer being present. The Democrats have consistently supported process improvements to unfair dismissal laws that will increase efficiencies and reduce costs, and have consistently opposed changes that materially impact on the basic rights of employees, especially if one group of employees have rights and another, such as small business employees, do not.</para><para>Schedule 3 tightens unfair dismissal processes, sharpens relevant considerations and confirms that reinstatement should be the primary remedy. We agree with reinstatement being the primary remedy.</para><para>In summary, where do I get to on this bill? The Democrats are prepared to support the central proposition that the field should be covered. In return, we believe that there has to be an adjustment to ensure that genuine employees are covered and to ensure that standard provisions for casuals reflect the reality of the market as a whole. That is the broad thrust of our approach.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>13034</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The principal object of workplace relations legislation is to make it easier for businesses to employ people. It sometimes seems in the national debate over workplace relations and the government's policy that the loud constituency that claims it is actually a measure that assists bad employers become worse employers has indeed taken charge of the debate. It bears repeating, apparently, that it is in no way in the interests of any employer to recruit and then to have to sack unsuitable workers. Neither is unfair dismissal law any longer naturally an area of big union dominance. Most Australian private sector employees do not belong to unions, and this is something the Labor Party, in particular, really needs to get to grips with.</para></talk.start><para>In speaking to the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> today, I want to concentrate on the really vital ground in this debate, and that really vital ground is small business. As a general rule, big business is capable of looking after its own interests in relations with its employees. We need laws to govern dismissal primarily to foreclose on what generally are very rare instances of unfairness in dismissals from large companies. The Labor Party might like to think differently—actually, we know that they think differently from everything that they say—but we would all benefit, and the country with us, if, in thinking differently, they also thought logically. I appreciate that this may come as something as a culture shock to those opposite, who seem to think that the Tolpuddle Martyrs were monstered only last week. But the logic of employment today in industries where work is either cyclical or seasonal is that short-term contract employment is a sensible option. Often this is provided by labour hire companies. In single workplaces with long-term employment conditions—and this is the basis of most employment in this country—it makes no sense either for employers to be unfair or for employees to take unfair advantage of their positions. As in most things, in a democratic and socially responsive culture such as ours, we are all in the same boat. Our collective interest lies in ensuring that those who row the boat do so in a coordinated manner, that those who steer the boat take the safest and speediest course to our shared destination, and that those who own the boat ensure that it goes to the destination they desire to sail to. </para><para>In Australia the bulk of the employment picture is made up of small businesses. The statistics are so often quoted that it hardly seems necessary to go through them here again tonight, and I will not. It is enough in this debate to say that small business is the real driver of local employment and that it is there that government policy on the workplace should concentrate.</para><para>Unemployment in Australia has been a persistent problem for a number of years. It is clear that there are a number of reasons for this, ranging from an awkward fit with emerging commercial and industrial opportunities and markets to that phenomenon of the soft Western world, the workless by choice. It is often useful to pause and think about how lucky we are as people. We live in an advanced economy under a system of government that the people actually control and which provides a welfare safety net that most of the world can only dream about between nightmares. In the workplace relations debate, in particular, I believe we need to recognise the beneficence that we award ourselves. That is not to say that this beneficence should not be removed or even reduced. It is just that on any objective analysis of Australia's workplace relations laws we do have good reasons to be proud.</para><para>The business community, and in particular in this instance the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have voiced some criticisms over what they see as insufficient attention being given to the two core impediments to business growth. Small business employment has been a focus of attention lately. There has been the Senate committee report and the federal Office of Small Business is currently undertaking an evaluation of two of its small business programs that aim to promote business growth and employment. The Senate committee report shows very clearly that the primary employment driver in the small business sector is business growth spurred by economic growth. Obviously priority should be given to policy that maintains a high level of production.</para><para>As well as making it possible for business to maintain high levels of production—and, of course, these are not in any case matters that rest only in workplace relations laws, as Senator Murray suggested—we have to liberate the workplace further to take account of how Australians nowadays want to work. There is a high level of casual employment in the restaurant and cafe sector, which operates on razor thin margins and experiences a high rate of both business openings and business closings. But casual work suits a great many of today's Australians and it is not necessarily something that is of disadvantage to the country, the economy or the people engaged in casual work. Similarly, part-time work is also gaining in popularity and it is not doing so because—although this is what the Labor Party sometimes seem to want to say—that is all people can get. </para><para>The Labor Party has for a long time been struggling to get out of its collectivist cave and to come to grips with the reality that a great many Australian people do not want to be busy little worker bees in some vast socialised employment market where the unions tell them what to do and when to do it or what not to do and where not to do it. The primary aim of all business is to grow, and this applies to small business just as much as to big business and global business. It even applies to the growing number of sole business operators. Everyone wants to get ahead; indeed, this is what drives human society.</para><para>The role of government in this environment is to facilitate growth—to make it as easy as possible for a business, any business, to grow and to contribute to national growth. We all know, even those opposite, that businesses and the community generally have long held concerns that termination of employment provisions are an employment disincentive for small business. Aside from the general philosophical point that the law should avoid being an impediment to enterprise—and we on this side of the chamber hold that to be an immutable principle essential to the operation of a free society—it is also plain commonsense to liberate the workplace. </para><para>These concerns were noted in the <inline font-style="italic">More Time for Business </inline>response from the government in 1997, near the beginning of the liberalising and liberating process that Australia has chosen to go through in the employment area. That report found that termination of employment provisions have a disproportionate impact on small business, which can neither afford the high costs associated with a highly regulated and formally structured system nor find the time to engage in the lengthy processes which ensue. A range of surveys since then has reinforced that point. Small businesses are more likely to employ new staff and employ staff on a permanent basis if freed from what is, in effect, a restrictive trade practice in terms of the prospects of unfair dismissal claims. This survey information was covered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in its submissions to Senate inquiries into bills seeking to exempt small business in 1998 and 2002.</para><para>More recently, as I have stated previously, a new Yellow Pages survey report commissioned by DEWR from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research, with results released in October last year, has found that state and federal unfair dismissal laws impose extra costs of $1.3 billion a year on small and medium businesses and reduce employment for low-paid workers by one per cent. Small business organisations representing a wide range of small businesses, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Small Business Coalition, have argued that the laws should be changed to make them less onerous, particularly for small businesses. A major cause for concern, as I briefly alluded to before, is that small businesses are generally unlikely to have dedicated human resource professionals within their management structures, let alone personnel departments to handle recruitment and performance management processes necessary to defend unfair dismissal claims. They are also unlikely to engage outside specialists to assist in this area. </para><para>The focus of interest for many in the bill we are now debating is that it proposes to establish a single system throughout Australia at the expense of state jurisdictions. In a federation—and I would venture to suggest particularly in our federation—one should tread very lightly in all areas where the existing rights and obligations of subnational and local levels of government are concerned. I do not believe in the principle of centralism as a force that over time is permitted to take over everything. In Australia, where we have a relatively small population in a relatively large landmass, we must always take proper account of regional differentiation and the commonsense that tells you that things in Townsville, for example, are likely to be very different from things in, say, Traralgon.  </para><para>But there is a strong argument, and I believe a convincing one, for creating employment conditions on a national basis where the application of the law is concerned. There is no reason why an Australian living in Townsville should be governed in his or her terms of employment in any way differently from an Australian in Traralgon—or, indeed, anywhere else. There is one rider I would put on this condition, however. Universality in employment terms, so far as the law governing dismissal is concerned, works only when the principle that is engaged is the principle of maximum freedom of movement. </para><para>It is vital to balance the interests of employers and employees. For the most part, sensible people will come to some mutual arrangement that, provided it is within the employment law, should be nothing to do with anyone else. In the argument that is often advanced from the other side of the workplace relations debate, it too often seems that it should be compulsory for an employer to take on—and keep on, even if unsustainable—a particular person. That is not how the world works, of course. It certainly is not any sort of policy that will assist in maximising profit and thereby contribute to business growth, local community growth and national growth. It is at bottom an anticonsumer market argument and, as such, it should be rejected. The concept of a single market for unfair dismissal relations—the concept that is the fundamental purpose of this bill—does nothing to offend against the single most important element of governance that a free federation such as ours should never surrender: protection of the individual's right to be an individual. </para><para>We can expect the Labor Party and the union movement to attempt to demonise any moves towards greater freedom in the workplace. They are so caught up in their time warp that unravelling the web of employment constraints that exists in this country always carries the risk of strangling them. They will escape that fate only by making up their minds to free themselves from commitments to the past that hold no relevance in the 21st century in Australia. </para><para>The future legislative amendments proposed to improve the Commonwealth unfair dismissal scheme are an expression of the `fair go all round' principle on which the existing unfair dismissal provisions are based. It would be very hard to characterise them as radical, and you would have to be potty indeed to consider them dangerous. They are designed to give the commission stronger direction in cases to allow it to more effectively balance the interests of all parties concerned.</para><para>In his second reading speech, opposing the bill, of course—a regrettable but thoroughly unsurprising position—the member for Barton, the opposition spokesman on this area in the House of Representatives, complained that it would lead to duplication of resources, Commonwealth and state. His remarks are worth repeating here. It is refreshing indeed to hear a Labor politician so staunchly defending states' rights, even if in this instance he is completely mistaken in the approach that he has chosen to take. The member for Barton said: </para><quote><para>It is a significant bill. It proposes to override state unfair dismissal laws insofar as those laws apply to corporations. Any instance where this parliament seeks to override state laws is of significance because we are here as part of a federal system of government and we should not ignore the significance of this parliament attempting to override state laws.</para></quote><para>The member for Barton is from New South Wales and, as a member of the Labor Party, is presumably happy with the continued restriction of business and employment opportunity represented by his party's long established policy of `cosyfication'—and I admit that I have made that word up—with the unions. I am from Queensland, where the present government, as its opening act of vandalism on assuming office in 1998, destroyed the sensible industrial relations reforms that I put in place as the relevant Queensland minister in 1996-97. So I declare a particular interest in seeing a continuation of Commonwealth improvements to the workplace environment and to business prospects.</para><para>It is, I suppose, possible that this legislation might lead to duplication of resources— I stress, in a very limited area—but there are two things to say about that. The first is that in a federation there will inevitably be some duplication across jurisdictions. The second thing to say about it is that it is a sterile argument and one that is, frankly, not altogether germane to this debate. Passing this bill—which I support as sensible policy and which, ever hopeful, I commend to the Labor Party—would provide better support for small business as a major employer of Australians. State jurisdictions would still have powers in areas where the Commonwealth's writ did not run. That is how we have always run our federation anyway. And I think if they are honest with themselves, honourable members opposite would admit that. </para><para>The member for Barton, in the other place, has not persuaded me that he is speaking with anything other than continued repression of small business and enterprise in his mind. I am far more persuaded by the argument of our side: by the argument of this government and of my friend and colleague the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I suggest to honourable members opposite that the sun will still rise—and in the east—and set in the west, and the stars will continue to shine, if we pass this bill, which I support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13038</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am sure that the former shadow minister in the other place, the member for Barton, would like to know that his words were taken note of in the Senate and I wait with great joy now for the words of the new shadow minister, the member for Rankin, Craig Emerson.

It is a regurgitation of the same old line that this government have put up over a period of time. As some of my colleagues have said, it is a very cynical approach to industrial relations and shows the vacuum there is in government policy when they have to keep turning up bills such as this. If you read the second reading speech you can see the jargon that is in it. One catches on very quickly that this is but another desperate attempt by the government, because in the second reading speech they say:</para><quote><para>A more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs.</para></quote><para>That is as far as it goes. There is no detail, no explanation and no justification—just the rhetoric. Further on in the second reading speech we find a little bit of the reason for this attempt to get uniformity. They quote the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research study which was referred to by the previous speaker. They note: </para><quote><para>Based on a Yellow Pages survey of nearly 2,000 small to medium businesses, the study found that almost a third of businesses did not know whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws.</para></quote><para>I find that quite surprising. I think 30 per cent is really quite low. I would have thought the figure would be far higher, because my experience in industrial relations has shown that employers, and particularly small employers, invariably are unaware of whether they are covered by a state or federal award. They do not know anything about the industrial relations system whatsoever. So I find it quite surprising that only 30 per cent responded that they were uncertain as to whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>I would have expected, in responses to questions in that survey, that the survey would have at least found out if the people knew whether they were under a federal or state system. As I said, I think they would have found that a large number of those respondents would not have known what system covered them. That is very important because my ongoing experience in industrial relations—as a former branch secretary of the SDA in Queensland over a 15-year period, and now as the branch president for at least the last seven years—tells me that there are still many employers who do not know the difference between state and federal jurisdiction and do not know the difference between state awards and federal awards.</para><para>If one knows the federal system, one knows that there are not a great number of small employers who are covered by federal awards. Invariably they fall through the system and get caught under the state award systems. In Queensland, common rule awards apply so that those employers who fall through the federal award system get caught invariably by state awards. The industry that I have been involved in over a long period of time, the retail industry, covers a large number of small to medium retailers who operate over the state and over a wide span of trading and working hours. They are invariably caught up by the shop assistants award in Queensland. Of course, that is important to the employees who work in many of those places. If one knows anything about the trade union movement, one knows that it is difficult to organise, particularly in those small business areas. Regardless of our ability and capacity as a union to be able to organise in those small business areas—because many of the businesses are owner operated business or they have a limited number of employees who may work casually to assist the owner operator out of a bit of a hole once or twice a week so that the person gets some spare time—invariably where there are employees, they are caught by the state award. We keep the state award up to date. My union in Queensland prides itself in taking a great deal of care and attention to ensure that the conditions in that award mirror what can be negotiated in many of our enterprise bargaining arrangements through our federal award system. Whilst they are not always to the same level as in the federal awards, they nonetheless maintain very good standards and very good conditions indeed.</para><para>We then know that the people that we represent—whilst some of them may not be members of the union, there are those that are—do have access to a range of benefits that are not covered in a federal award or a federal agreement. To people in many of these small enterprises these benefits include having reasonable working hours; having a proper starting and ceasing time; having a roster; having proper leave conditions, such as sick leave and annual leave; and, most importantly, having access to unfair dismissal laws. There is no doubt, based on my experience with many small retailers, that the problem of unfair dismissal does exist and that people are quite unfairly dismissed because it suits the purpose of the employer rather than for any good, cogent reason. The industry churns people over, unfortunately, to the disadvantage of the employees. </para><para>The fact that people in these small enterprises can, and have the right to, access unfair dismissal laws is important indeed. But my experience has been that over a long period of time, whilst the access has been there, it has not been overly used by employees in the small business area. It has been quite the opposite: most of the cases that the union— that is the SDA—has been associated with have involved employers that would be quite rightly titled as very large, major employers in the retail industry. I think that in any 12-month period one could reasonably count on both hands cases involving smaller employers that actually get to some formal proceedings in the commission. Those cases that are taken up are invariably resolved in conciliation conferences before the industrial commission.</para><para>The government is making much ado about nothing with this piece of legislation. The submission that the SDA, as a national organisation, put into the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which considered this legislation, really gets to the nub of many of the concerns of the SDA. Of course, the SDA is a union that has a highly casual membership content. Part-time work has become popular in recent years. It has become popular with some of the retail firms primarily because of the insistence of the union in negotiations on employee enterprise bargaining agreements. This has been to ensure that the unsatisfactory casual employment which the employers were making available to the employees was changed from that unstable form of employment into a more stable form: part-time employment. No-one should be under any illusion that either part-time or casual employment satisfies the needs of people who want full-time employment.</para><para>We have an industry where there are many people who are working in precarious employment, who are working with small employers, who have more than one job and who change jobs on a regular basis because of the mobility within the industry. If this particular bill were to apply to those people then they would see some of their rights immediately ripped right away from them because of the desire in the bill to stretch the probation period to six months—where it is three months for everyone else—and the proposal in the bill that if a person is unfairly dismissed and they seek remedy then the maximum compensation is three months for people in small businesses. So immediately we have, in an industry which is highly casualised, people in highly precarious employment finding themselves the subject of a bill which could severely disadvantage them. Anyone with a good conscience would have to reject that and say that it is completely unfair to create a distinct second-class group of people in the work force whose rights are fettered by the type of bill that is before the chamber this evening.</para><para>What makes it even more concerning is that we are not just dealing with people who are casual employees but we are dealing with many people who are young and who do not have great deal of knowledge about their rights. We are also dealing with a large number of women who are coming back into the work force after having absented themselves in many instances for family duties. They go back into casual employment and so find themselves in precarious employment and we have the government trying to push through a bill that would see these people denied their basic rights. These people are the most vulnerable in the employment market and who could, and would, be quite easily exploited if this legislation were to succeed. </para><para>As I said, the SDA made in its submission to the inquiry what I thought was a quite fair and balanced statement. It says:</para><quote><para>The SDA starts from the principle that all people are entitled to fair and equal treatment. This Bill would deny some workers but especially those in small businesses that fundamental right.</para></quote><para>We are not dealing with anything trivial; we are dealing with a fundamental right that gives people the dignity that they are entitled to in our society. The submission goes on to draw attention to this fact:</para><quote><para>These amendments would particularly disadvantage young workers and women returning to the workforce after an absence therefrom.</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para>Every time a worker started a new job, if it was in a small business, the probationary period would apply anew.</para></quote><para>So we see that a group is going to be unfairly exposed because of the ideological dictates that rule the people on the other side of this chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Oh, Hoggie!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Well, Carlton aren't doing any good, and you know that. I want to refer briefly now, in view of my time, to the Queensland government, because it was raised by the previous speaker. It is worth while looking briefly at the submission of the Queensland government to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. I will quote a couple of appropriate comments from that submission which show the attitude of the government. The Queensland government—a fine government under the stewardship of Peter Beattie—claims that it was not consulted properly in relation to this particular bill. The submission from the Queensland government states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Despite the repeated claims of the federal Minister, the Bill does not simplify industrial laws for employers or employees but makes a very complex federal system even worse. ... The Bill does not achieve an equitable balance between the rights of employers and employees but strongly favours employers to the detriment of employees. It takes away workers' rights under state laws without consulting the states, seriously compromising the Queensland government's economic, social and labour policies and its mandate to deliver a balanced and fair industrial relations system to the people of Queensland.</para></quote><para>That is the Queensland government's view of this piece of legislation. The Queensland government in its submission goes on to outline a number of problems that it sees with the legislation. I will turn to the report of the committee to go through those, because the committee's summing up at the end of those points is particularly pertinent indeed. Page 20 of the report says:</para><quote><para>The submission from the Queensland Government points out that far from resulting in improved legislation, as the Government claims, the bill establishes:</para></quote><para>·	two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent—</para><para>that is obvious—</para><para>·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;</para><para>·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';</para><para>·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; and </para><para>·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).</para><para>This is the environment that is being created. The report goes on, as I said, to really sum it up:</para><quote><para>Therefore, a state award employee of a constitutional corporation with a claim for unfair dismissal and withholding of wages would need to lodge claims in both federal and state jurisdictions, one for the unfair dismissal component, and the other for the wages component. Employers, who complain now about time wasted in court under the current law will find the regime proposed under this bill to be even more onerous.</para></quote><para>I refer back to my opening remark: the claim in the second reading speech was that the reason for the unified national workplace relations system was to take away complexity, lower costs and create more jobs. I do not believe that can be seen to have happened. I believe that if we are to have a system that protects people's basic rights, that is fair, that is equitable, that applies commonsense, that people understand very easily and that lacks complexity then the bill that the government have presented here is not the path to go down. That does not mean to say that there cannot be, and should not be, some form of uniformity. The main thing that the government have got wrong here is the vehicle that they are using to try to achieve it. What they are trying to do is discriminatory to a particular class of workers, which I have a great affection for and have represented over a long period of time. I believe they should not be disadvantaged by the passage of this piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13042</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> is the latest attempt by the Howard government to undermine the rights of working people.

The Senate has rejected its many attempts to erode the rights of people who are unfairly dismissed by small business employers, so the government has dreamt up a new plan of attack.</para></talk.start><para>The bill proposes to extend the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in unfair dismissal laws from 50 per cent of employees to around 85 per cent, or seven million people. At the same time, the Commonwealth government is seeking to diminish the rights of workers who are unfairly dismissed and take away the rights of redress that these workers currently have under state laws. Because the extension of federal jurisdiction relies on the Commonwealth's corporations power in the Constitution, employees of unincorporated businesses will not be covered. This means that around 15 per cent of employees will remain outside the so-called national unified scheme.</para><para>The Commonwealth, after having foisted this law on the states without consultation, wants the states to replicate the federal law or refer state powers to the Commonwealth so that these excluded employees can be picked up by the federal scheme. At the same time as the bill seeks to raise additional barriers for employees who make a claim for unfair dismissal, it weakens the remedies for workers employed by small business who are unfairly dismissed and it disadvantages casual employees, who will be subjected to a 12-month waiting period before they can make a claim for unfair dismissal.</para><para>The Greens will not support measures to undermine the protection of working people. We have been presented with no evidence that justifies discriminating against small business employees when it comes to protecting them against unfair dismissal, or their seeking reinstatement or compensation for wrongful loss of employment. The Australian Greens support the concept of a national industrial relations system that delivers good outcomes. That clearly is not the case here. We might have been inclined to consider more favourably supporting the part of the bill that extends the Commonwealth's powers had the bill improved protection for all employees and not been linked to another bid to undermine the rights of employees who are unfairly dismissed. </para><para>In effect, the government is using the expansion of its powers as a cover for extending its objectionable policies. Given the government's record, it is difficult to imagine that it could propose any industrial relations measures that would deliver good outcomes. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, has said:</para><quote><para>Greater uniformity in unfair dismissal legislation will provide substantial benefits for employees and employers through reduced complexity and greater certainty about the application of legislation.</para></quote><para>It is worth noting that the Howard government's desire for a unified industrial relations system sits oddly with the government's general approach of divesting itself of responsibility for, and leadership on, a range of policy matters that rightly demand Commonwealth involvement—for example, the protection of the environment. The idea of increasing the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, something the Australian Greens support, is also at odds with the government's history of trying to scale back the commission's relevance by stripping it of powers such as the power to settle disputes.</para><para>More significantly, this bill would not deliver what the government and the minister claim to be its main goal: a national system. On the one hand, the government wants to capture most Australian workers within the ambit of the federal scheme while, on the other, it wants to treat some employees—that is, those employed by small business—less fairly than others. This contradiction is another reason the Australian Greens think the minister is simply using the extension of Commonwealth powers as a cover for what he has been unable to achieve through stand-alone legislation: exempting small business from federal unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>The bill certainly does not remove the confusion and complexities of the dual industrial relations system that the minister claims is its driving motivation for the legislation. On the contrary, even if the bill were to pass it would exclude a significant number of employees of, for instance, sole traders, charities, unincorporated companies and state government bodies. In addition, some businesses would be subject to a federal unfair dismissal regime while other aspects of their business would be subject to state law. Then there would be two types of federal unfair dismissal law: a lesser standard of protection for people employed by small business and another standard for everyone covered by the Commonwealth legislation. Far from being national and unified, the scheme would be fragmented and confusing.</para><para>The Greens are also concerned about the lack of consultation with the states on this and Minister Abbott's high-handed approach of imposing this system on the states. Were the federal government genuine about wanting a national scheme, it would have sought to work cooperatively with the states. So what is the government really up to? The Greens believe that it is more of what we have come to expect from the coalition: shifting the balance of power away from employees and in favour of business. Not content with proposing to expand the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in unfair dismissal to seven million employees, the government wants to prohibit those people who are brought within the scope of this bill from seeking remedies for unfair dismissal in state schemes. </para><para>This bill would further undermine the rights of all employees covered by the federal regime by restricting the circumstances in which an employee of any business can take action against unfair dismissal, including where an employee is dismissed purportedly on operational grounds. We can find no check proposed to prevent this provision from being abused. This would appear to be a minimum requirement, particularly in light of the ACTU's submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, which identified employers' use of operational requirements to target particular employees on grounds including age and union activity. The bill also reduces any back pay component of compensation where a dismissed employee has had the opportunity to earn income from another source since being sacked.</para><para>Even further restrictions are imposed by this bill on employees of small business. It should be noted, as others have, that the number of unfair dismissal cases against small business has fallen in recent years from 3,218 cases in 1998 to 2,168 cases in the year to last November. Claims against small business as a percentage of all claims also fell, from 40 per cent to 30 per cent, in the same period.</para><para>Nevertheless, the government wants to go further, imposing additional restrictions on employees of small business including doubling from three to six months the waiting period before an employee of small business can take action if they are unfairly dismissed; denying an employee their day in court by allowing the Industrial Relations Commission to dismiss an application on the papers while requiring the commission to consider the cost of the employer attending the hearing; halving the applicable maximum amount of compensation that a dismissed employee can be granted to either three months salary or, for non-award employees, $20,400. Also, the commission can be directed to consider an employer's capacity to pay when determining a remedy or an amount of compensation, a provision that those working outside small business do not have to encounter. In addition, there would be the removal of the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to consider whether an employee was warned about unsatisfactory behaviour prior to being dismissed. This is particularly alarming when combined with the absence of a requirement for an employer to warn an employee about unsatisfactory behaviour before sacking a worker. It is only fair and reasonable that an employee has a right to be told that their behaviour is unsatisfactory and be given the opportunity to address an employer's concerns before being dismissed. The absence of such a direction and the removal of the commission's ability to take such a matter into account further demonstrate how this bill undermines the protection and rights of working people. So the government is trying to raise the hurdle for employees who are unfairly dismissed and reduce the compensation that they may be awarded.</para><para>On top of being unfair, the focus of these provisions is misdirected. They are aimed at reducing costs to small business and they do nothing to discourage employers from sacking people unfairly. In fact, these claims that make it harder for an employee to take a claim against their employer where they believe they have been unfairly dismissed could encourage some employers to abuse their power. The New South Wales Labor Council has provided a number of examples about how workers protected by the state unfair dismissal law in New South Wales would be disadvantaged under this bill, and, as a New South Wales senator, I would like to share those with the Senate. One is about an employee who injured their shoulder at home and was given medical clearance to return to work. They were dismissed after the company's nominated doctor said that returning was a safety risk. The employee's union made a successful application for the person to be reinstated under a state provision that protects injured workers. No such provision exists in this bill. </para><para>Another employee was moved to a permanent position after working as a casual but was then sacked five weeks later for refusing to move to night shift work. Her letter of employment did not contain a probationary period so she was able to take a claim for unfair dismissal, which she won. Under the federal bill this would have been impossible because of the compulsory three-month probation period when she went to a permanent position.</para><para>Under this legislation employees of small business who are unfairly dismissed would be excluded from lodging a claim until they have been employed for at least six months, whilst casual employees would be excluded for 12 months and only eligible if they have been employed on a regular and systematic basis. In New South Wales there was a casual sales assistant in a small bookshop who was dismissed on the basis of a lack of hours available at the same time that the employer was advertising for new casual positions. The employee was able to settle the claim for unfair dismissal under the state scheme but would not have been able to do so under the federal scheme because they had not been employed for 12 months. </para><para>In the New South Wales law there is no qualifying period for casual workers who are employed on a regular and systematic basis. For those casual workers who are not employed on a regular and systematic basis the exclusion period is six months. I know that in other states, in Western Australia and Tasmania, there is no exclusion period for casual employees. Given the growth of casual work, and particularly the casual work carried out by female workers, the 12-month exclusion period for casual employees would open the way for unscrupulous employers to exploit casual workers further and encourage greater use of casuals rather than permanent employees so as to avoid the application of this law. In addition, in New South Wales workers in regional and rural areas—and this may apply to other states as well—under this law would have to travel to the capital city to attend hearings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, whereas currently in New South Wales the Industrial Relations Commission provides for hearings in towns outside Sydney.</para><para>On top of the long list of objections to this bill there is a cost to implement it. The government has set aside $16.8 million over four years for the expansion of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that would be required to implement this proposal. The Greens believe this is a terrible waste of public funds not least of all because it duplicates existing state resources that will still be required even if the proposed federal expansion in the area of unfair dismissal laws were to proceed. The Greens say that the $16.8 million could be far better spent investing in job creation and training and it would yield a far better return than investing in a scheme that the government argues with a straight face will encourage jobs growth by making it easier to sack people.</para><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made it clear that this bill is the start of the coalition's project to centralise industrial relations under the Commonwealth. Of course his predecessor, Peter Reith, embarked on a similar undertaking, without much success aside from the support that he obtained from the former Victorian Liberal Premier, Jeff Kennett, and many Victorian workers continue to suffer as a result. In the absence of cooperation from the states, Minister Abbott has decided to force this dramatic shift onto the nation. This approach is not conducive to good outcomes. Regulation should protect the rights of the parties to a workplace relationship, guard against exploitation, and deliver fair wages and working conditions. A regulatory regime should act as a counterweight to the power an employer has over an employee, a power imbalance inherent in most working relationships. </para><para>The Greens are attracted to the idea of all employees having the same high standards of protection and rights under a national regulatory regime, but we cannot support this move by the coalition government because it does not deliver a unified national scheme; rather, it is a `not quite' national regime with lots of exemptions. What it does provide comes at too high a price, reducing the protection and rights of working people. That is because the government has confused long-term goals with short-term self-interest and political expediency. The government's determination to force its views on the states rather than to approach such a significant undertaking as a national IR system in the spirit of cooperation strengthens our conviction that the coalition's strategy is counterproductive. As such, the Australian Greens will be opposing this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>13046</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you to all honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I would like to sum up the debate by responding to a couple of points from other senators that should not go without response. Senator Nettle needs to fundamentally re-evaluate where the Greens are coming from on these issues. They are regarded generally by the government as being irrelevant in this place because 99.98 per cent of the time, or thereabouts, they vote with Labor and they are basically a rebadged radical Left of the Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>To say with a straight face that `the federal government should not impose something on the states against their will' is in contrast to virtually everything else they propose in virtually every other policy area. They would love to impose their views about the environment, about taxation, about social policy, about welfare policy, about education policy and about every other policy without any consultation with the states. The truth about this is that it is a measure proposed by a government that seeks not to protect the vested interests of unionised workers and their representatives but in fact to protect the rights of the whole nation and all of her citizens. If the Greens or the Labor Party senators who oppose this legislation would, instead of listening to the same old vested interests, open their other ear and their hearts to the concept of giving someone who is unemployed a chance in life, of giving someone who cannot get a job and who is not a member of a union a chance of a job, then you could take them seriously. Both the Labor Party—most of their members or many of their members—and the Greens pretend to stand in this parliament for the rights of the downtrodden, yet what they do is make sure that those downtrodden stay down.</para><para>All you have to do is read independent research. All you have to do, instead of hanging out in the trendy cappuccino strips up and down the inner suburbs of Sydney or sipping Chardonnay, is to get out and talk to a few small businesspeople who are trying to develop their businesses, which I am sure the Greens and many friends of the Greens in the Labor Party would generally regard as something that they despise. They do not like business, they do not like free enterprise, they do not like Australian companies developing and building international markets. They do not like trade and commerce. They would rather we all lived in recycled tents and did not eat anything that was packaged. That is really what they are on about, but they quite often do not have the honesty to present that to us in the way that I have starkly done so. </para><para>If they got out, as I know you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, and talked to small businesspeople about the effect of Australia's unfair dismissal laws and about the effects of the industrial relations regimes that many of the state Labor administrations impose on the societies that they govern, they would know that the laws themselves are stopping thousands of people from having a chance in life, of having what many of us regard as something that you just assume and take for granted. We, as Liberals and National Party members in this coalition, would like to see that all people have that right. And what is that? To get out of bed in the morning, put on a set of clothes and go to a job and, at the end of the week, collect some pay and have the choice of buying a cappuccino if that is what they want. But a lot of these people do not have that. We have got six per cent unemployment in this country and these Lefties on the other side of the chamber will condemn that six per cent to stay there. They say, `We care about the workers.' Well, you do not. We want to create more workers. The facts are blatantly obvious but the Greens senator over there cannot see them, but not because the facts are not there to see—because you can go and talk to people across the country.</para><para>You do not even have to accept the Harding report, <inline font-style="italic">The effect of unfair dismissal laws on small and medium businesses</inline>, from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne, dated last year. You do not have to accept that report and the work that has gone into it; you can actually leave the cappuccino shop, leave the wine bar—the Chardonnay place—get up from your comfortable stool and walk around and talk to people. This is what Professor Harding did. Don Harding went out there and he spoke to people. Of the people he spoke to, 47.9 per cent reported that their businesses' recruitment and selection decisions are influenced by the unfair dismissal laws. Professor Harding reported changes to recruitment and selection practices, include the following: greater use of fixed term contracts in over 10 per cent of the businesses—11.6 to be exact.</para><para>Senator Nettle was talking about the casualisation of the work force and the impact of that. When an employer is so worried about the potential impact and cost of the unfair dismissal laws that they are cautious about putting on a new full-time employee, what is one of the natural reactions? Put them on as a casual. So what happens? Increased employment of casuals, rather than permanent staff, by 21.3 per cent of the businesses—a phenomenal figure.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>13047</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Withdrawal</title><page.no>13047</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13047</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 relating to disallowance of the Space Activities Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 1). </para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13047</page.no><id.no>R1672</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13047</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13048</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before the suspension of sitting for the dinner break we were concluding the second reading debate of the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. I was drawing the attention of the Senate to the sadness of the position taken by Labor, the Greens and, from time to time but with not as great a degree of severity, the Democrats in relation to reform of unfair dismissal laws and industrial relations laws in Australia and also to the importance of industrial relations laws and the role a good workplace relations environment—not only in the workplace but also in the law, regulations and systems of justice—plays in developing a sound economy and therefore providing employment opportunities for all Australians. It is most important for those Australians—measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from time to time, averaging about six per cent—who are classified, for statistical purposes, as unemployed.</para></talk.start><para>There are, of course, people behind those statistics. There are mothers and fathers who hold hopes for their teenage children, having put them through school and sometimes TAFE, and who are sad because their offspring do not have the opportunity to get a job—an opportunity, as I said before the suspension, that most of us in this building take for granted and many of us have taken for granted all our lives because we are the lucky ones. But there are lots who do not have that and they are the people I referred to before—those who get out of bed in the morning and do not have that special feeling of belonging to our society, which is felt by those people who can go to work and share the experiences of the workplace with fellow workers and have the freedom of being remunerated at the end of the week.</para><para>It is a tragedy that the majority in the Senate so often say no to opportunity and so often vote against measures in this place which offer to empower those who aspire to work, when the evidence is so stark. Unfortunately it does not matter how much evidence, either anecdotal or through the distinguished work of people such as Don Harding in the University of Melbourne report of last year, shows that this particular provision could make such a significant difference to the employment opportunities and the employment intentions of the employers. The report that I quoted prior to the suspension stated that just over one-third, in fact 33.4 per cent, of businesses reported that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws increased their business costs. The Harding report conservatively estimates that compliance with the unfair dismissal laws costs small and medium businesses $1.329 billion—that is, $1,329 million—and that figure is in table 19 on page 19 of the report. This cost impacts most heavily on businesses with 20 or fewer employees—the total estimated cost of this group being $839.912 million. That figure is on the following page of that report. That is a phenomenal cost for businesses to bear. When you think of the alternative investments to which that sort of cost can be put, you wonder at the massive unmet potential that this nation has.</para><para>In fact, our new Governor-General, in his brief words to the Senate this morning, talked about how great this nation was in terms of its people, but I picked up that he also mentioned the word `potential'. This government is dedicated to unleashing the potential of this country. The core potential of this country is actually in its citizens. It is a national disgrace that we allow six per cent of the work force to remain unemployed when we have at our fingertips the potential to give those people more opportunities whilst balancing the very important measures contained in the law to protect workers, whether unionised or non-unionised, from a boss who may seek to unfairly dismiss someone. You would think from listening to the senators opposite that we are throwing away all their rights; we are not. We are actually protecting their rights but what we are saying in this bill in particular is: let us move to a simpler and fairer system to extend our protections across the nation by moving towards a single system. Potentially, at the moment, an employer across Australia could be subject to six or seven different jurisdictions and sets of rules; under a single system, they would be subject to only two sets of rules at the very most and possibly only to one. It is a significant move. </para><para>The bigger issue is: how long can the Labor Party, with the strong support of the radical left wing faction of the Labor Party who go out and promote themselves—and I steal one of Senator Andrew Murray's lines when he talks about truth in political advertising— have as false and misleading a title as the Greens? These are people who really are opposed to anything. They are opposed to free enterprise; they are opposed to business in virtually all its forms; they are opposed to trade and commerce across borders, which is called globalisation. They are scared of it or they do not like it because it could actually make the economy grow—and they do not like a growing economy. If the Greens had their way, along with their comrades in the Left of the Labor Party, they would actually shrink the economy and shrink living standards. That is one of their unwritten goals: they do not like an expanding economy where people have greater opportunities and where free enterprise and a liberal economy give people opportunities. They would rather shrink the economy. They call themselves the Greens because I guess they have to give themselves a title that appeals to the current political orthodoxy or to a niche that will get them just enough votes to squeeze them into a seat in the Senate. They can only call themselves the Greens because they do not actually follow pro-environmental policies.</para><para>I think the Australian Democrats, who are trying to create their own post Natasha Stott Despoja destiny, need to think very carefully about their position on some of these issues. You can in fact care about workers, care about unionised workers and support the reform of unfair dismissal laws. You can care about the environment without taking the same negative, carping antidevelopment attitudes of the Greens. The Greens entered into the realm of hypocrisy in relation to environmental policy when they supported a measure that was defeated in the Senate during our last sitting. On the last day of sitting, we put through a bill and the Greens supported a Labor amendment to effectively drive cargo off coastal shipping and onto Australian roads—in other words, increase the consumption of diesel, if you can believe this, take heavy goods off coastal shipping by taking the rebate off the diesel that gets used in coastal shipping and make coastal shipping more expensive vis-a-vis trucks on our roads. They actually voted for that.</para><para>It was one opportunity where the Greens could have thought about it for a nanosecond and said, `Hang on. Here's one thing we can vote with the government on.' It was one time when they could have wrenched themselves away from their comrades in the Labor Party and voted with the government. It was an opportunity to say, `No, Labor Party, you've got it wrong this time. We don't believe you are doing the right thing by the environment. You're actually forcing cargo off coastal shipping and onto Australian roads—chewing up roads, chewing up tyres, chewing up distillate and creating more greenhouse gas emissions.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It's bizarre.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I could understand Labor doing what they did, Senator McGauran, because they had to vote to support their fraternal brothers in the Maritime Union. They want to destroy coastal shipping and make sure that only ships that are flagged in Australia can run the coastal routes. You can actually understand why Labor did it. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the union movement and, under their governance structure, effectively have to vote for the self-interest of their fraternal brothers in the Maritime Union. But the Greens say that they are here to help the environment. So we put it to them on our last sitting day here: vote for the environment, vote to ensure as much cargo as possible gets carried across the seas in ships and let us get some of the cargo off the roads and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. No, they voted the wrong way; they voted against the environment. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The same thing occurs with the Greens' approach to forestry. When we are talking about the use of native forests for timber products, the Greens say, `No, you can't take down a single native tree—not one. What you have to do if you want to use wood is to grow it in plantations.' So they get their way in relation to banning the use of native timber in most states of Australia, and then when someone comes along and says, `I want to buy a bit of dairy farm in Tasmania to put in some plantation timber,' the Greens say no to that as well. So you start to see this pattern developing.</para><para>In Western Australia you see the Greens stopping the Ningaloo Reef proposal, with the support of the Gallop government. A few days after they stopped the proposal to develop the Ningaloo Reef and, in fact, find a way of saving the Ningaloo Reef by developing it sensitively for the environment, they moved up the coast a few hundred miles to Barrow Island and said, `You can't have any development there either.' The challenge to the Greens and to the Democrats is to find something that they actually agree with. In fact, I challenge the Greens to put a dot anywhere on the Western Australian coast showing where they would actually agree to any development at all. There's a challenge! I think my money would be pretty safe when I say that they would not put a dot anywhere.</para><para>I think that challenge links imperatively to this debate about the reform of unfair dismissal laws. If you want a good environment, if you want a healthy environment, if you want a healthy social environment and if you want a stable social environment where people have opportunities, then you need to find ways to develop Australia in an environmentally and socially sustainable way. Having unfair dismissal laws that protect the rights not only of the workers but of those who aspire to work is a vital piece of that. So I make an impassioned plea.

The Democrats, the Labor Party and, I think, all non-government parties and Independents—Senator Harradine— oppose this bill as they have its predecessors. If we do support schedule 1 of the bill before us, which the Democrats do with some amendments, and there is a double dissolution election and the fair dismissal bill passes a joint sitting, which I understand from the various notes has only occurred once in 100 years—but I am not sure I am going to try my luck—then effectively we might be facilitating the exclusion of a much greater number of small business employees from unfair dismissal remedies as a large number of small business employees will be brought in under the expansion of the federal regime. </para><para>There is an absolute contradiction in the government seeking to cover the field and simultaneously seeking to exclude small business employees from the provisions of the federal law on unfair dismissals.

We have been unable to work through some of these issues with our state colleagues in terms of the significant impacts some of these measures might have on them.

Whilst I can understand that Senator Murray would hope that an amended <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>, as suggested here by the Democrats—or perhaps with some even further improvements if we were talking about future second bites—would be an improvement, we would not see at this time this bill being significantly superior to, as Senator Murray has coined it, the `fairly dismal' bill. For that reason we will be opposing this amendment in particular but also the other amendments put forward by the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13052</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have taken the view, when these workplace relations matters have come before us, not to enter into the second reading stage when the issues are being dealt with quite adequately. But I do want to say—and I stand here having a reasonable degree of knowledge about industrial relations over many years—that I am concerned that this legislation is being proceeded with now without the states or the various industrial commissions being consulted. That is of concern to me.</para></talk.start><para>When I was involved in the whole of the industrial relations arena we had a very good record of settlement of industrial disputes and settlement of problems of unfair dismissal. One of the reasons for that was that we believed in the principle of subsidiary function: that power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the function for which the power was required. Nearer government is better than government being imposed by the mainland or somewhere else. It is quite clear that these matters are best dealt with on a state basis so that, as I say, democracy is nearer. You are dealing with the same people and you get, not a cosy relationship between the particular tribunals and the representatives of the employer and the employee but an understanding relationship, with the commissions knowing full well that unless justice is done or is seen to be done there will be ramifications from one side or the other. The important thing is that the interests of the employee must come before the interests, in this particular case, of the organisation or the employer, because if it is a question of unfair dismissal the onus is on the employee to prove that there has been unfair dismissal.</para><para>I appeal to the Democrats and to Senator Murray to have regard to that. I know that during his speech on the second reading debate Senator Murray was talking about the Democrats' policy, which really is more of a centralist policy than one which would accept as important the principle of subsidiary function. I do not accept that. I am surprised, actually, that a Western Australian senator should accept that. Certainly I do not, given the experience of attempts from the mainland, if you like, to take over some of the functions that are quite adequately performed by people in those positions in my state. I know, Mr Temporary Chairman, that I am straying slightly, but I would like to offer that as one of the reasons that I am opposing the amendment, although I understand that Senator Murray is trying to alleviate some of the damage that is being done by this piece of legislation. But I oppose the amendment as moved by Senator Murray. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>13053</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond quickly to some of the points that have been made. Firstly, in relation to the point about consultation that Senator Harradine has made, I think his remarks in relation to the powers of the states are entirely germane to this. I would share with him the philosophy that it is far preferable in a federal system to have decisions made as close to the people as possible and that things should only be brought under the power of the Commonwealth where you can prove that there is benefit to the whole nation and that all people have equal access. A recent example of how that has worked well—and I have to say that I was a sceptic when it was first put through this parliament—was the creation of the then Australian Securities Commission, bringing powers previously exercised by the states in relation to regulating companies under a single national regulatory regime. That has worked particularly well. That was a measure that was supported by the Liberal Party, although I was a less than enthusiastic supporter of it as a new senator in 1990. It was supported by the then shadow spokesman on those matters, a younger Peter Costello.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—Did you say you are younger than Peter Costello?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—No, he was a younger Peter Costello. He is still the same guy. He is still young—he was just younger then. That was one of the important reform measures of the then Hawke government and it was a measure that centralised control and regulation over securities regulation, a regime that had previously been run by six state regulatory corporate affairs offices as well as the National Companies and Securities Commission. The parliament in its wisdom deemed that it would be better to have a single system responsible to the Commonwealth parliament, because we had a lot of businesses that operated across the borders of the states and had to potentially comply with half-a-dozen or more different regimes and quite often had to get registered in a number of different states. </para></talk.start></continue><para>That measure that saw power transfer from the states to the Commonwealth was in fact one such transfer that took place in a successful way. You virtually never hear a complaint from a business in a state that they do not get good access to ASIC or that they do not get decisions made by ASIC close to the ground. You have in your own state, Senator Harradine, an office in Hobart serving the business community. You probably have an office in Launceston as well—I will have to check on that. I have not had any complaints out of Tasmania about ASIC not serving the people of Tasmania—nor have I in Perth, where the business community were very concerned, as I am sure the Tasmanians were at the time, about transferring that power from the corporate affairs offices to a new national regulator. That transfer served Australia well. It is a very similar concern that you raise here, and it is entirely appropriate for you to raise it in this debate, but it is one that is misplaced, because of the overwhelming benefit of having a single regime instead of half-a-dozen different systems.</para><para>Senator Harradine also raised issues about our consultation. We have in fact consulted with the states. We have had these proposals on the table now for three years. They have been raised at workplace relations ministers' council meetings as recently as 28 March. It is fair to say that the states and territories made their view of the bill known very clearly in the communique from that meeting—they were absolutely overwhelmingly opposed to this bill. But, having said that, we did go through the process of trying to get a common position and, as it is—I think it is fair to say on political lines—the state and territory ministers, who all wear the red, white and blue of the Australian Labor Party, oppose the bill and the federal minister, who wears the blue and white of the Liberal Party, supports the bill. We just have to face that political fact. The reality is that the Commonwealth has the power under the Constitution to pass laws for corporations and it is seeking to do that. </para><para>Senator Harradine is raising it from his perspective, but the Labor Party senators are saying we need to find this cosy consensus and have due process and allow discussion. It was, in fact, not that many years ago that the former Keating government sought to impose a uniform national system of laws regulating the termination of employment which relied on the external affairs power over the objections of the then states. I am sure Senator Harradine would have raised similar objections then; I cannot remember them, but I am pretty sure he would have. But clearly Labor Party senators would have been totally silent about the use of the external affairs power to achieve an almost identical policy by the previous Keating government.</para><para>There was one other important question in terms of process in the Senate; that is, that we had this listed at No. 3 or 4 on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> but, to assist a request by the Labor Party to delay a couple of other bills, we have brought this one up on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> quicker than even I anticipated.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—Lunchtime today.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Exactly, but it brought it up the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, because we acceded to the Labor Party's request to delay one or two other bills.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—By one hour.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—No, there are measures on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> that could have taken a day or so to debate, and they have been delayed so you can discuss them at your caucus tomorrow.

I suspect—although I cannot say I know—that at the time of bringing the Corporations Law under national law there was probably not too much opposition from the states, for very good reason. There is very good reason for proceeding to have national law apply in that sense. But we are dealing here with a totally different concept. We are dealing here with the dismissal laws that affect employees in different states. If you were to have, as I said earlier, a truly national application of industrial relations laws, then you would have a national set of standards in respect of wages and conditions. But we do not have that; we simply do not have it. It is appropriate that dismissal laws applicable in each state get dealt with at the state level, because that is where it is best understood. That is why not only can I not support the amendment that we are debating at the moment, which is the amendment on the commencement date, but I cannot support any amendment by the Democrats to the legislation—I simply do not support the legislation. </para></talk.start><para>If we were to spend our time effectively in this place, our debate would concern other measures in connection with small business in this country and what we could do for it, such as effect changes to the taxation laws.

Apparently unfair dismissal takes up a vast amount of state commissions' times— which is a bit of a shame when you consider that there are much more important things to be done in the field of industrial relations. Concern was also raised that workers in regional and rural areas who currently can attend local courts visited by state commissioners would incur increased costs to attend the federal commission, which some expected would be based solely in capital cities. My first thought was to mandate that state commissioners would have to deal with these for the Commonwealth, but of course I cannot do that constitutionally. So this really enshrines a principle which is already established: Commonwealth and states share these jurisdictions, I think, in two states. The intention is simply to ask, subject to an agreement—which there would have to be between the Commonwealth and the respective states—that members of those commissions could share the duties in this area.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13057</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a few comments as Labor's response to Senator Murray's comments on this occasion.

This is one of the reasons that I want to move these amendments separately. We are taking the fairly brave stand of supporting the intent of the government to have as far as possible just one unfair dismissals jurisdiction for all Australian employees— which I suggest will happen one of these days if not today—but we also need to move forward in terms of the definition of an employee.</para></talk.start><para>One of the dangers of practitioners in workplace relations law, industrial relations law or, indeed, even political parties is that they become stuck in what has been rather than what is. There is a need to constantly move forward in understanding changed employee relationships and to look behind the veils—sometimes in terms of entities, sometimes in the way people work and sometimes in the way they are hired and managed—to see whether the employee relationship is a genuine one. It has struck us for some time— and it probably has struck other senators in other parties—that the definition of employee is extremely poorly developed in federal law. Senators in the chamber will remind me, but I am pretty certain that in the act there is no definition of an employee. </para><para>In this there is a strange contradiction. My experience and knowledge is that the government has always supported the notion that genuine employees should have access to unfair dismissals law, except of course with their peculiar small business exemption idea. Once again, I would say that it is also the view of the Labor Party that any genuine employee should have access to the provisions of the law. I dare to suggest, without having asked them, that that would also be true of the opinion of the Greens and the Independents. You have to say to yourself, `In what respect is the law deficient?' The law is deficient in the sense that there is a lack of certainty at the edges as to what constitutes an employee. The states have tried to make some inroads on this but in my view are still constrained by past cases and past relationships.</para><para>I have tried in this definition to look behind that and to go for principles about the relationship of employee and employer. Of course I have needed some expert help, and in that sense I have turned to Professor Andrew Stewart, who is a real authority in this area. I looked at some work he has done and plagiarised it for the purpose of this amendment. If you are out there, Professor Stewart, thank you very much. Your good work is here and I think it advances the law quite considerably. There are some key elements I would pick up on. For instance, part of the amendment says: </para><quote><para>(2) In determining whether a worker is genuinely carrying on a business, regard must be had to those of the following factors which are relevant in the circumstances of the case:</para><para>(a) the substance and practical reality of the relationship between the parties, and not merely the formally agreed terms;</para></quote><para>A legal construct which is designed to evade the employee relationship you can get around by looking at the actual substance of it. If a person is carrying tools, driving a truck or hired by a labour agency, it does not necessarily make them a contract worker. In many of those cases they will be an employee.</para><para>There is another area which I would pick on briefly as I go through this amendment: tax law. This chamber gave all-party support, and I think Independent support too, to the alienation of services income legislation. Under that legislation, the tax office can make a personal services determination in relation to the worker, pursuant to subdivision 87-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, in connection with work of the client performed by them. That act says that for purposes of tax you can be determined—not deemed, but determined—to be an employee by the tax office, because of the alienation of personal services income. Yet a person who is determined as an employee and who must pay tax as an employee under that legislation might not be determined as an employee under the federal workplace relations act or under some of the state IR acts. That is just crazy. If there is anything which defines you as an employee, it has to be the tax you pay and the way you can make your individual income tax claims under the tax act.

I congratulate Senator Murray for the work that he has done with contributions for others to look for a more updated definition of employee to fit with current labour market practices. Having not had the opportunity to look through the definition, and as Senator Murray pointed out, there may well be more comments and proposals to be made to refine this area. I am not able to support the amendment at this stage, but certainly the Australian Greens support moves to deal with this complex and ever more emerging issue.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13061</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I could simply say `ditto' in terms of any attempt to establish a simpler, more certain definition of a genuine employee. However, Senator Murray, in your comments you alluded to a few of the issues that are, at this stage, creating problems for the Labor Party. One of those is the inroads that have been achieved in some states and, certainly for me at the moment, a lack of certainty about how what you have put here may impact on arrangements that do currently exist in some states. For instance, Senator Hutchins is far more intimately aware of what can be achieved for contractors in the New South Wales jurisdiction and he may well want to follow through some of those details with you.</para></talk.start><para>Again, without the time to absorb the detailed work that Senator Murray has put into concentrating on the principles of what it is to be a genuine employee, we are left with the position that, at this stage, we cannot support such a move.

Until we grapple with this area seriously, we will have ongoing problems of regulation of labour relations into the future.

I have only had an opportunity in the last half hour or so to have a look at the proposed amendments. From my background, I am familiar with the difficulties of defining a person's position to make sure that they are eligible to seek fairness before a tribunal. Senator Nettle correctly said that, in a rapidly changing environment within the work force, there is a real need to look quickly at how we deal with it, whether it is in the state or the federal jurisdiction. There is an attempt to cover outworkers in the amendments. I understand that only two jurisdictions have a definition of outworkers; the rest of them do not. Particularly in relation to what may be called lorry owner drivers or contract carriers, it does not appear to me to be clear in the proposed amendment that they would be at all allowed access to some jurisdiction. Maybe Senator Murray will answer that, but I know from the New South Wales jurisdiction that it has taken well over 50 years to try to correctly define what may be a lorry owner driver or a contract carrier and to make sure that they have access to a tribunal in relation to unfair dismissal and unfair contracts, or even to argue the situation with goodwill if they are terminated on that basis. </para></talk.start><para>I said in my speech on the second reading debate that I have drafted a private members bill that I hope will address a particular injustice that is occurring in Canberra at the moment, affecting 18 lorry owner drivers who work for Boral. I understand that Senator Lundy may mention this later this evening. I believe that to expand the definition is very important. This is not something that has not been discussed or debated. In fact, in New South Wales the definitions of what an owner driver or a contract carrier may be went twice to the Privy Council in the 1960s. There was a significant debate in the New South Wales parliament to make sure that it was got right. I do not oppose it, but I want to make sure that it is got right and that we do not create problems for ourselves in putting through something that, with all good intentions, may not be the answer.</para><para>I have had no lobbying from organisations with interests in this area. They may not be aware or they may not see that this is the answer that has been proposed. If they read the definition they would see that it may well exclude people who own trucks whose trucks are not painted in the company colours. They may not be subject to the direction and control of an employer on a day-to-day basis; nevertheless, under legislation in New South Wales people in that position may be covered by a tribunal that allows them to be reinstated if they are unfairly dismissed. This is not something that can just be done without giving consideration to a situation in one state.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13062</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no risk in Democrats amendment (3), and I commend Senator Murray for bringing it forward. The worst that can happen with this amendment is that a person is found not to be an employee for the purposes of section 170CB. If that happens and they are picked up by state legislation, they will have a right of recourse in respect of unfair dismissal under that state legislation. Whilst this is a covering the field piece of legislation, it only covers the field in respect of employees as defined by this legislation. If any categories fall outside the definition in the Democrats amendment, they are picked up under state law.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I am quite convinced that the amendment we are moving today goes much further in defining contract employees than the broad definition of employee under the state laws of South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales which I have checked, although I concede Senator Hutchins's point that the schedule of deemed employees at the back of the New South Wales act does go much further. In respect of that list in New South Wales law, we were conscious of the fact that, whilst the definition of employee in the New South Wales act is fairly old-fashioned and narrow—and I think this definition is much broader—there is that great long list of deemed classes of employees. That is why we put in 170CBA(2)(h), which requires the commission to take into account the provisions of state law which would have applied if this act did not apply. So that large schedule in the New South Wales act is to be taken into account by the commission.</para><para>This is a very exciting amendment which we are moving. I do not usually get excited about industrial relations law but this particular provision does excite me as a senator for Queensland. If we pass this bill with this amendment and the next one Senator Murray will move in respect of casual employees, and if we delete the provisions which the Democrats oppose, this bill will create an unfair dismissal jurisdiction better and fairer for employees than the one that currently applies in Queensland. It will also be better than the one that currently applies for employees in Victoria. It will be largely the same for employees in New South Wales, marginally better for employees in South Australia and, arguably, about the same for employees in WA and Tasmania. When you are talking about a system which is going to be better for the states of Queensland and Victoria—about half the population of Australia—and the same, broadly speaking, for employees in two other states, you are really talking about a significant advance. In addition to that, you have the economic efficiency arguments which come into play because of the fact that we are moving to a single system. </para><para>I note that the definition we are moving, which arose from the research by Professor Stewart, has been picked up by the independent Review of the South Australian Industrial Relations System. This review, conducted by former Deputy President of the Industrial Relations Commission of South Australia Greg Stevens, reported to the South Australian government in October last year. In that report, former Deputy President Stevens quoted from one of the submissions to the review:</para><quote><para>The fact is that any competent lawyer can take almost any form of employment relationship and reconstruct it as something that the common law would treat as a relationship between principal and contractor (or contractor and sub-contractor), thereby avoiding the effect of legislation ...</para></quote><para>The review looked at Professor Stewart's recommendation and reported:</para><quote><para>The Review considers that the proposition raised in this submission provides a positive way of dealing with this issue and provides the capacity to modernise the definition of employment, which has failed to keep pace with contemporary industrial and employment practice. This approach should also allow the distinction between an employee and a true contractor to be more clearly made. If approved by the South Australian Government—</para></quote><para>and I am pleased Senator Buckland is here to hear this—</para><quote><para>this, or a similar, definition should remove the need for expanded deeming arrangements under the ... Act and those amendments to the definition of industrial matter, contract of employment, employee and employer ... which are tied to the presence of an employment relationship at common law.</para></quote><para>I would also note that the second part of this amendment picks up provisions under the Queensland act which allows the full bench of the commission, at the application of a union, to make general rulings about who is in and who is out. This will allow the creation of some considerable certainty in this area of law. </para><para>So we end up with a broader jurisdiction than we have in the four biggest states in Australia, an up-to-date definition of `employee' and, in addition, comparing it with my state of Queensland, a higher salary cap and more compensation than is available under the Beattie government's industrial relations reforms. There are also the various other protections which exist in the federal act against abuse of process. So from my point of view, if we pass this amendment and the one that follows it and the deletions which are also in the Democrat amendments, we will end up with an unfair dismissal system which is the best in Australia in terms of covering the widest number of employees, balancing the rights of employees and employers, providing appropriate compensation and having the most up-to-date definitions. </para><para>It would be a tragedy if the Greens, the Independents and the Labor Party passed up this opportunity for substantial reform which delivers an up-to-date industrial relations act, leaves the workers in my state of Queensland better off, the workers in Senator Collins's state of Victoria better off, and the workers in Senator Buckland's state of South Australia better off. From that point of view, I commend this amendment, and the Democrat amendments that follow, to the chamber and I commend this particular reform to the chamber.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:48:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator J.J.

In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, which covers Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory as well as those people who fall under Commonwealth legislation, the probationary period during which casuals are excluded from accessing the federal unfair dismissal laws is 12 months. In New South Wales it is six months; in Queensland it is 12 months, excepting for valid reasons; in South Australia it is six months; and in Western Australia and Tasmania there is no exclusion.</para><para>I saw a recent figure that showed that the number of casuals nationally has increased very significantly to about 2½ million employees. Many of them you would classify as part-time regulars rather than as casuals, using the old terminology. As far as I can establish, and as the minister's advisers would advise him, it is very difficult to work out where casuals fall in terms of state and federal legislation but mostly it seems casuals fall under state legislation. </para><para>It is extremely undesirable for there not to be a common national standard as to when probation applies. When the Democrats agreed with the government originally to establish a probationary period of 12 months, it was regarded as reasonable in the circumstances. However, we think the nature of casual employment has changed so much that it is time to look again at the probationary period. Also, we do need to diminish somewhat any anxiety the states would have at the `covering the field' provision which may result in numbers of their employees losing access to the unfair dismissal jurisdiction. So we have recommended in this amendment that the probationary period, the period for which people are excluded, be six months.</para><para>That would deliver improved access for those under the Commonwealth jurisdiction at present—Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory. It would have the same access for New South Wales, improved access for Queensland, the same access for South Australia, and Western Australia and Tasmania would move from a no-exclusion basis to an exclusion basis. Frankly, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, I have always had difficulty with the idea that there should be no probationary period at all for an employee. I have never understood that and I have not understood why it would be acceptable in the Western Australian and Tasmanian jurisdictions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>13065</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Murray, I am sure you will forgive me if I need to ask you for an update on this issue.

But, even with those general remarks, it should be clear to the government that we are supporting further restrictions on vexatious and frivolous applications. Senator Collins can speak for her party but, as I understand the remarks of the previous shadow minister in the House, the Labor Party has sympathy for having some ability to dismiss applications on the papers. Not everything in that area has been knocked over by us.</para><para>We have moved an amendment that will give the employee a right to be heard by either the commissioner or registrar without the employer being present. With respect to schedule 2, I should also say to the minister that we have taken away the idea that only small business employees should be dealt with in a particular way and have suggested in amendments (18) and (19) that all businesses should be dealt with in that way—so in fact we have expanded your approach and your proposal. Many of the items we are opposing in schedule 3 relate to items in schedule 2, but we are supporting items relating to employees' conduct, impact on the health and safety of others, taking into account employees' conduct in determining compensation and taking into account income earned between termination and reinstatement. I should indicate for the record that the Democrats strongly support the provision in the bill which seeks to make reinstatement the primary remedy, and I suspect that is a view shared across the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>13067</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I have already foreshadowed, Labor is opposing all the Democrat amendments. In relation to these, as Senator Murray has already indicated, Labor has put on the record its preparedness to move with appropriate measures regarding frivolous and vexatious behaviour and also that reinstatement should be the primary or the principal remedy. As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, we have already cast the approach that we think should occur in relation to those issues in a private member's bill, introduced by the member for Hotham. Our response to Senator Murray on this point is that we join with him in his desire to see those types of changes occur but the vehicle of this bill is not the appropriate way to do it.</para></talk.start><para>I am sure the detail of these amendments, as they have been framed by the Democrats, is probably highly similar to what has been proposed already by the member for Hotham.

At one level there is an elegant simplicity in the way the law deals with this issue. However, award regulation of employment together with formalised bargaining and resultant certified agreements and an increasing trend to outsourcing, contracting out and labour hire have led to recent judicial attention on the issue of transmission of business from the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. </para></talk.start><para>From a practical and a legal perspective, there are two interrelated issues that arise for employees and employers in a transmission of business situation. First, what right does an employee have to accept or reject the transmission? Second, if the transmission is effected and the employee starts with a new employer, under what terms and conditions of employment will the employee be engaged? </para><para>In relation to the first question, an employee's right to reject a transfer to a new employer, the classic statement in law comes from Lord Aitkin in the 1940 English case of Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries. Lord Aitkin said:</para><quote><para>I confess that it appears to me astonishing that apart from overriding questions of public welfare power should be given to a Court or anyone else to transfer a man without his knowledge and possibly against his will from the service of one person to the service of another. I had fancied that ingrained in the personal status of a citizen under our laws was the right to choose for himself whom he will serve: and that this right of choice constituted the main difference between a servant and a serf.</para></quote><para>The essential distinction made in the above passage is that goods, chattels and livestock can readily be sold from one owner to another but a contract of service—a contract of employment—simply cannot be passed from one employer to another. This is because when a worker contracts to a particular employer the personal nature of that relationship requires that the worker should not be compelled, especially against his or her will, to work for another person. It is simply unfair and it affronts the dignity of workers to allow them to be shuffled between one employer and another, and more so if the conditions under which they are expected to work are in any way reduced or compromised.</para><para>But with realities of commercial life requiring that businesses pass from one owner to another it is recognised that there needs to be a fair and sensible regime that governs the right of employees in a transmission situation. Indeed, in many instances employees will work from one firm one day and another the next day without noticing much difference at all apart perhaps from the name of the enterprise or a different CEO. Under such occasions the transmission of business is just part of a vibrant and dynamic economy in action, and for the employees the transmission may be to their advantage, opening up new prospects for promotion or enhanced conditions of employment.</para><para>Returning to the first question that arises in the transmission of business situation, namely the right of an employee to accept or reject transfer from one employer to another, at common law the ruling in Nokes stands as part of Australian law. This was confirmed as recently as September 2002 by the Federal Court in the case of McCluskey v. Karagiozis. In this matter, the presiding judge, Justice Merkel, not only cited with approval passages from the Nokes case; he stated in relation to the employing bodies that they:</para><quote><para>... appeared to have pursued their own interest in disregard of the entitlements and interest of their long serving and loyal employees by transferring the employment of the employees, and the responsibility of their entitlements to shell companies thereby treating those employees as if they were serfs, rather than free citizens entitled to choose their own employer.</para></quote><para>This is in 2002. As can be inferred from this passage in the McCluskey case, the purported transmission of the employees' employment was ineffective for want of the employees' assent to the transfer. And, indeed, I am sure that if asked the employees in question would have given only one answer on whether they consented to being transferred from the principal asset holding entity in the business to worthless shell companies.</para><para>Herein lies the role of the common law as a real and effective protector for employees in a transmission situation. Before a business can effect a transfer of its employees to another business as part of a sale it must secure the consent of the employees affected. If the employer offers the employees appropriate guarantees as to future conditions and the security of the employees' accrued entitlements, the natural response from employees would be to accept the transfer—and then the issue is disposed of in a fair manner all around. </para><para>On the other hand, what happens if the employees take the view that the transfer is not in their interests and they refuse to agree to it? The real prospect is that they will lose their jobs but this may also stand in the way of the employer selling or passing on the business. This then compels the parties to negotiate and reach agreement.</para><para>It should be noted that in many federal certified agreements the prospect of a transmission of business is a matter contemplated in advance by the parties, and the obligations on the employer in a transmission situation are well known ahead of the event. For example, clause 9 of the Walkers Pty Ltd certified agreement 2002 reads:</para><quote><para>In the event of Walkers Pty Limited (the Company) business or businesses activities thereof is sold or closed leading to a transmission of business and transfer or termination of employment, the company commits to:—</para><para>(i) Identify all accrued entitlements of affected employees.</para><para>(ii) Consult with the Combined Unions regarding the impact of such a transmission of business on the accrued annual and long service leave entitlements of employees up to the date of transmission.</para><para>(iii) Consult with the parties in relation to the extent of any national employee entitlements scheme in place at the time, with a view to agreement between the parties to avail themselves of it, and/or establishing a trust fund into which such entitlements could be transferred. Such trust funds, if used, would be subject to any reasonable legal, accounting, taxation or fiduciary requirements in place at the time.</para></quote><para>These provisions show how the parties—in this case Walkers, an engineering firm, and the relevant unions: the AMWU, the AWU, the CFMEU, the CEPU and the TWU—are capable of sorting out their own arrangements. However, under this bill the provision in the agreement I have just cited could be replaced with an order of the commission. Isn't this tantamount to the commission taking on the role of a player and not that of an umpire? Haven't we heard this phrase before, and where did it emanate from? So here is an example of the government throwing out its stated principles where it is convenient or expedient to do so.</para><para>For the sake of completeness, there are other issues that arise in the severing of an employment contract in a transmission, such as the possibility of an entitlement to redundancy pay; and, as the Federal Court recently held in the Amcor case, an entitlement to severance pay on redundancy will arise even where employees accept a transmission with continuity of service. This case turned on the natural and literal meaning assigned to the terms in the prevailing certified agreement. Again it demonstrates that, under our current system, parties to an agreement can expect to get what they agree on—but not if this bill goes through. Furthermore, what is worrying for employees is that this bill proposes that the commission have reposed in it the power and discretion to alter agreed terms on a transmission, but that power and discretion would not be guided to preserving the benefits that accrue to the employees under their agreement.</para><para>A second consideration is what conditions of employment apply to employees transferred over to a new business. Here, the existing law is designed to have a certified agreement follow the employee to the new business as long as the test set down in section 170MB is met. This test is not materially different to that found in section 149(1)(d), which deals with when award conditions of employment flow on in a transmission of business. The test that triggers a certified agreement or an award flowing over is whether the new employer is a successor, transmittee or assignee, whether immediate or not, of the whole or a part of the business concerned—that is section 170MB(1)(c). A recent High Court judgment, in the PP Consultants case, emphasised the importance of the word `business' in that phrase. It is only where the successor takes on the business or a part of the business of the transmittor that the award or agreement flows. This meant in the PP Consultants case that bank employees who transferred from a branch of the bank into the employ of a pharmacy which also carried on banking functions as an agency of the bank were not entitled to the benefit of the relevant banking award. The High Court held that the pharmacy did not carry on the business of banking, notwithstanding its bank agency function, so the award did not transmit. </para><para>While this decision is not particularly helpful for outsourced employees, it shows that the existing laws already cater for businesses that divest functions to agencies, contractors or other service providers. Nevertheless, the current law ensures that the primary policy objective of the transmission of business provisions continues—namely, employers cannot avoid their award and agreement obligations simply by transferring their employees to a different employing entity. This means that in conventional situations such as takeovers, buy-outs and other forms of acquisition, one could with some confidence expect the transmission of business provisions to do the work they are expected to do and ensure that the award or agreement conditions of the old employer come across to the new employer.</para><para>If a successor finds the conditions of employment that come across with an acquired business objectionable or otherwise incompatible with the successor's other businesses, the successor may enter into negotiations with the employees of the newly acquired business and, if agreement is reached, the new agreement or a variation of an existing agreement can be ratified. Again, the solution to a business's problems in such circumstances lies in the principle so keenly espoused by this government—namely, agreement making between employees and employers. Recourse to the commission in such circumstances, which is what this bill provides for, is the antithesis of the government's stated approach to workplace relations. As was said before, principle is so readily discarded by this government when it impedes business getting its own way over employees and reducing their conditions.</para><para>Moreover, if one digs a little deeper into the bill, one can find another example of inconsistency in the government's proposed treatment of employee rights in a transmission of business. The bill only modifies the scheme of succession for the terms of certified agreements and, whilst consistency is one of the stated objectives, does not spread to Australian workplace agreements. Why the government has left Australian workplace agreements out of the equation is unclear, but one can draw the inference that AWAs are being given special treatment. This issue has, as I recall, been before the government for several years and no clear answer has been supplied to the Senate or to the committees that have investigated these proposals.</para><para>On the subject of AWAs generally, I can remark that, for all the government's attempts to promote AWAs, they remain unpopular, with less than two per cent of wage and salary earners on AWAs. Perhaps the government has left AWAs out of this bill because they are so rare that business has not lobbied the government to act on AWA employees. At any rate, without speculating further on the government's motives for leaving AWAs out of this bill, consideration should be given to how the exclusion of AWAs could affect labour law generally. If AWAs are to be afforded greater scope to protect an employee's agreed conditions of employment vis-a-vis collective agreements in a transmission of business, this would amount to discrimination against those who choose to bargain collectively. This principle is repugnant to Labor, and Labor will stick to its principles and give this as sufficient reason by itself to reject this bill. </para><para>In conclusion, this bill has the potential to undermine the sanctity and certainty of certified agreements. If it is passed, workers who have bargained and reached a deal with their boss could have the boss trigger a revision of their agreement simply by assigning the business to a new employer. This is unacceptable to Labor. Workers deserve better when they reach agreements. If the prospective purchaser of a business is not attracted to the workers' existing agreement, the purchaser should reconsider the buy or negotiate a new, mutually acceptable agreement with those existing workers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13072</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to give the Democrats' opinion on the <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002</inline>. Like all workplace relations matters, it is far from easy to draw a conclusion on. Transmission of business provisions have been part of workplace relations laws since 1914. At heart, the intention behind these provisions was to provide a protective mechanism for employees, but there has always been a corresponding understanding that business sales should be facilitated. Transmission of business has been the subject of lengthy litigation, and litigation clearly shows the issues are complex and they become more complex as the nature of agreements diversifies, as the nature of work circumstances diversifies and as the nature of sales agreements change. To date, by and large the courts have determined cases in a manner that has been beneficial to the employees. In that regard, a full court of the Federal Court in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v. the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, quoting from an earlier decision, affirmed:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The first point to be made about the operation of S.149 is that it should be beneficially construed so that employers do not `avoid the settled rights of employees', see George Hudson v Australian Timber Workers Union (1923) 32 CLR 413 at 435-436, per Isaacs J. Thus, in my opinion, whether there has been succession, transmission or assignment of a business should not be approached on some narrow basis.</para></quote><para>A recent article in <inline font-style="italic">Employment Law</inline> entitled `Transfer of undertaking: international comparisons'<inline font-style="italic"></inline>notes:</para><quote><para>Over the last couple of years, the Federal Court has significantly expanded the operation of the transmission of business provisions. Under the new approach, a transmission of business may occur wherever there is a “transfer of work” from one employer to another. As a result, the transmission provisions could apply where there is a substantial identity of work between that performed by employees of the transmittee and that previously performed on behalf of the transmittor. Consequently, a wide range of outsourcing or contracting out situations now fall within the scope of the provisions.</para></quote><para>The article further notes:</para><quote><para>PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union [2000] HCA 59 (16 November 2000) increased the uncertainty that has attached to these provisions. In the main judgment of a unanimous decision of the High Court of Australia, it was held that “it was not possible to formulate any general test to ascertain whether ... one employer has succeeded to the business or part of the business of another”. However, at least in relation to nongovernmental transmissions, the court stated that a comparison of the identification or characterisation of the business (or the relevant part of the business) of the former employer and business activities of the new employer is required. If these bear the same character, there would usually have been a transmission. </para></quote><para>It is acknowledged that this has raised further uncertainty and practical difficulties within the context of a complex industrial framework. It was the first wave of industrial relations reform by Keating and Brereton in 1993 and the second wave of the coalition-Democrats law which helped increase this complexity. It did so because it increased the number of industrial agreements and instruments which could operate outside the award system. The consequence is that transmission of business issues have become more particular and more specific to individual circumstances than was the case under the award system.</para><para>Businesses naturally want to avoid their original employees being on different wages and conditions to their newer employees in the acquired business. Awards have general application—award conditions easily transfer across businesses—so conditions for old and new workers in those circumstances are more than likely to remain the same. Certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements have specific application. Unlike awards, they are instruments determined by the parties in the business—between the employees and the employer—and are not determined through the Industrial Relations Commission. Consequently, conditions for old and new workers are as likely to be different as to be similar.</para><para>Certified agreements continue until their nominal expiry date, which is no less than three years, which means a certified agreement cannot be replaced by another certified agreement until the expiry date has passed. Therefore, on the transmission of business, the new business retains the certified agreements it takes on until their expiry date. On the other hand, one business acquiring another only has to wait out the unexpired portion of the certified agreement before negotiating a new one. Certified agreements can be terminated before their expiry date but only under specific circumstances, including where employees and/or the relevant union have agreed to the instrument being terminated and the termination is then approved by the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>The key change in this bill is to give the Industrial Relations Commission discretion to review the applicability of existing certified agreements in a new business without employee approval. This is the case at present with awards—as I said earlier, they are not agreements between employees and employers, but general instruments—but it is not so with certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements. It should be noted that certified agreements were regarded as awards under the Industrial Relations Act 1988; thus the transmission provisions applying to awards also applied to certified agreements. This is no longer the case under the Workplace Relations Act 1996— and I suspect it was not the case under the 1993 act, but I am not sure.</para><para>This bill has been introduced because employers have expressed concern at the possibility of meeting the obligations of a variety of employment instruments following a business acquisition. The Democrats appreciate the complexities that might arise from multiple agreements for the one work force, especially if those agreements cover performance of the same work. Here you have an odd contest. The chamber as a whole has cooperated in recent years to make the market work very effectively. Corporations Law has been changed to ensure that mergers and acquisitions proceed as easily as possible, with tax law there have been consolidation provisions and there has been general agreement overall that fluidity in business transactions should be encouraged and made easier through law. Here on the employee side there is the impediment of a time frame which, as far as I can see, is of three years or less. It is notable that within the government's bill no real attention is given to the time frames occurring within certified agreements. </para><para>Because the concerns that have been raised have some validity, the Democrats consider this issue to be worthy of further consideration. One concern is that there is potential for a seller to offer a prospective employer a `package' of lower cost operations through the elimination of current terms of employment. Related to this point, the Australian Council of Trade Unions is concerned that `weakening an already inadequate transmission of business provision will further encourage the types of contracting out and corporate restructuring which we have seen can have such an unfair effect on employees'. The flip side of the coin is that an acquiring business has the right to reshape the new business in the manner which will produce the best outcome for it.</para><para>Affording rights to the outgoing employer to make an application to the Industrial Relations Commission about the extent to which a current certified agreement will bind a future purchaser of the business, as this bill does, will only serve to facilitate behaviours which might be regarded as contrary to employees' interests. It should be noted that providing particular rights of the outgoing employer to have a certified agreement not bind a future employer is not available under the award transmission provisions. That surprises me, might I say, where you might have a state award and a federal award circumstance.</para><para>The amendments provide no assistance to the commission in determining the relevant circumstances or grounds for making or refusing an order. Also there is no requirement that an order to set aside be subject to a no disadvantage test or some similar mechanism to ensure that, for the short period remaining within a certified agreement, employees are not disadvantaged. Where two awards have `collided' following a transmission of business, it has been the case that the superior terms have been applied. In the current bill there are no guidelines of this sort for certified agreements. I might add that, in approving a certified agreement, the Industrial Relations Commission does and can apply a no disadvantage test.</para><para>Repercussions of the proposed new provisions have been quoted elsewhere. The Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill's predecessor, stated:</para><quote><para>Whilst some may argue that it is up to the Industrial Relations Commission to make any order and that this caveat will protect employees, it will be cold comfort to them. The fact is that the capacity will exist to remove the agreement in whole or in part. Where employees feel threatened or have little confidence in the system, the potential for industrial disputation increases exponentially.</para></quote><para>You can understand why it would take that view. In a privatised circumstance, and it does not seem to matter what colour government is doing the privatising, typically the number of employees falls and their wages and conditions change.</para><para>Only employers are allowed to make applications; employees and/or their unions are not, which seems odd. The Australian Democrats, however, have a long tradition of supporting the Industrial Relations Commission having an independent discretion to determine industrial relations matters on their merits. What the 1996 act did—and this bill seems to go against that intention—was to try to keep the Industrial Relations Commission out of as much action between employers and employees as possible. The whole basis of the enterprise bargaining system originally introduced in Labor's 1993 bill is to ensure that employers and employees, independent of a third party, work out their own circumstances. This bill takes it back to the Industrial Relations Commission. That is not something we have a problem with, but it does seem a bit of a backtrack in government philosophy. </para><para>I have said previously in our minority contribution to the report that discretion is never open-ended. It has long been the Democrats' view that, wherever possible, such discretion is a better guarantor of fairness and flexibility—and, of course, I am referring to the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission. However, we do recognise that discretion can lead to uncertainty and cost until such time as orders have been made, and that is another characteristic of the transmission of business. Somebody buying a business simply does not want to wait around longer than is necessary for due diligence to ensure the transference of assets and understanding of where they are going, and the employees of course also want certainty.</para><para>It seems self-evident that the IRC should have discretion in respect of transmission of employee conditions in business acquisitions, particularly when more than one certified agreement affects `old', `transferred' and `new' employees in a business. This is an alternative to the courts, which are notoriously slow and are a notoriously blunt instrument in these circumstances. The Industrial Relations Commission needs to determine which agreement should prevail—provided, that is, that the Industrial Relations Commission continues to recognise that the intention behind the transmission of business provisions is, in the interests of fairness, to provide a protective mechanism for employees. The IRC must do this while taking into account the need to provide new or reformed businesses with necessary operational flexibility. Whether we keep the current system, which allows employees and employers to terminate the agreement in special circumstances, or whether we introduce a new provision for the Industrial Relations Commission to weigh up the repercussions for both parties does need to be determined. But where does this lead us?</para><para>It seems to lead us to this: the government are only going part way along the road. They say that applications should be made to the Industrial Relations Commission. I cannot disagree with that, as a general intent. They say that the Industrial Relations Commission should have arbitration powers—in other words, the Industrial Relations Commission should have a final decision making ability, subject to the normal appeals based on matters of fact which are available. I cannot disagree with that. The whole purpose and basis of the Industrial Relations Commission was that it should have an arbitration ability. They say that employers should have the ability to make submissions or applications. I cannot disagree with that but I would surely envisage circumstances in which unions or employees would have similar rights, because that allows maximum flexibility. </para><para>There is the question of time. I would think that you would need to enforce a rapid process. In the case of the Corporations Law, when you are looking at the merger provisions and the takeover panels there is a speedy fast-track process which you can access. That is desirable in a transmission of business circumstance. When you are dealing with a certified agreement I am not sure you would want these provisions in the bill to operate if the certified agreement had a relatively short period still to run.

As senators will be aware, a review of the museum's performance, the National Museum of Australia Review of Exhibitions and Public Programs, was handed down recently. Therefore it is timely that I reflect on the review's findings and acknowledge what the National Museum of Australia has achieved in a relatively short period of time.</para></talk.start><para>It will be forever to the credit of the government of John Howard that, after years of grandstanding by the Labor Party, it was this government that finally funded and built this important national icon, the National Museum of Australia. Indeed it was a coalition government that passed the National Museum of Australia Bill in 1980. The genesis of the vision for a national museum is widely, and rightly, regarded as the 1975 Pigott report. In articulating what a national museum should be about, the Pigott report made a comment that is worth repeating today:</para><quote><para>The museum, where appropriate, should display controversial issues. In our view, too many museums concentrate on certainty and dogma, thereby forsaking the function of stimulating legitimate doubt and thoughtful discussion.</para></quote><para>`Legitimate doubt and thoughtful discussion' are interesting words in the present context. Whether intentionally or otherwise, the National Museum of Australia has fulfilled this foreshadowed aspect of its mission. It has certainly stimulated passionate debate in some circles. Consider the recent diatribe of a Sydney newspaper columnist. She wrote:</para><quote><para>You just have to look at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, built with $155 million of taxpayers' money on Howard's watch, with its sneering black armband treatment of our history, its irony overload of upside-down Hills hoists and digger statues, and its Holocaust architecture.</para></quote><para>I do not begrudge such sentiments. Supporters of the National Museum—and I count myself in that number—welcome strong reactions to this institution. Without those sorts of reactions we might be accused of erecting nothing more than a warehouse for baubles. However, it would be a shame if this sort of rhetoric, used in the so-called culture war, distorted the image Australians have of their National Museum.</para><para>The reactions of visitors to the National Museum have been overwhelmingly positive. They have found it entertaining and engaging. The exhibitions and programs review concurred, concluding that the National Museum has established itself as a popular and significant attraction in the national capital. I note that the opposition spokesperson on the arts, Senator Lundy, has labelled the review as disappointing. She says that it advocates a `whitewashing of Australian history'. I do not think that assessment is fair; the review is a much more subtle and balanced document than that description would suggest and ought to be taken seriously, even if we might disagree with some of its findings. </para><para>On the issue of bias, the review concluded that political or cultural bias was not a systemic problem at the National Museum but that it existed in pockets. There were elements in some exhibitions that, when taken as a whole, could be construed as characterising Europeans as the `bad guys'. I have said previously in this place that I have no truck with those who elevate Australia's shortcomings above our successes. Australia has a cohesive society that is the envy of other nations. Our values of tolerance and the fair go have given thousands of new Australians the opportunity to adjust to and to fully participate in Australian life.</para><para>We should take pride in the fact that this has occurred without the marked social upheaval and conflict evident in other nations. Yet we should acknowledge that there have been chapters in Australia's history that are, frankly, regrettable. Indeed, one of the criteria which the review panel used was the ability of the National Museum to cover so-called darker historical episodes with truthfulness, sobriety and balance. A significant proportion of Australia's darker episodes relate to the Aboriginal experience since European settlement. One aspect of this is the frontier conflict between Europeans and Aboriginals that occurred until the early 20th century. There is no doubt that this conflict occurred and that there were killings of Aboriginals. But, appropriately, there is ongoing debate on the scale of the violence and the intentions of both parties. Invariably, historical events involve differing interpretations. However, Aboriginal history is often passionately contested because it has contemporary political and cultural implications.</para><para>That was evident when the National Museum recently presented its <inline font-style="italic">Contested Frontiers </inline>exhibition in the First Australians gallery. It was accused at that time of being biased, demonising Europeans and being over-reliant on oral history. I might note that the review, on that issue, agreed to some extent, stating:</para><quote><para>... where an issue is likely to attract such public debate and scrutiny, the NMA should be careful to ensure that it is backed by a wider range of sources</para></quote><para>Nevertheless, the reaction of the National Museum to the initial criticism should be commended. In December 2001, the National Museum hosted a two-day forum that examined the frontier conflict from widely different perspectives. Speakers included the Left and Right's respective darlings on Aboriginal history, Henry Reynolds and Keith Windschuttle. It was at times a lively, emotional and uncomfortable event. It was also informative, controversial and engaging. Clearly this was an example of the National Museum delivering on Pigott's vision of an institution being able to stimulate thoughtful discussion on controversial historical issues.</para><para>The biggest criticism emanating from the review was that the National Museum lacked compelling narratives—in other words, it has not presented the Australian story in an understandable, chronological and meaningful way. It was also slated for glossing over key themes in the Australian experience. These are substantive criticisms and do deserve honest assessment and some soul-searching—responses which I have no doubt the National Museum will deliver. It will need to consider its use of technology, its collection policy and its commitment to evidence. I do not doubt that there is scope for improvement, but we should put the review into perspective. The National Museum, after all, is only 2½ years old. It is a work in progress. Despite reservations it can claim significant achievements in that 2½ years.</para><para>I also point out that the National Museum is the only museum whose role is exploring and exhibiting the history and culture of the entire Australian nation. It is supposed to appeal to diverse audiences by using contemporary and even entertaining techniques. Those are real challenges in any modern institution. We should be careful to ensure that any reforms do not compromise the National Museum's strengths. Some of its defenders have argued that the review signals a desire for the National Museum to take a more traditional and anthropological approach. They fear it would undermine the National Museum's accessibility—what we would call, perhaps, its capacity to educate by entertaining. I think that fear is ill-founded. At the National Museum's opening in March 2001, the Prime Minister said: </para><quote><para>What it does unusually, and I think very attractively is seek to interpret the history of our nation. Not only in terms of events and objects but also in terms of the life experience of people from different backgrounds ...</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>But importantly, it represents a quite different way of presenting the history and culture of a nation. </para></quote><para>It is the contemporary and, you might even say, lowbrow and sometimes irreverent style of the museum that has made it such a hit with its more than one million visitors, particularly schoolchildren.</para><para>I see a great irony in the position taken by certain critics of the National Museum. I am referring to the commentators who promote themselves as defenders of mainstream or middle Australian values. These people have been scathing of some cultural institutions, accusing them of being pockets of political correctness and having a sneering contempt for the lifestyles and preferences of the majority. Yet in the National Museum of Australia we have an institution that is overwhelmingly popular with the general public—there is no doubt about that whatsoever. Above all, the National Museum retains a capacity to be insightful of the Australian character and experience.</para><para>My assessment of the National Museum is that it is an inspired and vital element in the notion of a national capital. Its capacity to be fairly criticised in no way detracts from the good job it is doing, and yet it complements and confirms that role. Even at the tender age of 2½, its value to Australian society is difficult to overstate. I extend my congratulations to the staff of the National Museum of Australia and its Director, Dawn Casey, for achieving so much in the first 2½ years of its existence. The National Museum adds to the national capital's reputation as a repository of the finest examples of this nation's achievement and innovation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Boral Truck Drivers</title><page.no>13078</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>13078</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to address the issue of some workers who have been treated badly in this region. I will take a later opportunity to respond to the contribution by the coalition's latest foot soldier in the cultural war. I do acknowledge that indeed this subscription to the Prime Minister's cause seems to be veiled in support for the National Museum, so I will be interested to see Senator Humphries's ongoing contributions to this debate as the agenda becomes clear, belatedly, to him. But I rise this evening to bring to the attention of the Senate the treatment of David Morgan and 17 other Canberra concrete truck owner-drivers and their families after they were terminated by Boral in September last year. David's story was highlighted in an article appearing on page 3 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>newspaper last Monday.</para></talk.start><para>In September last year David and his workmates were terminated by Boral because they would not accept the new contract Boral gave them. The reasons they rejected the contract are obvious when you look at what it would have meant for each of the owner-drivers. For example, it would have meant each driver had to take a cut of about 30 per cent on their current rates. This cut would have been on the back of no rate increase for the past seven years. An independent financial analysis—which the company refused to even acknowledge—showed the drivers could not make a living under the contract proposal, the contract term was reduced to only four years, each driver had to purchase a new vehicle within the first year of the new contract, the contract would have given the drivers very limited rights to on sell their truck and their business, there was no security of engagement and it forced the drivers to forgo any goodwill on their business. It does not sound very reasonable. </para><para>Despite this offer the drivers attempted, with the help of their union—the Transport Workers Union—to negotiate a fairer deal. However, after months of trying, the company refused to move in any significant way. Boral were adamant that it was a take it or leave it offer. However, it was an offer the drivers could not afford to accept. In response, Boral made the decision to terminate all the contractors, giving them six months notice, expiring on Friday, 13 September 2002. The fact that the drivers had typically invested between $160,000 and $220,000 to get their contract and their truck did not seem to matter to the company. Nor did the fact that before September last year people bought a contract to deliver concrete exclusively for Boral in the ACT by paying goodwill and purchasing a specially modified truck.</para><para>When their contracts were terminated by Boral, the only assets Dave and his colleagues were left with were their trucks. However, even these were virtually worthless due to the special chassis design demanded by the company for their concrete deliveries. Despite years of loyal service and hard work for the company, this is what Dave and his colleagues were left with: virtually nothing. Some have been left with over $70,000 worth of debt due to their contracts being terminated. All of them have lost their investment, their business and their jobs. They received no redundancy and Boral refused to compensate them for goodwill, which averages out at about $120,000 each.</para><para>Boral's actions have created serious financial hardship for David Morgan and his family and for all of Dave's workmates and their families. In addition to the financial strain, the personal impact on the drivers and their families has also been devastating. You can imagine the stress and the uncertainty created by their termination and the loss of their goodwill, and how it has strained family relationships and led to many drivers having to reorganise their lives just to cope—just to get by in these circumstances. Families have been forced to sell their homes, and, for some, Boral's actions have led to health problems and nervous breakdowns.</para><para>In many families wives have taken on full-time work, not out of choice but to make ends meet. Most of the drivers have been working in the industry for decades and are now having to start all over again to find a way to provide for their families and save for their retirement. Most of them say they will now have to rely on the pension when before they would have been self-funded retirees. Because of this the drivers feel that Boral's actions have transferred the cost of this from the company to the community.</para><para>The Transport Workers Union advises me that Boral's claim is that they need to lower cartage rates in order to remain competitive. But if this were true, why, immediately after the drivers were terminated, did the company put its concrete prices up? With the help of their union the drivers are campaigning for justice. David Morgan and his wife have launched proceedings against Boral in the Federal Court alleging unconscionable conduct under the Trade Practices Act. Dave and his fellow drivers are concerned that the implications of Boral's actions could be far-reaching if the court action is not successful. Other companies could try and follow Boral's lead by offering contractors contracts they know they cannot accept. </para><para>Until all owner-drivers have the legislative protection of a goodwill tribunal, the 30,000 Australian transport workers who are contracted under similar arrangements to Dave are at the mercy of this type of corporate thuggery. Conduct like this from one of Australia's largest companies should not be tolerated. I urge senators to support the sort of response, like the adoption of legislative protections for small business operators, that would help prevent the sort of devastating situation faced by the owner-drivers that were sacked by Boral and protect them from the abuse of market power by companies like Boral.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title><page.no>13080</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13080</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to raise the escalating politicisation of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I am concerned about the damaging game play that appears to be unfolding between the Howard government—in particular the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston—and the board and senior management of the ABC, over the issue of funding. Senators will be aware of ABC management's announcement earlier this month of a cut of over $26 million to its program and non-program functions. That announcement was made on the basis of the requirement that the ABC has to operate within its current limited budget structure.</para></talk.start><para>As we know, the Howard government failed in this year's federal budget to acknowledge the very real need for spending on the national broadcaster to be increased. The government expects the ABC to operate over the next three-year period with no new or additional funding. Senators will also be aware of the understandable public outcry that resulted from the ABC management's decision to implement the funding cuts in part by stopping production of the children's educational television show <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>. Children's programming has also been affected by the axing of the digital multichannel television services Fly TV and ABC Kids.</para><para>Additional cuts are to be made to general television documentaries, sports productions and news and current affairs programs, including the award winning international current affairs program <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Correspondent</inline>. Some $2 million is to be removed from the ABC's international news and current affairs operations. There can be no doubt that this will significantly reduce the ABC's capacity to provide full and comprehensive international news coverage. Of equal concern, and even perhaps more insidious, is the decision to end the ABC's longstanding cadet journalist training program. This program dates back to the 1940s when the ABC first began broadcasting news. Over the years, ABC radio and television newsrooms have been a wonderful training ground for many of the country's leading journalists. It is a real concern to me, as I am sure it is to other senators, that this career pathway of high-level professional training for people in the communication and media industries will no longer be available.</para><para>Against the backdrop of virtually nonexistent on-the-job training opportunities for journalists in Australia's commercial news broadcasting, the decision by the ABC to end this important training is an issue for anyone interested in the preservation of standards in Australian journalism. It also comes as a slap in the face for Indigenous Australians, because this program offers the opportunity each year for one young Aboriginal person to gain on-the-job training as a journalist. The training program also provides for the annual induction of a science cadet journalist, and that opportunity will come to an end as well. How much money will be saved by the cut to the ABC's cadet journalist training? Just $530,000 a year. Such penny-pinching measures are certainly disproportionate to the inherent value of the programs that are being lost. </para><para>ABC journalists are frequently accused of being partisan and unfair in their reporting of news and current affairs. Most recently it was Minister Alston who claimed bias in the ABC's radio reporting of the war on Iraq. However, the ABC's Independent Complaints Review Panel subsequently rejected those allegations. In fact the ABC is generally acknowledged as setting a high-water mark for journalistic standards and ethics in Australia. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has expressed its concern about the intention to abandon the cadet journalist training program, with its federal secretary, Mr Chris Warren, describing the decision rather gruesomely as the ABC being `forced to eat its own future'.</para><para>The ABC's charter requires that the corporation broadcast programs of an educational nature and, further, that in connection with the provision of broadcasting of an educational nature it take into account the responsibilities of the states in relation to education. Given the widespread backlash among teachers, parents and schoolchildren against the decision to end production of the <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline> program, one has to question the reasoning behind that particular change to the ABC's television programming. <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline>, as it is known, has become something of an institution after more than 30 years of production, and it is valued as an effective tool in the teaching of media literacy to primary and early secondary school students.</para><para>The decision to cut this popular and worthwhile educational program possibly points to a rather dubious motive of the ABC board and management. I know I am not alone in thinking this. Other commentators and observers have suggested that the ABC board and management are strategically manipulating important program functions as armoury in their battle with the government over funding. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, too, has indicated that he is aware of the gambit, although his comments are to be viewed with the cynicism they deserve. On <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">Media Report</inline> on ABC radio last week Glenn Withers, Professor of Public Policy at the ANU, said as much. Professor Withers referred to what is known in US public policy circles as the Washington Monument gambit. Whenever the Department of the Interior in the US is threatened with financial cutbacks, it closes the Washington Monument as a means of meeting the demand to cut back costs. This of course outrages patriotic Americans, and the decision is inevitably reversed. That is hardly the kind of public policy administration we need or want in Australia.</para><para>The ABC management must be feeling very hard-pressed to be engaging in this sort of manoeuvring—and, as we know, they are hard-pressed. The government is clearly intent on starving the national broadcaster of funds, despite the critical role it plays in the intellectual life of the nation. It is understandable if the ABC management feel they have been backed into a corner. We have a government that is prepared to resort to those kinds of tactics to achieve its ends, led by a Prime Minister who is prepared to mislead the parliament, and we all know Australia deserves better. The ABC and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts should stop playing games and get down to the business of working to deliver the services expected and needed from the ABC. </para><para>This of course begs the question of what will be cut next. Are we going to see the last of <inline font-style="italic">Stateline</inline>, for example, or <inline font-style="italic">Landline</inline>, which provides an essential service across rural and regional Australia? I certainly hope not. When this government came to office in 1996 it promised to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. Since then something like $70 million in real terms has been stripped from the ABC's budget. This is having disastrous effects on ABC programs across the board. The refusal of the government to increase funding in the current funding triennium means that core ABC functions will continue to be downgraded and eliminated. That has been the deliberate intention of the federal government—to immobilise or dismantle the ABC. The government's frustration at being unable to impose direct limits and controls on the national broadcaster is palpable and grows daily. What is happening with the ABC is part of an emerging pattern in this government's treatment of the nation's key cultural institutions: milk them dry and starve them of funds until they can no longer function effectively or until they fall into line with the government's own cultural agenda.</para><para>This government has no commitment to the notion of a healthy, sustainable public broadcaster that functions to meet the information, entertainment and cultural needs of Australia's diverse contemporary society; in fact, quite the opposite is the case. Despite all its rhetoric, the government refuses to accept and fails to understand the vital role played by the ABC in contributing to the health of Australia's democracy. Instead of wanting to preserve the ABC as a strong, independent broadcaster and a treasured national institution, the government would rather have the ABC commercialised, privatised or sold off.</para><para>As a senator representing the people of New South Wales, I have a growing sense of unease about the impact the erosion of ABC programs is having, especially on people in rural and regional areas of that state. There are already too many gaps in the information services available to people in rural and regional New South Wales. In 2001 regional New South Wales suffered cuts to a number of its commercial news broadcasts. Those cuts, combined with these cuts to the ABC, serve to underline the importance of the ABC itself for people in remote areas. It is in fact a lifeline. It is the only reliable, credible source of information and news. It cannot continue to be undermined and undervalued as it currently is. It needs to be preserved and nurtured. There needs to be certainty that the decisions being made by, and on behalf of, the ABC are made in the best interests of the community that it is meant to serve.</para><para><inline

undertaken considerable effort to identify and rectify problems in these areas.</para><para>Pilots. A project has been established to provide the required number of qualified pilots and observers by mid 2013 through a ten-year ramp-up program. The Navy Capability Management Committee recently considered a paper that details a three pronged approach (short-term retention, mid term loans and transfers, and long term rectification of systemic issues).</para><para>Seaman Officers. Significant activity is underway to address the shortfall of Seaman officers including addressing workforce requirements, training throughput and retention issues. A recruiting campaign targeted specifically at Seaman Officers resulted in a significant increase of recruiting, achieving 86% of the original target.</para><para>Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers. Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers are the subject of a number of activities, including the introduction of an “Interim Retention Allowance”, continuing professional development programs and the introduction a recognition program as a “Chartered Professional Engineer” with the Australian Institute of Engineers.</para><para>Electronic Technicians. The Electronic Technician workforce structure was critically examined with the result of a modest reduction of the workforce requirement, thus effectively reducing the shortfall. Recruiting targets have been set at maximum training capacity levels and a focussed recruiting campaign has produced significant improvements in the achievement rate.</para><para>Marine Technicians. In mid 2001, Marine Technicians (MT) were surveyed to identify their reasons for separation or an intention to separate. A working group was established to implement recommendations and to further identify policy and management action that will improve the retention of MTs. The MT recruiting campaign has achieved excellent results with a near 100% achievement of targets now occurring. </para><para>(2)	The following recruiting achievement has occurred since 1 July 2001

The short-term plan (1-3 years) is focussed on retention management including re entry and the use of Reserves. All pilots or observers considering discharge are counselled by a senior Aviation manager. A comprehensive on line survey was recently conducted to determine the retention profile of all pilots and observers. An environmental scan of the helicopter pilot and observer job opportunities market, local, regional and globally, for the short, medium and long-term, will soon be undertaken in conjunction with the Army by a commercial company to more fully understand the threat to Pilot and Observer retention. Information obtained will be used to determine what further (if any) short-term retention measures may be required, noting the present maturing of the pilot and observer financial retention incentives.</para><para>Seaman Officers. The RAN is undertaking a number of actions to address the significant shortfall of Seaman Officers. These actions include:</para><para>·	a senior officer has been appointed as Head of Surface Warfare Community to improve Warfare officer and sailor management. A Seaman Officer Management Plan is being implemented;</para><para>·	improved Seaman Officer recruiting material and maximum Seaman Officer recruiting targets; </para><para>·	changes to the structure of Seaman Officer training to motivate officers and increase pass rates; and</para><para>·	the development of a Principal Warfare Officer Retention Allowance to improve Navy's retention of that section of the Seaman Officer community.</para><para>Weapons Electrical Aircraft Engineers. Although there are shortages remaining predominantly at the rank of Lieutenant, there are now sufficient trainees coming through the ranks to resolve the shortfalls within the next four years. Improvements to career structures and remuneration will reduce the likelihood of future shortfalls.</para><para>Electronic Technicians. ET workforce structural review is ongoing with the aim of optimising the workforce resource. This applies to both sea going and shore positions. </para><para>·	recruiting targets are being closely managed and the recruiting organisation remains focussed on maximising target achievement;</para><para>·	the length of initial training for ET sailors is considered too long and results in sailors not commencing a full time sea going billet until over two years has elapsed since joining. This is a de-motivator and is being addressed through a revision of the initial training packages; and</para><para>·	ET work practices are being altered to make the trade more attractive and rewarding and thus improving retention.</para><para>Marine Technicians. MT sailors have a similar initial training time problem as that experienced by ET sailors. The MT initial training packages is being restructured accordingly. In addition:</para><para>·	Navy is implementing changes to engineering watch keeping practices to significantly reduce the machinery watch keeping requirement, thereby releasing MTs at sea to concentrate on tasks that require maintenance and trade/technical skills. This is being positively received in the workplace and should improve job satisfaction and retention;</para><para>·	the ANZAC Ship MT workforce arrangements are being modified to create a sustainable workforce structure that meets the maintenance requirement.

I discussed this matter with the Indonesian Minister for Justice and Human Rights on a number of occasions. On 6 February 2003, at my direction and under the cover of a letter from me, Australian officials presented to Indonesian authorities a request for the provisional arrest of Abu Quassey. The Prime Minister also raised the extradition of Abu Quassey in a meeting with the Indonesian President on 15 February 2003. I wrote to the Indonesian Minister for Justice and Human Rights again about this issue on 17 February 2003 and the Attorney-General raised it with the Indonesian Minister during the Australia - Indonesia Ministerial Forum on 11 March 2003.</para><para>Also on 11 March 2003 the Indonesian Minister for Justice and Human Rights sent me a letter formally indicating that Indonesia would not extradite Abu Quassey to Australia.</para><para>Following the deportation of Abu Quassey from Indonesia to Egypt on 24 April 2003, the Australian Government sent a request for his extradition to Egypt.</para><para>I can assure you that the Australian Government is doing all that it can to secure the prosecution of Abu Quassey. The bringing of Abu Quassey to justice remains an issue of the highest priority for the Australian Government.</para><para>(2)	It is unclear which warrants Senator Brown is referring to, or what statement apparently made by Commissioner Keelty.

The warrants allege three offences of organising the bringing of groups of unlawful non-citizens into Australia and seventy-two offences of bringing unlawful non-citizens into Australia, contrary to the provisions of sections 232A and 233(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act), respectively.</para><para>On 6 December 2002, the AFP swore a fourth warrant, alleging one offence of organising the bringing of groups of unlawful non-citizens into Australia and four offences of attempting to bring unlawful non-citizens into Australia, contrary to the provisions of sections 232A and 233(1)(a) of the Act, respectively. This warrant relates to SIEV X.</para><para>A total of four first instance warrants have now been issued for the arrest of Abu Quassey alleging a total of four offences of organising the bringing of groups of unlawful non-citizens into Australia and seventy-six offences of bringing or attempting to bring unlawful non-citizens into Australia contrary to the provisions of sections 232A and 233(1)(a) of the Act, respectively.</para><para>(3)	(a)	No</para><para>(b)	Ongoing enquiries with survivors are providing details which will assist in the identification of victims who died in the sinking.</para><para>A list was provided to the AFP from a confidential source after the vessel sank.

Coalition forces were tasked with a number of duties as they moved into Baghdad, with the need to secure the city and ensure the safety of its citizens understandably given the highest priority. The Museum, Iraqi National Library and other buildings where cultural antiquities were stored were ransacked while coalition forces were still heavily engaged in combat apparently against forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. Fortunately, it now appears that initial estimates of the damage done and numbers of treasures lost were exaggerated: as opposed to some alarmist early media reports claiming that many of thousands of items were stolen or damaged, recent checks by curators and Interpol seem to suggest some 38 pieces are now considered missing. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that coalition forces were unable to reach some of these places before looting had taken place. In other instances, it seems looters took advantage of the fact that coalition troops were at times forced to redeploy temporarily to address serious military challenges and to protect the lives of ordinary Iraqis.</para><para>(4)	The Australian Government has announced the formation of a Cultural Heritage Reference Group, assembled by the Australian Heritage Commission and including representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and the National Museum of Australia. The group will consult with professional organisations in Australia, including the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the Australian Library and Information Association, Museums Australia and the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Materials, before recommending appropriate activities for further government consideration. The Cultural Heritage Group will focus on practical initiatives to join with other international cultural heritage assistance programmes and to assist with the international effort to track down stolen artworks and artefacts.  </para><para></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Electoral Commission: 2001 Senate Election</title><page.no>13104</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1426)</subtitle><id.no>1426</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13104</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 5 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>Can details be provided by the Australian Electoral Commission of the reduced values of the following surplus votes at the 2001 Senate Election count:

Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra has advised that documents exchanged between the parties in the course of establishing a contract will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the nature of the works, goods or services supplied, the cost, business requirements, complexity and type of activity, common practice of the relevant Telstra business unit, and risk profile. With respect to high value contracts, documents exchanged would normally include :</para><para>·	request for offer documentation, for example a request for tender document or a request for proposal or pricing</para><para>·	confidentiality documentation</para><para>·	administrative documents relevant to the contract process, for example an intent to respond form</para><para>·	offer documentation, for the contractor's tender or proposal</para><para>·	contract documentation </para><para>·	associated correspondence, clarifications </para><para>(2)	Telstra has advised that some of its contracts include provisions allowing it to claim amounts from contractors in the event of poor performance, non-performance or some other failure to comply with the contract, for example liquidated damages for late completion. Provisions of this type vary significantly depending on the requirements of the specific contract.</para><para>(3)	Telstra advises that such arrangements would vary on a case by case basis. Without being aware of the circumstances of a particular case, Telstra has indicated that it is unable to provide further information.</para><para>(4)	As for part (3).</para><para>(5)	(a)	Telstra advises that the depth at which a cable is to be laid is specified in various technical requirements documents, which are issued to the cable installer. For example, the document TM00044 “Technical Requirements Optic Fibre” is used to specify cable installation depths for various categories of Optical Fibre cables to installing contractors. As well as listing the standard depths, the document also specifies the options available, and the required authorisations and recording mechanism, in the event that standard depths cannot be attained </para><para>(b)	Telstra advises that there are several methods used for assessing compliance to cable depth requirements:</para><para>·	On-site surveillance by an authorised Telstra agent during the cable installation phase; or</para><para>·	physical exposure of previously installed cable by an authorised Telstra agent; or</para><para>·	electronic measurements made by an authorised Telstra agent, using appropriate instruments. This method measures the depth of metallic elements installed concurrently with the cable, in the event that the installed cable is of a non-metallic type.</para><para>(6)	Telstra advises that contractor equipment used in laying Optical Fibre cable is inspected and certified by an authorised Telstra agent. Part of this certification involves measuring the tensions applied to cables and installing seals and various limiting devices that prevent the equipment installing cables beyond specified tensions. Seals and other limiting devices are inspected and re-certified annually to ensure continuing compliance. It is a condition of the contract that only certified equipment shall be used.</para><para>(7)	Telstra advises that such cables are generally not accepted for integration within the Telstra network until the affected cable or cable section has been replaced by one installed to specification.</para><para>(8)	Telstra advises that the following numbers of contracts for the laying of fibre optic cables in the Inter-Exchange Network in Queensland have been let by Telstra in the respective years:</para><para>·		1998:	0</para><para>·		1999:	3</para><para>·		2000:	1</para><para>·		2001:	1</para><para>·		2002:	8</para><para>Telstra advises that no specific optic fibre contracts have been let in the timeframe detailed for the Queensland Customer Access Network.</para><para>Telstra has noted that these figures do not include contracts which may have been let by Network Design and Construction (NDC) during the period it operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra from 1999 until re-integration to Telstra this year. In addition, the figures do not include stances where Telstra has laid fibre optic cable by commercial arrangement on request of individual customers for private use.</para><para>(9)	Telstra advises that no contracts let in the Inter-Exchange Network were in default. As part of the on-going administration of its contracts, wherever possible Telstra seeks to prevent disputes and to work co-operatively with contractors to ensure best performance and minimise defaults.</para><para>(10)	Telstra advises that, as stated in response to part (9), no contracts let in the Inter-Exchange Network were in default.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Wet Tropics World Heritage Area </title><page.no>13111</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1446)</subtitle><id.no>1446</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13111</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 9 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Minister planning to change the management structure of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area by abolishing its independent board; if so, what is the timeframe for this change. </para><para>(2)	Is the Minister negotiating with the Queensland Government in relation to new World Heritage legislation; if so, what arrangements for the management of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area are being proposed in the legislation.</para><para>(3)	Since the changed World Heritage funding arrangements came into effect, what has been the impact on the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area funding.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13112</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	No.</para><para>(2)	I have received correspondence from Minister Wells indicating the Queensland Government is considering reviewing its legislation and management frameworks for World Heritage properties within the State.</para><para>Queensland has five World Heritage properties either partly, or wholly within its boundaries.

The statistics provided on 24 March 2003 on the number of detainees on medication for a diagnosed psychiatric mental illness (ie 2.9% of detainees at the end of January 2003) did not include detainees suffering from reactive depression but did include the number of detainees on medication for a diagnosed psychiatric mental illness including clinical depression.</para><para>The National Action Plan for Depression developed under the National Mental Health Plan 1998-2003, distinguishes between types of depressive disorders in the following way. “Unhappiness or sadness at a time of loss or disappointment is not the same as experiencing clinical depression. The term clinical depression describes not just one illness but a group of illnesses characterised by excessive and long term lowering in mood along with a range of other symptoms that affect the person's lifestyle and ability to manage life.”</para><para>(2), (4), and (6)	The very detailed information sought in the honourable senator's questions is not readily available in a consolidated form. The Department and the Detention Services Provider do not keep consolidated statistics on different categories of medical conditions suffered by detainees. It would be a major task to collect and assemble them. The practice of successive governments has been not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling such information on a general basis.</para><para>(3)	As clarified above, the Department has confirmed that at the end of January 2003 an average of 2.9% of detainees were on medication for a diagnosed psychiatric mental illness, including clinical depression, but not including reactive depression.</para><para>(5)	The Detention Services Provider keeps records on the use of medication enabling a manual count of persons on a particular type of medication to be extracted at a point in time. However, it does not keep them in a way that allows historical data to be easily extracted and collated. It would be a major task to collect and assemble it.

follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The data published in The Australian on 24 March 2003 included all people under the age of 65 in Commonwealth funded residential aged care at 31 January 2003. The data provided in response to question 2b, QON 1357, however, was only on the number, age group, and jurisdiction for people under the age of 65 in Commonwealth funded high (nursing home) and low (hostel) residential aged care where the State or Territory Government was the approved provider of aged care services.</para><para>(2)	As part of their client selection process, Government-funded disability services give priority to those people with highest needs, especially those with high support needs or a combination of factors which place them at a critical situation.</para><para>(3)	The Commonwealth has been collecting whole of year data for the last three years for disability employment services. Whole of year data is superior to snapshot data used in the Productivity Commission Report because it provides a count of service users accessing a service throughout the full year. This data is robust enough to be used for planning and policy development.  </para><para>(4)	The Aged Care Act 1997 specifies that younger people with disabilities will be accepted into nursing home care on compassionate grounds and where there is no other alternative. My Department has worked with the Department of Health and Ageing to tighten admission guidelines to ensure that admission is a last resort, and to ensure that all young applicants for residential aged care are first assisted to pursue more appropriate options through their state or territory government. </para><para>(5)	A copy of the CSTDA Implementation Plan will become available when the CSTDA has been signed by all jurisdictions.</para><para>(6)	(a)	The Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS) has met a number of times with State and Territory government officials to discuss strategies that could be included in Bilateral Agreements. At these meetings jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to address the needs of young people in nursing homes and to include relevant strategies and performance indicators in their Bilateral Agreement.</para><para>(b)	There is no extra funding attached to CSTDA3 Bilateral Agreements.</para><para>(7)	The Commonwealth is pleased with the outcomes achieved to date under the CSTDA negotiation process. We have a much more robust agreement which provides greater transparency and accountability to parliaments and the public as well as bilateral processes to achieve greater flexibility and better service delivery for people with disabilities. To date, two States have signed the Agreement and it is expected several more will follow in the coming weeks.</para><para>(8)	The issue of young people in nursing homes is a complex one, involving players from the State and Commonwealth, disability and health areas. Many of the bilateral agreements establish mechanisms for all parties to work together on this issue.</para><para>(9)	The Commonwealth has made a commitment of nearly $5 billion under the third CSTDA for disability services over the next five years. This is an increase of $1.7 billion over the last Agreement including an extra $835 million to address unmet need in employment services with the increased employment funding announced in the 2003-04 Budget.</para><para>In order to establish and reform systems to improve demand management over time, all Bilateral Agreements contain a standard clause that commits jurisdictions to provide information on improvements in areas such as systems to predict, monitor and manage inflows, methods for assessment and prioritisation of applicants, and systems for balancing long-term accommodation demand with other intervention.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Human Pituitary Derived Hormone Treatment</title><page.no>13118</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1481)</subtitle><id.no>1481</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13118</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 27 May 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Minister aware that Professor Allars, on page 703 of the 1994 Allars Report, and the 1997 Community Affairs References Committee Report CJD Settlement Offer stated that many recipients of pituitary-derived hormones experienced difficulties in accessing their medical files, stating that records were `missing or destroyed'.</para><para>(2)	Is the Minister aware that an `unapproved' patient, who declared himself as a patient of Human Pituitary Advisory Committee (HPAC) doctors, could only obtain access to his medical files by applying to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>(3)	(a) what does the department consider as an `unapproved patient';

The APMC includes the Minister for Justice and Customs of the Commonwealth, and Police Ministers responsible for firearms legislation and policy within each State and Territory. The Firearms Unit of the Attorney General's Department is responsible for providing the Government with a national and international perspective on firearms policy and for coordinating the development of national legislation on firearms within Australia's federal constitutional arrangements.

Leading national law enforcement bodies including the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Federal Police, inform the development of policy on firearms and provide information on trends in illicit firearms trafficking.  </para><para>Following a national planning conference in January 2003 involving senior representatives of all Australian criminal law enforcement and other relevant organisations, it was agreed that the Australian Crime Commission would coordinate strategic intelligence and operational activity relating to illegal firearms trafficking on a national basis. It has developed a national framework for the collection of intelligence relating to illegal firearms trafficking and is in the process of preparing a strategic assessment of the nature and scope of the trafficking problem within Australia.

In Australia's federal system of government, the six State and two Territory jurisdictions have direct legislative responsibility for firearms control measures. The Federal Government is responsible for controlling the import and export of firearms. </para><para>Following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 in which a person armed with high powered rifles murdered 35 persons at a historic tourist site, Australian governments tightened the regulation of ownership and licensing of firearms through the historic National Firearms Agreement (NFA). This agreement is the foundation of Australia's domestic firearms legislation. It reflected agreement by all governments in Australia's federal system to improve firearms legislation and introduced:</para><para>·	prohibitions on a range of automatic and semi-automatic or “military style” longarms, 660,000 of which were surrendered under a “buyback” and compensation scheme funded by the Australian Government;</para><para>·	registration systems maintained by each jurisdiction and linked across Australia;</para><para>·	requirement for genuine reasons for owning, possessing or using a firearm;</para><para>·	registration of all firearms;</para><para>·	licensing of all firearms owners;</para><para>·	strict health, character and safety criteria for firearms licence applicants;  </para><para>·	minimum firearms safety and storage requirements. </para><para>The Federal Government has continued to work with the governments of Australia's States and Territories to develop new legislative and policy initiatives in support of the aims of the NFA, to refine the regulation of lawful firearms owners and users and to improve community safety.</para><para>Most recently, following a tragic shooting at an Australian University, the Federal, State and Territory Governments of Australia agreed on further measures to reduce the circulation of small concealable handguns such as “pocket pistols” and to strengthen significantly controls on access to handguns by sporting shooters. The reforms do not affect access to handguns by official agencies such as Police or private security firms; however, a review of the allocation of handguns and storage practices in the private security industry will be conducted.  </para><para>Australian political leaders have given their unanimous support to the following strengthened control measures:</para><para>Prohibited handguns:   </para><para>Reforms will in effect restrict the classes of legal handguns to those meeting recognised sporting shooter classifications in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and other accredited events. </para><para>Sporting shooters will no longer have access to small and other easily concealable handguns and to those above .38” calibre. An exception to this limit will apply to sporting shooters who participate in a limited number of events which governments will jointly accredit where handguns of up to .45”calibre will be permitted.</para><para>Semi-automatic handguns with a barrel length of less that 120mm, and revolvers and single shot handguns with a barrel length of less than 100mm will be prohibited. Some specialized target pistols of a barrel length below 120mm will still be permitted because of their unique characteristics and lack of concealability. Shot capacity will also be limited to a maximum of ten.  </para><para>Stricter Controls on Access to Handguns</para><para>To ensure only genuine and committed sporting shooters gain access to handguns, the reform measures establish a system of “graduated access” to handguns by sporting shooters who wish to enter the sport. Sporting shooters will also be required to participate in a minimum number of shooting matches each year to demonstrate their commitment to the sport and their need for handguns. Failure to meet the minimum participation level will result in loss of the handgun licence. The access regime includes:</para><para>·	stricter character requirements;</para><para>·	limited access to handguns for the first six months of a person's licence; </para><para>·	progress to full access after 12 months upon establishing a genuine need for a handgun; adherance to safe storage requirements; and specification of the particular sports shooting discipline in which the handgun is required; and</para><para>·	a requirement that sporting shooter clubs endorse a member's application to acquire a handgun.</para><para>Buyback of prohibited handguns</para><para>The prohibition on certain handguns will be accompanied by a surrender and “buyback” of handguns and certains parts and accessories. This will commence in July 2003 and continue for six months. The Federal Government will fund two-thirds of the cost of acquiring prohibited handguns and the States and Territories one third. An amnesty will be conducted concurrently during which handgun owners can surrender illegally held handguns without penalty. The Government is ensuring that handgun owners including handgun dealers will receive fair compensation for handguns by developing valuations based on experts' opinions and a formal resolution process for disputed valuations.</para><para>Export/import controls</para><para>Australia also has in place strict and comprehensive controls and licence procedures to regulate the import and export of small arms. These controls regulate the legal trade in small arms, which in turn helps to prevent illicit trafficking.  </para><para>All proposed exports from Australia of defence and related goods, including small arms, are subject to comprehensive, case-by-case government review and licence procedures. Licence approvals are issued only where export is consistent with Australia's international obligations and broader interests, including security and human rights considerations.</para><para>Australia's strict policy on illegal arms transfers is illustrated by the various conditions under which exports of military small arms and military goods are expressly prohibited, including: </para><para>·	to countries against which the United Nations Security Council has imposed a mandatory arms embargo </para><para>·	to governments that seriously violate their citizens' rights, unless there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against those citizens</para><para>·	where foreign and strategic policy interests outweigh export benefits.</para><para>Australia has also decided that in certain circumstances it may be necessary to prevent the export of non-military lethal goods (including certain types of small arms, such as hunting or sporting weapons) to particular destinations on foreign policy, defence or other national interest grounds. As with military goods, the export of non-military lethal goods also requires an export licence or permit.</para><para>Australia fully complies with third party transfer undertakings and obligations provided to the original exporting State. The discharge of these obligations includes notification of the original exporting State of the intention to retransfer. Australia also requires end-use and end-user certification for small arms and light weapons from designated recipient states. Military firearms are only exported to a foreign government or its authorised representative.</para><para>Customs inspections are thorough and include use of sophisticated technologies and targetted inspections based on intelligence information.</para><para>In March 2000, Australia increased penalties for illegal firearms trafficking, including some types of small arms. Through amendments to the Customs Act 1901, criminal offences relating to smuggling or importing firearms were made punishable on conviction by a penalty of up to $250,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment.</para><para>On 20 December 2002, the Australian Government banned the import of all prohibited handguns by sporting shooters (that is, all handguns other than those which meet the prescribed physical characteristics, including barrel length, calibre and shot capacity) by amendment to its Customs legislation. States and Territories will have their own legislation in place by July 2003.</para><para>Tight controls are applied to all other firearms imports. For lawful handguns (such as for the private security industry), importers now require permission from State and Territory police prior to the importation and sale occurring, and limits are placed on the stocks of newly imported handguns that importers/dealers can hold (handguns stocks over and above the set limits must be held by the Australian Customs Service). The amendments will also extend controls to handgun frames/receivers in the same fashion as complete handguns. This is to prevent the possibility of handgun frames/receivers being legally imported as parts and subsequently assembled as an operative firearm or used to convert a permitted handgun into a prohibited handgun.</para><para>Other changes to national controls </para><para>Recent significant developments in Australian firearms policy and legislation include:</para><para>National Firearm Trafficking Policy Agreement - 2002 (NFTPA)</para><para>The NFPTA reflects Australia's focus on effective control of the illegal trade in firearms by strengthening domestic legislation and increasing efforts to detect and prosecute those engaged in firearms trafficking. The NFTPA, an administrative and legislative action plan was endorsed by Australasian Police Minister's Council (APMC) in July 2002 and provides for: </para><para>·	increased efforts to detect illegally imported handguns through improved Customs controls</para><para>·	The government has committed significant resources to prevent the illegal importation of handguns including increasing border activity and commissioning state-of-the-art x-ray equipment at Australian ports; </para><para>·	substantial legislative penalties for illegal possession or selling of a firearm and an extended and comprehensive legislative definition of “possession”; </para><para>·	consistent provisions to regulate the manufacture of firearms; </para><para>·	stricter monitoring of licensed firearms dealers including power to refuse or cancel licences where the dealer is associated with or employs persons of bad character;</para><para>·	tighter recording and reporting of transactions involving major component firearm parts to ensure firearms cannot be assembled from unregistered parts;</para><para>·	national legislation to complement State and Territory laws against firearms trafficking.</para><para>In support of its commitment to the NFPTA the Federal Government introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Act 2002. This legislation prohibits inter alia interstate trafficking in firearms and provides for a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine for those convicted of firearms trafficking. The penalty is in general more substantial than that provided under State and Territory legislation for the illegal sale or possession of a firearm.

Uncertainty about key parameters constrained the Commission to providing low and high estimates. For the gambling industries as a whole, estimates of their <inline font-style="italic">net</inline> contribution to society, ranged from a net loss of $1.2 billion to a net benefit of $4.3 billion. This masks divergent results for different gambling modes, with lotteries revealing clear net benefits, whereas gaming machines and wagering include the possibility of net losses. </para><para>(2)	Policy approaches for the gambling industries need to be directed at reducing the costs of problem gambling - through harm minimisation and prevention measures - while retaining as much of the benefit to recreational gamblers as possible.</para><para>(3)	The current regulatory environment is deficient. Regulations are complex, fragmented and often inconsistent. This has arisen because of inadequate policy-making processes and strong incentives for governments to derive revenue from the gambling industries.</para><para>(4)	Restrictions on competition have not reduced the accessibility of gambling other than for casino games. With the possible exception of casinos, current restrictions on competition have little justification.</para><para>(5)	Venue caps on gaming machines are preferable to statewide caps in helping to moderate the accessibility drivers of problem gambling. However, more targeted consumer protection measures - if implemented - have the potential to be much more effective, with less inconvenience to recreational gamblers.</para><para>(6)	Existing arrangements are inadequate to ensure the informed consent of consumers, or to ameliorate the risks of problem gambling. Particular deficiencies relate to:</para><para>-	information about the `price' and nature of gambling products (especially gaming machines);</para><para>-	information about the risks of problem gambling;</para><para>-	controls on advertising (which can be inherently misleading);</para><para>-	availability of ATMs and credit; and</para><para>-	pre-commitment options, including self-exclusion arrangements.</para><para>(7)	In such areas, self-regulatory approaches are unlikely to be as effective as explicit regulatory requirements. In most cases, regulation can be designed to enhance, rather than restrict consumer choice, by allowing better information and control.</para><para>(8)	Counselling services for problem gamblers serve an essential role, but there is a lack of monitoring and evaluation of different approaches, and funding arrangements in some jurisdictions are too short term.</para><para>(9)	Services, awareness promotion and research activities related to problem gambling are likely to be most effectively funded from earmarked levies on all segments of the gambling industry, with the allocation of funds independently administered.</para><para>(10)	The mutuality principle, combined with lack of constraints on gaming machine numbers, appears to be distorting the investment and pricing decisions of some clubs, with impacts on competitors. Of the options for dealing with it, only tax action at the state level appears feasible.</para><para>(11)	Policy decisions on key gambling issues have in many cases lacked access to objective information and independent advice - including about the likely social and economic impacts - and community consultation has been deficient.</para><para>(12)	An ideal regulatory model would separate clearly the policy-making, control and enforcement functions.</para><para>(13)	The key regulatory control body in each state or territory should have statutory independence and a central role in providing information and policy advice, as well is in administering gambling legislation.

The Government is willing to discuss issues that the US Administration raises in negotiations if they are able to argue that they impact on bilateral trade and investment. This does not mean that we will be prepared to make concessions on such issues. The Government has stated that it will not agree to any outcome from the negotiations that would undermine the objective of providing Australians with access to affordable medicines through a sustainable PBS.</para><para>(2)	(a)	We are not aware of any reasons why the PBS requirement for new drugs to justify their listing and price, by demonstrating comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness compared to alternative therapies would be considered a barrier to trade. These assessments are made to determine whether the drugs are subsidised.

Parliament is currently broadcast to these cities as well as Darwin, the Gold Coast and Gosford on the ABC's Parliamentary and News Network (PNN). When Parliament is not in session, PNN provides listeners with access to NewsRadio.</para><para>PNN is, however, available to all Australians (including those Western Australians who are unable to access the Perth region service terrestrially) via satellite based reception. This reception option would involve the installation and maintenance of: (a) a PNN self-help retransmission service by a Council or community group; or (b) direct-to-home (DTH) satellite reception equipment by an individual or household. </para><para>Under the self-help arrangements, a community (in the form of a Council or community group) funds the provision of a local rebroadcast transmission service. In order to establish such a service, the following would need to be installed at a suitable site: a transmitter, a dish to receive the relevant program feed from the satellite and an antenna to radiate the new self-help service to the community. Once established, the Council or community group would be responsible for meeting any ongoing licensing, operations and maintenance costs associated with the service.</para><para>Individuals or households who wish to pursue the DTH option would need to purchase and install the necessary reception equipment (a satellite receive dish and an integrated receiver decoder) at an approximate cost of $1300 to $1800, depending on the size of the dish required.</para><para>In addition to the above reception options, NewsRadio can be heard live on the Internet 24 hours a day - even when Parliament is being broadcast on the air in Australia - via the ABC's website at: http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio. </para><para>Parliamentary broadcasts can also be accessed live on the Internet via the Parliament House website at: http://www.aph.gov.au/live/webcast1.asp and Hansard text is available at: http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/index.htm.</para><para>(2)	The future extension of any national broadcaster radio or television service is dependent on the provision of appropriate funding and the availability of suitable spectrum capacity. Funding for such extensions would generally need to be considered by the Government in the Budget context and in light of competing priorities for the extension of national broadcasting services to other regions.</para><para>On 20 June 2003, I announced that if the Government received the Senate's support for its media ownership reforms, it would commit the necessary funding to extend ABC NewsRadio to all transmission areas with more than 10,000 people, subject to spectrum availability. This would provide a significant enhancement of diversity of news and opinion, by providing up to 62 areas of regional Australia with new or improved access to a dedicated national news service.</para><para>If suitable capacity proved to be available for the NewsRadio extension program to proceed as proposed, the ABC has estimated that it would improve NewsRadio's penetration rate in Western Australia from 76% to 90% and involve extensions to: Broome, Bunbury, Central Agricultural, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Southern Agricultural.</para><para>As you would be aware, the House of Representatives laid the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 aside on 26 June 2003 after rejecting some of the Senate's amendments.

All Operation Falconer personnel deployed in Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and United States (US) Air Force aircraft, chartered aircraft and scheduled civil airline services. US Air Force tanker aircraft were used to assist the deployment of the F/A-18 element. The majority of Special Forces Task Group and Air Force personnel deployed by civilian charter aircraft, with some deploying by military airlift. The vast number of Navy personnel deployed in Navy ships.</para><para>It is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown for the deployment by individual elements, particularly those that deployed by air, without significant research to match passenger manifests, crew lists, transport assets and units as members from difference units travelled together or on the same series of charters to ensure maximum utilisation of the particular transport asset.</para><para>(b)	The total cost for the initial deployment of personnel and equipment was $26.2m, excluding the operating costs of RAN ships and RAAF aircraft. The amount includes $0.358m for civil airline movement of personnel. The scheduled airline service figure cannot be broken down by Force Element as only the name of the personnel being deployed appears on the QANTAS account; a further break down of the figures would require significant time and staff resources to research and match names to units.

is to provide an integrated system of personal equipment, weapons and sensors for our soldiers. The project is currently planned to be progressed in several phases, as follows:</para><para>Phase 1 A capability definition study;</para><para>Phase 2 A project definition study;</para><para>Phase 3 Initial Acquisition;</para><para>Phase 4 Further Acquisition; and</para><para>Phase 5 Technology Enhancements and Through-Life Support.</para><para>(2)	(a)	Phase 1 was planned to start in 1996 and complete in 1998.</para><para>Phase 2 was planned to start in 2000 and complete in 2004.</para><para>Phase 3 was planned to have a 2003/2004 Year of Decision.</para><para>Phase 2 was subsequently split into two sub-phases, with Phase 2A approved initially in 1999 and increased in scope and cost in 2000. The 2000 Defence White Paper brought forward Phase 3 to a 2002/2003 Year of Decision, to follow on from Phase 2A, with a new Phase 4 added with a 2007/2008 planned Year of Decision. Subsequently the first part of Phase 3 was redefined as Phases 2B and 2C and these were planned for a 2003/2004 Year of Decision to follow Phase 2A, with the balance of Phase 3 - initial acquisition - planned for a 2006/2007 Year of Decision. The project is currently subject to review by Government as part of the overall regular review of the Defence Capability Plan.</para><para>(b)	The project was always expected to be evolutionary in nature, buying and updating equipment over time, so there was no defined end date for the project as a whole, although the original planning target was for Phase 3 to end around 2008.</para><para>(3)	Phase 1 $2m (1994 prices).</para><para>Phase 2 $11m (1999 prices). </para><para>Phase 3 $450m to $600m.</para><para>(4)	(a) and (b) The planned completion dates of each phase under current planning is as follows:</para><para>Phase 1 was completed in 1998/1999;</para><para>Phase 2A is expected to finish in 2003;</para><para>Phase 2B &amp; 2C are planned for completion by around 2006;</para><para>Phase 3 is planned for completion around 2008; and</para><para>The completion dates of Phases 4 and 5 will be depend on progress with earlier phases.</para><para>(5)	The costs of currently planned phases, based on the 2001 Defence Capability Plan, are as follows:</para><para>Phase 1 was completed at a cost of $2m;</para><para>Phase 2 has a proposed cost of $50m - $70m. Phase 2A has an approved budget of $14m with Phases 2B and 2C subject to further Government consideration;</para><para>Phase 3 has a proposed cost of $450m - $600m;</para><para>Phase 4 has a proposed cost of $350m - $450m; and</para><para>Phase 5 was not programmed in the last Defence Capability Plan.</para><para>(6)	(a)	$7m.</para><para>(b)	Phase 1 cost $2m. The remaining $5m is part of the uncompleted Phase 2A.</para><para>(7)	No. The 2001 Defence Capability Plan proposed a 2005/2006 Year of Decision for Phase 3.</para><para>(8)	The structure of the project phasing has been varied to reflect a refinement of the acquisition strategy, notably the current plans to develop the project cooperatively with the United States Army Land Warrior Program. The current timing of Phase 3 reflects this evolution of acquisition strategy as well as wider priorities in the overall Defence Capability Plan.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Funding</title><page.no>13264</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1517)</subtitle><id.no>1517</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13264</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the cut in funding from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to the Aboriginal Development Foundation (ADF) in the 2002-03 financial year.</para><para>(1)	Given that ATSIC had invited submissions for triennial funding and ADF submitted for this, why was it then not offered triennial funding.</para><para>(2)	Why did ATSIC, without advice, warning or prior communication reduce funding to ADF between 2001and 2002 from $457,320 to $292,619.</para><para>(3)	Does ATSIC have any duty of care in providing funds to organisations for the provision of services which have been long established.</para><para>(4)	Did the ATSIC procedures for grant assessment for the 2002-03 financial year fully comply with principles of natural justice.</para><para>(5)	What is the status of the ATSIC Service Charter.</para><para>(6)	Did ATSIC (Darwin Network Regional Office and Yilli Reung Regional Council) breach this Service Charter, which states that ATSIC aims include ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the same level of services which are provided to all Australians, to advise Indigenous people of their rights to make a complaint, and advise clients of their appeal rights.</para><para>(7)	Were organisations invited to submit for triennial funding in 2001.</para><para>(8)	(a) On 24 July 2001 was ADF sent a letter from a Mr Peris, Darwin Network Regional Office, approving funding. </para><para>(9)	Did this letter refer to a triennial budget figure of $457 320. </para><para>(10)	Did this letter from Mr Peris request `ADF to refer to the attached 3 year budgets and indicate if you agree with the budget, and if not please provide a preferred revised budget to ATSIC'.</para><para>(11)	Did ADF respond with a revised triennial budget.</para><para>(12)	Could the letter from Mr Peris have been taken to be a letter of offer.</para><para>(13)	Prior to April 2002, had ADF breached ATSIC funding conditions.</para><para>(14)	Prior to April 2002, had ATSIC issued any warnings to ADF that it was in any breach or performing poorly.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13265</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The ATSIC Darwin Regional Manager wrote to the Aboriginal Development Foundation (ADF) on 22 December 2001 inviting the ADF to make a submission for funding for the 2002/03 financial year. The letter clearly indicated that the Yilli Rreung Regional Council was seeking submissions for one year funding against the Regional Council program budget and possible three year funding against selected National Programs. </para><para>ATSIC Regional Councils are under no obligation to approve funding on a triennial basis.</para><para>The Yilli Rreung Regional Council (YRRC), after consideration of the previous performance of ADF in delivering programs, were not prepared to extend approval for funding over a three year period.</para><para>(2)	ATSIC Regional Councils have discretion to vary amounts offered to organisations that have been funded in previous years (even in the event of a multi-year Letter of Offer being issued). </para><para>Past funding to a number of organisations providing services, and which have been established for a period of time, has been approved based on historical funding levels. The YRRC has been pursuing a goal of achieving greater outcomes with available funding. </para><para>At a draft estimates meeting held in May 2002, the YRRC discussed appropriate funding allocations for all organisations for the 2002/03 financial year. As a result of its deliberations, the YRRC believed that, based on the number of people serviced (estimated at 217), the amount of $292,619 was a more justifiable and equitable allocation than had applied in previous years and would be sufficient to allow the ADF to carry out the services for which ATSIC funding was provided.</para><para>(3)	ATSIC Regional Councils are required to prepare a draft budget for the purpose of assisting to improve the economic, social and cultural status of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders living in the region concerned. </para><para>In approving funding to organisations, ATSIC must consider, amongst other things, the appropriateness of the level of funding against the established performance and demonstrated ability of the organisation to achieve acceptable outcomes in line with the objectives and performance indicators of each grant. </para><para>Duty of care in providing funds to organisations is only to the extent that the organisation can demonstrate acceptable outcomes and to a level of funding which is believed to be sufficient.</para><para>Further, ATSIC Letters of Offer clearly state that:</para><para>“This offer of funding does not imply any commitment to further funding from ATSIC.”</para><para>(4)	The Office of Evaluation and Audit (OEA) undertook a Special Audit on the propriety and probity of the decision by the YRRC to reduce the ADF funding for the 2002/03 financial year. The audit found that on the balance of the evidence the YRRC decision was sound. </para><para>In addition, a later investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office concluded it did not intend to further investigate the matter.</para><para>(5)	The ATSIC Service Charter is current and is available for viewing by the public on the ATSIC internet site. In addition, ATSIC has a well established Complaints Handling process, details of which are provided to all persons who are aggrieved by processes and/or decisions made by ATSIC staff and/or the ATSIC Elected Arm.</para><para>(6)	No. </para><para>The extent to which ATSIC can ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receive the same level of services which are provided to all Australians is limited by the extent of available funding and the influence that can be exerted on other government and non-government service providers. </para><para>The YRRC has an obligation to direct funding to achieve improvement in the economic, social and cultural status of all Indigenous people of the region for which they are responsible (estimated in excess of 8,000).</para><para>ADF was advised that a review is available by the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Further, the ATSIC Letter of Offer for 2002/03 funding provided details on how to pursue any dissatisfaction with the funding offered.</para><para>(7)	Funding submissions for the 2002/03 financial year were called for in late 2001. There were no invitations for triennial funding against the Regional Council budget for 2002/03.</para><para>(8)	The letter referred to from Mr Peris of the Darwin Network Regional Office was a facsimile with attachments showing requested, recommended and approved budgets. The facsimile indicated that ATSIC had approved a Municipal Services activity for an amount of $457,320. </para><para>(9)	No.</para><para>(10)	The letter from Mr Peris did not request the ADF to assess a proposed three year budget. As indicated in response to Question 8 above, the attachments to the facsimile included requested, recommended and approved budgets. Although the requested and recommended budgets contained figures relating to triennial budgets, the approved budget of $457,320 clearly related only to the 2001/02 financial year.</para><para>(11)	Yes.</para><para>(12)	No. </para><para>The ADF has been receiving and accepting ATSIC grant funding and conditions since the 1990/91 financial year and would be aware of the form of a Letter of Offer.</para><para>(13)	The ATSIC Grant Management System (GMS) has been operational since the 1998/99 financial year. The GMS records all financial and performance monitoring, including due dates. The Client Breach Report generated from the GMS indicates that the ADF has been consistently late in complying with ATSIC reporting requirements. Late submission of reports is a breach of grant conditions (and is outlined in the Terms and Conditions attached to Letters of Offer).</para><para>(14)	In the 2000/01 financial year, ADF was advised of concerns with its performance. As a result of these concerns, a Major Review was conducted in June 2001. The report of the Major Review detailed 20 recommendations, several indicating major concerns including governance issues.</para><para>Notwithstanding contact and assistance from ATSIC, it has taken the ADF nearly two years to provide a satisfactory response to the Review and implement its recommendations.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq </title><page.no>13267</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1520)</subtitle><id.no>1520</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13267</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the pre-war concern that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and advice from intelligence organisations:</para><para>(1)	Was advice given to the Government that the United States of America (US) or the United Kingdom (UK) were moving to invade solely because of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; if not, in each case, of what other motivation was the Government advised.</para><para>(2)	(a) Who in the Government was made aware of that advice; (b) from where did that advice come; and (c) who conveyed it to the Government and when.</para><para>(3)	Were weapons of mass destruction seen as the primary motivation for war for the UK or the US; if not, what was the primary motivation.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13267</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Like the Australian Government, the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom came to independent decisions on whether to participate in military action in Iraq.

A transitional fund will ensure that UWS is not financially disadvantaged in the transition to the CGS and will be fully compensated during the adjustment phase. </para><para></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tibet: Sino Gold</title><page.no>13281</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1616)</subtitle><id.no>1616</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13281</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 July 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to Sino Gold's project and work at Jinkang (Sichuan province), Tibet:</para><para>(1)	What information does the Government have on the project.</para><para>(2)	What support of any kind has been provided by the Government.</para><para>(3)	What representation or requests from Sino Gold have been made to the Government about the project.</para><para>(4)	What representations have been made to the Tibetan government-in-exile about Sino Gold's activities.</para><para>(5)	Has the Government been approached for, or provided, support of any kind to Sino Gold for its activities in Asia, including China; if so: (a) for which projects; (b) where; and (c) what amount or type of support.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13281</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Government is aware that Sino Gold is involved in gold exploration at Jinkang in Sichuan Province and has what information is available in the company's annual report.</para><para>(2)	The Government has given no specific support to the project.</para><para>(3)	None.</para><para>(4)	The Australian Government does not recognise a Tibetan government-in-exile.</para><para>(5)	No.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
