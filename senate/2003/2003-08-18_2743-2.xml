Amendments (3) to (8) are to do with public consultation by the minister. Amendment (8) clarifies that, if the Australian Heritage Commission finds a place has national heritage values, the minister cannot refuse to list the place or all of its national heritage values unless it has complied with the additional public consultation process. Amendment (9), which is about the inclusion of a place on the National Heritage List, changes the current provisions concerning the making of the final listing decision so as to be consistent with the amended nomination and assessment process. It relates to the standard listing procedure only and not to the emergency listing procedure, which is outlined in amendment (16).</para></talk.start><para>Amendments (10) to (16) are on emergency listing. Amendments (10) to (15) are relatively technical and do not have any substantial impact. They clarify the wording concerning the emergency listing process. Amendment (16) alters the decision making process for places included on the list via the emergency listing process, to account for the additional consultation process. Amendments (17) to (18) are relatively technical and account for the additional consultation process. Amendments (19) and (20) concern disclosure of the Australian Heritage Commission assessments and advice, and they ensure that the heritage council's assessments can be disclosed during the additional consultation period. </para><para>That is really the crux of our set of amendmentsâthe need for disclosure of heritage council decisions with regard to which sites are of heritage significance. We think that at the very least the government ought to agreeâin fact it did agree, in my talks with Minister Kemp and his advisers over the last few monthsâthat this disclosure keeps the government accountable. It does not stop the minister from deciding not to list. It does not stop the minister from saying, `That listing won't happen at this point in time.' What it does is allow there to be disclosure of a difference between what the heritage council says ought to be listedâthat is, what is assessed to be of heritage valueâ and that which the minister determines.</para><para>I do not know whether, Senator Hill, you have had a chance to look at these more carefully over the weekendâand I am sure you have spent most of it on this legislationâbut I remind you that this was the fourth in a line of different models that we attempted to persuade the government to address. Clearly, I think most of us in this place would like to see the heritage council determine what is on that list. We do accept that there is a political judgment to be made in some circumstances. However, the very least that should happen is that this requirement for disclosure be passed. Amendments (21) to (40)âand I remind you, Senator Hill, in case you missed it before, that the government did agree with us at some earlier stage but now chooses not toâmirror those discussed previously in relation to Commonwealth heritage listing processes. </para><para>Before finishing my remarks on this debate, I thought I would point to some of the statements that have been made on listing. As I said, it is a crucial part of this whole bill. The protection or otherwise of heritage sites can be politicised, a matter just for the minister to determine, or a process whereby there is public involvement when there is disagreement. So when the council determines that a site is worthy of listing and the minister decides otherwise, I think it is reasonable to say that there should be a process which involves the public. I will quote from the joint letter that was sent to me from the Humane Society, the WWF and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. It contains a set of recommended amendments, and I think they are important. They say:</para><quote><para>The bill should be amended to include a requirement that the minister be compelled to designate all heritage values of a place as national heritage values or Commonwealth heritage values if he or she is satisfied that they meet the national or Commonwealth heritage criteria. Further, there should be a presumption in favour of the inclusion or retention of a place or values on those lists if there is uncertainty regarding whether the place satisfies the listing criteria or continues to have certain heritage values.</para></quote><para>I quote from that document because it is typical of the positions that were put by conservation groups. It does go to the absolute discretion of the minister to list or otherwise. As I said, this seems to me to be central.</para><para>The Democrats did understand the political reality and it is the case that this provides better protection for heritageâthere is no question about that. But again, at the end of the day it comes down to the will of the minister to apply that protection. We think that, in terms of accountability and of being able to publicly demonstrate what is going on, this amendment is reasonableâeven more than reasonable. This was compromise No. 4 as far as we were concerned. I strongly urge the minister to consider supporting it. We thought there was no opposition to this at the end of the day by the government, but it seems that the minister has changed his mind. I would be interested in the minister indicating to the Senate what his deliberations have been on this matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13732</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government does not support the package of amendments before the chamber now but it does support the general direction of many of those amendments. As I said on the last occasion, there has been a very long process of debate on the listing process not only between the political parties involved but with the various interest groups. Whilst I could go through each of the amendments and express the government's concern about particular aspects of them, I do not know that it is a constructive use of time in the circumstances, whereby I can say that at least a number of these amendments have been picked upâbut, we would argue, improvedâin amendments that are to be debated further along the line. </para></talk.start><para>So, in terms of the efforts Senator Allison has made in improvingâfrom her perspectiveâthe listing processes, if the Senate does pass the foreshadowed amendments she will see that they have achieved some of the outcomes she has been seeking. In those instances, efforts have been made to improve the drafting so that, if the bill is passed in terms of the foreshadowed amendments rather than these amendments, the government will be more confident that they will achieve the outcomes which Senator Allison and others within the heritage community have been seeking. That would be my response to the block of 40 amendments we are looking at.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13733</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Greens support the amendments and think they are good ones. I think it is the proper place for me to ask the minister, because it crosses some of these amendments, for a response in general to the report by the Australian National Audit Office for January to June 2003. It is an audit activity report which I am sure the minister has. Page 74 says that the office made six recommendations to Environment Australia which aim, firstly, to improve the consistency and quality of referrals made under the act, which is the act we are dealing with; secondly, to address the risks from referrals of staged developments that may circumvent the objects of the act; thirdly, to improve awareness of the requirements of the act; fourthly, to strengthen monitoring and review arrangements; fifthly, to finalise compliance and enforcement procedures and guidelines, ensuring that there are timely and effective responses to all potential breaches of the act; and, finally, to enhance the quality of public reporting on the administration of the act. The report says that Environment Australia has agreed with all the recommendations. Could the minister explain how Environment Australia is going to remedy those shortcomings that were listed by ANAO? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13733</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI read that audit report, and it did seem to be generally supportive of the processes implementing the EPBC legislationâwhich was good, considering that it is new legislationâbut it did suggest some modifications, as indicated by Senator Brown. I am told that the minister has accepted that advice in each instance and that the department is currently developing the ways in which it will meet the commitment that it has made in regard to the processes that relate to each of the particular recommendations. So my advice is that that is work in progress. Senator Brown will understand that, because the audit report is very recent. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13733</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you. If the minister has any written response to that report, I would be pleased to see it. Because it crosses a number of parts of the legislation, I ask the minister about the report in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the erection of the Telstra tower on the Patriarchs group of rocky mountains on Flinders Island. I quote from that report by Melissa Fyfe, the environment reporter:</para></talk.start><quote><para>An 850-metre-long swatheâin places 12-metres wideâhas been cut through a patch of the rare dogwood <inline font-style="italic">Pomaderris intermedia</inline>, listed under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act.</para><para>The Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment is investigating the incident.</para><para>Telstra said its contractors were told only to make a 45-centimetre trench for a power line under an existing narrow track.</para><para>Another plant, <inline font-style="italic">Isopogon ceratophyllus</inline> or horny cone bush, listed as vulnerable under the legislation, was also bulldozed, along with many centuries-old slow-growing grass trees.</para><para>The 30-metre tower, part of Telstra's mobile phone roll-out on the island, was approved despite the area's zoning as visually significant under the island's planning scheme.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say how the local plant expert Mr John Whinray, a very famous local resident, had come across the environmental destructionâand there is a picture of the cobra greenhooded orchid recently found on Flinders Island by Mr Whinray. </para><para>Could the minister tell me what progress has been made in discovering why Telstra made the extraordinary swatheâand there is a picture of itâthrough this particular high conservation area on Flinders Island? Could he tell me whether the species that are endangered there have federal listing or listing under this legislation? What is there in this legislation that is going to specifically whack people like Telstra and/or its contractors who create havoc like this which cannot be undone? Mr Whinray points out that he does not think that what has been done there will ever be undone.</para><para>This follows on my noting of the Auditor-General's report about the difficulty of sometimes getting to the very people who might breach components of the actâand if Telstra does not know then who does? If Telstra is able to behave in such an environmentally irresponsible fashion, then what can we expect of other enterprises which do not have the wherewithal of Telstra or their stated avocation for the environment?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>13734</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have asked for specific advice relating to that matter. I do not have that to hand but will get it. This is obviously another instance where the heritageâand it sounds as if this is principally natural heritage valuesâis protected by both the state and the Commonwealth according to the values that are protected. If they are national heritage values then, as defined, they would be protected under the Commonwealth legislation, and there are very significant penalties attached to that legislation for breach. Whilst I am not very familiar with the Tasmanian legislation, I assume there are penalties attached to that legislation if it relates to an asset that is protected by the state of Tasmania. But in relation to the detail of this particular action and whether it affects any Commonwealth values, that is something that I need some specific advice on and I will report to the Senate when I get that advice.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>13734</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for that because I am very interested to hear what information there may be on this matter. On the matter of Tasmanian heritage, it is spotty down there. The breach is very often what is honoured and extensive habitat, for example, of rare and endangered plant and other species which are listed on both the national protected list and the Tasmanian protected list are repeatedly bulldozed in Tasmania under the regional forest agreement. </para></talk.start><para>The minister might like to comment at this stage because it is the next one that is very important. He will be aware that there has been an application to Dr Kemp, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, to approve the Meander Dam at the headwaters of the Meander River. The planning authorities in Tasmania decided not to go ahead with this project because, amongst other things, the area is a threatened habitat and a particularly rich one for the endangered tiger quoll in Tasmania, which, if my understanding of this is correct, is listed under this piece of legislation, the EPBC.</para><para>Not accepting the umpire's ruling on this, the Tasmanian Labor government of Premier Jim Bacon, who is the Minister for National Parks, hurried through legislation after the land and environment umpire had said, `No, you cannot proceed with the dam,' to override the heritage legislation in Tasmania so that it will proceed. Now the gatekeeper on this is the federal minister. I do not see how on earth, if we are to have faith in this legislation for the protection of the species and Australia's heritage, he could give the go-ahead for the flooding of a prime habitatâas found by the planning commission in Tasmaniaâfor the tiger quoll, a large carnivorous marsupial with its healthiest stronghold in Tasmania. The matter is now before the minister for the environment, Dr Kemp.  </para><para>I know there is a great deal of anxiety about this particular habitat in the headwaters of the Meander River both locally and statewide. It is a very important test case as to whether this EPBC Act that we are dealing with is going to be honoured by the Australian government. I wonder whether the minister could tell the committee what the progress is as far as the minister making the decision is concernedâand I think it can only have one conclusion. Can he tell us whether there is a time line and what the process is that is being undertaken to ensure that this process is not listed by political actions, like those high-handed actions of the Tasmanian Premier and government just a couple of weeks ago?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13735</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am advised that the process is advanced and that Dr Kemp determined that the proposed action was a controlled action in terms of the EPBC legislation. That triggers an evaluation process which has been taking place. Dr Kemp will have to make a decision, ultimately, on whether the project can proceed in terms of EPBC legislation. Advice to him on that issue from the department has not yet been received but I understand it is not too far away.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13735</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wonder if the minister would be good enough to provide the committee with the terms of reference of the minister's inquiry to the department, which species are involved in that terms of reference, what the process is for making an evaluation and indeed if there is a time line. By terms of reference, I mean the minister's briefing, in whichever way it might be, as to what he needs to know about the issue of the Meander Dam and the threat it poses to this important habitat for the tiger quollâand, I understand, a number of other speciesâand what other matters are entered into.</para></talk.start><para>The other matter that impressed the Tasmanian planning commission was the failure of the government and the lobby group involved to be able to show that there were the financial benefits that were touted from this dam. There was very good evidence that it was not going to be as financially beneficial as pointed out. I know the minister will have the planning commission's full report on his desk. And I know that financial matters like that will be subservient to the environmental consideration being made by the minister about such an important endangered species as the tiger quoll. I would be very pleased to hear if there is an expected date of decision and what the parameters are of the advice the minister has sought.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13735</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe reference is on the web site and the details of the proposed action and the triggers as identified by the proponent are referred to in that reference. Detail, as it relates to any particular known endangered species, should have been included in that reference and be on the web site. As I said, the advice of the department to the minister was that it amounted to a controlled action and therefore triggered the Commonwealth legislation. Dr Kemp, I am told, accepted that advice. That leads to a process, as set out in the legislation, that enables public submissions to be lodged. No doubt the proponent has put further information, and that information is being evaluated by the department. Advice will be given to Dr Kemp. In the end he is obliged to take into account other circumstances, which is the balance that is created within the EPBC Act, and no doubt he will do so.</para></talk.start><para>At the time of the drafting of the legislation that was one of the differences the government had with Senator Brown because Senator Brown was of the view that other circumstances should not be taken into account in the final evaluation process. It might be that the state government is putting an economic argument to Dr Kemp through his department; I do not know. As I said, that is work in progress within the department at the moment. I was asked whether we had an indication of a closing date and I am told that we do not but I have also been told that the matter is expected to be completed in the reasonably near future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>13736</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for that. Yes, I am very strong on the environment being given pre-eminence when it comes to environmental legislation. I would remind the minister that it is not unusual thinking. The World Trade Organisation legislation, which the government signed and put through this parliament in 1986, was made on the basis that economic considerations were paramount, and the environment and social justice were considered zip when it came to making decisions by that international body, with Australia's authority. So there is a precedent for not being across the board in an assessment of a piece of legislation. In this case, the environment should be seen as pre-eminent. That being said, can the minister tell the committee what the other considerations areâI know they will be listed on the web siteâand whether these include the economic considerations and, of course, those political considerations which come down to lobbying from the pressure groups in Tasmania who are in favour of the dam, including both of the big political parties? I wonder if the minister could say how the financial assessment, which is the chief one of those other considerations, is being made by the department? Does it have expertise? Is the minister seeking other advice, or is he going to go on the advice of the planning commission in Tasmania or will he simply take the advice from the biased point of view of the Tasmanian government?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13736</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe usual practice is that the department would seek verification of a submission that did argue some economic benefit. Exactly how the department is doing that in this instance, I do not know. If Senator Brown wants to know, I can make those inquiries and see what information is available. If Dr Kemp is uncertain about any particular issue in the advice given to him by the department, he can require further work to be commissioned. In the end, it is his decision and he must be satisfied. I am sure Dr Kemp will ensure that he will make these very difficult decisions on the best evidence available. Whilst we have great respect for the states, the statutory obligation is on the Commonwealth if it is a matter of national environmental significance, and I would expect that Dr Kemp would exercise that responsibility with great care.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13736</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would be pleased if the minister would furnish me with the information about how the assessment is being made and who is involved, so I thank him for making that offer. Secondly, because water policy is so important at the moment and this decision cannot be extricated from that, how is the government going to assessâbecause it must be built into this decisionâthe cost to the community of an environmental flow down the Meander River below this dam in the future, because that is a cost against the dam? Could the minister also explain how the current evolution of government water policy is going to affect this decision by the minister on the Meander Dam? There are very big environmental as well as other social and economic factors involved there. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>13737</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not know the answer to that. The evolution of Commonwealth water policy is, firstly, to determine that important natural values are not lost through overextractionâin other words, that extraction for commercial, recreation or other uses is maintained at a sustainable levelâand, furthermore, that the usage of such water goes to highest value outcomes. The determination of that is never easy, particularly if you are trying to equate, for example, a recreational benefit against a commercial benefit. But, because of our prejudices, we think there is room for the market to assist in that regard, certainly between commercial uses, and thus we are seeking to encourage and support regimes that properly cost water, that allow transfer of water to higher value outcomes and that in other ways seek to reduce waste and low-value usage. But all of that is after assessment and support for maintaining the flows that are at least necessary to preserve the health of the natural system.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13737</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Meander River currently has a natural flow but has water extracted for various downstream purposes.

Our preferenceâand Senator Brown indicated the direction of the government's proposed reformsâis that an assessment be made of the flows that are necessary, not just simply the quantity of water but the timing of the flows and so on, to conserve the natural system and those environmental values that are obviously important to us all and that commercial exploitation is subject to that necessary minimum. It is not easy to apply in practice, but I think approaching it in that way is actually better than the approach that I think is being advocated by Senator Brown.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13737</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe obvious question that comes from that is: how do you make an assessment that you can take away part of the flow of a natural watercourse and maintain its natural health? That is absurd. As soon as you start to interfere with the ebb and flow and the rise and fall of a river's natural reaction to precipitation and other factors, you start to have an impact on the environment. I want to correct the minister here: it is not within the realm of human capability to be able to subtract water from a river and still maintain its natural environmental health. What has to be judged here is how much detrimental impact you will have on the environment by taking water away and how far you will allow that to go.</para></talk.start><para>Maybe as a result of the discussion about the Snowy Mountains getting 28 per cent returned to itâand I saw in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that even that is not sureâthere is some magic percentage below 100 at which you can draw a line and the river will not be affected. That is absurd; it is not true. What you are measuring is how much detriment to the environment you are going to allow to happen. There is no argument or debate in that; it is just a factâit is just how life is on this planet. There is a lot of obfuscation and green wash that gets in there to say that we can take away 72 per cent of a river's flow and we have done the right thing to ensure what is called an environmental flow, which is a misnomer for a massive impact on the environmentâthat is, the water will get down there in a way that we can tout as a good thing for it and maybe we will not have to look at the damage that continues to occur through taking that water away. </para><para>The Meander Dam is going to be the first in-stream dam on this river. It is one of those rarities in Australia these days where there is not a dam on the riverâbut it is coming. The people who are proposing that would put their shoulder behind another dozen or so dams being proposed in north-east Tasmania and down the east coast in the near future. I do not think that the minister is right in saying that there is going to be an outcome which says you measure what is good for the environment and then people can pay for what else is required to come out of the river. It will be the other way around: people will fight over the water they can get out of the river and the highest bidder will pay. Under those circumstances, it leaves the environment with no leverage, unless the government has policy. I am trying to establish what the government's policy is for defending the inevitable impact of subtraction of water out of rivers. Where is that defined? Is it true that it is not defined but left for an environmental grab-bag at the end of the day: the old leftover mentality of the age of materialism and resource extraction? I think that that is the case. If it is not, I would be pleased to hear from the minister as to the defined policy his government has in ensuring that the current circumstances for rivers around Australia are maintained or improved when it comes to the environment and that we just do not get terminology like minimal impact, mitigation or environment flowâwhatever that might mean.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13738</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not sure that I can say much more. I have outlined the structure of the best practice proposal that the Commonwealth is taking to the forthcoming COAG meeting. It is obvious that, whenever water is extracted, it does have some consequences on the environment. If you adopt a policy of no extraction of water from Australia's river systems, that would be an uncomfortable experience for all of us who live in Adelaide, which is now totally reliant on extraction from the River Murray. How do we try and assess what quantity can be extracted sustainably? That is not an exact science, but you obviously take the advice of specialists and, in the end, make a judgment on the basis of that advice. If you find that you have made a mistake, as we have on many river systems in Australia that perhaps had not been thought through in quite that way, then you have to find a way of winding back the level of extraction. That is not easy either. One way in which you may do it in the public interest is to purchase water for environmental outcomes.</para></talk.start><para>I have a little more information in relation to the Meander Dam proposal, in part to modify slightly my earlier answer.

Further submissions have been made by both the proponent and the Tasmanian government and they are being taken into account.

I gather that each of these properties has a different mix of tenures and none of them will be wholly owned by the Commonwealth.

That process is ongoing. The Commonwealth has given certain commitments in terms of restraints on the use of that property to ensure that the heritage values are preserved. The EPBC legislation does not trigger sales per se; it triggers actions that are potentially contrary to national heritage values.

I ask the minister how on earth he could believe that if he is going to dispose of such heritage it is not going to be eyed off for a different function. Is he not, by his own philosophy, saying to people with moneyâ that is, to the marketâ`See what you can do with this piece of national heritage'? Does not the very fact of divesting it immediately expose it to market control of its future? Doesn't the government see other values, outside the market, which are important to communities and to the nation when it comes to heritage? I think this is right at the crux of what we are debating here today. Ought not that value to the nation have been assessed more clearly before the government began to divest itself, saying that there was not a need for this heritage being in national ownership? I think many constituents would say, `There is a need for it, a very important need.'

The Commonwealth is actually expending quite a little at the moment, but there is a great deal more that is going to be needed to be spent if these buildings are going to be properly conserved.

But whilst the alternatives are being considered it seems to me that it would be unhelpful for me to speculate upon them at this time. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13744</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a specific question.

The minister has said that people who are interested in developing the sites of these heritage buildings can conserve the heritage values and get on with their projects. What is missing, if that is the case, is the government's list of heritage requirements and the means by which they are going to be strapped down in perpetuity. The developer has no trouble with the heritage values being protected. The government is going to protect the heritage values. We have a process under way, but the government has no extant plan. It should have one. It should be saying to the public at large that is concerned about Point Nepean: `Here is your guarantee. Look at this. Our cards are on the table.' But it is not doing that. It is saying, `Trust usâcoming down the line is some sort of formula that you will be happy with.'

I do not feel at all reassured by what the minister has had to say. Where is the heritage values guaranteeâthe HVG? People do not believe the government is going to protect the heritage values and they certainly do not believe that developers who buy at a prodigious cost and develop at a prodigious extra cost to make a profit are going to have heritage values right at the forefront of their minds. It just does not work that way. I say to Minister Hill and, through him, Minister Kemp: for goodness sake come out with this insurance plan on the heritage values. It is missing. You should have it at the front. If you are happy with it you should be able to give it to the public, but you do not have one that guarantees these values. So far the clearest assurance I have had is that the developersâpeople who want to make this into a projectâcan conserve the heritage values.

What I cannot do at the moment is detail the protections the government will implement because, as I have said several times already today, that matter is still under consideration. But the information about the form of protection would be made publicly available before the next stage of the process.

In many ways it is a celebration that the government has been able to accept advice from the ADF that the circumstances in which our forces are operating in East Timor can no longer reasonably be classified as warlike. It is true that the tax consequences now change, but it has occurred in circumstances that most Australians would be very pleased to hear about. Speaking generally, if it is a warlike operation then the whole of the salary as well as the allowances are tax free; if it is not warlike, that does not apply. So, yes, there will be a taxation consequence as a result of the government accepting that advice and making that decision, but it has not been made for any taxation reason; it is simply a reflection of the circumstances of the particular operation.

In fact, to ensure that the government was reasonable to the forces, who we very much value and appreciate, we decided that even though the decision on warlike conditions was changing in the middle of a rotation the allowances could continue as though the declaration had not been made. So the normal thing would be that when the operation ceased to be warlike not only would the taxation consequences change but also the allowance would be reduced.

Under the new health care agreements we are going to be giving the states $42 billion, which is a $10 billion increase and 17 per cent over and above inflation. How on earth this can be a decrease beggars belief. But it does not matter: Mr Beattie uses taxpayers' money to take out a full-page ad to say we are going to decrease funding to Queensland. Queensland will be getting $2.1 billion moreâin fact, Queensland gets a 20 per cent increase over and above inflation as well as being the first state to benefit from increases from the GST. If Mr Beattie wants to tell the truth, he ought to use taxpayers' money to tell the Australian public, in particular Queenslanders, that they will be getting $2.1 billion moreâa 20 per cent increase over and above inflation.

It was very interesting on Friday morning when Mr Corbell came out and said he was going to sign up to the agreements. What happened? He had been left out of the loop: the New South Wales Premier, the Queensland Premier and the Victorian Premier had forgotten to tell Mr Corbell that they had a little planâthey had a little stunt they were going to put on, and Mr Corbell was left out of it. He was hung out to dry and had to run around on Friday saying, `Oops, I didn't mean to tell people I was going to sign up.' </para><para>The state budgets have factored in the growth that the Commonwealth is offering them, so this is grandstanding. This is a stunt which always occurs when the Commonwealth is making its offer to the states. We are requiring the statesâfor the first time in the history of Australiaâto say what they will spend this financial year and at least match our growth. The Commonwealth has had to put up in front for five years what it is going to spend on state hospitals. The states contribute to the hospitals and they run the hospitals. The states have never been put under the hammer like this before. They do not like it. They do not like having to tell the Australian public what they are going to spend.

That is totally untrue. If he listens to what the President of the AMA says, to what the President of the Queensland branch of the AMA says and to what the College of Emergency Medicine says, the number of patients going to emergency departments is not affected by issues associated with GPs. Those doctors working at the coalface tell us that there is an increase, but it is an increase in the number of people at the very high need end, those people who get admitted to hospitals. The figures from emergency departments show that a significant number of people go into hospital as a result of going into an emergency department. About one per cent of people who go to a GP end up in an emergency department. A much higher proportion of those people who would be categorised as normally going to a GP and who front up at an emergency department end up in a hospital. </para><para>The states ought to admit that they need to reform.

Is the minister aware that the insulin pump costs around $6,500 and that ancillary items for the pump, including cannula lines and needles, cost about $2,700 annually? Why has the Howard government refused to list either the pump or its ancillary equipment on the National Diabetes Services Scheme, putting this life-saving treatment out of reach of those Australians with brittle diabetes who cannot afford it? Does the minister realise that her department has approved criteria for limiting the number of claims that could be made by insulin pump users but has been stopped in its tracks by her refusal to approve the listing of the pump ancillaries on the subsidy scheme? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13752</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I have said before in this place, there are huge demands on the public purse in terms of health. Every time we turn around there is another issue that is very worthy and very demanding of the health fund. I remind honourable senators that the medication we have just put on the PBS for arthritis will cost $100 million a year for 9,000 people. We need to always look at the enormous demands there are on the health bill. Two applications have been received from the manufacturer of the latest generation of insulin infusion pumps for consideration of subsidy for the consumables of these pumps to be included in the National Diabetes Services Scheme. A decision on subsidising these products will take into consideration the health benefits provided by the products, the overall cost to government and the competing priorities for health expenditure. Insulin infusion pumps deliver a constant dose of insulin that is particularly beneficial to people with type 1 diabetes who cannot adequately control their blood glucose levels.</para></talk.start><para>An expert advisory panel convened by Diabetes Australia has provided advice on the health benefits of the new generation of these products. The panel concluded that the new products are superior to the currently listed products, with a lower incidence of blockage and kinkage and a lower risk of diabetic side effects. However, the cost of consumables is high, at around $200 per month for each patient, and the overall cost to government of subsidising these could run into tens of millions of dollars per annum, depending on the uptake of pumps among diabetics. The challenge is to find a way of managing the costs while ensuring the most effective use and the best health outcomes. We are committed to ensuring that Australia continues to play a leading role in diabetes research and service provision. Our strategies ensure that both health professionals and people with diabetes are well positioned to improve the prevention, early detection and management of diabetes.</para><para>The total 2003-04 budget estimate for Commonwealth spending on diabetes initiatives is $300 million. Our commitment to diabetes is evidenced by this government championing the establishment of diabetes as a national health priority area in 1996 in response to the increasing burden of diabetes on the Australian community. People with diabetes are served well by the government's two key programs that provide subsidised access to a range of essential diabetic products and services, the National Diabetes Services Scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These schemes provide insulin, diagnostic agents and syringes at heavily subsidised prices. Government expenditure on diabetic products for these schemes for 2002-03 was nearly $260 million, an increase of $27 million or 11.5 per cent over the previous year. In 1999 the government committed $2.3 million per annum to the National Diabetes Strategy, which is endorsed by all Australian health ministers. The strategy provides a focus to coordinate the wide-ranging activities being undertaken across Australia to improve the early detection, prevention and management of diabetes.</para><para>In the last 18 months this government has introduced a world first program to improve the care of people with diabetes through general practice, with funding of over $43.4 million over four years. It is a very successful program for diabetes management in general practice, and I think it is a great initiative of the Howard government. The program represents a national approach to improving the prevention, early diagnosis and management of people with diabetes through the provision of incentive payments to general practitioners. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13753</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is very easy for Senator Mackay to get up and choose one item, one group.

It gets confused, it gets lost and it gets politicised when a summit is held two weeks before the health care agreements are determined. They came to me and said, `We're not going to have politicians speaking at it. It is not going to be political.' Then I suddenly found a leaked email that said that I had refused to speakâI had not actually had an invitation to speak at the stage when the email went aroundâand then I found out that Mr Carr was going to speak. I was then told, `He's only speaking at lunchtime. He is not on the program.' Today, I find that he is on the program and he is speaking. Really, you have to begin to wonder.

We have had that debate over nine months, but it got lost in November, December, January, February and March in a debate about funding. When Mr Craig Knowles was health minister, he said to me twice at that meeting and in front of all those ministers, `We can do better with the money we've got. We don't need more.' We are giving them more, 17 per cent more. We spend $40 billion a year on health between the state and the federal governments. I believe we can do it better.</para><para>You have only to go across to Canberra Hospital to find a young man working over there who has just received our Cochran collaboration prize looking at best practice. By a simple method of identifying patients at risk and deciding which patients should wear a stocking, which patients should wear a stocking and take a drug and which patients should wear a stocking and take a different drug, he has reduced deep vein thrombosis by 25 per cent. Imagine the savings to that hospital. Imagine the savings to those people in terms of pain and suffering and being in hospital for four or five weeks with deep vein thrombosis. That is the sort of reform we need, reform at the interface between primary health care and acute care.</para><para>I am not going to be embroiled in a discussion when I asked them to hold the summit after the funding arrangement and when I indicated to them that I was committed to reform. I did that with those eight health ministersâat great risk to me.

The ministers have already come to me and said that they want to work with me. When they have stopped this argy-bargy, when the premiers have let them get on with debating and discussing reforms with meâlike the $6Â½ million we have just given Tasmania for after-hours care to reduce the number of people who call doctors out unnecessarily and which will take the strain off the doctors and relieve public hospitals of people appearing at night when they do not really need toâwe can have the sorts of reforms that help not only doctors and patients but also public hospitals.

A doctor from Griffithâand I have forgotten her nameâsaid in response to a question at the Medicare inquiry that doctors should not have to bulk-bill.

As I have said over and over again in this chamber, there are as many billing practices as there are doctors. Some doctors, whatever you paid them, would not bulk-bill.

There is some pressure on doctors when they come into an area not to bulk-bill. A Fairer Medicare package is about increasing the number of doctors and getting more GP registrars on the ground. There are 234 new medical student places and those people who come out of their training will work in areas of work force shortage, as either a specialist or a general practitioner.

It gives me the opportunity to give some information that I have acquired as a consequence of a table that was given to an estimates committee, and the estimates committee was notified that we were not satisfied that the information in that was correct. I notice that, despite that qualification being given to the estimates committee, Mr Swan has nonetheless proceeded to release the table and to assume the worst as a consequence of it. The table indicates that there might beâand much has been made of thisâ15 millionaires in receipt of family tax benefit. I understand why people initially say, `Well, how could that be?' I have made a point of looking at those first 15 in the first instance, and have asked for an inquiry in relation to all of the payments that have been raised. I do note that Mr Swan does not accept there could be any legitimate reason for these payments being made. </para></talk.start><para>I go first to four of the 11, I think they are, because I recall last week in this place and elsewhere Mr Swan saying that I, because I am the representative of the government in this area, was one of the meanest, nastiest people because we were reviewing child disability allowance saved casesâand this was a dreadful thing to be doing. In fact, four of the people who have incomes which might include fringe tax benefit or capital gainsâit is not necessarily taxable income; it is adjusted taxable incomeâare child disability allowance saved cases people. As it turns out, the very people that Mr Swan was complaining about being reviewed last week he is now complaining are not in receipt of any benefit. Why are those saved cases in receipt of family tax benefit when they have these high incomes?</para><para>Senator Wong, I would not expect you to know this because you were probably genuinely in primary school when this happened. In 1993, 10 years agoâthat is a reasonable assumption; you might look younger than you are; I don't knowâthe child disability allowance did not have an asset or income test on it. However, after 1993 Labor effectively put an asset and income test on it for future recipients, but they saved the people prior to 1993 and said, `You do not have to worry, we will not put it on you.'</para><para>There are 586 saved child disability allowance cases involving people in receipt of family tax benefit who have incomes of over $100,000. Four of them have incomes of over a million dollars. That is as a consequence of a Labor decision in 1993 which we have not gone back on; we have continued to protect these people. You can see from that, Senator, that there is a perfectly legitimate explanation for some of those cases. I do not imagine there will be a legitimate explanation for all of them. However, one other legitimate explanation is that people had expected to have either very low or reasonable incomes and during that year they had a very significant capital gain.

By way of further example, equally some of these people will have, when their income is reconciled at the end of the year, a debt raised against them and we will be collecting that money back. That is another explanation and in that sense the system works. But I am not satisfied just with the knowledge that there will be a number of perfectly reasonable explanations for this, including Labor saved policy. I have asked for an inquiry to be held and where there are any loopholes you can be sure that I will be looking to close them.

Whether it is ripping off the taxpayer through the $36 million Centenary House rort or avoiding the donation disclosure rules through the Bolkus rafflegate or Markson Sparks, or rorting the electoral roll, there is no depth too low for Mr Crean and Labor. Senator Brandis was right when he said that Peter Beattie vowed to drive the rorters out of the party and that Mr Crean has put them in charge.

The minister is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on Saturday, 16 August as saying: </para><quote><para>I am concerned that the summit is in danger of being hijacked by NSW for its own interests.</para></quote><para>How outrageous and reprehensible a proposition it is that someone could seek to attend a national health summit and put forward their own case and speak in their own interests! Isn't that what a summit is meant to be all about? Isn't that the way summits are meant to work? Did the minister perhaps think that New South Wales should put forward the Commonwealth's position? Given that the minister did not attend then it may be right that the Australian people could be forgiven for thinking that New South Wales would put forward the Commonwealth's position.</para><para>The language the minister chooses to use also tells us about her frame of mind when tackling this issue. The minister uses some nice descriptive words about those attending the summitâwords such as `hijacked'. There is nothing like resorting to the language of fear and personal attack when you are trying to get your message across! What an insult to the many organisations, professions and individuals and the states and territories that attended the national health summit. Here we have a minister saying that because New South Wales is going to advocate a position it is hijacking the summit. Everyone else who wants to attend the summit is therefore, by assumption, just there to behave in a craven way to the interests of New South Wales. I know that the New South Wales minister for health and, indeed, the Premier of New South Wales are very strong advocates for their state and the interests of the people of their state, but I did not realise they were capable of hijacking the entire national health summit.</para><para>Perhaps, though, what this really shows is the abject failure of leadership this minister is offering to the health industry throughout this country. Essentially, she is saying that unless she gets her own way she will not engage in any discussion with anyone else on any other issue. Unless you sign up to her one offer you cannot discuss any other reform agenda within the health industry. Basically, it is the good old-fashioned `sign or reject' scenario. You cannot debate the future delivery of health care services or debate a more collaborative approach until you fundamentally accept her offer. She will not even have a reasonable debate with the other ministers for health about ways of modifying or changing her offer. Instead, all of a sudden we have the position being put that she is the one who has made the big increase in health funding and no-one else has ever made any.</para><para>I do not know about the other states but in my state of Western Australia the state government delivered a nine per cent increase in health funding in this budget, and in the previous year there was a six per cent increase in health funding. That is a fairly good indication that there are going to be continued real increases in health funding in Western Australia. I accept that a lot of those increases had to recover from the complete sham and debacle under the Court government's delivery of health services so there is a lot of catch-up to take place, but they are significant real increases in health funding. Western Australia, like most other states, publish these great things called forward estimates, where they actually outline their future plans for health expenditure. Apparently, that is just far too hard for the minister for health.</para><para>The minister for health has suddenly discovered the reform agenda that state and territory ministers for health have been trying to get her to talk about for some time. But she only wants to talk about reform on her termsâand that is after you have locked yourself into a funding model and a reform agenda that I do not think is actually going to deal with things like the decline in bulk-billing. My colleague Senator Forshaw referred in question time today to figures that have shown the decline in bulk-billing in rural New South Wales. Those figures also show that people in towns where GPs do not bulk-bill use emergency departments 60 per cent more often than those in towns where doctors do bulk-bill. So unless the government does something about fixing this fundamental problem about the lack of access to bulk-billing services, it is just cost shifting onto the states. It will send all those people to the A and E departments, lock us into a funding model and then perhaps it might talk about reform if we are lucky. Then there is the question of access to GPs throughout Western Australia. The minister, in talking about her reform agenda, does not actually want to go to the heart of how the reform agenda is failing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13766</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am so pleased to be standing here to discuss and debate health with the Labor opposition, in particular to debate Senator Webber's comment at the end of her speech about access to GPs. This is the key: access to adequate health care. There have been a lot of smoke and mirrors and a lot of misleading and deceptive statements in the media by the Labor Party with respect to health. Let us get a few facts on the table and make a few of these things clear. The first is about the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, and her willingness to attend health ministerial meetings. She has attended everyâI repeat, everyâscheduled ministerial health meeting. She does not attend events that are set up for political purposes. That is really the point. She does not particularly support the summit that has been referred to today in question time when she knows she is going to be set up and browbeaten. She does support summits that are debating these important reform issues in the health arena, and she is more than willing to participate in those. She has participated in my state of Tasmania and, I know, throughout Australia in terms of the key stakeholder groups. But she wants the clean air of a post-Australian health care agreement, and not to be browbeaten and used as a political pawn in this whole debate.</para></talk.start><para>Let us focus on this health care agreement and what has been proposed. This is a historic offer, unprecedented in Australian political history: a $42 billion offer that is a $10 million increase on the amount in the previous five years. Those are the facts; they are on the table. If you believed what you read from the Labor Party in the media you would think there are actually funding cuts. What nonsense! What absolutely outrageous misinformation, deception and misleading comments. There is going to be a 17 per cent increase in real terms. We are talking about a 30 to 40 per cent increase.</para><para>In my state of Tasmania we are talking about a $220 million increase on $700 millionâit is going to increase to $920 million over the next five years. What does that mean for Tasmania and Tasmanians? It is no good just having point scoring and political debate unless you look at what the impact is on the people. I will tell you. We have a waiting list for surgery in Tasmania of over 6,000 people. I know what will happen to that waiting list if they take up the offer: it will go down. Two things have to happen. First, they have to sign up to the offer and the agreement. Secondly, the waiting list will go down and waiting times will also go down. But the key issue here is whether Labor are going to hold good and support the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. The question for those on the other side of the chamber is: will they? I seek an interjectionâin fact, I would welcome itâsaying, `Yes, we will support the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' By their silence I suggest that is not the case. That is because their counterparts in the state Labor governmentsâcertainly in Tasmania, in the ACT and, as far as I am aware, in the other statesâhave said, `No, we want to reallocate those funds elsewhere.' That means abolishing the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. That means 44 per cent of the Australian population, and in Tasmania that means 208,000 Tasmanians, will be detrimentally affected and will have to pay an extra $750 per family and lose that 30 per cent rebate. </para><para>It also means that waiting lists in the public hospital system will blow out. People will move out of private health insurance and into the public hospital system. That is going to be very damaging and hurtful. You will see the waiting times blow out and the waiting lists lengthen immeasurably. This will be the impact of Labor policy. We have a great health system in Australia. I am not saying it is perfectâwe can always improveâbut we have a mix of private and public that works well. I call upon the Labor opposition to reconsider their position with respect to the 30 per cent rebate. With respect to getting GPs into rural and regional areas, we have a host of policies to try to make that happen and we seek the support of the Labor opposition. We have the runs on the board in terms of an 11 per cent increase in getting GPs into those areas in the last few years. That has increased under us. It went down under Labor. We have the runs on the board and we have further policies and reforms to make things even better. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>13767</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson this afternoon in the ongoing discussion about what is going on in health in our community. The Minister for Health and Ageing, backed up very strongly by her colleagues, said that she preferred to talk `in the calm air' about the issues to do with health reform. We are now together in the calm air and we have been informed that the minister `does not wish to take part in any organisation, information or meeting that is purely a stunt'âonly a stunt, manipulated by the ALP, about health issues. I would hope that people would agree. But this is certainly not a stunt; we are sharing information about health.</para></talk.start><para>We need to know what actually constitutes a stunt according to the minister. It seems to us that perhaps anything that does not agree with the minister, does not accept the ministerial policy or is not humbly grateful for the government's options is automatically a stunt. Minister Patterson, we do not agree that a stunt is correspondence from current GPs working in remote and regional parts of the community who have been forced over the last six or seven years to seriously reconsider their options for providing health care to their communities and have had to face the decision to stop bulk-billingânot a choice they wanted to make but one that has been forced upon them. That is not a stunt; that is a decision forced upon them by policies of the current government.</para><para>You cannot always say, as the minister frequently does in this place, that every ill to do with the medical system in this country can be immediately traced back to what happened under previous governments. It is too late to use that excuse all the time, particularly as we heard today in answers that we can create a large number of doctors overnightâor perhaps within three months. Hopefully that process can continue.</para><para>It is not a stunt when you listen to people who work in the community such as those we have heard from through the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, in which many senators from all sides of the house are sharing. We hear from community workers who work with families in low-income areas who cannot access doctors. We are not talking about remote areas in this case; we are talking about areas in the immediate suburbs of Wollongong where children affected by outbreaks of scabies cannot attend school. They have been forced through poverty, lack of support in their community and no immediate access to health care to have their schooling reduced because they cannot go back into their community because they are sick. They are sick because they cannot get medical help. Not only can they not get to see a doctor; they cannot get the pharmaceutical help they need to fix their problem. That is not a stunt; that is reality. </para><para>It is not a stunt when we hear about whole communities in rural New South Wales that have had to admit, not proudly, that they have no bulk-billing doctors. As we have heard from Labor senators who know them well, these are areas that used to have bulk-billing doctors. What has happened is that, as I said earlier, doctors have had to review their practices in good faith simply because they have not been able to continue to provide that service to their communityânot in 1991, 1993 or 1994 but now. That is not a stunt.</para><para>We need to understand that there has to be some calm in the process. We need to know that there has to be some trust. Minister Patterson, we agree that, as your current statement says, `We can do it better.' We can do it better, but that does not automatically mean doing it your way and it does not mean imposing penalty clauses when your policies are not accepted by other people who share your concerns about providing effective medical services to the community. We canâwe mustâdo it better, but that demands cooperation. That does not demand direction; it demands cooperation and a willingness to take part in all kinds of meetings, not just those which can be controlled by the participation and the agenda of the government. Minister, that is effective health policy and that makes sure that people across the country can be involved, not just those who share one particular view of the world. That is not a stunt; that is effective policy being implemented. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>13768</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHere we are debating the health issues again and talking about some stunt that was pulled at the weekend. It is interesting. Senator Webber asked a question about this of Senator Patterson and Iâadmittedly in an unparliamentary fashionâinterjected and asked Senator Webber to confirm whether or not she had attended that stunt at the weekend. Her lack of response indicates to me that she did not. If she had attended something she thought was so important as to ask the minister for help about, she would have been the first to accept an interjection and say, `Yes, I did attend.' But clearly Senator Webber did not attend and was prattling on about something she has had no contact with and no information aboutâno nothingâbut saying how wonderful it was. I find that pretty amazing. I cannot talk about a show unless I have seen it, so I go and see it. If Senator Webber thought this was so important, why didn't she go? She then tried to tell everyone else that they should go. That is the squib's way out by saying, `I do not want to goâI do not want to use my weekendâbut you should go.' That is absolutely preposterous.</para></talk.start><para>The minister is saying to the states that we have Medicare agreements for the expenditure of public funds and part of that comes from the Commonwealth government. We have to say that over recent years much of the money that has gone from the Commonwealth to the states has gone into the states' Bermuda Triangle, never to be seen or accounted for again. With this agreement the minister has gone to the states and said, `Because money has disappeared with no apparent accountability in previous agreements, for this agreement I want accountability; I want to see how it's going to be spent.' Under the new agreement the states will have to recommit to the Medicare principles, and specifically the availability of free public hospital treatment for all Australians who seek it, and will have to publicly commit to a specified level of funding for each year of the next agreement. Guess what? They will not do it. Why won't the states simply agree to a set amount of increase per year in public funding? They only have to agree to commit to a new financial and performance reporting framework. If you were dinkum, you would not think that that would be too hard. What is wrong with asking the states to agree to a reporting framework and a financial system that is clear and transparent to all who put in the moneyâthat is, the taxpayers? But, no, the states will not do that. </para><para>So why should Minister Patterson go off to some frolic at the weekend with a bunch of people who may be well intentioned but who are putting the cart before the horse instead of saying, `Let's look at the way in which this can work once the agreements are signed'? Nothing that happened last weekend is going to change the proposal that is on the table at the moment and to which the states have to agree or not agree.</para><para>By not signing and continuing to carry on, the states look set to deprive the hospital system of over $3.6 billion over the next five years. I would say that $3.6 billion amounts to a lot of explaining that they will have to do to their constituents. I will make sure that I do my bit to have it exposed that the states are going to deprive their constituents of $3.6 billion in Commonwealth funding because they want to play politicsâjust because it is all Labor states against a coalition federal government. That is not acting in the best interests of their constituents, but they do not seem to care about that and never have. This is all about trying to get the Commonwealth government because it is not of their political persuasion. That is naive; it is stupid. It is not in the interests of constituents, and the state governments are the ones who will have to account for it. If they do not want to sign up for a 17 per cent increase over five years, that is their business; but they will be held accountable for it. I look forward to the day when they are held accountable and they all lose office.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13769</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take note of answers given today in question time by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, in relation to the crisis in Australia's health system. The federal government's attitude to health has been nothing short of appalling. It has consistently attempted to shift the buck to the states, as we have heard here today, rather than implement reforms that will genuinely improve the deep-seated problems in our health system.</para></talk.start><para>We heard today in question time that, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>, in at least nine towns in New South Wales it is simply not possible to visit a GP who bulk-bills. It is more than likely that the figures in rural and regional parts of the other states would reflect these figures. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> reported that pensioners and general patients must often pay almost twice the Medicare rebate amount to see a doctor. For these people, the decision to visit a doctor is not simply one that relates to their health; it also becomes a financial consideration. These people often have to pay up to $44 for the consultation before they can turn up and see a doctor. This is the situation in which Australia's health system finds itself under this government.</para><para>Labor has committed to strengthening Medicare and bulk-billing, which would take the pressure off the hospital emergency departments. We heard today that it has been shown that, in towns where doctors do not bulk-bill, emergency departments are used 60 per cent more than in towns where bulk-billing is available. The government's proposed changes to Medicare would do nothing to stop this outrageous misallocation of resources that leaves the states with nothing short of a task for Sisyphus. The Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, reported yesterday that some 9,000 people went to emergency rooms in hospitals across New South Wales last year for coughs and colds, some 3,500 for ear infections and some 900 for treatment for ear waxâall of which could, and should, have been treated by general practitioners. </para><para>Senator Patterson has refused to address the correlation between bulk-billing and overflowing emergency rooms. These issues go fundamentally to the quality of health care Australians are able to access. What we need is an approach from the Minister for Health and Ageing that will address the problems of the health care systemâthe 60,000-odd Australians who have dropped out of the government's so-called solution to private health cover which has done nothing to stop overflowing emergency rooms and help towns where bulk-billing has disappeared altogether. The government has its priorities fundamentally wrong. The federal government is effectively blackmailing the states into signing the Australian health care agreement by the end of the month. The actual agreement would mean a cut of the order of $75 million over five years to public hospitals in South Australia and would deny public hospital treatment to some 35,000 South Australiansâmy constituents.</para><para>Senator Patterson is even refusing, as we heard today, to sit down and discuss the stalemate at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting in Canberra, due at the end of this month. In addition, in my state of South Australia Trish Worth, federal member for Adelaide and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, last month had the nerve to send a letter to her constituents asking them to make appeals to the state Premier, Mike Rann, to sign the Australian health care agreement. She also had the nerve to imply that the South Australian Minister for Health, Lea Stevens, would welcome pressure on the South Australian state government to sign the fundamentally flawed Australian health care agreement.</para><para>The minister's parliamentary secretary did not once mention the need for reform of the system nor the minister's continued refusal to meet with the states or her complete lack of interest in attending the Australian health care summit, a gathering over the weekend of some 200 health professionals from across Australia. This was not a stunt; it was a serious meeting of people who are concerned about the crisis in Australia's health system. Senator Patterson's non-attendance at the weekend summit shows her complete lack of concern for the urgent need for reform of Australia's health care system. What better opportunity to show a genuine commitment to sorting out the health systemâa genuine commitment that will simply never be given by the present government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>13770</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing, both to the ALP and to us. I think that in this case the minister is being extraordinarily hypocriticalânot only that, but she may actually be threatened by serious debate about policy. In an attempt to belittle what is a very serious debate at this time, the minister chooses to describe it as naÃ¯ve and politically motivatedâSenator Knowles added to that and called the meeting at the weekend a `frolic'. The reason we have a serious debate going on outside this place is that we do not see a great deal of it from this government. This government seems to think it has all the answers. What does it do? It puts a Medicare package on the table. Who says it is a good solution? Nobody: not a single body, except maybe the private health insurance groups. Not a single other individual or group has stood up and said, `What a great idea. This is a fantastic package; we can buy into it.' When it comes to policy, this government likes to do it by itself and does not like to think that anybody else may be having a discussion about it. </para></talk.start><para>With regard to politicisation, if there is one sector that has politicised this debate, it is this government. Let me go to the media release that was put out by the alliance. The final paragraph says:</para><quote><para>The harsh reality is that while both state and federal governments have expressed their strong support for a reform agenda, so far they have failed to deliver. The conference will be held in time for suggestions made to seriously examine the state premiers when they meet with the Prime Minister for the COAG meeting at the end of August 2003.</para></quote><para>That is the political statement. It says that both the state and the federal governments have failed. If all these people are part of a great conspiracy for the Labor Party then obviously they have their wires crossed when it comes to putting out their press release, because they are not politicisedâthey are not interested in which party says what. What they want are outcomes. That affects all of us one way or the other. Those of us who are ill and need hospital care, those who are frail and aged who need age care and rehabilitation, those who need care in the community because of chronic illness or frailtyâthese are the people who want outcomes; they want policy that is based on sound advice and they are sick to death of the divisiveness and the arguments between both levels of government, for starters.</para><para>What we should be able to expect from the Minister for Health and Ageing is visionâsome pulling together and leadership on how limited resources can best be spent. We want some leadership to facilitate the implementation of health strategies that health providers and policy developers accept as best practice. For Senator Knowles' benefit: I was not able to get to the national health summit yesterday afternoon but I was there last night and I talked with a great number of people. They are extremely worried about the future of health in this country. We need leadership to facilitate the implementation of health strategies that health providers and policy developers can acknowledge as being best practice. What was said yesterday, is being said today and will be said again tomorrow is not likely to be terribly different, in terms of its generality, from papers that have been written over the past 30 years. I would also encourage Senator Knowles to look up those papersâthey are on the web site; she does not need to go to what she describes as a frolic. Over and over we have heard from clinicians and researchers about the ways money is spent inefficiently and against patients' best interests, merely because of administrative fragmentation and responsibility fragmentation.</para><para>The Senate inquiry into public hospital funding is an excellent testament to the ideas that have been generated and discussed for Australia in the recent past. If the Minister for Health and Ageing sponsored the development of options by nine working groups of health policy analysts then why isn't the minister announcing reforms, together with the associated expenditure? Surely, it is indicative of a failure of leadership if the health minister cannot come up with solutions that improve the health outcomes of Australians. Minister, what we need are solutions. If the minister for health at a national level cannot effect change then perhaps it is time to revisit the responsibilities of the federal health portfolio. If it is all too political, then perhaps we need a fixed formulaâan independent body to provide this funding and allow the states, through block funding perhaps, to provide services. We have had enough of the rhetoric of the Commonwealth purchasing services on our behalf, and we need to move on from there. The Democrats have called for an independent arbiter in the health funding round since February this year, and I note that more recently this approach has been endorsed by the Australian Health Reform Alliance. We should proceed down that path to avoid some of this bickering and some of the accusations of politicisation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>13772</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>13772</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate notes that:</para><para>	(a)	16 August to 24 August is National Science Week 2003;</para><para>	(b)	National Science Week is an annual nation-wide celebration of science, innovation and technology with the aim of inspiriting curiosity, discussion and debate about science and its impact in our world;</para><para>	(c)	during National Science Week numerous universities, private companies, museums, galleries and research centres will offer members of the public access to their facilities and staff;</para><para>	(d)	National Science Week events are being held in every state and territory and will look at topics as diverse as the science of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll to that of code breaking machines and burping sheep;

You can correct me if I am wrong, Mr President, and no doubt you will quickly do so, but I think my understanding is correct. I know that Senator Lundy, as well as Senator Humphries and Senator Brown, has an interest in this and there may be a way that it can be worked through to see agreement being reached. Hence, the delay may well only be 24 hours, which is probably acceptable.</para><para>I think the general point made by Senator Humphries has substance and I think the chamber needs to take account of that. But surely, without getting into a long drawn out, knockdown debate about this now, the sensible way would be for Senator Brown to agree to withdraw the notification before the chair and see if it can be worked through to agreement to bring on the debate at the earliest possible opportunity. If it cannot be agreed, obviously we can go to determining the matter substantively tomorrow. That is my suggestion to the chamber through you, Mr President, which I think might be a sensible way of dealing with this. At worst, it is only delaying this matter for final determination tomorrow as opposed to today, but it may be able to be agreed upon amongst senators in the chamber. If it finds favour with the government as well, it seems to be a sensible way through in this circumstance. We are expecting the postponement to come before us tomorrow anyway. Senator Brown's notification has brought forward the matter to today that we were expecting to deal with tomorrow. If that is withdrawn, we can deal with the matter, as I understand it, and there would be the substantive question of dealing with that tomorrow.

In effect, the minister's response has completely ignored that resolution. He is simply saying that responsibility for the issue rests with the states and territories and each jurisdiction of the states and territories has agreed to confirm its position on a ban out of session from the PIMC meeting in April.</para><para>That agreement by the jurisdictions was not met by the state of New South Wales; it did not confirm its position out of session and it did not confirm its position at the 30 June meeting. It is incorrect for the minister to say that this rests with the states and territories. He is a member of the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and he is quite certainly able to work to obtain consensus. He has basically ignored the complete thrust of the Senate resolution, which is urging him to act to generate a consensus rather than to simply say it is a matter for the states and territories and they have not got their act together yet. That is the whole point of having national leadership on an issue. </para><para>It is my concern that the Senate's will and indeed the Senate's call to the minister have been ignored completely in the response that he has provided. It is not the most pressing issue on the planet, I must confess, and it is not even the most pressing animal welfare issue; nonetheless, it is a straightforward issue. It should be straightforward. The Primary Industries Ministerial Council has repeatedly indicated, since last year, that a national position on banning tail docking was imminent. At the April 2003 meeting, it reiterated its commitment to ending tail docking of dogs but, once again, failed to reach consensus. Instead it indicated that it would sort that out on 30 June but, once again, there was no consensus reached.</para><para>It appears quite clear that the New South Wales government, for whatever reason, is dragging its heels on this issue. A number of state and territory governments have gone forwardâthe ACT government has in particular and I congratulate it on doing so. The Queensland government has put in place similar regulations to be automatically enacted in October 2003, so there are some good actions there by those Labor governments. But, unfortunately, the Labor government in New South Wales is continuing to refuse to provide a clear position.</para><para>This is a clear example of why we do need a more clear-cut national approach and oversight of animal welfare issues. If this rather minor animal welfare issue cannot be dealt with effectively by the Primary Industries Ministerial Council, then it highlights once again why we need the ability for a national approach to be put in place. At the moment we have a circumstance where most states will not go forward unless everybody agrees, and that is the case with every state as I understand it. They support the implementation of this ban but they do not want to do it unless every state and territory agrees. New South Wales, unfortunately, is not agreeing for whatever reason. That is not just a poor reflection on New South Wales but a poor reflection on the paucity of the whole approach to animal welfare in Australia where, unless you can get universal agreement, nothing happens.</para><para>This is a very uncontroversial policy, except with a very small number of breeders. It has been advocated for many years by the Australian Veterinary Association and the RSPCA, who are very much on the moderate side of the spectrum in terms of animal welfare organisations, as well as by others who are committed to animal welfare issues. Despite all that and despite the obvious animal welfare benefits involved and the clear support of the Veterinary Association for the removal of this practice, we still have no movement forward. The federal minister has basically washed his hands of it, which again indicates why we need to get a clearer national regime for animal welfare issues. Quite frankly, the risk is there that if New South Wales continues to stall and the federal government refuses to take a position and allows them to stall, then we could have things sliding backwards very quickly and other states would then start backing out. That is something that would very much be a lost opportunity for straightforward, simple, positive change in one area of animal welfare purely because one state government refuses to commit itself and because the federal government will not play any sort of leadership role at all.</para><para>For the minister to say, as he has in his response, that the finalisation of this issue is a priority for the Primary Industries Ministerial Council simply is not borne out by the record. If it had been a priority then they would have sorted this out a long time ago. If it is a priority for the council, as the minister says, he is part of that councilâI think from memory he chairs it, although I may be wrongâand he certainly can ensure that a priority means a priority and that we get resolution. I urge the minister to reflect once again on the content of the Senate resolution and do something to act in accord with it. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13780</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>A message from His Excellency the Governor-General was reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following law:</para><quote><para>Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003</para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13780</page.no><id.no>S394</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>13780</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13780</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13780</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS: PROPOSED DEPARTMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SERVICES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>13780</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13780</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1)	That, in accordance with section 54 of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Service Act 1999, </inline>the Senate resolves that:</para><para>	(a)	the Joint House Department, Department of the Parliamentary Library and Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff are abolished with effect from 31 January 2004; and</para><para>	(b)	a new joint service department, to be called the `Department of Parliamentary Services' be established from 1 February 2004 to fulfil all the functions of the former joint departments;</para><para>		and supports the Presiding Officers in the following endeavours:</para><para>	(c)	to reinforce the independence of the Parliamentary Library by strengthening the current role of the Library committees of both Houses of Parliament;</para><para>	(d)	to bring forward amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Service Act 1999 </inline>to provide for a statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian within the new joint service department and conferring on the Parliamentary Librarian direct reporting responsibilities to the Presiding Officers and to the Library committees of both Houses of Parliament;</para><para>	(e)	to ensure that the resources and services be provided to the Parliamentary Library in the new joint service department be specified in an annual agreement between the Departmental Secretary and the Parliamentary Librarian, approved by the Presiding Officers following consideration by the Library committees of both Houses of Parliament; and</para><para>	(f)	to consider, after the establishment of the joint service department, that department providing human resources and financial transaction-processing activities for all the Parliamentary departments, subject to such an arrangement being proven to be both cost-effective and efficient. </para><para>	(2)	That this resolution be transmitted to the House of Representatives.</para></quote><para>Since 1901 the Australian parliament has had five separate and distinct departmentsâ Senate, House of Representatives, Joint House, Parliamentary Library and Parliamentary Reporting Staff.

Former Prime Minister Fisher was one such advocate of this particular course of action, so the efforts to rationalise the five parliamentary departments in fact date back as far as 1908. My own memory of this, of course, really only goes back directly to the efforts that were made during the lives of the Hawke and Keating governments to reform the structure of the parliamentary departments. I note that at the time the Liberal and National parties were strongly opposed to such a course of action, and they had the support during those debates of the Independents and the minor parties here in the Senate. One of the outcomes of the debate during the time of the previous Labor administration was that any proposal in support of amalgamations needed to come back before the chambers for endorsement, and of course that is why you, Mr President, have put that proposal to the Senate. The Senate, obviously, has to agree with any such amalgamation before it can occur.</para><para>You were right, I think, Mr President, to outline to the Senate the fact that the former President of the Senate, Senator Reid, and the Speaker commissioned Mr Podger, the Parliamentary Services Commissioner, to examine the administration of the parliamentâwith a view to improving the management of security here in Parliament Houseâand also to consider any measures that would make the administration of the parliament and of Parliament House more efficient and more cost effective. It is important to remember that the terms of reference established at the time did not contemplate Mr Podger examining the issue of the merger of parliamentary departments. But, anyway, Mr Podger went ahead and did so. I recall Senator Ray's questioning recently of former President, Senator Reid, before an estimates committee. His questioning made this point absolutely clear. But, of course, this did not inhibit Mr Podger's work at all. Mr Podger did it. He went ahead and examined the issue of departmental amalgamations anyway, and he has made recommendations.</para><para>You, Mr President, mentioned Mr Podger's involvement in this. It is quite unclear to me how much responsibility for this Mr Podger really has. The truth is that he delegated most of the work on this to Mr Len Early, who is well known to many senators because he is a former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration. He in turn shunted most of this work out to PricewaterhouseCoopers. So it was done by Mr Podger in name only; that is all it was. The Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee have, thankfully, been able to keep a weather eye on this issue as it has developed. </para><para>The situation is that you cannot now examine the issue of security around Parliament House and the question of amalgamation of parliamentary departments separately. I want to deal with that matter in some detail. In the most recent budget, $6.8 million was allocated in the current financial year to sustain the new security measures around the building. In the financial years 2004-05 and 2005-06, an extra $6.2 million was allocated, and in the year 2006-07 an extra $6.4 million was to be spent on security measures. But in the out yearsâ2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07âthere is no funding provided by government for security measures. In fact, in those years we are required to find the funds for those security measures here in Parliament House through savings measures. That is the trick here. As a result, the five parliamentary departments must, through savings measures, generate $6.2 million in 2004-05 and 2005-06 and $6.4 million in 2006-07.</para><para>Of course, the Department of Finance and Administration argues that the savings can be found via the Podger report. The government is saying that the only way you can implement the security measures is by implementing the Podger report. That is not tantamount to blackmail; it is blackmail. The parliament is being held over a barrel on the issue of the safety and security of all those who work in this building. This is not a situation that applies to other agencies and departments in government. Evidence given to our estimate committees confirms that no other department or agency has had to find savings to fund enhanced security measures. Over the four-year period, an extra $374.7 million has been allocated for new security measures and Budget Paper No. 2 directly links parliamentary security funding to savings measures.</para><para>This is the situation we faceâfind these savings. The only mechanism that has been established is the implementation of the Podger report or literally the core functions of all the parliamentary departments will be attacked. The only way of making up these shortfalls would be to attack core functions of the parliamentary departments. That is the situation the Senate and the parliament face in relation to these particular matters. The Senate Staffing and Appropriations Committee has been unconvinced that the level of savings claimed or indicated in the Podger report is achievable. Even if the $5 million can be harvested it will still leave the parliamentary departments with another $1.2 million to be found in savings in the next out year. Hence the sensible amendment that stands in my name:</para><motion><para>That any savings achieved by the amalgamation may be used to offset increases in costs of security measures approved by the Presiding Officers for Parliament House, but if those increases in costs exceed those savings, the appropriations for the parliamentary departments are to be supplemented for the excess.</para></motion><para>I note that the government accepted that amendment in the House of Representatives.</para><para>The plan under the Podger report is that the number of parliamentary departments will go from five to three. You will have one large joint parliamentary department comprising the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. That will be combined into a joint parliamentary services department. The two chamber departments will remain in something like their current form. </para><para>I am amazed that the Liberal Party and the National Party have so diametrically changed their view in relation to the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments. Whatever else you can say about the opposition on this issue, we have been consistent in our approach. We have been consistent in relation to the need for parliamentary departments since 1908, whether you agree with us or not. This did not happen right through the period of the Hawke and Keating governments most recently because the Liberal Party and the National Party would not have a bar of it. Now that the Liberal Party and the National Party find themselves in government you can bet your life no-one will stand up in the chamber and take the same view that they so trenchantly argued forâthis position of principleâin this debate. You can bet your life that they will fold like a deck of cards. I think that the hypocrisy of this position as far as the coalition is concerned is extraordinary. </para><para>We in the Labor Party have been the only political grouping in this parliament to actively support the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments but we are not willing to see the parliamentary departments strangled by an approach that is nothing other than blackmail. That is the approach in the budget. That is the approach that has been effectively put to the Presiding Officers by the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet. The President gives reports to estimates committees and to the Senate Staffing and Appropriations Committee on how the Presiding Officers have gone at the ERC, but I must say that I do not think they have demonstrated a huge amount of power in the processes of government. It seems to me that they have not been successful in holding the line. </para><para>Mind you, I do not think anyone would have expected that a different approach would be applied to the parliamentary departments than is applied to any other department or agency across the breadth of government in relation to forcing the parliamentary departments to fund security measures through offset savings within the parliamentary departments themselves. I would have a different attitude to this if other departments and agencies faced the same sorts of challenges, but it is only the parliamentary departments that have had to face that challenge. I say respectfully to you, Mr President, and the Speaker that your trip to the ERC was a highly unsuccessful one and we are now debating the consequences of that lack of success in the chamber.</para><para>If the amalgamation does not occur, you and Mr Speaker will be required to develop alternative savings measures to the tune of $1.2 million on the part of each of the five parliamentary departments. The consequences of that I do not think are yet well understood around parliament. Certainly, on information that has been made available to us, the consequences are far reaching. The parliament has been unable to stand up to the Department of Finance and Administration, unable to stand up to the ERC and unable to stand up to executive government and that is why the amendment has been moved by the opposition to try to ensure that if the increases in costs for security exceed the savings of amalgamation, the appropriations of the parliamentary departments, of which there will be three, I expect, are supplemented for the excess.</para><para>Governments have to face up to the fact that the parliamentary departments do not have the capacity to find savings on a major scale. Of course, we know from the information provided to us by the Clerk of the Senate what the impact would be in relation to cuts in that department. I am pleased that efforts have been madeâand I think they are genuine efforts that have been madeâto protect the independence of the Parliamentary Library. That is important and absolutely essential. I am pleased that something that is long overdue will occurâthe appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian. It seems to me to be one of the very few positive things that might well come forward from this proposal, although we will make an assessment, I suppose, of what all the consequences and knock-on effects of the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments might be. But there will be a statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian, reporting to the Presiding Officers and the library committees of the parliament, and that is in my view one important and positive development from what has been a very unfortunate situation. </para><para>The problem that we face in relation to this matter is that this debate, as it is held in this chamber, leaves the parliament with no choice. That is the difficulty with this situation as it has evolved. It is very difficult to deal in a debate like this with amalgamation of parliamentary departments on the merits of the proposal. Really, we are not debating the merits of the proposal. Really, we have no choice but to agree with the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments. It is just a case of political blackmail from the government. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âThe consequences of not agreeing with this proposition, Senator Brown, whether you like it or not, are too awful to contemplate. Finding that level of savings across the parliamentary departments would mean that the way this place has operated in the past could not be contemplated into the future. I do not think that is a responsible course of action for the Senate or the House of Representatives to take. I do think that a strong case can be mounted in relation to the amalgamation of parliamentary departments but not with the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of those who sit in both chambers. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is possible that this will develop over time into a positive reform for the parliament. Time will tell. I can assure the Senate that, as far as the opposition is concerned, we will be closely monitoring the amalgamation. We will be using all the accountability mechanisms that are available to us to ensure that this matter proceeds in an orderly way. I note the commitments that have been given in relation to the question of involuntary redundancies. I do not think there is a need for the Senate to express a view on this matter. I can assure the Senate that the Speaker has told the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, that there will be no involuntary redundancies. I, for one, am willing to take the Presiding Officers at their word. I think that is the appropriate way for us to proceed, as opposed to providing an expression of opinion on the matter in this chamber.

The proposal that you have put before us, Mr President, is one that will not proceed without a partisan and rancorous debate, but credit should be given to people who have been proposing and refining this reform for generations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It was Alfred Deakin who suggested, only two years after the formation of the national parliament, that there must be a more efficient way of running the national parliament. Professor Gordon Reid, in his book <inline font-style="italic">Australia's Commonwealth Parliament</inline>, which was published in 1988 for the Bicentenary, related the Rt Hon. Andrew Fisher's approach, taken in June 1910. Andrew Fisher suggested at that time that there should be a single parliamentary department, but this was not proceeded with. In 1933 Mr Pinner, who later became the Commissioner of the Public Service Board, examined the organisation and the working of the departments of parliament. He did so at the request of the Presiding Officers. He made a report that also suggested the adoption of a single department with a single clerk of the parliament who would be ultimately responsible to the President and the Speaker. </para><para>That was again suggested by the 1953 Public Service Commission report and by the National Commission of Audit in 1996. So it is not a new idea; it is one that has been pushed by Public Service reformers and politicians decade after decade after decade. So the proposal that is now before us is indeed a credit to those who have worked on it and to you, Mr President, for bringing it before the Senate today. In the other place in 1977, former Speaker Gordon Scholes suggested that the three joint departments should be merged into one. In 1980 former Senate President Sir Condor Laucke and the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, also initiated reviews of each of the five departments and said that there was significant scope for efficiencies. </para><para>So this is an area where parliamentarians from both political parties have agreed on the need for reform. And I think it is fair to say in light of today's debate that they did so without any rancour and without trying to score cheap political points. Over the generations they all agreed that there are efficiencies that can be made. Only recently, the last speaker of the House who was a Labor Party member, Speaker Martin, introduced a bill. In the explanatory memorandum to the billâ which you have probably reread recently, Mr Presidentâhe identified savings of about $1Â½ million per year. So not only has the government, through the Expenditure Review Committee, said to parliament that it would be helpful to make some savings, but also a very recent Labor Party Speaker identified potential savings. </para><para>I do not think anybody here would say that the parliament should be exempt from running its affairs efficiently and trying to find savings where possible. The people of Australia read articles in newspapers and hear stories on the television and the radio on a very regular basis about waste by parliamentarians and parliament. I think many of those stories are unfair. They are usually a way for journalists and newspaper proprietors to fill in a bit of space between the advertisements they sell and to denigrate, in their own wayâand not a particularly intellectually sound wayâthe workings of the parliament and parliamentarians. </para><para>I do not think, if you look at all government expenditure at a time when you are trying to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent efficiently, that any areas of government expenditure should be exempt. I think it is quite brutally unfair to seek to score political points against the government on this particular issueâon this particular motion of yours, Mr Presidentâbecause it detracts from the importance of the reform `on its merits', to use Senator Faulkner's words. For the record, we will not oppose the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner; in fact we will vote for it. </para><para>I now turn to the substance of the reform. It is fair to say that many of the previous proposals for the amalgamation of departments have failed for a range of reasons, but one of them that seems to go through all the literature and discussion on this issue through the last century is the independence of the Senate and, particularly, the Parliamentary Library. Some of the outstanding achievements encapsulated within the proposal before the parliament today are that it safeguards the independence of the library and, as Senator Faulkner has referred to, it establishes the position of Parliamentary Librarian. And I believe your proposal, Mr President, is to make that position a statutory one.</para><para>The 1999 reforms to the Public Service, when the Australian Parliamentary Service was established, separated officers working for parliamentary departments from the general Public Service. It was a major reform, one which received bipartisan support at the time, and was something which was long overdue. Indeed, the special role and independence of staff of the parliament was one of the drivers of Andrew Fisher's approach way back in 1910. I do not intend to go into serious rebuttal of the points made by Senator Faulkner about the ERC and the process. I do not think it adds to the quality of the debate on this particular measure. The Senate can determine exactly what it wants to do in relation to the proposal. If Senator Faulkner or anyone voting for this believe that they are being blackmailed, that is a reflection on them and not a reflection on the government or anybody else in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>13787</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis proposal does have a long history. Poor old Senator Campbell does not want to rebut any of the points that Senator Faulkner has made because he is incapable of doing so. This proposal has been around for a long whileâHoudini had the first powered flight in Australia in the same year that Andrew Fisher decided to move on this. This proposal was around at the same time that the great American fleet first visited Australia. Indeed, Carlton Football Club was a football power way back then. That is how long ago it was, Mr President. </para></talk.start><para>Over the years there have been five serious attempts to amalgamate the parliamentary departments. A major step forward was when the executive government in 1987 decided to amalgamate 29 departments into 18â17 portfolio departments plus the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The argument came up that, if government was willing to take all the risks necessary to amalgamate what was an ever growing list of government departments back into 18, why should not the parliament do so? It was frustrated on every occasion, not by a lack of will from the Presiding Officers, not by a lack of encouragement from government, but by an intransigent opposition aided and abetted by the minor parties. That is why it is before us today and was not solved 10 or 15 years ago.</para><para>We cannot divorce this issue from security at Parliament House. Not only are the two things intertwined in the argument; they are intertwined in the budget papers. The Presiding Officers, the President and the Speaker, have had to take courageous and drastic action to tighten security in this building. Some of my colleagues come to me and say: `We're not that happy with these new, enhanced measures. We don't worry so much about our own security.' I tell them: `Frankly, neither do I.' I do not care whether they get shot or not, but there are 3,500 people working in this building and half a million to a million visitors. That is where our responsibility lies. That is where the President's responsibility lies and he has taken up the challenge. Maybe not everything that has been done has been aesthetically pleasing, but it is absolutely necessary. Parliament House is a national icon. It is a natural target, and we must have tough security measures based on the best advice. The best advice has been sought and obtained and proper action has been taken by the Presiding Officers. </para><para>The great exception here is that when it comes to the security of Parliament House those savings measures have to be found by the parliamentary departments. It is okay to get $500 million and trundle it into Attorney-General's and Foreign Affairs. They get given all the money for their enhanced security. The Presiding Officers and the parliamentary departments do not; it is deducted from the other end. They are told: `You've got to make the savings if you want to put in security.' Why the inconsistent approach from government? The government spokesman here today has nothing to say on it. He probably says it is a political point. We get no explanation as to why the parliamentary departments are being treated separately. Maybe they are not in a position to defend themselves, as other government departments are directly represented in cabinet.</para><para>When I asked a question at the estimates committee, the Department of Finance and Administration could not point to savings in the budget papers, so they took it on notice. I asked: what savings measures, other than for the parliamentary departments, have been made to fund these security matters? What did this duplicitous department answer? They said, `Savings and offsets'. I got a deliberately distorted answer to my questionâ Mr President, you might recall watching the evidenceâthat included `a revenue measure'. I was asking about savings, not about offsets. They can now quote that answer and say I am wrong and that other departments have had to make a contribution. You wonder why at times we get a little hostile and cynical about answers from public servants. The reason is that we get this distorted backsliding when provided with answers. We should have had an accurate answer to the particular question that I asked. All we got was an inaccurate one. That is evasion.</para><para>Senator Campbell does not like the term `blackmail'. The two issues are linked. Security and the amalgamation of departments is the way it has been put. We have three choices. Firstly, we could not implement the security measures and not amalgamate the departments. That is not a choice we could make. Secondly, we could not agree to the amalgamation and we could find another $6.4 million to $6.8 million in savings per annum. Thirdly, we could agree with the long-held aspiration of the Department of Finance and Administration and amalgamate the departments and possibly make sufficient savings to fund security. Those are the choices we have. We have one other choice: next year when the parliamentary supply bills come before us we can take the appropriate action there. But do any of us want to get involved in that sort of argy-bargy around the end of June when we are trying to negotiate all the appropriation bills and trying to get a proper appropriation for this parliament? I doubt it.</para><para>The consequences of non-amalgamation are that nominally each department will have to cough up $1.2 million a year. You might argue that there is a slight capacity in the current Joint House Department to do so, but there is no capacity in the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives, and least of all in the Department of the Parliamentary Library, to find those savings. We know it. For the last 15 years, parliamentary departments, quite appropriately, have had to pay an efficiency dividend. Every hollow log around has been emptied out. In addition to that, salary rises now also have to be driven by efficiencies. So there are three pressure points on parliamentary appropriations. Whilst we might be able to survive with two of themâthat is, the efficiency dividend and funding salary risesâit is not possible to survive with the three of them, without major and drastic cuts. A cut of $1.2 million per year to the library must eventually affect their collection. That does not worry governments too much; parliamentary libraries are really for minor parties and oppositions. But what they should think about is that sooner or later they will be in opposition and they will require a parliamentary library to assist them. Maybe they will not be around, but their successors will be. Maybe people in the coalition do not think too much about their successors. </para><para>I will move on to the Podger report. As Senator Faulkner indicated, it was a bit like a cleaning contract. First of all, it was sublet to Mr Len Early and then he sublet it to PricewaterhouseCoopers. It went three rungs down before any real work was done, and I think it has that weakness. We asked the Department of Finance and Administration whether they looked at the financial consultants' report. They had never read it. It had never been referred to them. They had only read the Podger report; they had not read any of the underlying analysis provided by the financial consultants. Having looked at all the figures, I would have to say the Podger report is a tad rubbery. One document that they provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Staffing and Appropriations comes up with $5.165 million in savings. When I read down that list, I am not convinced. I want to be, but I am not convinced that it will necessarily deliver the level of savings that the Podger report claims and the Department of Finance and Administration gullibly accepts it will without any proper analysis.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âAs they did with IT.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âAs they did with the cluster of IT. You could go on and on. Here is a department that enforces financial probity and had $8 million embezzled straight out the back door just a few years ago, Senator Murray. You would recall that. We also have on the record Senator Reid's assurance that the Podger inquiry would not even look at the question of amalgamations. They were answers given to me so that we were all reassured on that particular point, but in fact they went ahead and did it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The one pleasing feature of Podger, clearly, is the attitude to the library. Four major recommendations are contained therein:</para><quote><para>The position of Parliamentary Librarian be established at a senior level within the amalgamated service provision department.</para></quote><para>That is welcome. It is also recommended that:</para><quote><para>The independence of the Parliamentary Library be granted by Charter from the Presiding Officers.</para></quote><para>That is welcome.</para><quote><para>The independence of the Parliamentary Library be reinforced by strengthening the current terms of reference for the joint Library Committee.</para></quote><para>That is another step forward. And, finally:</para><quote><para>The resources and services to be provided to the Library in the amalgamated department be specified in an annual agreement between the Departmental Secretary and the Parliamentary Librarian, approved by the Presiding Officers following consideration by the joint Library Committee.</para></quote><para>All those are major advances and they are welcomed. If you have a look at the amendment that Senator Faulkner has moved, and which I strongly support, you see that it really does get to the guts of the issue. We know that the current savings projected out of Podger are not enough to fund the cuts occasioned by the supplemented funds for security. We are saying that, firstly, the government has to supplement those in any event and, secondly, if the Podger savings do not meet the assumed level, government really should supplement the parliamentary departments for those security measures. People may say, `Why is this motion before us today?' The reason the motion is before us today is that former Senator Georges, back in the mid-eighties, moved a motion saying that both houses had to approve any amalgamation proposal. Given the fact that every government member here today supports itâ eight or 10 of themâyou would wonder how that motion ever got through. The reason it got through was that it got strong supportâ genuine supportâfrom the minority parties. Senator Harradine was one of those at the time, I recall. They beat us; we copped it sweet, I think. </para><para>But the Liberal and National parties voted for that motion. You would not know about it today, because if we point it out they say that we are political point scoring. When we point out their double standards and hypocrisy, apparently, that is political point scoring. But it does have some relevance. We have seen it time and time again on issues: the Liberal and National parties stand up on an issue of principle when they are in opposition, and it means nothing at all to them when they are in government. Let me give a few examples of that. When in opposition they insisted that a 30-day rule for answering of questions on notice be imposed on the then Labor government and the executive government. What happened when they came into government? Do they observe the 30-day rule? Of course they do not! I had a series of questions that went unanswered for over 1,000 days. Then, because the parliament was prorogued, they were never answered. I had others that went for 200, 300 and 400 days without an answer. The government voted for a 30-day rule and yet do not abide by it.</para><para>For years we listened to their hand-wringing speeches on returns to order, yet we have a whole series of returns to order not fulfilled in this chamber. What was good for them in opposition is not good for them in government. These rules do not apply to Liberals; they are just meant to be imposed on others. Thirdly, let us look at the question of cut-off motions. They imposed them on the previous government. They have made over 400 requests to be absolved from the cut-off motion on legislation since they have been in government. It was good enough for a Labor government to have cut-off motions, yet the Liberals have put up their hands 400 times to be absolved from them. Take the question of committees looking at legislation. They are always whingeing about having bills referred to legislation committees. Who set them up? Who imposed them on the chamber? It was the Liberal and National parties that did these things.</para><para>Finally, the ultimate thing is, of course, Senate power. If you go back and look at the speeches of the current Prime Minister and others when they were in opposition, you see that they lauded the Senate. They praised the Senate for its representativeness. They praised the Senate for being the bulwark against the executive government. What happens today? They condemn the Senate as an obstructionist institution. They are constantly campaigning to try to denigrate the Senate because it does not pass all their legislation. Indeed, they try to rort the electoral systemâwhenever they get a chance to propose itâto try to change the representation in this chamber. I must say, for the record, that I welcome the slight change in their attitude: the coalition are now looking where they always should have looked, and that is at Senate power rather than Senate representation. </para><para>So what does all this add up to? It just means that this particular motion will almost certainly go through this chamber today and leave you, Mr President, with a lot of responsibility in implementing it. I wish you well in that. I know how well-intentioned you are in all these matters and that you will try to handle this with great delicacy. But, when Senator Campbell comes in here and says that we are just political point scoring, we do have a duty to point out the double standards of the Liberal Partyâthe hypocrisy of the Liberal Partyâin constantly frustrating amalgamation moves when they were in opposition and so readily embracing them the moment they got a chance in government.</para><para>Where are the backbench objectors that we saw 15 and 10 years ago? Suddenly they have become the lickspittle of executive government. Yesterday's heroes have just become craven toadies today. Eight or 10 of them voted against this way back in 1987 or 1993 and are still here; where are they? They have done the chicken run: shot back to their offices, saying that they have constituents to attend to or something else. The last thing they want to come and do is justify their previous intransigence in this chamber, which would expose their double standards and hypocrisy in opposing these measures in the past. Time and time again, not just on this issue but also on a whole range of issues to do with this chamber, we have seen a 180-degree turnaround. I am proud to say that that has not occurred on this side of the chamber. We supported amalgamations from 1908 right through to 1993, and I am proud of the fact that we are going to do it again today.</para><para>Let me finally say, in terms of the amendment which is to be proposed by Senator Brown, that I do not support it, though of course I support the sentiments. The two Presiding Officers have given us a commitment, and I want them to keep it. I do not want them to have to say that they kept it because they were directed to by this chamber. I should correct myself: when I say two, I mean that at least one Presiding Officerâthe Speakerâhas given an assurance that there will be no involuntary redundancies. As I am entitled to, I want to take the Speaker at his word, and I am sure he will deliver on it. I am concerned that, if the amendment which is to be proposed by Senator Brown is carried, it will be used as an excuse by the Department of Finance and Administration to say, `You didn't try to generate all the savings measures; therefore, we are not going to supplement the budget of the parliament.' I do not want to give them that particular excuse. We should note that, if the Speaker's assurance is given to us, people will not be forced to lose their jobs. You cannot say that of all other government departments, so that is reassuring.</para><para>In conclusion, this motion is long overdue. It would have been implemented back in 1987 and 1988 if the Liberal and National parties had had any integrity at all. If they had not been such sleazy opportunists, had not opposed for opposition's sake or had not been involved in such hypocrisy and double standards you would not have had the task today, Mr President, of implementing all thisâit would have long been buried. But at least, after today, you can get on with the job and continue to protect this parliament through the good job you have been doing in terms of all the security arrangements, which we all admire you for. You can be assured that in the next estimates round and on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing we will continue to scrutinise your activitiesânot pursue youâand get a measure back. </para><para>I want to finish on one last point. A colleague of mine, Mr Roger Price, has been both agitating and giving notice for the House of Representatives to have a staffing and appropriations committee. It is not my job to interfere in their business, but I think it is long overdue. In the end, whilst it might be inconvenient for the President to have an appropriations and staffing committee, it is a good safety valve. It is a good fall-back position for trying to gauge the reaction of a wide range of senators. If they did the same thing in the House of Representatives, there would then be some level of scrutiny. As it currently stands, it is the only government department not to be scrutinised at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13792</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI and the Greens oppose this motionâmuch as we would like to support you, Mr Presidentâbecause we think it is wrong. The argument that is being put forward, firstly, by the government, comes down to it being, in Senator Ian Campbell's words, a `credit' to those who have worked on the proposal. The problem is that the work on the proposal was not done. If you were to use this proposal as an example of the financial thoroughness and excellence of the government then it would lose its ratings right across the board.</para></talk.start><para>As has been said earlier in this debate, the report by Mr Podger was commissioned last year. The report did not stipulate that there was to be an investigation into the cost savings of the amalgamation of the three joint departments. That became an add-on at the time of the transition of Presidents, with the outgoing President, Senator Margaret Reid, your predecessor, having said that she thought it would actually lead to a cost increase if the departments were to be amalgamated. I would trust her assessmentâshe having been in your job, Mr Presidentâ more than I would the arithmetic that has been presented to give us the contrary point of view through the Podger report. There was an extension of a week or so and in that short time, by some sort of mysterious signal, the investigation went on to look at the efficiency to be gained by amalgamating the three departments, not the matters that had been canvassed, which were to do with efficiency in the three departments. Out of that, we got these figures of some 35 staff and perhaps $5 million to $10 million in the long term but not the corroboration that is required to back up those figures, simply because it is not there.</para><para>There is no breakdown of the 35 staff positions that would goâthey are not stated. There is no recognition that many of these positions have multiple functions: some of them will be retained under the proposed amalgamation; some of them will be lost. How that is going to be rationalised or sorted out is not stated here, and the assessment of $5 million to $10 million is simply pulled out of the air. It is not backed up with the sort of financial rigour you would expect if there were to be a consultant to stand by those figures down the line. When you cannot stand by the figures, you say that, instead of there being that sort of cost saving, it will be in the longer term. What about the shorter term? There is no figure given here at all. There is the real potential for the costs to grow. I think one of the Democrat senators mentioned earlier the cost blow-outs from the Department of Finance and Administration's much touted savings that we were going to get through rationalisation of IT services. It did not happen.</para><para>The best you can do to hedge against that, Mr President, is to get a very thoroughgoing cost-benefit analysis before you move into making the sort of move that is flagged in your motion, but that has not been done. The opposition has quite clearly got an ideological commitment, going way back, to an efficiency they see could be gained through the amalgamation of these departments. As Senator Robert Ray and Senator Faulkner have said, the government had an opposite ideological commitment. I can tell you what has happened here: there has been an ideological commitment which has overrun all that. It is called market fundamentalism: rationalise wherever you can in parliamentary and government services to the people and, in this case, do it blindly, without the proper analysis that you would expect of a parliament and that a parliament, government and opposition would insist on. None of them are going to insist on that today.  </para><para>This motion is going to go through for ideological reasons which do not stand up. If that is going to be the case, let us have those reasons put forward. Let us not have the spurious argument that there are going to be cost savings, when they have not been demonstrated. Mr President, I would be very pleased to hear you explain to the chamber where the cost savings have been demonstrated in this process. I will not make that a challenge, because I do not want to make things difficult for you. Where are the guaranteed savings coming out of this? They are simply not there. There are losses involved in it, and they concern the Greens.</para><para>The Greens are going to oppose the motion because this move has not been legitimised and does not warrant the changes that are going to occur in this parliament as a consequence. Senator Faulkner has moved:</para><motion><para>That any savings achieved by the amalgamation may be used to offset increases in costs of security measures approved by the Presiding Officers for Parliament House, but if those increases in costs exceed those savings, the appropriations for the parliamentary departments are to be supplemented for the excess.</para></motion><para>How extraordinary to move an amendment like that but say in the same breath that the whole economic argument, as I heard it, is that it would be unconscionable to leave these departmentsâand there are five involved nowâto find $1.2 million each to meet security needs because those savings cannot be found. This squeeze is being put on by the government, and the opposition has to go along with it. But it says in the amendment that the government should supplement the appropriations if there is a shortfall. I move an amendment to Senator Faulkner's amendment:</para><para>Omit âThat any savings achieved by the amalgamation may be usedâ.</para><para>Omit â, but if those increases in costs exceed those savings,â.</para><para>Omit âfor the excessâ.</para><para>My amendment would have Senator Faulkner's Labor Party amendment reading:</para><quote><para>To offset increases in costs of security measures approved by the Presiding Officers for Parliament House the appropriations for the parliamentary departments are to be supplemented.</para></quote><para>Let us have the government come up with the money. Why go halfway like the opposition want to? The principle is exactly the same. Let us take this squeeze off the parliamentary departments. Senator Faulkner argued very cogently that nowhere else is this being done. The government is putting out new expenditure for security elsewhere but when it comes to this parliamentâthis icon, as Senator Robert Ray so aptly described itâand the great services that are being provided to the nation, not least to us as elected representatives, the parliamentary departments are being squeezed to find the extra money. No, the government has to find that money. That is what we should be insisting on as a baseline.</para><para>If this amalgamation is going to go throughâand the government wants itâI would have thought the opposition would make sure that that squeeze was taken off the five departments in this place. They are halfway there to doing it, and my amendment to Senator Faulkner's amendment will in effect go the whole hog to ensure that we do not squeeze the 3,500 departmental employees in this place that Senator Ray referred toâand I am not sure where those figures come fromâwho do such a magnificent job for the parliament. I foreshadow that I will move on behalf of the Australian Greens: </para><para>After paragraph (1), insert:</para><para>â(1 B)	That any redundancies arising from the amalgamation must be of a voluntary nature and that no staff will be forced to take involuntary redundancies as a result of the amalgamation.â</para><para>Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner both said that the opposition are going to oppose that amendment. They will leave it to the grace, to the word, of the Presiding Officers. I like to see these things formalised. Parliament House can be a very stressful working place for very good staff and employees. An amendment such as that will take a stress burden off a lot of people who are going to go to bed tonight wondering if and how long their jobs are going to last and what sort of pressure is going to be brought upon them to leave voluntarily or otherwise. I recommend both those amendments.</para><para>Finally, there have been recommendations put forward by the Clerk to the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. I simply want to end by reading those out. I think they should go into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I think this is what we should be supporting. The response from the Clerk states:</para><quote><para>This response to the report therefore recommends that no decisions be taken until cost/benefit analyses are undertaken of proposals in the following order, with the successive stages being considered only if the outcome of the previous stages indicate that there is justification for doing so:</para></quote><para>Â·	adoption by the departments of common financial management and human resource management systems</para><para>Â·	transfer of corporate management functions of the joint departments to one of them or to a shared services bureau</para><para>Â·	outsourcing of the processing functions of the corporate management sections of the two House departments, either to an outside provider or to one of the joint departmentsâ</para><para>and if all that were to workâ</para><para>Â·	amalgamation of all the joint departments.</para><para>The Clerk goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Without such analyses, in that order, the Presiding Officers run all the risks of embarking on an expensive and disruptive reorganisation exercise with no way of knowing whether real savings will result. When recommended by management consultants, such exercises invariably result in the consultants and the persons who have carried them out declaring them to be a great success with massive savings, but with no real evidence of any such savings, and with new problems which then have to be disentangled at further cost, while the consultants move on to their next reorganisation project.</para></quote><para>Clearly, there are grave concerns that this proposal is not going to have the outcomes that you envisage, Mr Presidentâthat there are not going to be cost savings. Implicit in what I would submit to you and to the Senate is that enormous pressure is being brought on staff in this parliament, which of course are going to be self-interested to some degree but which I believe primarily know how this parliament works and how it does not, and which must be astonished that such a proposal as this could go forward without any proper financial analysis. We should at least begin by going back and requiring that a cost-benefit analysis of this far-reaching proposal be done before proceeding with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>13795</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to indicate the Democrats' strong opposition to this motion. I have listened with great interest to Senator Faulkner's and Senator Ray's contributions to the debate and I think that what you say to blackmailers is, simply, `No.' If you give in to them, you give in to poor processes, you give in to lack of analysisâwhether it be cost-benefit analysis or any other sort of cost analysis at all, in this approachâand you give in to very poor practices indeed. You give in to a proposal which has absolutely no arguments for it. Senator Ray said in a debate, I think it was last year, that he is an amalgamationistâas if that is some sort of belief that you cannot step outside.  </para></talk.start><para>There is absolutely no evidence to support this motion. It has arisen from recommendations in a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing in June that the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff be abolished and replaced by a new joint service department to be called the Department of Parliamentary Services. The Appropriations and Staffing Committee, of which I am a member, made this recommendation without binding any committee member to supporting the proposal, to allow the Senate to decide this matter as a whole. The recommendations come about after an unhappyâI would sayâconjunction of events: a review, by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Andrew Podger, of aspects of the parliamentary administration and the emergence of a need to finance enhanced security measures at Parliament House.</para><para>The proposal, to make one service provision department by combining these three departments, was floated in 1996 and legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives by the ALP government of the time but never brought on for debate. There have been about 10 proposals altogether since Federation and, as Senator Faulkner points out, the first of those was in 1908, but most of the proposals to amalgamate all or some of the five parliamentary departments have come after 1977. Until today, I am sad to say, none of them have been successful, and for very good reasons.</para><para>The genesis of this current proposal comes out of the Podger report, as I said, which was commissioned by the Presiding Officers in April 2002 and presented to them in September of the same year. The review originally was to look at the sharing of corporate management and purchasing functions. Then it became pretty obvious that this was not going to produce much by way of efficienciesâwhich, in the case of purchasing, was already being done and being done very successfullyâand Mr Podger used his last term of reference to look at such other matters which may arise during the review. And, lo and behold, the `such other matter' became the old favourite: the proposal to amalgamate the three so-called service departments. That was not authorised by the outgoing or the incoming President. As Mr Evans points out, the Senate President in May 2002 gave assurances that the review had nothing to do with the amalgamation of departments which, in her view, would involve greater costs.</para><para>The Podger report had little in it that would enable any sort of informed decision as to the benefits or not of such amalgamations. The consultants who did this work consulted, supposedly, with staff in this place, but the report from that consultation suggests that they were very uninterested in the information that staff were bringing to them and that they clearly did not agree with any ideas that were brought forward or any information or opinions that did not agree with the preconceptions that those consultants had. The cost efficiencies were claimed at between $5 million and $10 million a year once they were fully implemented, which equates to roughly from 4.7 per cent up to 9.3 per cent of the current combined department budgets. The Appropriations and Staffing Committee asked for more detailed cost analysis and that produced a further briefing from Mr Podger in March this year. That cost saving was narrowed down to an annual cost saving of between $4.9 million and $5.2 million but still it was unclear as to where this saving was going to be made, and a lot of reference was made to staff and to the middle management group of officers in this place. </para><para>So it is our conclusion that the review was very unsatisfactory. In fact, I think it has to be said that the vast majority of members of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee thought this way and expressed that on numerous occasions during our meetings. That is another reason why I am disappointed that the ALP feels they can support this when, in that environment, so much was expressed by way of concerns about this proposal.</para><para>As has been said already by other senators, the process was dodgy. It was conducted as a subcontract to a private management consultant who, in turn, subcontracted it to PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby wasting $170,000 on a consultancy to tell us what we already knew and what were, effectively, back of the envelope figures in the first place. It was properly criticised as being a flawed, superficial consultation and badly argued analysis of the benefits and an inadequate analysis of the costs. The answer to those criticisms was, `We won't really know if the savings are achievable until we do the amalgamation.' In other words, suck it and see. But, of course, once you have done that, once you have lost staffâwhether you have sacked them or whether they have departed voluntarilyâit is very difficult to turn that around and undo the work that has been done.</para><para>The Clerk of the Senate provided the committee with a list of the kinds of costs that he argued had not been properly taken into account: redundancy payments for the staff who are shed; the need to keep staff longer than would otherwise be the case because of their knowledge of the separate departments; the new position of secretary of the enlarged department and support staff, presuming that the new secretary would be at a higher level than the current departmental secretaries because of their greater responsibility and management of an enlarged department; the proposed new position of the Parliamentary Librarian, which of course we support, but that should be done without these changes; the costs of the implementation of the amalgamation over many areas from new stationery to remaking certified agreements and the costs of inefficiencies arising from the distinct functions of the departmentsâfor example, the need for different treatment of building maintenance staff and research staff in the provision of human resource management services. I think it is fair to say that the committee was not persuaded that even the second round of cost estimates took that into account.</para><para>With regard to funding the enhanced security, the Democrats did agree that there was a need for better security for Parliament House, although I must say we do not agree with the current white plastic barriers that are around this place. We think they are neither suitable nor adequate to do the job and, as I have indicated before in the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, I think there were many more aesthetically suitable arrangements that could have been made, but I will not dwell on that matter. What is worse is that the Minister for Finance and Administration announced that the extra security for the financial year 2003-04 would be funded separately but that funding for security for the three financial years after that would have to come from the parliamentary department's operating budget. The minister made it quite clear that the savings are to be achieved either by implementing the Podger proposals or by any other means. The cuts demanded are $6.1 million in 2004-05, $6.3 million in 2005-06 and $6.4 million in 2006-07.  </para><para>It will be immediately obvious that the estimated savings from amalgamating the three departments is very unlikely to be enough to fund the extra security needs. I agree with Senator Brown that it makes the ALP amendment to this motion a very cynical and contradictory one. On the one hand, they say that the savings are probably not there or they do not think they are there but if there is anything extra over and above those savings that is not needed for security then it should go back into the departments. We know that is not going to happen. We know there will be a shortfall because those savings are not obviously there. The $1.2 million a year, which is the Senate department's share of the funding required for future years, is about four per cent of the Senate's current budget. The Senate's current budget is only for staffing, so it would appear that the savings will have to be found by decreasing staff and, therefore, senators' services. It is all very well to talk about involuntary redundanciesâand nobody, least of all me, wants to see anybody sacked in this placeâbut the downside of that approach is that we will lose people who may not necessarily be in the right positions for this to be a workable arrangement. </para><para>Budget estimate questions told us that no other government department or agency is being asked to find savings from ongoing departmental expenses to fund enhanced security costs. No-one has explained to us why this is necessary. Why is it that the ministerial wing is not contributing? It is sharing the costs of security, just as every other department is, but we get no answers to those questions. The Senate department has already absorbed costs for extra security out of its current budget, money which could have gone into enhancing services like the vital but very busy Senate committee system. My colleague Senator Cherry and his committee is feeling the pinch in terms of resourcing from the secretariat. Times are tough at present in this place, and there are often not enough resources to do the work that is needed. Why should the Department of the Senate, Hansard or the Parliamentary Library have to shed functions and staff to find savings to cover the costs of security? It just does not make any sense. We say that security measures should not be funded at the expense of key parliamentary services.</para><para>Three heads of department are in favour of amalgamationâthe Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Joint House Department Secretary and the Hansard-Parliamentary Library Secretaryâand one head made no recommendation. Submissions from the department staff mostly follow along the same departmental lines. In other words, Senate staff groups are not supportive; others are. The Clerk of the Senate declined to recommend a decision on either option until a proper cost benefit analysis was undertaken. He noted the unsatisfactory process, the lack of detailed cost analysis, estimated savings without foundation and savings already made by the Senate department by good management continuing and being of far more significance than the small savings gained by eliminating a small number of corporate management staff. He pointed out that 14 per cent had been cut out of departments over the last four or five years and that there is very littleâin fact nothingâstill to be gained by cuts. Of course, Mr Evans's answers to the questions in estimates by my colleague Senator Murray show where other savings can be made, but I will leave him to talk about that. The Secretary of the Joint House Department endorsed the amalgamation option as `achievable' and having a better chance of success than the shared services centre option also proposed. He noted that an inherent dynamics problem could be created by the new balance of a superdepartment that was bigger than either of the two chamber departments. </para><para>Our position is that we have consistently opposed all previous attempts to amalgamate any or all of the parliamentary departments. We think it compromises the independence of the Library, which is noted as a problem in the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee report with its warning advice that there is a need to take measures to guarantee the independence of the library. I do not think that the appointments that have been discussed so far will do that. There is often an unacceptable extra layer of management and salaries resulting from amalgamations. There is an enormous cost to staff, and I am talking here about work structure changes, resources and morale. This is something we need to take into account very seriously. When staff know that there are large numbers of redundancies that are about to occur, it can be extremely difficult for them to maintain the work that they have to do and to keep up their morale.</para><para>The creation of a superdepartment would have inherent problems as opposed to smaller departments which, we would argue, are better as service specialists and have proved that over the past 100 years. The new joint department would be much bigger than either of the chamber departments, as has already been mentioned. It can be argued that none of these departments is even in the same business. There is certainly a lack of commonality between the Senate and the House of Representatives. I can see that in the future this amalgamated department will seek to make the Senate more like the House of Representatives, not the other way around. We know that the real scrutiny of legislation takes place in this place, and it needs resourcing, and I doubt very much that those in the other place will be sympathetic to the needs and the costs that are associated with proper service in here for real democracy.</para><para>The premise that merger equals better is flawed. That is why I cannot understand why the Labor Party is supporting this. Again, there just have not been any serious arguments to say why merging is going to be beneficial. The cost benefits are very small and not warranted, given the other costs. We need to find more innovative and structured ways of achieving practicalities within existing departments rather than having efficiency proposals always imposed from above. We think that the five departments can work out areas of cooperation and shared resources between themselves. They do this now from time to time. Let us have a look at exploring what other opportunities there are, if there are any. We also need a much more supportive environment for them to do that, which has not happened with these amalgamation processes and proposals always being on the cards, as it were.</para><para>We have heard no real arguments for amalgamation. Is this empire building? Are these fanciful notions of savings that might be made? There has been no independent assessment of those savings. We cannot compare amalgamation with outsourcing in achieving savings and, again, no decision ought to be made until a proper cost-benefit analysis is done, not just some dodgy back of the envelope calculation. Senator Brown has already outlined the stages which the Clerk of the Senate recommends before we go to this kind of decision, and the Democrats are strongly supportive of that approach. We are also very supportive of the Greens amendment to the ALP amendment. This place should not be wearing the cost of security. That should be properly and separately funded and should not impinge on the services that are available to this place. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13799</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to say a couple of things about the proposal that we amalgamate into one parliamentary services department the three departments of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Department. I am concerned that the current proposal for restructuring the parliamentary departments is being driven by a need for cash for security rather than being based on any merit at all. I am also concerned that there are 35 staff positions to be sacrificed for our security. I cannot for the life of me see where the $10 million savings come in over a particular period of time. It remains to be seen whether amalgamating the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff will in fact be an efficient way of organising matters.</para></talk.start><para>I acknowledge that there have been a number of attempts, based on the suggestion that this is a more efficient way to go, over 100 years or so to organise more efficient use of taxpayer funding by reducing the number of departments. In 1977 the then President, Senator Sir Condor Laucke, and Mr Billy Snedden had a study done. I can see Condor Laucke in the chair in Old Parliament House with the big wig on that he used to wear. I do not know how much that wig actually cost to manicure et cetera, but that is now not worn by you, Mr President, so you have made a saving there.</para><para>Irrespective of the view one might have, it is difficult to see how people can accept that this proposal should be driven by security fears for the parliament. Our security and the security of the parliament, including that of the Prime Minister and cabinet members, ought to be provided by the Australian government. I was told that we have to make these efficiency gains and that other departments are making efficiency gains, and I wrongly assumed that was for security purposes. So far as I know, the security requirements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department are being paid for by the Australian government. For us to determine any reform of parliament, such as that being suggested, the arguments should have been put forward on their merits. Frankly, I cannot see the merit in it because it has not been tightly argued. Indeed, I am concerned that such an impost on the parliament's resources threatens the parliament's very independence in some ways.</para><para>I have not seen it adequately proven anywhere that there are 35 staff positions we do not need. Which area are these 35 positions going to be taken away from? I have not really seen evidence of that. I have worked in this place for 28 years and have had the privilege of working alongside many staff from the various parliamentary departments. I and other senators know there is more than enough work to go around in the parliament. For my own information needs, I am particularly concerned about the impact of staff losses in the operation of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. I and other senators depend on timely, concise and accurate information, which is provided by the staff of the Parliamentary Library, often meeting unreasonable deadlines. A lot of that is background policy information which you need to assess what is being proposed in a particular area of public policy.</para><para>The parliament would know that I do not have a big party behind me and therefore I do not have policies in the sense of party political platforms. I do rely very much on advice that is given not only by people whom I know from all sorts of professions but particularly from the Parliamentary Library, and I am very grateful for that. I am concerned that this proposal may affect the operations of the Parliamentary Library. It would be ironic if we sacrifice the capacity of the library to provide us with information central to our work. If we damage the quality of the work done in this parliament we will be increasing spending on parliamentary security to protect what may be a devalued product. That is going to an extreme because, by that time, there will be alarm bells ringing. </para><para>Mr President, I acknowledge very much the work that you and Mr Speaker have done to make sure the position of Parliamentary Librarian is re-established, with certain amendments that will be made to the Parliamentary Service Act. That will enhance the position of Parliamentary Librarian and I congratulate you for that. I do not know whether it was a victory but it was certainly a very important decision that was accepted. Mr President, I note you are proposing that there be no forced redundancies. I think it is very important that we make a stand on this particular matter. All redundancies must be unforced redundancies and, where there is a vacancy so caused, the Presiding Officers must surely have much regard for the merits of not filling that vacancy.</para><para>I have not really had time to focus on the details of the issue, but I have been thinking of the matter in general principles. I have to say that, despite the good work that has been done by you, Mr President, and Mr Speaker to uphold and enhance the position of Parliamentary Librarian, I am concerned that the service we receive from the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Department may diminish as a result of this. Why? Because we have to pay for our own security. If there are genuine security concerns, it is the responsibility of the Australian government to provide money for that without reducing resources available to the Australian parliament. Under those circumstances, I must say that I oppose this proposition. I do so reluctantly, because I know of the work that has been done. If it were proven that all other departments were providing for their own security by adjustments in departmental appropriations then that would be another matter. I have found that all of them are not doing that. So why should we?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13800</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn closing the debate, I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. If the motion receives the support of the Senate, I believe a major improvement in the efficient operation of the parliament will result. The consequences of the passage of the motion will lead to the appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian, which I believe will reassure senators, such as Senator Harradine, who are rightly concerned about the independence of the Parliamentary Library. That person will each year conclude a resource agreement with the secretary for the proper funding of the library and its research services. The new joint services department will have around 750 staff. As I mentioned, the Speaker and I have agreed that there will be a selection process for the secretary to the new department, including national advertising and an independent assessment of the merits of those who apply. The same will apply to the recruitment of the Parliamentary Librarian.</para></talk.start><para>This debate provides an appropriate opportunity for me to emphasise that officers who currently serve in the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff have given and continue to give excellent service to the institution of the parliamentâas have their predecessors, who have worked in those departments since 1901. Without the work of the joint departments neither the Senate nor the other place would be able to adequately function. I take this opportunity to publicly thank the personnel of the joint departments. If this motion is passed, I look forward to their continuing contributions to the work of the single, joint parliamentary department. </para><para>I understand that we have quite a few amendments.

A four-minute division bell was rung and the nature of the division was that the government and the opposition were voting together on an amendment before the chair. Subsequently a one-minute division bell was rung, as sometimes occurs, and the unusual circumstance was that in that division the government and the opposition were voting in a different manner.

In response to a question I asked about the implications for Commonwealth assets that had already been sold and that had an indicative place on the list under the current regime, the minister informed the committee that the process would effectively have to begin again under the new regime if this legislation were to pass. That would mean that Commonwealth assets that were being considered but which were not formally on the list would effectively have to start the process again. There would be no ability for them to transfer onto the new list because they are not Commonwealth assets anymore. Because they are former Commonwealth assets, they would not be locked into any sort of transferring process. So to be listed they would effectively have to be nominated again. The example that was used was the police cottageâpart of the Water Police station at Yarralumla Bayâthat was sold off. It is my understanding that it is currently leased by the Commonwealth. Minister, I know you are undertaking to get some additional information about that particular circumstance, but can you further clarify whether, if these bills were to pass, there would be any process by which the police cottage would find its place on a list under the new regime? Would it be part of a process that was at least moving in that direction if these bills were to pass? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13804</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can provide some further information on the police cottage.

The property was leased back by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth nominated the place to the ACT Heritage Register in June this year. The Commonwealth took that initiative. The place is currently being assessed by the ACT Heritage Council. The Australian Heritage Commission was involved in the contract of sale to ensure the protection of heritage values. Special conditions were attached to the sale document to require: (1) that the purchaser was made aware of the intention to list the place on the ACT Heritage Register and (2) that the purchaser cannot lodge an objection to the place being entered onto the ACT Heritage Register or the Register of the National Estate. So it seems that, between them, the Commonwealth and the Australian Heritage Commission decided that the process that I have just outlined would best protect the heritage values and was therefore adopted.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13804</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Minister.

I guess I am asking whether, as part of this transitionâif these bills are passedâthe police cottage will be automatically nominated to go on the Register of the National Estate.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13804</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI understand that it has also been nominated to the Register of the National Estate under the existing legislation.

That would be a question of whether its values meet the standards under the new legislation. It seems that whether they meet them under the existing legislation is still being assessed. What surprises me a little bit is that, while it is not inconsistent to be going down the ACT Heritage Council path as well, that seems to be the emphasis that those who have a primary responsibility to protect these values have preferred rather than putting an emphasis on a future Commonwealth list.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13804</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just make the observation that that itself says something about the relative merits of the two systems. I do not know if this is anything that the minister can answer, but I will put the question anyway. I am curious, given the location, as to why that is the preferred path. One, the location is very much in an area that is, obviously, under the auspices of the National Capital Authority, being immediately on the lake foreshore. Two, it is in an area where the National Capital Authorityâand, therefore, the Commonwealthâhave had the greatest interest in everything from design and siting to planning arrangements on the lake foreshore. Three, what is the view of that organisation? </para></talk.start><para>But I think that, for the purposes of this bill, the issue here is that it seems to be perceived by those who are trying to protect the heritage value of the police cottage that in factâin the light of the bills we are debatingâACT heritage registration is perhaps the stronger of the two. I think that that reflects very unhealthily upon the propositions before us. If I can think of any more questions about this particular circumstance, I will ask them. I think it is quite a reasonable case study to demonstrate what happens to former Commonwealth assetsâor, as we have now heard, former Commonwealth assets that are leased by the Commonwealth and, therefore, are still eligible to transfer to the Commonwealth list. I think that the minister is learning more about these bills as we go along. I know that the more questions we ask, the more convoluted it seems to get, particularly about the issues that arise when you introduce the sale or pending sale of Commonwealth assets into the considerations of heritage status.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13805</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not know that it is more convoluted, but I do not have the answer to that specific question.

There were enormous concerns about both the environmental and cultural heritage of Iraq at the time. The minister will remember some of the destruction of cultural heritage, which was obvious. It always takes a long while before the environmental impact comes through, but there are great worries about a whole range of things, obviously, when armies are invading a country. I ask why the minister made the exemption. Where do you draw the line? It seems that the exemptions are made domestically for social and economic parameters and that they are made internationally before the war is on and then you protect the site after the war is overâthe minister has mentioned Gallipoli a number of times. When does the Australian government get to the stage of believing that it should protect environmental and cultural heritage, particularly of world heritage significance, and make sure that it is protected under all circumstances? After all, there is a 1954 code which says that such places should be protected in times of war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>13806</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a few points. Firstly, the Australian forces obviously make every endeavour to protect cultural heritage assets, whether or not they are in Australia. My second point is that we are a party to various conventions in which we accept a national responsibility to protect heritageâthat is a fact of life and we are proud of it. We do everything possible to meet our obligations under those conventions. The third issue is in relation to making public the determination made under subsection 28(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act. There was no reason not to make it public.

So there is no secret in that regard. As to why the decision was taken: as I recall, the decision was taken as a precaution to protect Australian servicemen in case there was an argument that an action they may have taken was in breach of this piece of legislation. The legislation provides that in circumstances of national security they can receive an exemption, and the government so acted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13807</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe reason the government did not publicise this is that it covered it up during the onset of the Iraq war. The government did not want the people of Australia to know about it. This minister, the Minister for Defence, did not make a public declaration about this very important matter, and there had already been worldwide alarm about the potential for destruction of the cultural heritage of global significance in Iraqâof course, that is heritage of the whole of humankind. I believe it was a contentious matter and I believe this minister covered it up by not making it public. All down the line, the government was flagging other intentions which were of public momentâput aside secret matters, but this is definitely not in that category. The minister, quietly and without notifying the public, declared that, as far as Australia was concerned, the invading forces were exempt from the act which was designed to ensure that we protect places of global significance anywhere in the world.</para></talk.start><para>What is the point of a piece of legislation when you have a government or a minister able to do that and, moreover, able to cover it up? If there is one amendment which obviously needs to be made here it is that such declarations must be published.

We all remember the ferment and the intense national interest, and it is still a matter of great contention. I maintain, unless the minister has an argument to the contrary, that he made this critical decision to waive the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for the Iraq war and did not tell the Australian people.

The minister responded to my question by saying he did make such a declaration on 25 February this year but did not put it on the Environment Australia web siteâhe did not put out a publication of it, in effectâand that he is not required to do so. I ask the minister would he care to say what he has done with other such actions and why he thought that in the middle of such a massive public debate as there was over the Iraq war, with very real concerns about world heritage sites in Iraq, he made that determination but did not tell anybody in the public about it. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>13808</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe did cover these matters before the dinner break, and I do not know that there is a lot more that I can add.

There was no wish to hide anything from the Australian public, but I will never convince Senator Brown of that. The government was very up front about the role of Australian forces. I think most reasonable Australians would see that there is always the chance of inadvertent damage to a heritage site and would wish us to protect Australian forces, who are acting responsibly and with the appropriate level of care given the nature of the operation.

What is the point of putting a clause in an act which I think quite rightly protects global heritage from Australian actions overseas if the first time it is tested you bring out an exemption clause? We have seen serial transgressions of the so-called protection of the domestic environment under this legislation. We have heard the minister say that social and economic interests, which means the interests of the big end of town, need to be in no way trammelled when it comes to heritage listingâin other words, you do not list a place because of its heritage value; you first of all ask the developers whether they have something in mind and for goodness sake do not let the heritage get in the way. </para></talk.start><para>But this is the government's own legislation.

I think the general approach should be: when decisions are made that are of public interest and there is no reason why they should not be made public then it is better that they are.

What happened was that the Tasmanian Heritage Council, under the authority of Premier Bacon, announced that it would be making an independent investigation of the heritage values of Recherche Bay. Then suddenly two weeks ago it told the interested partiesâwhich do include the Tasmanian Greens but, more importantly, the local community groupsâ that it was not going to do so; they would have to do it themselves. They did not make any offer; they were told. The Tasmanian Heritage Council unilaterally withdrew from that commitment it had made, by the way, to Environment Minister Kemp and which he had then made to me. Premier Bacon had made it too. I ask why.  </para></talk.start><para>The answer is that the woodchip industry and Gunns leant directly or indirectly on the Tasmanian Heritage Council, unless the minister can give some other explanation. It just does not add up. There has been political influence on a process that had been publicly announced.

Now it is left, by the way, to the community groups who, earlier on, may have had decent timeâI know they do not have the money to get independent expertise because it does cost moneyâ and suddenly their time is almost out and they have no wherewithal to do that except to get together the best information they have. I suggest to the minister that the process is wrong. The national government cannot allow itself to be compromised by the Tasmanian government in that fashion. The minister says, `When the assessment comes back, if there is not sufficient information we will get an independent study done here.' I do not have any faith in that.

If I am wrong, please give an explanation as to why that commitment from the Tasmanian Premier and his Heritage Council has suddenly evaporated. It just does not make sense. After long consideration they made that commitment. The Greens have no experts on staff who can take up this matter. You should go down there and do all the investigations that the Tasmanian Heritage Council and the Tasmanian Premier said they would do. What is more, on 13 August the council's decision was deferred and we are closing the gate on this in September. And, what is more, you know that you have to get the permission of the owners, and there are all sorts of hoops to go through down there. </para><para>It is a terrible process, and I want the minister to restore some confidence in it. Again, it is this act that we are dealing with here and part of this act, which we were given all sorts of assurances about three years ago, covered the transfer of many of the obligations for assessing and protecting the national heritage to the states. But you cannot transfer that authority; this is federal legislation. You cannot transfer the responsibility. I am asking the minister what the Hon. David Kemp, Minister for the Environment and Heritage, has done to investigate why that change took place in Tasmania. Surely we are owed an explanation here. The minister says that suddenly the groups decided to undertake it. They did nothing of the sort. They were told there was no option; they would have to do it or it would not be done. There was going to be no investigation. So I presume they are cobbling together whatever they can at the moment. What a processâa process that can be cut in two by vested interests in such an extraordinary way as that!</para><para>I also asked the minister last week about the eyebright, which is critically endangered and on the protection list under this bill. Premier Bacon has to make a decision as to whether he will allow a resumption of roadworks going right through the territory of the one known place where that critically endangered flowering plant in southern Tasmania exists. What is the process here? Who is doing the independent analysis this time? What assurances have we that Premier Bacon will not be allowed to give the go-ahead to that road which damages that environment and, therefore, is likely to push this critically endangered native closer to, if not all the way to, extinction? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13812</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Tasmanian assessment process is one under Tasmanian legislation, with a protective regime set up thereby. Whilst we seek cooperation, because we think the most effective form of protection for the nation is each level of government playing its part, nevertheless how the Tasmanian government implements its statutory obligation is primarily in its hands. I am advised that there was no commitment as such to Dr Kemp. Certainly Dr Kemp was led to understand that the process was being driven by the Tasmanian Heritage Council, but I am told that on 14 August the Commonwealth department was advised that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was adopting a different approach to that originally advised. </para></talk.start><para>I have outlined what that different approach is. What I have said is that, whilst the Commonwealth can take the outcomes, the assessments or the matters that were involved in the Tasmanian process into account in its obligationsâand, sensibly, it wouldâit is not limited by the Tasmanian investigation under the Australian Heritage Commission Act, as it is now, in terms of a listing application, of which there is one, as I have said, or if the EPBC Act comes into play the Commonwealth is free to seek what other advice it considers necessary in order to make the best decisions and I am sure under Dr Kemp will do so.</para><para>I have some further information which I can give to Senator Brown on the swamp eyebright. I understand that Minister Kemp has previously advised Senator Brown that the EPBC Act does not apply to the construction of the access road through the Southport Lagoon Conservation Area as the road is for forestry purposes. Forestry operations undertaken in accordance with the forest practices plan meet the requirements of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and, therefore, are exempt from the EPBC Act. The Forest Practices Plan for the construction of the access road was certified in April 2002.</para><para>I am advised that the swamp eyebright is listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act and the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act. Officials from the Department of the Environment and Heritage have been in contact with the Tasmanian officials in an effort to find further information on the matter. As a result, I understand that the access road is located approximately one kilometre from the swamp eyebright population in the conservation area and that the action will not directly impact on the eyebright population. In fact, it is the officials' view that the uncontrolled access by recreational four-wheel drive vehicles is actually a greater threat to the swamp eyebright. However, the department is informed that potential for impacts on the eyebright was considered during the forest practices plan process and that the plan for the road incorporates specific construction measures designed to prevent unauthorised recreational four-wheel drive vehicles from using the road to gain access to the conservation area where the eyebright is located. I think Senator Brown made reference to a particular study. Commonwealth officials have been unable to identify that study. I hope that that basically answers the issue that Senator Brown has raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>13812</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am surprised that the Commonwealth officials have not been able to get the study by Parks and Wildlife in Tasmania which lists the potential for a logging road to be a threat to the eyebright. The minister will know, from his years of experience with the environment, that a logging road going within a kilometre of a critically endangered plant is a very serious threat indeedâparticularly where it is not warranted and where it is going through a conservation area. We get into a downward spiral with the logic the minister used. He says, `Forestry is a protected activity as far as this bill is concerned.' So here we go: this bill is to protect Australia's heritage, logging operations not included. The minister says, `This critically endangered plant is on the list, but if it is a logging operation it does not count.' </para></talk.start><para>The first attempt on that road, by Gunns Pty Ltd, to get in and woodchip the north-east peninsula was in May last year. A combination of factors including bad weather stopped them, but I bet it was not even brought to the minister's attention that this critically endangered plant was in the vicinity, let alone the values of the north-east peninsular. If either of those factors were brought to the attention of the minister, I would like to see that evidence. I point out that on both counts this legislation and the process of divesting authority to the logging operatives in Tasmania and to the Tasmanian government has failed. It failed with a critically endangered species and it failed with top-rank national, cultural and environmental heritage. If it is going to that down there, where is the guarantee of this legislation? That is the question I was putting here three years ago.</para><para>The Commonwealth has an obligation to understand what is going on at state level because otherwise anything goesâand I said that three years ago. You get maverick state governments when it comes to the environmentâyou get maverick premiers, ministers and chief ministersâand this legislation has no way of dealing with that. You are ransomed by their behaviour. The behaviour I am outlining here regarding Recherche Bay, and a cascading series of events that all tumble against the environmental interest and the public interest, has not been countermanded in any way by Commonwealth action. The minister makes an assertion that there is going to be an independent inquiry, and then within a month of that there is not. Efforts are made to try to feed me that the community group opted to take up responsibility, when I know that is wrong. The government down there intervened, one way or another, and the Tasmanian Heritage Council said it will haul off the independent investigationâ because there is money involved here.</para><para>The minister is listening to this debate, and I would have thought that he would be able to respond to that. I can tell him that the Recherche Bay issue has drawn international attention. It is being watched by the international media, not least the French media, and there is national and international archaeological, anthropological and environmental interest. The Commonwealth government is going to get itself into a big stew here if it does not have the backbone to say to the Tasmanian state government, `Haul off on this occasion. You can't do that.'</para><para>In concluding, let me tell you where the state government and the Tasmanian Heritage Council are going to do. They are going to put in two postage stamp exclusions: one for the French garden and one for the observatory. The observatory is outside the logging range anyway, and they will argue that the French garden is too because they have a 100-metre zone around the outside and it happens to be just within the zone, next to the coast. They are going to put in postage stamp exclusions to what should be a culturally protected landscape. This is a cultural landscape of international significance. I have handed the minister the sum of the evidence on that. There are known historic sites all over this peninsula.</para><para>Minister Kemp needs to know that he is dealing with a very dangerous situation as far as the environment and Australia's international kudos are concerned, because the decisions the Tasmanian government makes under this legislation are the decisions the Howard government makes. If I were the national government I would not simply be the fall guy for the delinquency that is coming down the line over this particular, extraordinarily important historic, environmental andâwell above allâIndigenous site, which has so far remained miraculously intact but which is about to be blitzed within the next six to eight months. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13814</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI hear what Senator Brown says but I do not think I can take the swamp eyebright or the Recherche Bay matters any further at this time.

The issue is whether the state or the Commonwealth protective regimes, or both in conjunction, provide adequate protection. The process in relation to Recherche Bay is still under way, so I think it is premature to make a judgment on that. In relation to swamp eyebright, the agreement that was reached between the Commonwealth and the state gave the responsibility to protect those assets primarily to the state. The state is arguing that the course of action it is taking is not going to threaten the asset, and no doubt there will be debate and public interest on that particular issue.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13814</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn another matter, I did ask the minister last week about the protection of Aboriginal heritage by the logging operations under the regional forest agreement.

In Tasmania the protection of Aboriginal sites in areas proposed for logging is informed by the state government's Forest Practices Code, which is underpinned by the National Parks and Wildlife Act, the Threatened Species Protection Act, the Aboriginal Relics Act, the Forestry Act and the Commonwealth EPBC Act. The Tasmanian Heritage Office and the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board have advice that logging activities are not exempt from the provisions of the Aboriginal Relics Act 1975, which provides penalties for any person found to have interfered with a protected Aboriginal relic or site. The Forest Practices Code, which is a public document, sets out the process whereby cultural values should be assessed at the strategic or property level and evaluated during the preparation of forest practices plans. The code stipulates:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Requirements for the conservation of ... cultural values, including specific sites, should be recorded to aid in future decision making and ensure continuity of management.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Areas of high conservation significance may be designated as special management zones ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>During the planning for broad areas of forest, areas of Aboriginal cultural heritage site potential and/or sensitivity should be identified using the Archaeological Potential Zone maps ... or the potential zoning predictive statements ...</para></quote><para>Heritage specialists within the Forest Practices Board advise that all areas of high archaeological potential are surveyed within the limits of access and visibility. A proportion of the areas of medium and low archaeological potential are also surveyed. Known sites are managed by avoidance. Following the logging of coupes, an assessment is undertaken to determine ongoing management requirements. </para><para>The Tasmanian Heritage Office advise that the Forest Practices Board were originally provided with data relating to some 3,500 sites around Tasmania. They advise that since 1994 they have undertaken some 3,000 pre- and post-operational surveys of logging areas. Information relating to cultural heritage sites located during these surveys is provided to the Tasmanian Heritage Office for inclusion on the Tasmanian Aboriginal site index. Information used to prepare the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement identified some 180 natural and Indigenous heritage places located in forest areas either in the interim list or inscribed in the Register of the National Estate. Both the Tasmanian Heritage Office and the Forest Practices Board advise that producing specific figures on the number of sites identified within logging coupes and the management status of each would take some time to generate.</para><para>I am also advised in relation to applications for protection under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Actâthat is, the Commonwealth act. Until 1998 the administration of the act rested with ATSIC. There was up until that date only one application that related to a claimed threat from forestry actions. That was the Kooparoona Niara application. I understand that a buffer zone was provided to protect the site and that ultimately the matters were resolved. As I suspected, there have been no further applications for protection since the Commonwealth department took over the administration of that piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13815</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Minister. I know you are giving us the information you have. You said during that submission that known sites are managed by avoidance. Let me be a bit more particular. Your good officers have had some time to work on this. I mentioned last week quarry sites, middens and scatter sites that are listed, and I asked specifically if such sites had been destroyed, isolated or removed or were under threat of same. I want the minister to know that his information is not right. I would like to ask the minister if all logging operations in the Tarkine in north-west Tasmaniaâthat is, in that corner of the stateâat the moment exempt damage to Aboriginal sites. I very specifically ask if there are intentions, applications or otherwise to forgo protection of logging sites so that logging can take place or is taking place already. Another way of asking that is: has the Tasmanian government or any of its instrumentalities or ministers given exemption for the interference in such sites at the request of logging operatives or have logging operatives made such a request?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13815</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAgain, Senator Brown asks for a great deal of detail about the application by Tasmania of its protective legislation. I do not have the answer to that specific question, but I have said to the Senate that the Tasmanian relics act takes precedent. If a site has been protected then to damage it is a serious offence. There seems to have been an extensive process of evaluating Aboriginal sites in Tasmania, which is obviously a good thing. If they have been identified and listed, they are managed by avoidanceâwhich seems to me to be the best way to manage them. I do not know of any provision under the Tasmanian legislation that allows for what I think Senator Brown referred to as an exemption, which I take to mean that the forestry operation would be permitted to destroy a protected site. Certainly that would not occur under the Commonwealth legislation, but the fact that there have not been applications under the Commonwealth legislation would suggest that, by and large, interested parties are happy with the operation of the Tasmanian regime. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>13816</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask the minister if he will go back to the Tasmanian government and ask if an exemption has ever been given to exempt from protection a listed Aboriginal site in Tasmania, if a request for an exemption has been made and if there is the facility for the minister or the Premier or anybody else to make such an exemption. The minister has indicated that is not the caseâthat is not my information. I am very serious about the matter. The minister says, `Well, under the Forest Practices Board, there are 3,500 sites and there have been 3,000 surveys in the last eight years.' He says this is Tasmanian legislation. No, it is not. This is this legislation, which transfers the Commonwealth's guardianship of such heritage to the Tasmanian authorities. It exempted logging operations because there is a code of practice there. What I am talking about breaches that code of practice, but the responsibility is with the federal government. The Prime Minister signed that regional forest agreement giving authority to the state to do the Commonwealth's work. The minister knows that that is the case. I do not know whether any other member of this committee wants to comment on this, but we are talking about legislation here to protect the nation's heritage. </para></talk.start><para>Is the minister saying to me, `Yes, the Commonwealth exempts logging operations from protecting known sites of national cultural or environmental heritage'? Is that what you are saying? That is new. The line we have always been given here is that the Forest Practices Code, which operates under the regional forest agreement which Prime Minister Howard devised with then Premier Rundle, does the Commonwealth's job. I am saying it does not. The question is: how can the Commonwealth allow that to happen? How can it have national heritage being damaged or destroyed under its authority, under the Prime Minister's signature? Don't they value the Prime Minister's signature? Isn't there an expectation that the state government, inheritors of that regional forest agreement, will be honest and true to its requirements and to the assurances given to the people of Tasmania and indeed everywhere else about the Tasmanian heritage? Or is the minister saying to the committee that the national obligation to protect sites, places and values of national significance does not apply to logging in Tasmania? If that is the case, say so. It has never been said before. If it is not the case, I ask: how do you protect Indigenous and other cultural and environmental heritage from those people who breach the spirit of this legislation? And it is being breached. You cannot wash your hands of it. You cannot be Pontius Pilate and say, `That is not my business; it is somebody else's.'

In general terms, they are heritage related amendments: some relate to Commonwealth obligations and some are general amendments relating to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Firstly, the heritage related amendments cover a raft of different issues. They stipulate that the EPBC Act definition of environment includes places listed on the Register of the National Estate. They insert obligations for the minister when making a decision in relation to the taking of an action in regard to World Heritage or national heritage places. Also they increase transparency in the listing process by requiring the minister to publish his preliminary decision about listing, the council's assessment report and the value statements when the minister invites public comments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Amendment (116) specifically relates to transparency and inserts time frames. I will go through some of the publishing requirementsâand I list theseâin relation to nominations that need to be assessed, the minister's statement of reasons for listing or non-listing, notifying the nominator and other interested persons. Amendments (37) to (39) relate to seeking comments on proposed removals; amendment (42), to seeking comments on management plans; amendment (88), to the minister's decision on endorsement of Commonwealth management plans; and amendment (10), to providing reasons for extending the council's assessment period. All of these will now have a requirement to be published and to be openly accessible, increasing the transparency of the process.</para><para>Amendment (53) clarifies the fact that anyone may notify the minister if they believe a place has national heritage or Commonwealth heritage values and is under threat. It clarifies that management plans in Commonwealth reserves that include a heritage place must be consistent with the management principles and the regulations. Amendment (106) allows for the transfer of World Heritage properties to the National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List. It expands requirements in relation to reviewing management plans and reviewing and reporting on the lists. Amendment (104) amends the definition of Indigenous heritage value to ensure that historic places of Indigenous heritage value can be protected under the new heritage legislation. </para><para>I want to look quickly at the Commonwealth obligations. Amendment (109) says that the Commonwealth must not, or authorise any other person to, contravene a management plan in a Commonwealth area or a state or territory, or act inconsistently with the management principles and the Ramsar or World Heritage conventions. Then there are a series of amendments that relate to improved protection and management of Commonwealth heritage places by Commonwealth agencies: amendment (100) gives the minister prior notification of an intended disposal; amendment (92) assists the minister and the council to monitor a place's heritage values; amendment (93) seeks the council's advice before making a heritage strategy for a place; amendment (97) involves seeking the minister's advice on the heritage strategy in relation to management principles, assisting the minister in nominating places to the Commonwealth Heritage List and publishing general implementation details about the heritage strategies in agencies' annual reports; and amendment (99) involves not undertaking any actions that may have any impact on the heritage values of a national or a Commonwealth heritage place unless there is no feasible or prudent alternative.</para><para>Finally, there are amendments that relate to the EPBC Act. These amendments deal with referrals that relate to split projects or staged referrals. There are general amendments that tighten up the EPBC Act itself. They amend the EPBC Act by providing penalties for not taking an action in a specified manner; increase transparency by removing an exemption for giving reasons where the person referring a proposal states that the action is a controlled action; and insert additional publishing requirements for the secretary in relation to all EPBC Act matters, not just those affected by this legislation.</para><para>As well as the amendments, I have received a number of non-legislative commitments from the minister. Environment Australia's administrative procedures will provide for consultations with Indigenous persons or groups with rights and interests in a place, identified at the time of listing the place, to be alerted to the referral stageâso it will happen much earlier. They will be provided with the opportunity to comment. All regulations associated with the heritage amendments will be placed on the Environment Australia Internet siteâagain, a transparency issue. Environment Australia will maintain a consolidated register of Commonwealth heritage registers received from agencies. Environment Australia will review the operation of the EPBC Act in 4Â½ years time. </para><para>Environment Australia will ensure that the new Australian Heritage Council will be a separate budget item in the annual budget statement to enable a year-to-year scrutiny of the funds appropriated to the new council. This is an issue that was raised by quite a number of groups who were concerned that funds would be effectively pooled and the actual amounts of money available to the new body would be very difficult to track and monitor. I have also been given the commitment that the government will work with the states to ensure the protection of national heritage values through the regional forest agreement process. I recommend to the chamber that the amendments that I have moved tonight, which considerably strengthen the legislation, be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>13833</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will support the amendments, but I may ask that one or two be voted on separately. Most of them are almost exactly the same as Democrats amendments, as would be obvious to anybody in this place. Amendments (13) to (18) are ones that I would like to speak about briefly. They relate to the listing procedure. The amendments include the obligation to undertake consultation in circumstances where the Heritage Council indicates that a site should be listed and the minister either has not made up his mind yet or simply wishes not to indicate one way or the otherâ that is the difference between this amendment and the last.  </para></talk.start><para>Amendment (17)(5)(iii) states that the minister may make a statement that he or she does not have a view whether or not a place should be included in the National Heritage List. I want to draw honourable senators' attention to that clause. We might as well not have that provision there at all because it simply means he can advise that there is no advice on the matterâwhether the minister proposes to list or otherwise. So it is rather a nonsense amendment in our view.</para><para>I would also like to raise some questions about amendment (31). This act applies to Australian residents, but there is a provision for emergency listing whichâas I understand itâamendment (31) changes. I wonder if there could be a further explanation of the implications of that amendment. In our amendment, for instance, in our listing option the time line for decisions applies to all places, including those that are outside Australia, whereasâas I understand itâin this amendment it does not. I wonder what the implications of that are for foreign sites, such as Gallipoli, and for our companies operating overseas.

We will not be supporting these amendments because we do not believe that these bills are salvageable. Labor moved a series of amendments, when we first started debating this bill in committee, relating to the independence of the Heritage Commission. Those amendments were defeated. We now feel that this bill no longer has integrity or provides the foundation for an independent Heritage Commission. Therefore, regardless of these amendments or earlier Democrat amendments, this bill is not able to be supported by Labor.</para></talk.start><para>I would also again make the observation that what we have witnessed with a series of very lengthy amendments by the Democratsâthe first batch, and the second batch that we voted on a few minutes agoâdemonstrates quite a humiliating attempt by the Democrats to try to be the ones to do the deal with the government on these heritage bills when in fact the deal has been done with Senator Lees. As we have just heard, the government is about to support the remaining amendments that Senator Lees has moved which exclude identical ones that the Democrats have moved previously that the government found it in their hearts to support. On my countâand it was a pretty rough tracking of a very complex series of amendments with some eight of 65 in the first batch and then none out of 40 in the second batchâwe are dealing with the leftovers, if you like, of those amendments. The government obviously prefers to do the deal with Senator Lees on this occasion. From Labor's perspective, we think that this is all quite unfortunate, as the bills themselves are no longer worthy of overall support. Nonetheless, in the forthcoming amendments we will be seizing a couple of opportunities to comment, and we look forward to the debate continuing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13836</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens will be supporting the amendments. They do not give teeth to the bill, but they give an indication of teething troubles. I think it was John Gould who said, back in 1863 or thereabouts, about the Tasmanian tiger, that not many years must elapse before that creature went to extinction. He was noting the troubles and so on. There is an inverse process going on here. It is going to be many years before this bill becomes worthy of becoming the environmental legislation that this nation should have. Incremental bits and pieces are being added on against enormous pressure to prevent that from happening. The problem with that process is that the government can go to a series of players and, as Senator Lundy has just pointed out, shed off pieces each time, which then have to be picked upâhopefully, somewhere further down the line. </para></talk.start><para>That said, who knows what the final vote on the legislation will be? I will not be supporting it, but I have been around long enough to know that one has to stand by even little increments on the environment. So I will be supporting the amendments. Goodness knows: somewhere an eyebright or something might have its status marginally improved by some clause in the legislation. It is like the butterfly's wings moving in the forest somewhere. Many of these amendments are hoping that sort of thing, because this legislation simply does not measure up. Practice has found that it does not measure up to protecting the nation's heritage. But, for the reasons that I have outlined, I will be supporting the amendments. I would rather do that than reject the very marginal improvement that they might make to very faulty legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>13836</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will address a couple of things just briefly in response to a few of the comments that have been made by the ministerâfor example, the amendments being the result of long and difficult negotiations. As I have said before in this debate, they were difficult negotiations because I have never seen negotiations conducted in such bad faith in my life. Bad faith is not about not reaching agreement but about misleading people about what you are doing and what you are agreeing to. Obviously Senator Hill was not the person involved, so that is not a direct reflection on him.</para></talk.start><para>Also, I think that Senator Lundy is basically mistaken. Personally, I am not interested in doing a deal one way or the other. These amendments are in effect Democrats amendments, but they are slightly weaker. Unfortunately, the ability to have them stronger has been lost. But, as Senator Brown has said, any advance forward is always better than none and is better than going backwards. The Democrats' approach to this issue, as it is with every issue, is not to try to wrap ourselves with some ribbon where we can say that we have the deal or whatever; it is about trying to get an outcome. Whether that outcome is achieved through specific amendments we have put forward, or in this case amendments that were developed by the Democrats in discussions with government and then put forward by others, is fairly irrelevant. The outcome is to try to get a move forward.</para><para>My only disappointment is that the opportunity for a stronger outcome can be lost by misjudgments about where the best gains can be made. But that is a very different thing from just deciding that, unless we can get something that has our name on it, we are not going to agree on it. The end result that I think all of us, most of the time, recognise as the reality is that we are trying to get the best possible legislative outcome. That is the approach we have taken with our amendments and, as has been widely reflected in this chamber, these amendments are basically Democrat amendments rebadged and slightly weakened. But, as Senator Brown has said, they are nonetheless an advance forward, albeit not as far forward as would be desirable. Of course, these are not the only amendments that are being considered in the context of the bill. We have to look at what the end product will be in making a judgment about that. I think that there are still some issues to be considered about thatâ some very substantial and important issues that I think need to be flushed out properly. </para><para>Again, in part because of the approach the government or at least the ministerânot the minister in the chamber, but the relevant government ministerâhas taken on this has meant that we have had to take up more time than would otherwise have been necessary to try to ensure that we get accurate information. Particularly in a process that to date has, as I have said, involved bad faith and, therefore, an absence of trust, you have to try to use the public process of the Senate chamber to get things on the record and to at least try to get something slightly more clear-cut for the public. Even though we have had commitments to the chamber gone back on in the past, at least as far as possible we have to try to get some accurate information in the public arena that we can then use to hold the government accountable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13837</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI really do not want to take more time than is necessary, but it would be inappropriate for me not to respond again to this allegation of bad faith. Dr Kemp does not negotiate in bad faith. The problem for the Australian Democrats is their failure to understand that nothing is achieved through years of negotiation if, ultimately, a bill is not passed. The Democrats do not seem to be prepared to negotiate towards the ultimate passage of a bill. They are prepared to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate, but the end seems to be further negotiations. After six years, it is the government's view that the matter has to be brought to a head, and if it can garner the numbers within the chamber to pass what it believes is a piece of legislation that will take huge steps forward in terms of protecting Australia's heritage then, as a government, it has a responsibility to do so.</para></talk.start><para>That is not bad faith; it is the path the Democrats have chosen to go down. As I said, this bill has been in development and negotiation for some six years, during which time the Democrats have had to reach a conclusion that will lead to the passage of the bill, but they are still not there. As far as we know, the Democrats will still vote against this bill in the end.

I do not expect you to agree to that but you were not involved in it and so you would not know; I was, and I do know that it is a straightforward fact of blatant bad faith. Obviously, the government is keen to get the numbers wherever it can, and I do not blame it for that. But I can absolutely say, having given a very clear-cut message to the relevant minister and advisers a few times about an interest in trying to bring the matter to a conclusion, that it is impossible to get any sort of agreement on something when you get written correspondence from a minister that suggests one thing and then a completely opposite action happening at the same timeâthat is bad faith. It is nothing to do with getting the numbers; it is to do with basically misleading people, stringing them along and giving inaccurate information. That is a very unhelpful process in any circumstances, in anyone's language; it is completely different from having disagreement. </para></talk.start><para>I have been and I am still very keen to get an outcome on this. Despite everything, how the Democrats vote has nothing to do with how the government has behaved; it is about whether or not our view of the legislation is that, overall, it is an advance forward. We can deal in other venues and circumstances and in other ways with the issue of the bad faith shown by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. We are not going to prevent beneficial legislation, however marginal, from going through simply because we are annoyed. That would not be responsible or mature. It would be nice if the government took the same approach, but they obviously have not done so in this debate. Hence their refusal to support Democrat amendments despite them reflecting what they had agreed in written correspondence to support, apart from verbal assurances. As I said, that is not our game; that is not the way we do business here.</para><para>It would be worth while for the minister in the chamber, the Minister for Defence, to realise for his benefit and that of all his colleagues that it is not helpful for any minister of the government to behave in this way. If it is seen to be acceptable by his colleagues then that makes it difficult to trust anybody in any form of negotiation at any time. I would prefer that not to be the case, because I do not like wasting my time, as I am sure neither the minister nor anybody else here does. The simple fact is, nonetheless, that that is what occurred in this circumstance. I am not going to labour the point but neither am I going to back away from it or ignore the fact that it has happened. However, our approach to the legislation and the amendments will not be based on our justified outrage at the completely inexcusable manner in which the minister has behaved in this case; it will be on what the better outcome is for the protection of heritage and for the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>13838</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a question to raise about amendment (106), which relates to including World Heritage properties on the National Heritage List.

It allows operators to get in there under all sorts of guisesâthey say they are not going to affect Indigenous heritage here or rare woodland over there, but they are going to put a mine in there. It was rejected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, but here we are getting the government putting it into this legislation. This means that World Heritage properties put on the National Heritage List are going to have less protection than they are intended to have under the World Heritage List itself. Why simply go to values criteria? Why not protect the places in toto? The reverse way of saying this to Senator Lees is: why not protect the place?

This is in no way reducing the protection.

Apparently the Tasmanian government is very keen to see that entire place listed for its values. While we will put in a boundary and we will have management plans et cetera as under the legislation, by listing it in its entirety for its convict heritageâand who knows what the theme will eventually be, but something to do with convicts is pretty well assuredâthat helps to protect the site in its entirety. We do not have to go to this building or that particular path or that bit of bridge; we can stop inappropriate activity that impinges anywhere on those particular values. Yes, it will have boundaries and, yes, the theme will be very clearly definedâfor example, its convict heritageâ but, if someone wants to put up an additional building within sight of the place that is nothing like a convict ruin or in keeping in any way with that particular classification, that can be stopped.

Yes, we have World Heritage places, and then you allow all manner of activities within them as long as they do not infringe on certain values. The places themselves are not protected. There is a whole drift to that because, in the world of greenwashâdevelopers wanting to make money out of World Heritageâthey can always go in there and do whatever it is they are going to do without damaging the values, because that becomes a matter of opinion. The place is not a matter of opinion. The boundary is set; you protect it. Once you start to say, `You can do this in there without damaging this value', you can get a consultant to say you can do that. It is very fraught. It needs to be listed and protected because of the place it is as well as the values it has. If you just go to the values, when you get to section (3) of this amendment, suddenly the place is gone. If the place is listed because of its values, you are in trouble.</para></talk.start><para>There will be the argument that says, `That's the situation we've got.'

You get death by a thousand cuts. You should protect the place, make sure the developers stay outside that placeâparticularly if it is the cream, a World Heritage listed place. But, when you get down to protecting only the values, sure. We have even had this recent example of the World Heritage in Tasmania: they can put in Basslink and they can allow floods to go twice a year down the Gordon River because they can look after the values there and the place has not got the protection it deserves. It does not have it under national legislation, and it is not going to get it under this legislationâbecause they will just bring in consultants and argue, `A flood a couple of times, ripping down through the Gordon Gorge, to meet the airconditioning needs of Melbourne might even improve the place.' Terrific! You can find an argument for saying it is going to actually improve the place because you have paid your consultants well enough.

It is very difficult to conceive of truly national legislation on the environment without some effort to contain both air pollution and global warming. On the last day of sitting, the Senate passed a motion calling on the government to do much more about reversing Australia's status as the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas emitter. The Senate agreed to that motion, taking into account that we are now seeing a rapid series of very troubling events, including the heatwave that tonight's news tells us has claimed 5,000 lives in France, the almost doubling of the record number of tornadoes in the United States in May, the bushfires and droughts we had in Australia last season and before that, and the fact that most of the hottest years recorded for the globe in human history have been in the last decade; and that Australia is in the sad position of being up there with the United States as the world's worst performer on a per capita basis.

Whilst the Democrats would like very much to see a greenhouse trigger, I think there are some difficulties with this amendment as it has been draftedâ which is why the government needs to do this and not rely on individual amendments from this chamber. One of the problems I foresee is that 500,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents would be quite a small amount if you were to take into account a series of activities as an action. For instance, I imagine that a reasonably large transport company would generate that level of CO2 emissions in a year. I imagine there would be a lot of activities that would fit this action. So whilst the Democrats are very keen to see a greenhouse trigger, the minister may wish to comment about how this would work and whether the government has a view on an alternative approach that might be workable.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>13847</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI agree with Senator Allison and I have some real concerns about us proceeding not only with this specific amendment but also knowing tonight that the government is, hopefully, still in debate and discussion with others and is making some progress on both this issue and land clearing, particularly land clearing in Queensland.

A spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, was reported as saying that he was `delighted with the appointmentâhe's acknowledged as a superb campaigner'. The appointment of Kaiser to the second most senior professional office within the ALP is an example of cynicism and double standards so odious that, if it were possible, it would even put the Labor Party to shame. And it exposes the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, for the grinning hypocrite that he is. </para></talk.start><para>Let me remind the Senate of the circumstances in which Mike Kaiser was forced out of the ALP. On 15 August 2000, I told the Senate about serious and systematic corruption within the ALP in Townsville. The sequence of events which followed ultimately led to the establishment of the Shepherdson inquiry into electoral fraud, which reported on 17 April 2001. That inquiry revealed the existence of a culture of systematic corruption, vote-rigging, branch-stacking and the falsification of electoral enrolments endemic within the Queensland branch of the Labor Party throughout the 1980s and 1990s. </para><para>In the course of evidence before the inquiry, Mike Kaiser, then seen as a Labor rising star, admitted that he had been a party to the falsification of enrolments for the Brisbane City Council ward of South Brisbane in 1986. The Commissioner, Mr Tom Shepherdson QC, found that Kaiser's conduct would have constituted the offence of making a false declaration under section 117 of the Queensland Elections Act and the corresponding penalty provision under the Criminal Code. However, because the charge was statute-barredâin other words, the time within which a prosecution could be commenced had expiredâsince Kaiser's fraud only came to light 14 years later, the charge could not be brought. For the same reasonâ that the fraud had been concealed for so longâand for only that reason, Mr Shepherdson declined to recommend a charge of criminal conspiracy.</para><para>So Kaiser did not end up in jail, as did other Labor Party identities who had engaged in similar behaviour. But he did pay a heavy political price. He was forced to relinquish his Labor Party endorsement for the safe seat of Woodridge and, apparently, his political career.</para><para>Mr Beattie went on to lead the Labor Party to a famous election victory, largely because he succeeded in convincing voters that he was sincere in his strong stand against Kaiser and the other rorters. When asked on election night whether Kaiser and another fraudster, Jim Elder, had paid too high a price, Mr Beattie was as eloquent in his denunciation as he was uncompromising in his righteousness. He said:</para><quote><para>Look, I know that there'll be some people who will say that but when it comes to matters of principle, when it comes to matters relating to the integrity of the electoral system, I have to be clear. I was clear, I will be clear and my view about that will not change.</para></quote><para>Two months later, after the release of the Shepherdson report, Mr Beattie told the Queensland parliament:</para><quote><para>I welcome the Shepherdson report on electoral fraud, and so does my government. The inquiry was good for the Labor Party and good for democracy. The actions of a few rorters nearly destroyed a good Labor government ... and I will never forgive them for it.</para></quote><para>Earlier on, on 6 November 2000, Mr Beattie had said:</para><quote><para>I don't want people who break the law in the Labor Party.

The Shepherdson inquiry heard extensive evidence of the same conduct, part of a pattern of conduct over numerous episodes in the course of many yearsâduring most of which Kaiser, as state secretary, was the chief executive of this most corrupt organisation. I refer to the evidence of Mr Warwick Powell and Mr Lee Bermingham in relation to Kaiser's conduct in the East Brisbane plebiscite of 1993, the Archerfield plebiscite of 1994, the Townsville plebiscite of 1996, as well as his systematic handling of large sums of cash, delivered in unmarked envelopes of which Powell and Bermingham testified. In fact, Mr Powell went on to describe how Kaiser boasted about his behaviour, telling `war stories' at Young Labor retreats in which he regaled new recruits with tales of his shenanigansâand, no doubt, thereby perpetuated the Labor Party's corrupt culture by letting each new generation of recruits know that this behaviour was not only acceptable, it was the way to get aheadâit was funâit was cool. </para><para>So this is not a case of a gifted young man condemned forever to the political wilderness for a youthful indiscretion. Here is a case of a hardened young serial offenderâ premeditated, systematic, amoral, shameless, remorselessâeducating and corrupting new generations of young Labor activists into the corrupt old culture over which he presided. No wonder Mr Beattie struck such a chord three years ago when he called him `scum, scum, scum'.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

There is one further aspect to this story. Oddly, when Kaiser assumes the position of assistant national secretary, he will remain resident in Brisbane.

Some people pretend they are like that; some people aspire to be like that; Ian actually was. Mr President, Ian died on the weekend, aged 54. He was a Newcastle boy: he grew up there and was educated there. I got to know him after he joined the staff of the then opposition leader Bill Hayden in 1978. After Bill resigned as Labor's leader, Ian went to work with Peter Walsh. He served as Peter Walsh's senior adviser. His three years with Peter involved, among other things, resolving the difficult uranium policy issue and implementing the petroleum resource rent tax. I reckon just working with Peter would have been difficult enough.</para></talk.start><para>In March 1986, from a slate of 21 candidates, Ian was appointed an organiser at the national secretariat. He ran unsuccessfully for the position of assistant secretary in the Queensland branch in 1988, but in March 1990 he did take on additional responsibilities when he became the Assistant National Secretary of the ALP. Ian retained that position until he left the secretariat in mid-1994 after nominating for but losing the position of national secretary.</para><para>In his eight years at the national secretariat, Ian did a remarkable job for the Labor Party. Between 1986 and 1990, he was heavily involved in the review of Labor's uranium policy, which he shepherded through two national conferences in those four years. He was also largely responsible for the policy work on telecommunications reform which went to a special national conference in 1990. </para><para>Ian designed Labor's policy committee structure at the national level, and those policy committees were in place from 1986 to 1994. He always had a focus on policy. Ian was capable of being tough enough to prevail in internal party ructions, including interventions by the national executive into state branches, and he proved in election campaigns that he did not live in a policy `ivory tower'. But he was not a factional warrior. The hard slog of policy was what Ian considered the real work of politics: the rest of it was just what made implementing policy possible.</para><para>There were rare occasions when Ian's concern for the best outcome did blind him to the short-term political considerations. I was reminded by his friend Gary Gray todayâand Gary is in the chamber tonightâ that in 1991 Ian came up here to Parliament House to advise Bob Hawke about proposed ministerial changes: who should be promoted and who should be demoted. When Hawke realised that all the demotions Ian suggested were of Hawke supporters, Hawke said to him: `You owe it to me to bring me your good ideas. You owe it to yourself to think about it first.'</para><para>Ian was based in Tasmania for a period of six months from March 1992 following federal intervention into the Tasmanian branch of the party. Labor had returned a devastating 27 per cent of the primary vote in the previous state election. After assisting in rebuilding the fortunes of the Tasmanian branch, Ian famously told Sylvia Smith, the Labor candidate for Bass, that he would eat his hat if she won the seat of Bass in the 1993 federal election. Ian was duly presented with a hat at the party conference following the election where Labor won all five Tasmanian seats. He did not eat it, but he was seen regularly wearing it for years afterward.</para><para>Ian served as the party's international secretary from 1989 to 1994. In 1992, Ian got a call from the British High Commission asking whether, as the party's international secretary, he would entertain two members of the British Labour Party. Not thinking the occasion warranted a trip to a fancy restaurant or the expenditure of party funds on a dinner, he took the two guests home and cooked pasta. The significance of these two visitorsâTony Blair and Gordon Brownâ soon became apparent.</para><para>Also in his capacity as international secretary, Ian spent quite some time in South Africa from late 1993 through to the post-apartheid elections of 1994. Those were exciting times for the international labour movement and Ian worked tirelessly for the ANC. He used to recall that the ANC had a clean sweep everywhereâexcept in the South West Cape where Ian ran the campaign.</para><para>In 1994, Ian left the national secretariat to begin a new career in journalism, first with the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, then the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>and finally as national economic correspondent with ABC Radioâa move viewed by some as `adventurous' because of Ian's long association with the ALP. However, to the great disappointment of not a few Labor Party flacks, Ian's journalistic integrity was ironclad. Put simply: he proved to be a very professional and balanced journalist in both print and radio.</para><para>Ian's unassuming character, his dry, self-deprecating sense of humour and his generosity of spirit made him widely respected and admired in both politics and journalism. It is not common for a Prime Minister to take time in parliament to send good wishes to a former staffer and party official from the other side, but it is a measure of Ian's high standing with those who knew him that, when he first became ill this year, Prime Minister Howard did just that. I know the best wishes of those from all parties in the parliament meant a great deal to Ian's family. Our thoughts and our sympathy are with Ian's parents, Albert and Norma; his partner, Fiona; and his close friend and supporter of many years Margaret Ward. They have endured an extraordinarily difficult six monthsâdifficult beyond beliefâduring Ian's long illness, and they have done so with courage and grace. I consider myself lucky to have known Ian. With his passing we have lost an advocate for a better and fairer nation. We have lost a principled and decent Labor activist and latterly a commentator on Australian politics. We will miss him. Vale, Hendo. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Red Cross</title><title>Environment: Automotive Industry</title><page.no>13854</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Automotive Industry</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>13854</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak tonight on two issues that, while vastly different, relate to the essential principle of local initiative. On July 22, the Ascot-Hamilton branch of the Australian Red Cross held its annual general meeting, and its 54th annual report was delivered by its energetic andâif I may say soâ highly proactive president, Mrs Myra Carter. As all of us here in this chamber know, unless things work at local level they will not workâor at least not as well as they couldâat higher levels. For that reason it is wonderful news that Myra Carter and her Red Cross troops are hard at work in the Ascot-Hamilton area of Brisbane. Branch meetings are held on the fourth Tuesday of each month at St Augustine's hall in Racecourse Road, Hamilton. The rector, Reverend Robert Braun, and the churchwardens give the Red Cross the use of the hall rent free. Myra Carter has been the branch's disaster officerâa post she relinquished on 22 July. The branch manned telephones after the Bali bombing and during the drought appealâin both of which events the Red Cross played a vital and honourable role.</para></talk.start><para>At this point I believe it is appropriate to say something about the Red Cross and Bali. After the terrorist attack there, the Australian Red Cross was, as always, among the first into the field to lend assistance. It set up the Bali Assistance Fund, which, as honourable senators will know, later became the object of some criticism. In May this year the Red Cross asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide an independent audit of the fund. It did this so that the Red Cross could benefit from an objective assessment of its management of the fund and be provided with recommendations on how to improve its processes. The report has now been delivered, and the Australian Red Cross has accepted its findings and will fully implement the recommendations outlined in the report. In a statement issued on 8 August, Secretary-General Martine Letts said the Red Cross hoped the Australian public would accept that it had demonstrated that it was an open, transparent and fully accountable organisation. I do not believe there is anyone who would take any view of the Red Cross other than that it is among the most public-spirited and community-minded of organisations that we could wish for. Its operations rest on those of its branchesâsuch as the Ascot-Hamilton branch in Brisbaneâthroughout the country and around the world.</para><para>Here at home we are so fortunate to live in a safe, lawful and democratic society. The Ascot-Hamilton branch of the Red Cross runs card days, where members have a great deal of fun under the leadership of Mrs Glo Marshall and help to raise the relief funds that are always much needed. There are of course a great many other activities, both locally and more widely, that reflect the Red Cross as a caring and compassionate contributor to human wellbeing. It would be appropriate, in the context of the Ascot-Hamilton branch, to mention some of the people who feature so largely in its affairsâ people who, as a state representative, I have had the pleasure to meet and to enjoy so many good times with. I mentioned Mrs Gloria Marshall. These days she is the patron of the Ascot-Hamilton branch of the Red Cross. For many years she was the president and is now the new deputy president. Mrs Joanne Blakely and Mrs Merryl Suthers are vice-presidents. Mrs Judy Howel is the secretary. Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Stuart is the treasurer of the organisation and a thorough gentleman, as is Brigadier Ian Hunter, who has been a long-term supporter of the Ascot-Hamilton branch and a state president of the Red Cross. I mention also his wife, Rosemary Hunter. Dr Carmel Marshall provides constant assistance and support to her mother and has received a distinguished award, a medal for her great service to the Red Cross. I also mention Dr John and Margaret Campbell. One cannot forget people like Joan Lugg, who is a member of the Floral Art Society of Queensland and puts together the Red Cross Chelsea Flower Show arrangements every year. There are other people to mention who have left this world: the late Bill and Marcia Webber, who did so much for that particular branch of the Red Cross; the late Bob Marshall, husband of Glo Marshall; and the late Canon Bill Carter, husband of today's president, Myra Carter. There are so many good people who have done so much in that community and for the Red Cross as a whole. As with everything, it is the human element that makes an organisation work. The Red Cross worksâas it proved in its immediate response to the Bali tragedyâand because of that we are all better off. </para><para>Local initiative is also important on the environmental front. On 30 July I had the honour of helping to launch in Queensland the national eco-efficiency green stamp program for the automotive industry. This is a modest scheme, and it is all the better for that fact. The more modest a scheme, the easier it is to implement and keep on track. This is a principle of governance that sometimes seems to elude modern administrators. Modest it may be, but it is operating at the workshop level in an industry that, because of the products with which it has to deal and the inescapable residues that result, is right at the forefront of local area environmental management concerns. I believe that it is action at this level that will have the greatest impactâa positive one, of courseâon the lives of most Australians. It is the built environment that most concerns the majority of peopleâor should. It is where we live. We owe it to ourselves, and even more to our children and their children, to eliminate the toxic residues of urban existence.</para><para>The national eco-efficiency green stamp program is a joint initiative in Queensland of the Motor Trades Association of Queensland, as the state affiliate of the Motor Trades Association of Australia, and the Commonwealth, represented by Environment Australia. Environment Australia has provided $50,000 in support for the first year of the program. Program funding assistance from the National Heritage Trust and the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil program has been arranged for a three-year period to develop a national green stamp program. This program will implement improved environmental practice by state coordinators for the national MTA.</para><para>The strategy that has been implemented aims to demonstrate to the community the commitment of motor tradersâa commitment that is ongoingâto the reduction or abatement of their environmental impacts. Eco-efficiency is a concept that links environmental strategy with economic processes to create better management of environmental resources, improved resource efficiency and reduced environmental impacts by using economic strategies. The green stamp program aims to generate an understanding of the range of eco-efficiency and good environmental management initiatives throughout Australia's automotive repair industry on a state and national level. The program will chiefly assist small- to medium-sized businesses meet their legislated requirements and ethically fulfil `beyond compliance' responsibilities related to environmental impacts. </para><para>The green stamp program will be implemented through a range of strategies. These include provision of technical advice and support to business ownersâan essential element of any practical implementation plan. It will provide obligation-free workshop auditing to investigate current environmental practices and suggest improved techniques in environmental protection. It will also provide information resources and media opportunities, and offer guidance on legislation and updated information on industry-related environmental issues via personal and electronic communications. Included in the overall strategy is a plan to develop case studiesâalways a useful resourceâand to collect baseline data on small- to medium-sized motor repair industry current practice. </para><para>This is a very worthwhile initiative which, in Queensland, is being given a great start by the MTAQ, and its Executive Director, Mr Tony Selmes, and his entire executive. In Queensland, the program is coordinated by the MTAQ's environmental officer, Cressida Strang. When I launched that program a few weeks ago, the motor industry of Queensland was represented. What was most impressive about the representation was that it was the ordinary playersâthe little and the big players who make the industry the successful industry that it isâwho were there representing their interests and offering great sense and commitment to the corporate and the public good. I believe, Mr President, that local effort is always worthy of mention in the Senateâthe states' houseâand I am happy to place the remarks I have made tonight on the national record.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rocky Creek War Memorial Park</title><page.no>13856</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13856</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to bring to the Senate information relating to the memorial service that I attended yesterday at the Rocky Creek War Memorial Park. This memorial service was in recognition of the 58th anniversary of VP Dayâthat is, Victory in the Pacific Day. The concept for a memorial park at Rocky Creek was raised when Tim Foley, who is affectionately now known as the `Mayor of Rocky Creek', and Mark Alcock discovered the remnants of the 2nd/6th and the 2nd/2nd Army hospitals in 1992. Realising the significance and historical value of the site, they began clearing much of the area and exposed huge concrete slabs, tent pegs, bottles and rock gardens, which had been left undisturbed for 50 years. Trackback in October 1993 saw the return to the tablelands of many ex-service men and women who had taken part in the celebrations and visited the old camp site.</para></talk.start><para>In 1995âthe year of `Australia Remembers'âthe mayor of Atherton, Mr Jim Chapman, became Chairman of the Victory in the Pacific committee. Through the efforts of this committee a memorial Victory in the Pacific Day was celebrated in 1995. This incorporated the unveiling of a plaque, donated by Myra Jones BEM, formerly Myra Shue, from the 2nd/2nd AGH, in memory of all medical units and personnel who served in the hospitals at Rocky Creek from 1943 to 1945. All Australian Army units that served on the tablelands during World War II were invited to supply plaques, describing the campaigns in which they participated, for the memorial park. Plaques are mounted on a large granite boulder supplied by Wongabel Quarries. This has been an ongoing exercise, with new plaques being unveiled each year on the nearest Sunday to Victory in the Pacific Day. At yesterday's ceremony the total was over 70. </para><para>I will give a little history of the area. In mid-1942 the Army secured War Cabinet approval for a hospital in the area and a commitment of Â£730,000 over three stages was allocated. Why was Rocky Creek chosen? The land was Crown reserve; therefore, no civilian enterprises would have been disrupted by the Army's occupation. However, when plans were being drawn up for the various hospital buildings, it was found necessary to compulsorily obtain leases of adjoining land. There was an excellent permanent and pure water supply nearby at Barney's Springs. The elevation was more than 600 metres and, therefore, out of the range where malaria-carrying mosquitoes can survive. As well, the general area in this vicinity is renowned for having a very equable climate. There was an existing railway siding; railway transport of personnel and supplies, as well as ease of transport for bedridden patients, was of paramount importance. Also, it was serviced by a road in the process of being upgraded to become the Kennedy Highway.</para><para>The 19th Field Ambulance, already in North Queensland, was ordered to prepare a site for a camp hospital at Rocky Creek and moved there on 5 October. The 5th ACHâ that is, the Australian camp hospitalâarrived on 14 October to take over, and the 19th Field Ambulance moved out the following day. During the latter part of 1942 preparations for the establishment of two 1,200-bed hospitals with semipermanent buildings and adequate water and sewerage facilities were proceeding at Rocky Creek. However, facilities on this site were far from ready when the 2nd/2nd ACH arrived on 5 January.</para><para>While at Rocky Creek, the 2nd/2nd ACH was involved in a malaria research program and catered for thousands of troops training and recuperating on the tableland between overseas campaigns. Patients were received from casualty clearing stations operating in New Guinea, and the RAAF began operations from the Mareeba airstrip in mid-1943. From then on, most patients from the battlefields of New Guinea travelled by plane to Mareeba. Occasionally, a sudden influx of patients would result in the normal 1,200-bed capacity of the hospital being extended up to 1,800 beds, with several hundred beds set up in annexes. At such times, all leave for hospital staff was cancelled and normal on-duty hours were extended to cope with the emergency. During January 1944, when the 7th and 9th divisions were engaged in battles on the Huon Peninsula, there were so many new patients expected that a number of the nurses were asked to temporarily give up their mattresses for patients. </para><para>The concept of the Rocky Creek War Memorial came about as a program by the Eacham Historical Society, and the publication that I have was produced by them with support from a considerable number of people in North Queensland. It is timely that we recognise the victory in the Pacific, which was recognised last week, and the 37th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. Back in 1966, on 18 August, as we all know, a relatively small number of Australian Defence Force personnel came into contact with what turned out to be a major force against them, and the battle of Long Tan occurred. In closing, I would like to quote again from the document, because I believe it encapsulates so very well both the pride we have in our Australian forces and the privileges we have today:</para><quote><para>Whilst we move forward as a nation privileged by more than 60 years of peace, we should never forget the sacrifices of the men and women who served to keep Australia free from invasion.

The other two presentations being bacteraemia and pneumonia.  In 2001, there were 512 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 5 years of age, 46 (or approximately 9%) were reported as meningitis.  During this same period five children under five years of age died of invasive pneumococcal disease. Two of these deaths presented as bacteraemia, one presented as invasive pneumonia and two were unknown.  There is no data that confirms the Senators statement that 11% of children will die from pneumococcal meningitis.  There is insufficient data to enable a comparison of fatality rates in children under five between pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases. </para><para>(10)	Yes.</para><para>(11)	The ATAGI has recommended a universal pneumococcal vaccination for children on technical and scientific grounds.  This newly published article supports this recommendation.  The recommendations remains with Government for consideration of future funding in the context of the remaining ATAGI recommendations.  Since 2001, the Government has funded a National Childhood Pneumococcal Vaccination Program for children most at risk of developing pneumococcal disease.  This includes all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under 5 years, all children living in Central Australia under 2 years and all children under 5 years with medical risk factors for developing pneumococcal disease.</para><para>(12)	States and Territories are required to report on a number of performance requirements through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements, the mechanism by which vaccines under the National Immunisation Program are funded.  For the period August 2001 to June 2002, States and Territories indicated that 48,525 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine had been purchased and 40,858 doses distributed under the Childhood Pneumococcal Vaccination Program.  This Program provides vaccine to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under 5 years of age, all children living in Central Australia under 2 years of age, and all children under 5 years of age with medical risk factors.</para><para>(13)	The Commonwealth, including the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH), in partnership with the States and Territories and the National Immunisation Committee (NIC) continues to work to improve the level of uptake of the Childhood Pneumococcal Vaccination Program.</para><para>Data provided by the Northern Territory and Queensland Health Departments at a pneumococcal workshop in 2002 and published in Communicable Diseases Intelligence Vol 27 No 1 April 2003, indicate that the uptake of the program is good.</para><para>In the Northern Territory 96% of the eligible cohort received the first dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 2 months of age.

In northern Queensland 69% of children were fully vaccinated.</para><para>As part of the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs), States and Territories are encouraged to minimise wastage and leakage of vaccines under the National Immunisation Program.  States and Territories implement measures such as education of GPs through the Australian Division of General Practice (ADGP) and linking vaccines supplied to provision of data.</para><para>(14)	Past studies have shown that Indigenous people living in central Australia have the highest rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in the world.</para><para>(15)	Accurate measurement of the true incidence of pneumococcal disease is limited by several factors including the need for the collection of blood cultures, prior administration of antibiotics and the level of notification of isolates from pathology laboratories.  The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) advises that the quality of data on hospitalisation of Indigenous children is only of acceptable quality in the Northern Territory and South Australia.  The Department has been unable to obtain any data on the incidence of disability from invasive pneumococcal disease in Indigenous children.  Details on case fatality rates from invasive pneumococcal disease for 2001 is available from an article in Communicable Diseases Intelligence (Roche P, Krause V. Invasive pneumococcal disease in Australia, 2001. Commun Dis Intell 2002:26).</para><para>(16)	The National Meningococcal C Vaccination Program will run over four years. As a result, an evaluation is planned for the second half of the Program, that is from 2004.  No commencement date has been set for the Program's evaluation.  In the short term, an evaluation of the national awareness campaign will be managed by the Department's Research and Marketing Group.  This will determine the effectiveness of communications with parents and providers. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Agents</title><page.no>13869</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1584)</subtitle><id.no>1584</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13869</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>Can a list be provided of all education agents in China and Korea dealing with student visas to Australia, together with an equivalent list of such education agents and the visa refusal rate for each agent, expressed in both numerical and percentage terms</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13869</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">China</inline></para><para>The Australian Embassy in Beijing has provided a detailed list of education agents in China who deal with student visa applications to Australia.
