Even if the government sees them as machinery bills—and they are more than that—it ought to be getting the bills listed on time. It is a reflection not on the staff of the bureaucracy but on the minister involved that the request has been made to debate these matters without allowing a suitable amount of time for senators to contact constituents and allow the cut-off exemption.

I would like to bring us back to the context of the debate. The Democrat amendments move towards ensuring that the department clearly communicates to those people who find themselves in the situation of having received an overpayment that they need to enter into a process to repay that overpayment. The situation that we generally find, unfortunately, is one that would appear to be somewhat dominated by the department pressuring people to make final and complete settlement of that debt within one calendar month, and certain processes are used to achieve that. They are not, in some cases, limited to having collection agents knock on people's doors. One Nation believes that there is a process that already exists within the department, and this process is set out very clearly. It is that process that I was speaking about last night. </para></talk.start><para>I will refer briefly back to the document that sets out this process. It is a departmental document that is prepared and used by recovery staff in area recovery teams. It is also used by customer services officers in customer service centres, so it is clearly a process that the recovery team is supposed to follow. It is also a document that is available to the departmental staff in their customer service centres for guidance. I will briefly go through the steps that are set out. Step 1 is when an overpayment has been identified. The department is required to put the question: will the customer agree to make a full refund on the due date? If they say yes, they go to the completion statement, which is step 10. However, if the person says no, the department goes to step 2. The step 2 question is: will the customer finalise the account within 14 days of the due date? If the answer is yes, the department is instructed to accept the offer and then go to step 10. If the answer to step 2 is no, the department puts the next question: will the customer make a partial lump sum payment now? If the answer is yes, the department then negotiates a lump sum amount and goes to step 4. If the answer is no, they are advised to ask the customer if they are expecting any money—that is, a tax refund—and, if they are, to include that in the negotiations.</para><para>So the instruction is clearly there already for the department to advise the person that possibly their tax return could be used as part of offsetting this overpayment. If the answer is no, the department is instructed to go to step 4. The question in step 4 is: is it legal to recover this type of account from the customer's current payments? In other words, it refers to the withholding table. That question is put to the person. The next question is: is it possible for the person to repay the overpayment out of the existing payment that they are receiving? Again, if the answer is yes, they move to the next question. If the customer has different types of account, an SSA or an ANTSFA, and they are receiving Abstudy or an AIC payment, withholdings cannot be deducted due to legislative restriction. The department has the information at its fingertips to clearly let these people know.</para><para>In relation to question 4, if it is not possible to recover it from their current payment, the department should move on to step 5. The question in step 5 is: do Centrelink records indicate that the customer has income or investment that could allow them to finalise the account, pay a lump sum or pay more than standard withholdings? Again, if the answer to that is yes, the department is instructed to negotiate an arrangement which takes this information into account. If the customer says no, they do not want to do that, the department is instructed to go to step 6. Step 6 is: advise the customer of the approximate rate of standard withholding and remember to tell them that this may change if their income assets change.</para><para>So they are instructed to advise the person what the approximate rate of withholding would be. If the customer indicates they cannot afford the standard withholdings, the department is instructed to go to step 7. Step 7 is: can the customer afford a withholding rate that will recover the account in three months? Again, if the customer says yes, the department is instructed to go into that process, set it out formally and, when the customer agrees, move to the final step, step 10.</para><para>However, if the answer is that the person cannot do that, the department is instructed to go to step 8. Step 8 is: obtain information about the customer's current financial situation, preferably over the phone. They have a reference there to ask about financial information. They are clearly instructed to ascertain over the phone what the person's current financial state is. If they were to do this, a lot of the problems that we have seen in the past would be resolved. The customer would have the opportunity to tell the department what their particular situation happens to be. </para><para>People are then instructed to go to step 9. Step 9 is: negotiate an arrangement that takes the customer's financial circumstances into consideration and send an OLA or Q246 if required. The instruction to the department is very clear: this whole process should—and I emphasise the word `should'—be done in conjunction with the customer. If the customer's expenses exceed their income and the maximum withholding rate is $10 per fortnight, the next step is: discuss options with the customers, which may include approaching each of their creditors to reduce the amount they pay. The department is instructed to have this discussion with the customer and, if their expenses do currently exceed their incomes, to try to negotiate with whoever their creditors are to slightly reduce those payments to be able to make the restitution back to the department. It is there; it is clear. This is not happening.</para><para>Note 2 under step 9 says: if below standard rate withholdings are negotiated, advise the customer this rate can only be accepted for three months before it will be reviewed again. Again, there is a clear instruction to the department that, if they do enter into this form of repayment that is below the normal amount that would be accepted, the customer should be aware that it is only for that short period, three months, before the process should be gone through again. Finally, step 10 says: record the details on document 22.1 documenting the information. If above standard rate withholds are coded, a manual review should be coded for a future withholding rate review.</para><para>I know that I am putting a rather complex contribution before the committee, but it is complex because it is the process that the department is instructed to follow. I think the majority of senators would concur that this process is not being followed. This is one of the reasons why we are having this debate today. One Nation believes that the Demo-crat amendment will reinforce the necessity for the department to follow this process.</para><para>One of my reasons for going through this quite lengthy explanation of the steps is that, if people cannot access this process anywhere else, in the future they will be able to access it from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. With that in mind, I will seek the indulgence of the chamber to have this photocopied and circulated and, at a point before we complete this debate, I will seek leave to table this document. In closing, One Nation supports the Democrat amendments because they include the process—and I quote:</para><quote><para>Add “including the fair instalment repayment options provided for in section 91; and</para><para>	(fa)	that the person must be offered a choice of the methods of recovery specified in section 82”.</para></quote><para>These are the options that they ought to be given now. They are departmental procedure. I commend the Democrat amendments to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>16269</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As honourable senators know, the family tax benefit is part of the tax system. That is probably one of the issues that has been quite difficult for people who have not been familiar with the tax system, and I can understand that. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, whose employers take money out of their income, very rarely get a return, so they are unlike people who have investments or, at the other end of the scale, who are more familiar with dealing with tax underpayments and having to repay them at the end of the year. We are dealing with a group of people—and most of us pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are in that classification—who do not expect to get a debt. </para></talk.start><para>But as we have said before, and as the shadow minister has said, if a debt has been incurred, it ought to be paid and one of the difficulties which we have to deal with is how we make sure that it gets paid in a way that is appropriate. As I have said, this benefit is part of the tax system. Details of the tax offsetting arrangements have been included in various tax and family assistance office publications since its introduction. These include FTB forms and information products produced since July 2000; the 2003 <inline font-style="italic">TaxPack</inline>; the 2003 FTB tax claim instructions; various communications with tax agents by the ATO, for example tax agent newsletters; a range of family assistance office publications, including the notes attached to the claim form for FTB; maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance; family tax benefit and child-care brochures on estimating your income, reconciliation and the checking process; and in the <inline font-style="italic">More Help for Families</inline> newsletter.</para><para>There are a number of reasons why a debt might not be able to be taken from a customer's tax return—for example, if they have a tax debt. If this is the case, the current debt recovery arrangements for the FTB are flexible. Customers are able to pay their debt off in full, if they can afford to do so. They can repay the debt through withholdings from their fortnightly FTB payments at a rate of either $20 or $40 a fortnight depending on the size of the debt and they can contact Centrelink if, for whatever reason, they are unable to meet these recovery arrangements to arrange a different repayment amount. These options afford customers a great deal of flexibility concerning the repayment of family tax benefit debt.</para><para>The amendments the Democrats are suggesting would simply impose an additional administrative burden with no better outcome for customers. I will make a commitment to look at the notices that go to customers to ensure that these options are clear to them and easily understood. I am hoping to meet with Centrelink customers. I have asked the department to set up some meetings with people who have incurred family tax debt to talk to them first-hand about what we could do, because sometimes people at the grassroots level can make suggestions about what we can do more effectively than those of us who sit around here. I intend to ask people how we could better inform them and, if everything goes well, I hope that process can be started on Friday, or at least next week. It is important for me to meet with clients to talk to them and to look at this issue.</para><para>We are all in agreement that we would prefer people to have money on a weekly basis. In some ways, you would think maybe it would be better to give it to them all at the end so that they have a windfall, but this is about helping families in their day-to-day living. It is an additional $2 billion a year but it is causing grief because it is very difficult for people to estimate their income. There has to be give and take on both sides. We have to be better at entering data, making sure that when a client gives information to Centrelink it is recorded appropriately and that they can get a receipt for it. There is the commitment I made last night to have a look at the possibility of errors in recording that information. I am told it is very small compared to the overpayments that result from people misjudging their income for the year. We have more choices for families to enable them to have different options of part payment and then having a top-up and there are various options to assist them in dealing with the fact that their incomes may vary over the 12-month period. I would be appreciative if any of my colleagues have suggestions from discussions with clients about the way that we can do it, but it is part of the tax system. I do not think we should make it any more complicated for clients but I do believe that we should inform them more fully. </para><para>I note that the proposed amendments do not attempt to change the law as it relates to withholdings from ongoing FTB payments; rather, these amendments could limit the capacity of the family assistance office to enter into an agreed repayment arrangement with the customer. That is another concern I have about the amendments. For those reasons, the government will be opposing them.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>16271</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (R3) and (R4): </para></talk.start><quote><para>(R3)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3C After subsection 77(1)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para>	(1A)	Where a person does not notify the Secretary of a choice in accordance with paragraph (1)(fa) within 10 working days of receipt of notification of the right to make a choice of repayment method, the secretary may determine the method of repayment.</para><para> (R4)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3D Subsection 82(1)</inline></para><para>Before “recoverable”, insert “, subject to the Secretary first offering the person the options outlined in paragraph 77(1)(f),”.</para></quote><para>Before speaking to these amendments, I acknowledge and thank the minister for her contribution and certainly her undertaking to review the situation as she has explained to the chamber.

If there is an opportunity for the Democrats to assist her in that process, we would be delighted to do so.</para><para>I will speak to the amendments before us in reverse order so they make better sense. Amendment (R4) aims to change the balance so that the families involved in these situations are given a choice as to the method of recovery, rather than this remaining at the discretion of the secretary for Family and Community Services. Amendment (R3) provides that a measure be inserted after subsection 77(1) putting a limit on the time people can take to make that choice. That is self-explanatory. There has been some discussion on this already, and I referred to it at some length in my speech during the second reading debate. I seek chamber support for that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>16271</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Democrat amendments (R3) and (R4) seek to alter the schedule of periodic instalments in cases where there is no fraud so that repayments are made at no greater than half the rate at which they were originally paid and are repaid over twice the period over which they were originally paid out.

One Nation is supporting these amendments because, in effect, we would have a person going through a consulting process with the department, which is covered by (R4), and then (R3) binding that person to make the decision within 10 working days. That is a good, sound process. It is one thing to give a person the option to accept a level of payment but, unless we set a time limit by which that person has to make that decision, we could be making things difficult for the department if it is not able to get a completion of that process by the person either accepting or rejecting it. So these two amendments put forward by the Democrats provide for sound procedural processes. One Nation believes that all five of these amendments are necessary both to bring about the process of accountability and to ensure that the department is responsible for the actions that it takes. </para></talk.start><para>I hear what Senator Greig is saying. He is hoping that the government will accept the amendments. One Nation's position is that—sad as we would be to stop it—the bill should not progress unless these amendments are part of it, although we support what the government is setting out to do in extending the time for a person to make an application for a top-up and also allowing 12 months extra for that to be paid. They are very sound and good amendments put forward by the government. But the essence of this whole process to some degree will be lost if we do not insist on having these changes that have been suggested by the Democrats. They will resolve all of the heartache and pressure currently being put on these people. So One Nation commends not only these two amendments but all five amendments. Hopefully they will be passed. I hope that the chamber will insist upon them should they come back from the House of Representatives.

Currently when a family accrue a family assistance debt, often without their knowledge, their tax return may be stripped to recover all or part of the overpayment. All of this occurs without warning to hapless families who have been counting on the money for bills, school fees or other necessary household expenditures. Most do not even know they have a debt, let alone know that it may run into thousands and accrue over many years. The government relies on fine print in the <inline font-style="italic">TaxPack</inline> that says refunds may be used to offset family assistance debts. The truth is that there is not so much as a phone call or a letter before the money is stripped—removed from an individual's tax return. The Ombudsman has called for an end to this practice, or at least a requirement whereby a family assistance debt may not be recovered from a tax return until a subsequent financial year.</para><para>Labor's amendment (1) will ensure that written consent must be obtained from families before debts are recovered from tax returns. This need not be an administrative burden. The consent could be contained in the <inline font-style="italic">TaxPack</inline>, in the annual income estimate forms that families are required to fill out or at the time of an original claim. This amendment will apply only to families who are continuing customers and will give them some choice as to whether debts are recovered directly from tax returns or as a deduction from their future benefits. Labor's amendment (2) will provide some limited discretion for the recovery of debts from tax returns without consent if the secretary is satisfied that the overpayment occurred due to a deliberate misrepresentation of circumstances by the recipient. There is little cost associated with this amendment.</para><para>I note that the new minister has said publicly that she is keen to be more sensitive in the collection of debts. Here is an opportunity for her to show that those words on ABC radio were not empty words. I likewise counsel Nationals senators that the new target voters, Peter and Lindy, are the very people who are getting their tax returns stripped each year under the current system. For this reason I urge all senators to support the amendments circulated by the opposition. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>16274</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendments would only allow tax offsetting to occur where the customer has provided written consent.

But this does not mean that I do not think it appropriate that, as the family tax benefit is part of the tax system, when a person has a repayment due from the tax office any overpayment in their family tax benefit is taken out of that.</para></talk.start><para>As I said in my previous comments, I want to make sure that people are as fully informed as possible but I think that sometimes we are all a bit lax.

It is no secret. It was an original feature of the legislation which went before parliament and it has been clearly articulated. As I have said, a number of communications go out to clients but I want to make sure that we are doing the best we possibly can.

The minister responded that, if passed in their current form, the opposition amendments before the chair would be a cost to revenue of $70 million per annum. When I look at the two amendments, the principal amendment goes to the prior written consent of the person affected and the second amendment is essentially a minor amendment which goes to recovery of moneys where there has been deliberate misrepresentation or omission—that is, fraud. From responses to Senator Vanstone over the last two or three years at estimates, we know the exact quantum of instances of fraud and recovery, and they have nothing to do with that figure of $70 million. As a matter of logic, that means the question of cost to revenue of $70 million arises from ALP amendment (1). My question to the minister is: how is that figure of $70 million calculated? What variables are involved? Would the minister advise us as to when that figure was calculated. It was not advised to the opposition in any of the negotiations in the lead-up to this discussion in the Senate. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>16275</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am just thinking on my feet here.

I do not know—and it would be an administrative cost to do this—whether people should have to sign some form to say that they understand that, if there is an overpayment of their family tax benefit, and if they have a positive in their tax return and the tax office is in debt to them, it could be taken out of their tax refund. That would be an administrative cost. That might be one way of making sure they understand, but it would be an enormous cost. I am just saying that I will have a look at that but I think it could be an enormous administrative task.</para></talk.start><para>The issue with the amendments that the Labor Party have put forward is that there is in administrative cost in the first instance of getting people to sign. There will be some people who will say, `No, I do not want it taken out.' You will then have a situation where the tax office cannot offset the overpayments with the fact that a person is owed a rebate from the tax office from their income tax but has had an overpayment in their family tax benefit. By that person not having that taken out or used to pay their debt, the tax office then has to wear a debt while that person pays it off. There is a public debt interest cost for that because, instead of being able to offset it against the debt that the person has, that person might choose to pay it off. As I have said, they have options; but, even if the option is for $20 or $40, depending on the level of debt, it takes time for that. The Commonwealth wears that debt during that time and there is an interest associated with that debt. We would have money that we would not otherwise have had in our current budget. So the estimate is that it would be about $70 million. You can question that estimate of how many people will sign on to having their tax rebate used to pay back their FTB debt.

There seems to be a bit of doubt. I have here something from Treasury and something from our department, and there seems to be a question about what the 80 per cent is of.

I think it would be better if I get some more detail, because I do not want to mislead the Senate. When we come back on this we can go through it. I am new at this game. This is very detailed. It is a Treasury estimate; it is not an estimate that we did in our department. I will reserve my comment on the previous comment about what it was 80 per cent of, because there seems to be a little bit of disparity between the advice I am being given by Treasury and the advice I am being given by my department. </para></talk.start><para>I can understand that it is quite complicated. It is an assessment. You know and I know that some people choose not to do that. It will be a judgment about how many. But whatever, whoever and however many, there will be a cost. What I am telling you is that there will be a cost somewhere between zero and $70 million, and that is of concern to us. I am not prepared to sign off on amendments that will have the possibility of having an annual cost at that level. There are a lot of other things I could spend that money on for people who are desperately in need.</para><para>We always have to remember that these are people who have received an overpayment because they have not been able to judge what their income is going to be, and they have underestimated their income. They are people who have had more money throughout the year than other people on exactly the same income who have been able to assess their income accurately. We always have to go back to that premise about it being fair. It is tough to ask people to estimate their income, and I am going to look at how we can streamline that—what we can do to assist them. But, short of not giving them money until the end of the year, there will always be situations. You in Labor had it when you had a family allowance, but you did not give them a top-up. If they made an error and got underpaid, they did not get a reconciliation in the positive. At least we have that system, which I think is tremendous. But there is a problem with people who underestimate their income and receive a family benefit over the year that is larger than the benefit someone else receives on a similar income. When they have a rebate in their tax payments, why should they then impose a debt on the Commonwealth—and have it extended—because they have been in receipt of a larger payment than somebody else on the same income? It just does not seem logical to me. It seems that, because it is within the tax system, the important thing is to inform them and help them to better understand how the tax system works and to be more able to predict their income more accurately. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>16278</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for her response.

Under questioning, the minister gave three subsets of that cost of $70 million.

You can guarantee that not 100 per cent of people will choose to offset their FTB overpayment with their tax rebate; there will be a percentage. That is a guesstimate; nobody can know what people will choose. We do not know how many people would choose, if that amendment went through, to not offset their tax rebate against their family tax benefit debt if they had been in receipt of an overpayment. Any number of people will have a cost associated, because the government will have to bear that debt over a longer period of time, because they will be repaying it over time rather than taking a lump sum from their tax rebate. There are estimates—which I will get before we bring this bill back again—and details of how those have been calculated.

The response begs an obvious question. At the beginning of each financial year, every recipient of FTB has to put in a renewal form which states their estimated income for the year, to receive the FTB on a fortnightly basis. My understanding is that each person who submits the form has to sign the form. Would it not be a simple administrative matter to add an extra paragraph or question authorising deductions for the individual from an approved bank account if there should be an overpayment made and a debt created in that period? That way, there would be no additional administrative costs. Alternatively, that paragraph or question could be put into the system when the person first applies for the FTB or the CCB as relevant. It could be at either inception or annual renewal time, if the relevant paragraphs are in the form. If the person signed that, it seems to me that there would be somewhere between zero and minimal additional administrative costs. So to that extent this argument about administrative costs of somewhere between zero and $70 million appears to be somewhat hollow.</para></talk.start><para>I just put that on the table for the minister to perhaps respond to.

Similarly, in this tax system, if I have a tax rebate and I have a tax debt owing from family tax benefits because I underestimated my income, it is a closed system and those two offset each other. It is what happens in the taxation system. When the legislation went through that was quite clear. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We most probably need to explain that more clearly, especially to people—as I have said—who are not used to dealing with the Taxation Office, who have a pay-as-you-earn situation where the right amount is taken out and they rarely have a rebate or anything to pay. They are not dealing with the tax office often because they fill in a tax return and there is no rebate because they have no claims or very small claims and they get a very small rebate. People who are at the other end, who have investments and are dealing with the tax office all the time, understand much more clearly and have much more experience of having a debt because they have not paid all their tax at the end of the year; there is a reconciliation.</para><para>With regard to your suggestion, Senator Bishop, of taking it out of people's bank accounts, I really need to go back and look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because I do not know what you are talking about. I think what you were trying to say to me was that, if this amendment were to get up, in the beginning of the year when they fill in the form that information should be there so they can make a choice. We are opposing it because it is a part of the tax system. People who underestimate their income can receive a tax benefit in excess of what they should have, compared with people on a similar income. If they have a rebate, it means that they, for some reason, have claims—whether they are occupational claims or claims for gifts, donations or whatever. It is part of the tax system, and that should offset the debt that they have incurred in the other part of the tax system. There really ought not to be a choice. That is part of reconciling tax at the end of the year. If those two do not balance out and you still end up with a debt then there are various ways of paying it back.</para><para>If we were to accept your amendment, there would be a cost, over and above the administrative cost, of wearing the debt for a longer period of time. I do not know whether it compounds; I suspect it would compound if they do not pay it back, but I am not a tax expert and I do not pretend to be. I have had to learn to be an expert in a lot of areas, as we all have here. When we come back to debate this again, we will give you the estimates and you can make a guess. You can say: `If it is 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 80 per cent, here are the costs.' It would be somewhere in between those figures. I do not know what it would be; I do not think anybody knows what people would choose to do. You can see what your amendment would cost. The cost is not the prime reason for opposing your amendment, but you need to know that there is a cost involved in your amendment. There are estimates of that cost. You would only know at the end of a 12-month period, when you knew how many people had chosen not to offset their FTB with their tax rebate, how much it would be.</para><para>I do not think that I would want to be in the position of having to live with that. Those people who have money owed to them by the Taxation Office in one system but who owe money to the Taxation Office in another system would cause a cost—and we do not know what that will be—that could be better spent in other areas in a situation where they are getting benefit over and above people on a similar income. We always have to go back to that. We are saying that there are two families with the same level of income: family A have been able to estimate their income for the year, have had the appropriate payments and have no debt at the end, but family B, who for various reasons have not been able to estimate their income and have received more than family A, have to reconcile at the end of the year so that they are treated as fairly as family A in the tax system. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>16282</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Minister, for that lengthy response. Just to make it clear that we are talking about the same thing, I ask the minister to take on notice to ask both the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of the Treasury to provide full details in writing to the committee as to how the figure of $70 million was calculated, what if anything involves a compounding effect as interest accrues from year to year and what part, if any, of the $70 million from year to year takes into account any debts that the Commonwealth might choose to write off from year to year on behalf of consumers. It would be appreciated if the minister could provide that in writing to the committee. If there has been any modelling done on the question of how the figure of up to $70 million was calculated, it would be appreciated if that modelling could also be provided in writing to the committee. I make those requests of the minister.</para></talk.start><para>I will just respond to the point that the minister correctly identified as the central issue in this discussion. The minister put the case that two sets of families are being treated differently: one particular family that have a debt through inadequate, improper or nondisclosure of facts to the department receives a benefit compared with a family that puts in the form correctly, amends it correctly and receives the correct amount from year to year. The minister draws the conclusion that the families are being treated differently and that the Commonwealth has an obligation to recover the differential from the family who were improperly advantaged by the system. That is the core of her debate. It is the core position of the government, of this minister and of the previous minister.</para><para>Our position is that the incursion by the department into future benefits is what we refer to as `stripping', and we regard that as improper because the debt has been created by the system. As far as the opposition is concerned, if a person in this chamber receives income from any means, all of that income should be disclosed and the appropriate amount of tax paid. For example, if I have income from my position as a politician and I also receive dividends from share interests, interest from a bank account or proceeds from the sale of property, that income should be disclosed and the appropriate tax paid. If the income from some or all of those sources is not disclosed, the only avenue that the ATO has to recover unpaid tax is to (1) seek negotiations with me as the taxpayer, (2) issue a notice or (3) if I refuse to pay the debt prosecute me in the appropriate court of law to recover the unpaid tax.</para><para>We are simply saying that, if that process is good enough for persons who have income from property or income from a range of sources and who have fraudulently or improperly taken advantage of the system by not disclosing their income and have incurred a debt and the ATO goes through the system to recover that debt, that process should apply in the social security system.

You can label it as being under the taxation system, but it is a social security payment being made to people who are entitled to receive it. You are seeking to take, essentially, benefits paid under legislation. We say that the system of recovery should be the same as for those who do not pay the appropriate amount of tax on a range of other benefits—that is, through the courts or through the legal system, not by simply plundering future benefits to be paid under the system. That is the rebuttal of the position that the minister put. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16283</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to address a couple of issues that the minister has raised. The first thing is that the minister is focusing on injustice. As she explained, a family with a set income is successful in determining what their income would be, there is no top-up payment to apply for and no overpayment to be repaid, but because there are people who do get it wrong and who do underestimate their income, the minister has said that there is an injustice to the family that was accurate in determining what their income would be. One Nation disagrees with the minister. There is not an injustice, because the family that has incorrectly assessed their income will pay back that money. So the argument of injustice between two families having the same income is not based on the outcome. The second thing is that it was the government that brought in this process of asking people to forward project their income. The amendments that have been successful so far will go a long way to ensuring that, if those people have incorrectly assessed their income, they will be given a series of options on how to pay that back. One Nation believes that is the right process to correct that anomaly.</para></talk.start><para>The other issue that the minister raised was the fact that, if these amendments are passed, we may put in jeopardy people being able to access their lump sum top-up before Christmas. We have the remainder of this sitting week; we have a week in which neither house sits for the departments and the government to assess the amendments; and we come back on the week of 27 October for another sitting week. This would give a reasonable amount of time (a) to assess the amendments and (b) for the government to bring them back to the chamber. That still leaves us eight weeks before Christmas for the department to administer the legislation as amended. I believe Senator Patterson's comment that passing the amendments may jeopardise people's ability to obtain the top-up payment is incorrect. I know that every senator in this chamber would work very diligently with the government to ensure the passage of the legislation as amended should the government be prepared to bring it quickly back through this chamber.</para><para>I believe the amended bill should definitely gain passage through both houses because it achieves what the government is setting out to do. It will allow those people who, unfortunately, were locked out and unable to apply for a top-up payment, if they had actually overestimated their income and not received their full benefit, to be paid. The amendments that have been put through the chamber will make the department far more accountable in the process and in the way in which it makes those assessments. Those people who are unfortunate enough to inaccurately project their income will be given twice the amount of time to repay the debt that they have incurred involuntarily. One Nation commends both the amendments and the eventual amended bill not only to this chamber but also to the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>16283</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to Senator Harris, sometimes things are not as simple as they seem. I have just been advised that, once the legislation has been passed, Centrelink would have to write to all of the 2001-02 FTB customers who received fortnightly payments but who missed out on the top-up because they lodged too late, advising them that they will receive a top-up payment. Similarly, Centrelink would have to write to all customers who lodged lump sum claims with Centrelink for 2001-02 but who were ineligible for payment as they lodged their claims late. The ATO would also have to contact tax agents and accountants, advising them of the proposed changes, and the Australian Taxation Office would work with tax agents and consultative groups to explore other ways of effectively assisting accountants and tax agents. </para></talk.start><para>It might be that the Senate comes back eight weeks before Christmas, but all of this process has to take place. In addition, there have to be systems changes between Centrelink and the ATO put in place, and this cannot occur until the legislation has been passed. So it is not just a simple matter of the legislation going through and therefore tomorrow we will start helping people who were not able to make those claims because they did not lodge their tax returns on time. There is a whole process that has to go on as a result of the legislation. What might seem very simple to Senator Harris is not as simple as it seems.</para><para>The delay, I believe, will mean that people who are entitled to top-ups will not be able to receive them before Christmas. But that is fine—that is what I will tell people when they do not get their top-ups. I will tell them that, because we wanted to address this issue, which did concern us—and the legislation was very positive for people who lodged their tax returns late—now it has become complex and more costly because of these amendments and maybe it will be delayed for a very long time because the amendments do not fit with the concept of its being part of the tax system.</para><para>Senator Bishop said—and I will stand corrected if this is not correct—that someone may say, `I've had an FTB overpayment and I do not want my rebate to pay it off. I may decide to pay it in a lump sum or I may pay it in some other combination, which may be a part lump sum payment.' If in some way they do not do that, then they go to court—just like everyone else who fails to pay their tax if they have underestimated their income for a year. That is basically what happens. If I underestimate my income and squirrel some of it away and the tax office finds out, they will come after me. If I do not want to pay it, Senator Bishop is saying, `Go to court.'</para><para>I think that a whole lot of people who get the family tax benefit will be very interested to know that the Labor Party's policy is not to assist them in paying this debt, not to work with them in using their offset—and that is exactly how it happens if I fail to put in my income tax from last year. I know there was a previous Prime Minister who was very tardy in getting his tax returns in because he was so busy being Prime Minister. Mr Keating did not get his tax returns in. If a person has a rebate one year and in the next year—because he put both tax returns in at the same time—he has a debt, the tax office do not say, `We will give you the rebate for the first year and you can pay off the debt for the second year.' They reconcile it and say, `This is what you owe.' They have not got a choice; they reconcile the tax system.

If that is not what you said, then you had better get up and correct it, because I will remind you constantly that that is the way that the Labor Party would deal with it. The Labor Party's policy is: let people make a choice and when they get into debt we will just chase them through the courts, unlike the treatment for every other person in the tax system where, if they have a credit, it is offset against a debt. This happens to be a debt which they have incurred by, for some reason, not being able to estimate their income correctly and having underestimated it. They have therefore had a benefit all year, which is more than somebody else on the same income has had. You are telling me, `Do not let them offset their tax rebate against that debt and, if they decide not to pay it, we will chase them through the courts.' I do not think that it is an acceptable way to go. It is not the way the tax system works, but if that is your policy I will sing it from the rooftops. Maybe you had better get up and tell me whether it is your policy or not, because I do not think it is the policy that your shadow minister was purporting to put forward. I would be quite surprised if it were. I do not know whether Senator Bishop has discussed it with the shadow minister. I will be quite generous and not go and shout it from the rooftops until I get it clarified but, boy, it seems to me to be a very heavy-handed way of going about it.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>16285</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response, I was simply putting a proposition that people within the taxation system or the social security system be treated the same—that the same rules be applied to the treatment of income, to the disclosure of income and to people within the system to the nondisclosure of income.

Nonetheless, having said that, it is disappointing that, when the opposition amendments were put in good faith and were argued in response the minister initially put the proposition that the reason for the government opposing the amendments was that they were going to cost $70 million.

Nearly all hospitals and health care clinics in Iraq are operating, and more than four million Iraqi children have been inoculated. The coalition has begun modernising the Iraqi health care system, which was below regional standards due to a lack of investment by Saddam's regime. The Iraqi education system is operating, with schools having been reopened and teachers being paid. More than 90 per cent of primary and secondary schools are operating, employing over 220,000 teachers. Twenty universities and 43 technical schools are also open. Electricity supplies are being restored and water production is returning to prewar levels. Overall, law and order is improving. A police recruiting drive is already two-thirds of its way to its target, and courts and prisons are functioning. Progress is also being made in efforts to create a new Iraqi defence force, one which will protect the Iraqi people rather than being used as a tool to oppress them. In fact, the first graduations took place only a few days ago.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The ADF continues to play an important role in rebuilding Iraq.

The Remuneration Tribunal's response to that query was tabled on 9 October.

The current figures for the June quarter show that about 8.6 million people are privately insured. That is 43.4 per cent of the population, which I think is what Senator McLucas said. I do agree with her that I may have confused that figure with a figure in the brief which I had only read about an hour before that question time. I do apologise for the confusion there. For one tranche of citizens the improvement in the level of private health insurance was well over 50 per cent, and I think I did confuse the figure with that massive increase—people who have been targeted by Lifetime Health Cover. This is worth noting, because it is a significant policy achievement of the Howard government to lift the levels of private health insurance cover. We know that Senator McLucas's party has canvassed over recent months the abolition of the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. Senator McLucas has to struggle with her own party's policy there.</para></talk.start><para>We of course have increased the percentage of people in private health insurance from the very low levels under Labor to 43.4 per cent, but amongst certain very important categories of people it is higher. Let me pick up the case of people aged between 31 and 64 who have taken out Lifetime Health Cover. More than half of those people—58 per cent—were aged between 31 and 40; so more than half of the people who have taken out Lifetime Health Cover are in that younger age group. I think that is one of the great achievements of the previous two ministers in this portfolio. Traditionally in Australia and certainly under Labor, when you had a total reliance on the public health system, with all of the weight being put onto the public health system and the queues in public hospitals getting longer and longer—Labor have an ideological opposition to private health insurance and therefore an ideological opposition to the coalition's policy of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate—many young people in that 31 to 40 age group chose simply not to insure.</para><para>If you do as Labor want to do under their spokesmen and the leadership of Mr Crean and return to a situation whereby you put all of the weight and the burden of health in Australia onto the public system, you will end up with the catastrophe we had under Labor when I think Carmen Lawrence was the health minister and the catastrophes we had when I think former Senator Graham Richardson was the health minister. You had the collapse of private health insurance funding and you also had a significant problem with younger people simply not wanting to get involved in insurance. This government's policies have seen a significant improvement in private health insurance. The only risk to that sort of fundamental underpinning of quality health in Australia is the Australian Labor Party's policy, and the Australian Labor Party's policy is of course to do away with the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate in its current form.

Last week I did comment on the final budget outcome for 2002-03. That showed that total government revenue increased by eight per cent over the previous year on the back of very strong company results and total expenditure rose by 3.1 per cent. As finance minister I am pleased to say that this means that total government expenditure is under control, but I regret to say that in relation to one item, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, expenditure is not under control—it is the fastest growing area of Commonwealth government expenditure. Senators will recall that in last year's budget we drew specific attention to the fact that, in the last decade to the year 2000, expenditure on the PBS went from $1.2 billion to no less than $4.2 billion—a growth of 250 per cent over the decade.  </para></talk.start><para>That is why we did introduce what were pretty modest measures in the 2002-03 budget to try to keep some control over the growth in the cost to taxpayers of this fastest growing area of Commonwealth government expenditure. All that we were proposing was a $1 rise in the concessional payment and $6.20 for the general co-payment, which would have saved taxpayers more than $1.1 billion over four years. Of course, the Labor Party, who say no to every sensible reform that we put up, blocked this fairly modest proposal. In other words, their policy is to let the cost of the PBS spiral out of control.</para><para>Now that we have the final result for 2002-03, I can report to the Senate that the total level of expenditure on the PBS last financial year cracked the $5 billion mark. It was $5.06 billion—a growth of 10.3 per cent on the previous year. This means that the government is now in the position of having to find no less than half a billion dollars extra every year to fund the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It has been growing at more than 10 per cent a year every year for the last five years. No government in its right mind can just sit back and say, `That is terrific. We will just let that program grow by 10 per cent a year.' It is unsustainable. If the current rates of growth were to continue, in 13 years time, which is not that far away, we will be spending more on subsidising pharmaceuticals than the Commonwealth will spend on the total education budget for this country—that is, all universities, schools and everything else. We will be spending more just on subsidising pharmaceuticals than on education.</para><para>Any responsible political party has to address this issue. You would think that the opposition would behave as a party that thought that one day they might just get back into government and therefore pay some attention to this serious issue. But, no, they are determined to act like a party that is never going to be in government again and they are simply not interested in finding solutions to these sorts of problems. The Labor Party's blocking of this measure in the Senate already cost taxpayers $299 million last financial year, and for every single day that this measure remains blocked by the Labor Party it is costing taxpayers nearly $1 million. I think that Labor senators do need to understand that, because this is government policy, these savings are factored into the forward estimates.</para><para>If the Labor Party continue to oppose them, they have to explain to the Australian people how they are going to make up the $1.1 billion that is factored into the forward estimates as savings for this measure. The Labor Party cannot run around promising to spend a whole lot of new money without explaining how they are going to pay for this $1.1 billion, which is their policy. It is their policy to continue to let the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme grow at over 10 per cent per annum. It is their policy that the government are going to have to find another half a billion dollars every year to fund this scheme.

All Australians have been touched in some way, no doubt, by the scourge of drugs on young people, particularly in our community. When I was in Vienna at the United Nations Narcotics Control Commission meeting, it was widely recognised that Australia had made great progress in limiting the supply of heroin. We have always said that the Tough on Drugs fight does not only include law enforcement. It also includes education—the education of the next generation of Australians, particularly in relation to the harm of illicit drugs—and health, particularly the rehabilitation of those who already have a problem. This is a three-pronged attack that we have with our Tough on Drugs program, and we have allocated funding accordingly.</para></talk.start><para>We have some great partnerships with those people in the community who are doing great work. I have seen it at Odyssey House in New South Wales, and I have experienced in my own home state of Western Australia, diversionary programs dealing with Palmerston farm and Cyrenian House. In fact the drug court there relies largely on diversionary programs which enjoy Commonwealth funding. That is the extent of our Tough on Drugs approach.</para><para>Senator Greig quite rightly points to the dangers and the emerging threat of amphetamines. There is no question that, worldwide, the use of amphetamines is increasing. I would, though, provide a cautionary note to those who say readily that Australia has the highest rate of abuse of amphetamines in the world. What we have is a very good system of reporting, of data collection and assessment compared with a lot of other countries. So what we have is a reporting situation which details that usage for obvious reasons—so that we can deal with the problem. Not many countries in the world have as advanced a reporting assessment and monitoring of the problem as we do in Australia.</para><para>Having said that, I do not discount for one minute the problem of amphetamines in this community. We have always said the war on drugs will not be won overnight; it will take time. In relation to heroin, we have put some runs on the board. Education and the stemming of the flow of supply have been recognised internationally. The United Nations has recognised that our law enforcement measures have had an impact on the reduction of supply. You see that in the reduction in the rate of overdose deaths. Some states and territories around this country have seen a reduction in the rate of deaths of up to 50 per cent. Why? Because the purity rate has gone down. Why has the purity rate gone down? Because of the lack of supply of heroin. When your cut heroin is down to about 15 per cent, you are less likely to get the overdoses that you get when it is up to 60 per cent, as it was in previous times.</para><para>Having said that, we are not complacent by any means. Tough on Drugs is one of the key priorities of the Howard government. We will continue this fight on the fronts of health, education and law enforcement. It cannot be done just by the national government, either. It has to be done in conjunction with the states and territories and internationally. That is why we have been working at the level of the United Nations, to keep up international efforts in the fight against drugs. This extends across the board: law enforcement, educating of our people—young people particularly—and also rehabilitating those people who have a problem with drugs. That is where we need a comprehensive approach, and we have resourced that accordingly in an unprecedented fashion. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16299</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

That is about eight per cent of all employment in the Pacific island nations.</para><para>Australia has played a very real lead role in getting this convention up and running. We have supported the Pacific island nations in their discussions—what I would call, rather robust discussions—with the distant water fishing nations, the European Union particularly and Japan. We have supplied the Chief Scientist to the technical commission; we have worked to protect the island nations in the management of the fisheries; we have funded a lot of work; and indeed our officials have played a major role. I particularly want to mention here Mr Glenn Hurry and Dr John Kalish, who have had very leading roles. This convention has brought a new sense of unity and regional stability to the Pacific islands. It is important work and it laid the framework for the great success Australia had last week at the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. </para><para>I am asked if I am aware of any alternative policies. In respect of this very important area of fisheries management and support, in an area so critical to Australia, I have to say the answer is, regrettably, no. There is no policy from the ALP at all. There is something out called a discussion paper but, in this discussion paper that masquerades as policy, there is not one word about this important area in the Pacific. In spite of Labor's lack of interest, I am delighted to report that the Howard government has got on with the job of helping our neighbours in the Pacific. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>16301</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Email Services</title><page.no>16301</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>16301</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 13 October, Senator Mackay asked me a question without notice regarding the difficulties that Telstra customers have been experiencing with the provision of BigPond and email services, which have caused delays in the receipt of incoming email.

According to Telstra, the most visible impact has been that users have experienced delays in retrieving e-mail.

I want to say at the outset that really these questions do not go to Senator Alston's behaviour at all. It is not really about Senator Alston. Everyone knows that Senator Alston has resigned as communications minister. Everyone knows that Senator Alston is halfway down the air bridge towards getting on the pointy end of a big jet and heading off for a very plum ambassadorial appointment, and so be it. He is lucky in that regard.</para><para>But it is not about Senator Alston. It is about the Prime Minister's code of conduct. How could it happen again that a minister is caught in yet another imbroglio about shareholdings? Look at the record of the Howard government: you had a parliamentary secretary, former senator Brian Gibson, resign over a related matter on 14 October 1996. You had a former Assistant Treasurer, former senator Jim Short, resign on 14 October 1996. You had Mr Moore, who had $100,000 capital in Bligh Ventures, and he had a ticker in his office when he was the Minister for Defence so that he could follow all the activities on the share market. You had Mr Prosser, who was a former minister for small business, who continued his business through 1997 until he resigned. And then, of course, we had the extraordinary situation in relation to a former resources minister, former senator Parer, who had an undeclared coalmine in his family trust and $2 million of financial interests. He left parliament after the 1998 election.</para><para>How could it happen again? After all these incidents how can it happen that the Prime Minister is unable to fix these sorts of problems? You ask the question: is it acceptable that a minister stands to benefit from a family trust that includes Telstra shares, that bought Telstra shares while the former minister was the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts? Is that acceptable? Surely it should not be acceptable. Surely that is out of bounds under any reading of proper practice. But where is Mr Howard in all of this? This is a self-declared family trust; it is not a blind trust. Did Mr Howard inquire of Senator Alston about these matters when he was sworn in as a minister in over three governments? Did Mr Howard follow up on the material provided now in the public arena by Senator Alston in relation to the two loans he provided to Messen Pty Ltd? I think they were in 1998 and 2003. Did Mr Howard inquire whether the 2003 loan was to top up a margin loan? Where is the rigour? After all the appalling experiences in the Howard government, where is the rigour from Mr Howard and his ministers in relation to these very important matters?</para><para>Is it not time for the Prime Minister to close, once and for all, the loopholes in his own guide to ministerial responsibility? However discredited that guide is, is it not time for him to close the loophole that is the family trust? That is the loophole that allows this sort of share trading in under the radar. That is the sort of thing that gives ministers cover in relation to these sorts of issues. It is simply not good enough. Yes, Senator Alston has resigned. He has left, he is on his way to a plum ambassadorial post, but Mr Howard is left again with the responsibility of cleaning up the mess. He has had ample warning and ample opportunity, and you would think a responsible Prime Minister would have done the job by now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>16304</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister's guidelines are to ensure that there is not a conflict of interest between a minister's public responsibility and his or her personal interests and also to see that there is no perception of such a conflict of interest. Ministers accept that obligation and the Prime Minister rigorously enforces it. So the issue here is whether there is a conflict of interest in the case of Senator Alston. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Alston has put out a statement today explaining the circumstances of the trust to which Senator Faulkner referred. This is really a rather grubby attempt by Labor, I have to say, because the circumstance of this trust arises out of the death of Senator Alston's father. As Senator Faulkner would have seen from the statement that was boxed before question time, and I presume he has, this trust, Messen Pty Ltd, was originally owned and operated by his late father and since his death has been controlled by his mother.</para><para>As disclosed in the Register of Senators' Interests, Senator Alston and other family members, he understands—certainly he but he believes other family members also—are contingent beneficiaries. In other words, there is no specific entitlement to Senator Alston at all. This has been reinforced by a letter from one of the current trustees, Mr John McCormack, a chartered accountant, who says in the letter, which Senator Alston has also put on the public record today:</para><quote><para>Since 1996, Mrs Alston and I have been the only directors and shareholders of Messen Pty Ltd, as the trustee of the Robert Alston Discretionary Trust. Senator Richard Alston, along with his brothers and their families, are contingent beneficiaries of the trust, meaning that they have no specific entitlement to any distribution which is entirely at the discretion of the trustee.</para></quote><para>Senator Faulkner has read these documents and he therefore knows that there is no conflict of interest in this circumstance. Nevertheless, he still decided it was worth having a shot at Senator Alston and in some way detrimentally affecting Senator Alston's reputation. I think that is unfortunate, but it seems to be the way that this carping negative opposition fills in its time.</para><para>Seven and a half years in opposition and the Labor Party has nothing better to do than dredge the gutters in the hope of finding some morsel that might be embarrassing to a member on the other side. Seven and a half years and not a positive policy contribution to offer! Here is an opposition that has done nothing constructive in 2½ terms of opposition and therefore shows that it is in no way deserving of the responsibility of government in the future. It has not learnt a thing from its electoral defeats. All it does is sit on the opposition benches and carp and whinge about the government and, if there is a chance of a personal attack upon a member of the government, then that opportunity is seized.</para><para>What about the hypocrisy of the situation? From the public record you can see that there is no conflict of interest in the case of Senator Alston. But what was the position of the ALP in relation to its former Prime Minister, Mr Keating? When Mr Keating, as Prime Minister, owned a pig farm and borrowed money from the Commonwealth Bank at the same time as he made banking policy, was that a conflict of interest? Of course not, says the Labor Party. Why? Because that was Labor Party business; that was Mr Keating's business. Those are the standards of the ALP. It is part of the reason the ALP is in opposition. It is part of the reason it will stay in opposition for a long period of time. As I said in question time, what the opposition is showing is that it is getting good at being in opposition. It is starting to like the idea of opposition. It sits there dredging the gutters to try to find something to attack people, personally and individually, on the other side and it has not had a constructive comment to offer in seven and a half years. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>16305</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today, together with my colleague Senator Conroy, I asked about aspects of the federal Liberal government's First Home Owners Scheme. This scheme was introduced by the current federal Liberal government as a partial compensation mechanism in respect of the goods and services tax to provide a sum of $7,000 for first home owners. The scheme was established under rules and guidelines set out by the federal Liberal government—rules and guidelines set out by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. Indeed, that was confirmed today in the response by the finance minister, Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer, when he was pressed on this issue. He acknowledged that the guidelines and the rules of operation of the $7,000 first home owners grant are clearly established and are clearly the responsibility of the federal government.</para></talk.start><para>We need to look no further for additional evidence than at the requests made to the Treasurer to exclude millionaires who have been able to access the first home owners grant of $7,000 or to exclude people who buy, by very definition, very expensive properties—$1 million or more in value—from being beneficiaries of this scheme. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made it very clear that the first home owners grant was to be a universal scheme. It was not to be means tested. Those Australians who wanted to be first home owners would all receive the $7,000. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made this very clear time and time again. </para><para>Imagine my shock, and the shock of members of the Labor opposition, and I am sure residents of Victoria, when they picked up a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> today to discover that we have babies and children able to access the $7,000 first home owners grant in Victoria—three babies aged one, a two-year-old, six three-year-olds, nine toddlers aged four, four five-year-olds, 10 children aged between six and nine, and five 10-year-olds. If it was not so serious, the fact that toddlers—some of them not even able to walk or talk—have been able to access the $7,000 first home owners grant would be slightly amusing. It could have its amusing side, but it is very serious. We have here obviously parents who have been able to abuse access to the system by receiving the $7,000 first home owners grant in their children's names. This represents many hundreds of thousands of dollars in the state of Victoria. At the same time as we have people who clearly would have a high income—probably using trust mechanisms to try to hide this sort of scandal and rorting—accessing this scheme for their babies and children, who in some cases cannot walk or talk or even read obviously or sign their name, as Senator Conroy highlighted in the Senate, we have literally hundreds of thousands of Australians—low-income, elderly Australians—struggling to find reasonable accommodation at a reasonable cost.</para><para>The minister, Senator Minchin, made it very clear that the guidelines for this $7,000 grant scheme for first home owners were set by the Commonwealth government. Mr Costello and the Liberal federal government set the rules and here we have clear examples of what anyone would acknowledge is an abuse of the scheme. Labor would like to know how many other minors, toddlers, babies and children have been accessing the scheme throughout the country. If there are 40 children under the age of 10 in Victoria, there are probably hundreds around the country who have been doing the same thing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>16306</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yet again this afternoon we have seen Senator Faulkner practise that low political art at which he is so well practised—that is, on the basis of innuendo and smear, trying to damage the reputation of a respected colleague. I rise in defence of my colleague and friend Senator Richard Alston. I want to put before the Senate those things that Senator Faulkner studiously avoided referring to—that is, the facts.</para></talk.start><para>The questions that came from the opposition during question time concerned Senator Alston's alleged interest in two companies: Messen Pty Ltd and Balmoral Gardens Pty Ltd. The first point to be made is that Senator Alston has no interest in either of those companies. At no relevant time has he been a director of either of those companies and at no relevant time has he been a shareholder of either of those companies. Messen Pty Ltd is the trustee of a discretionary trust and, as Senator Faulkner perhaps would be unaware, the beneficiary of a discretionary trust has no specific or vested interest in any of the property of that trust whatsoever. Senator Alston has been a contingent beneficiary of the discretionary trust held by Messen Pty Ltd and that is the limit. That fact has at all times been disclosed by Senator Alston on the Register of Senators' Interests—at all times disclosed. Senator Alston has not at any time held any vested interest in any company which has a specific interest in Telstra shareholdings. Messen Pty Ltd acquired a parcel of Telstra shares on 17 October 1999 and, as Senator Alston has said on the public record today—and as has been confirmed by his accountant—he was not at any time aware that that company had acquired that shareholding.</para><para>More than 14 months earlier than the first acquisition by Messen of Telstra shares, on 4 August 1998, Senator Alston realised his investment in his own family trust company, Marn Pty Ltd, and he sought professional advice as to how to invest those moneys. This is the professional advice he sought and these are the instructions he gave to his professional adviser, Mr John McCormack of McCormack and Partners, Chartered Accountants. Let me read onto the record what Mr McCormack has said:</para><quote><para>In 1998 Senator Alston advised me that he desired to sell all shares owned by him directly or through his own family trust company, Marn Pty Ltd. None of these shares were in any companies relevant to his portfolio responsibilities. He wanted advice on the most appropriate means of investing at least part of the proceeds in such a way that he would have no knowledge or control over any subsequent investments other than that they were not to be in his area of responsibility. </para><para>Around that time Messen Pty Ltd made a distribution to all of the contingent beneficiaries and I advised him that any moneys that he desired to have invested on his behalf should be made available to Messen with strict instructions that no money should be invested in any companies in any way involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities. We also agreed that any investments made on his behalf should be kept strictly separate from any other investments held by Messen. These arrangements have persisted to the present day. I confirm that none of Senator Alston's investments are or have been in Telstra or any companies relevant to his former portfolio responsibilities.</para></quote><para>Those are the facts. That is the truth. It cannot be denied that this was nothing other than a blind trust and that all relevant interests were fully disclosed by Senator Alston. Any suggestion of a conflict of interest—any suggestion that Senator Alston had control or knowledge inappropriately—is simply false.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>16307</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am glad Senator Brandis, an expert in trusts, made a contribution today.

Messen Pty Ltd is a trustee of an Alston family trust, Robert Alston Discretionary Trust. It is not a blind trust, as Senator Brandis, who should know better, said. This is not a blind trust.

I will read it again just for Senator Lightfoot: `It would not be acceptable for a minister to purchase shares in the name of a spouse or a nominee or a trust.' A number of issues do require clarification, particularly those surrounding the loans provided to Messen Pty Ltd. Senator Alston is quoted as saying that Messen were given strict instructions that `no money should be invested in any company in any way involved in the area of my portfolio responsibilities'. I presume that such strict instructions would have been given in writing. It is difficult to comprehend that strict instructions would have been delivered by way of, say, a phone call or a casual conversation. Would Senator Alston table these `strict instructions'? Would the senator provide copies of any other investment guidelines or restrictions imposed on Messen? Will trustees of Messen Pty Ltd be sacked, given that his strict instructions were ignored? </para><para>Senator Alston has stated that he made loans to Messen `entirely of my own will and not in response to any request by or on behalf of Messen' and, `I was advised that in order to secure my entitlement to the funds, it would be prudent to advance such moneys to Messen by way of a loan,' which he duly did. `At no time were moneys advanced by me by or on behalf of Messen Pty Ltd.' Could the senator please explain who advised him to advance such moneys? What is or was the nature of the relationship between himself and the source of this advice?

In fact, the most recent figures that my office has been able to dig out show that, in July 2001, the average tenure of a parliamentarian was 8.4 years of service; the average tenure of the entire Australian work force was seven years of service. More than that, of the one million jobs created in the last seven years of the Howard government, half of them have been casual.</para><para>There has been a very significant change in community expectations as a result of the increasing casualisation of the work force and the increasing propensity of people to move from job to job. I say this because our scheme—the scheme which all of us are members of—is completely out of touch with community expectations. This was the conclusion of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation headed by Senator Watson when it reported in 1997. The committee said:</para><quote><para>The Committee considers that change to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme is desirable. The scheme is now out of step with superannuation practice in the wider community. There is convincing evidence that it is excessively generous to a small group of retiring parliamentarians.</para></quote><para>It went on to talk about the issue of members of parliament retiring at the age of 55. The committee noted that parliamentarians in the USA, Canada and the UK are not paid their benefits until 50, 55 and 65 respectively. It went on to point out:</para><quote><para>Preserving benefits to a later age could reduce the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer by a substantial margin. The Australian Government Actuary, Mr Craig Thorburn, estimated that the saving could be 20 per cent if the age of access to pensions was increased to 55 years</para></quote><para>Twenty per cent! Given that the actuary says that the cost of the scheme is the equivalent of 70 per cent of the salary of parliamentarians, that is a very significant saving.</para><para>More significantly when you look at it, the government, at about that time, did agree that access to pensions would be denied until age 55 for people elected from 2001 onwards. But what about the 192 MPs elected prior to 2001, including, I might add, myself? At what point are we going to ask that those people elected prior to that date should also be required to preserve their pensions to 55 years of age? It is not as if, when you are first elected to parliament, you are making a contract with the Australian people to be here forever. Every three years, or every six years in this place, you make a new contract with the Australian people, and at that point people should decide on the basis of the entitlements that are there whether it is reasonable to turn up for an election. There has not been any evidence that the parliamentary entitlements are denying people the opportunity to come into parliament. I notice there is a very wealthy merchant banker from Sydney spending an awful lot of time at the moment trying to get a seat in parliament, which would result in a very significant reduction in his income. But that, of course, is being resisted. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—He will put it in a trust!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—Yes, put it in a trust! What we really need to do is recognise that our scheme is out of kilter with and out of range of the expectations of the community as a whole. We have to recognise that the arguments being put up to defend this scheme, particularly those by Senator Minchin in question time, are completely inadequate. It is time that, as parliamentarians, we acknowledge that our scheme has to be changed. The subsidy has to be brought back to a more reasonable level, and access to benefits has to be brought back to a more reasonable age. Rather than having a new set of rules for the 34 MPs who have joined this place since 2001 and having a separate set of rules for the 192 who joined prior to that time, let us acknowledge that each election is a new contract with the Australian people. Let us also acknowledge that the subsidies in our scheme are unfair between parliamentarians in terms of the length of time they are here and, importantly, they are unfair in respect of the rest of the Australian population. It is time we reformed the scheme; it is time we fixed it. I think the report from the Remuneration Tribunal today on resettlement grants gives some indication of the sort of direction we should be taking in separating out the issue of retrenchment on one side from retirement on the other. At that stage we would be on our way to getting a much fairer, more equitable and more workable scheme.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONDOLENCES</title><type>Condolences</type><page.no>16309</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cairns, Hon.

They have gone by many names over the years: idealists and pragmatists, Left and Right, and quite a few less complimentary. Jim Cairns was a fearless and influential advocate of idealism, socialism and revolutionary social change. He was a hero to the Left and, in the time of Gough Whitlam—champion of party and platform reform and attacker of impotent purity—Cairns's defence of principle before politics provided the symmetry that is essential to Labor's stability. Gough himself acknowledged as much when he said on Sunday:</para><quote><para>Jim Cairns brought a nobility to the Labor cause which has never been surpassed. It is a great thing for me that throughout our political careers I had such a colleague, a friend, sometimes a rival, but always a benchmark, in doing the great and good things in the cause of Australia and the Australian Labor Party. </para></quote><para>From his political awakening in the 1940s until his death two days ago, Jim Cairns was passionately and unreservedly committed to a single cause. I do not think it will surprise anyone if I say that, despite his 22 years as a Labor parliamentarian, that cause was not the Australian Labor Party. Important as his time in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party was to us, and important as his influence on Labor was, Cairns's ambition was greater than parliamentary democracy. He fought, and never stopped fighting, for a radical and complete remaking of society. Party politics was merely one of the ways he tried to achieve that. Cairns once said:</para><quote><para>I wear my heart too easily on my sleeve.</para></quote><para>His passionate idealism would come to be regarded as a weakness, but his wholehearted commitment to the struggle for social change was also his greatest strength. He was a man of many paradoxes, convinced that he was both obliged and able to save humanity from itself, yet plagued by self-doubt and reluctant to seek power. Fervent in his convictions, he was on friendly terms with many ideological enemies. Cairns could forge a connection with 100,000 people in a crowd, but he had few intimate friends. Cairns had great faith in human nature, yet seemed to have utterly rejected his own. This coldness and kindness was his profound and central contradiction.</para><para>For 30 years, he accepted that parliamentary democracy was the only road to substantial social change in Australia and he devoted himself to change through and change within the Australian Labor Party. Yet he was a continued opponent of political compromise. After the 1966 federal election, in which Labor was trashed, he wrote in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline>:</para><quote><para>It would be wrong for us to believe that compromise is the road to power ... Unlike football, winning is not all.</para></quote><para>And in the strategy paper for the 1975 budget that he never did deliver, he declared:</para><quote><para>It is far better to be defeated while attempting to implement Labor policies than to be defeated after surrendering them. I do not believe we can win by surrendering these or, if by any chance we did win, that winning would be worthwhile.</para></quote><para>Cairns's commitment to principle and ideals was rooted in his belief that reform of the existing social order was ultimately pointless: capitalism was fundamentally destructive of human virtues and no project of civilising it could succeed.</para><para>Born in 1914, Cairns's early life had a strong influence on both his nature and his politics. His father never returned from World War I. As a child, Cairns was told his father had died. It was not until he was middle-aged that he learnt the truth: James Cairns had abandoned his wife and his son, travelling to Africa at the end of the war and never returning to his family. Cairns's mother, Letty, kept this secret until she died in 1964. The truth came as a shock.</para><para>Gough Whitlam told me this morning about the day Cairns found out about his father. Gough was in question time and Cairns slipped into the chair beside him to say that he had just had a call from Paul Ormonde who, of course, was writing his biography on Cairns, <inline font-style="italic">A Foolish Passionate Man</inline>. Ormonde had discovered the truth about James Cairns surviving World War I. Cairns said to Whitlam, `It makes me understand a lot of things I didn't know.' It explained a visit from a vicar who had offered to assist Cairns's mother receive a war widow's pension. The vicar said, `So you have a war widow's pension, Mrs Cairns?' Letty Cairns responded, `No, I don't.' Cairns's mother said later that afternoon to her son, `I wish people would mind their own business.' It is noteworthy that Cairns told Whitlam this story during question time in the House of Representatives before he mentioned it to another soul. Surely, this says more about the relationship of Whitlam and Cairns than the claims made, some even today, that they were barely on speaking terms during the period of the Whitlam government. </para><para>The other family secret was another legacy of James Cairns. In the early 1920s, Letty discovered that her husband had given her syphilis. Fearful of passing the disease to her son, Letty literally kept the young Jim at arm's length from then on: the only physical contact she would have with him was shaking hands. Not knowing the real reason, Cairns accepted his mother's explanation that this was how `little men' behaved. Her parents, with whom she and Cairns lived, were not demonstrative and so Cairns's upbringing was emotionally restrained and physically distant.</para><para>In 1931, when Cairns was in his final year of school, the bank foreclosed on his grandparents' dairy farm. He endured several demoralising months of unemployment after leaving school until getting work as a junior clerk. In 1935, when Cairns was 20, his mother became too ill to work and the burden of providing for her fell to Cairns. Offered the opportunity to join the police force, he jumped at the chance to leave the ledger books and to earn more money.</para><para>Although he received several commendations and was regarded by superiors as a diligent officer with great potential, Cairns grew disillusioned. He disliked being sent to shadow Japanese and German `enemy aliens' during the early years of World War II and he disliked even more being sent to raid the homes of suspected communists and impound `subversive literature'. As he said in his first speech to the House of Representatives in 1956:</para><quote><para>I think that the nature of the society in which people live has a good deal to do with their quality and the way they behave, and a society in which there is considerable injustice, inequality and oppression ... cannot be a society in which the citizens exhibit all the qualities that please democrats and liberals. And if this is so, it is because of these conditions and not because of any moral fault that some may be able to find in these people.</para></quote><para>This was not a view, of course, that fitted well with the police force of the time.</para><para>Always intellectually curious and always capable of a tremendous amount of work, Cairns undertook studies in economics at Melbourne University part time, impressing his lecturers and tutors. His growing disenchantment with police work erupted in 1944 when he was falsely accused of corruption. Outraged that his integrity could be suspect—a character trait, of course, that persisted throughout his life—Cairns resigned from the police. After a brief time in the Australian Imperial Force, he was invited to apply for a position in the economics department at Melbourne University at the close of the war.</para><para>On campus, Cairns became involved with left-wing causes. Although he would later be accused of communism, in reality Cairns was suspicious of the doctrinaire nature of the CPA and they were suspicious of an ex-copper. Nonetheless, Cairns acquired the radical's badge of honour in this period: his very own ASIO file. Cairns criticised the Labor Party for not being socialist enough. He doubted the ALP's parliamentary and reforming approach could truly change society. These doubts would never leave him. However, he could see no other way to bring about the radical social change he was committed to. He was also attracted to the possibility that parliament might provide him with the opportunity to educate on a larger scale than the lecture hall provided.</para><para>Cairns joined the Labor Party in 1947. Regarded by the Groupers with suspicion as possibly a `fellow traveller', if not an outright communist, he was soon embroiled in the Victorian ALP's bitter internal politics, despite his own distaste for factional brawling. When the split in 1955 brought those tensions into the open and shattered the party, Cairns was preselected to contest the seat of Yarra for Labor, taking on the Grouper candidate Stan Keon. Cairns won after a campaign marked by occasional violent skirmishes. A former prominent diminutive senator assisted the Cairns campaign by hurling the DLP how-to-vote cards into the Yarra River. I am pleased to say they sank.  </para><para>In the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Cairns was noted for his generous personal attitude towards his ideological opponents. He was able to maintain friendly relations with hardline right wingers, even as he opposed much they believed in. Partly this was due to his passionate commitment to freedom of opinion and open debate. In a 1947 article for the Melbourne University Magazine titled `A Road to Full Employment', Cairns had written that a truly socialist society would have `a general willingness to freely inquire into any and all subjects'. </para><para>Partly it was just the way Cairns was. As Tom Uren, his closest friend in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, would later say, Cairns was no good at internal politics because he was `always too nice to the other person'. Cairns himself said only last year:</para><quote><para>If you look for the best in people, you will never be disappointed. If you are aware of the worst, you will never think of anything else.</para></quote><para>Cairns was always looking for the best in people. His commitment to the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign was in part because he saw it as a way to unlock a grassroots empowerment of democratic citizenship that would lead to broader social change. The Moratorium Campaign legitimised public protest in Australia, drawing unprecedented numbers to the streets and proving that mass gatherings could be responsible, peaceful and influential. </para><para>Cairns had been campaigning publicly against the war since the early 1960s, much of the time without support within the party and under attack in the parliament. He addressed hundreds of meetings a year. As the anti-war movement grew, Cairns was its natural leader and his leadership, which has been called both courageous and statesmanlike, was pivotal. Cairns managed to keep protests largely peaceful when both militants on the Left and provocateurs on the Right would have preferred a bloodier outcome. Although the Moratorium Campaign did not evolve into a force for radical social change, as Cairns hoped, its success paved the way for a new view of democratic citizenship in Australia, one where rights and duties extended beyond the ballot box to constant vigilance and activism. This is one of his legacies. </para><para>Another legacy lies in Australia's engagement with Asia. From his early days in parliament, Cairns was an advocate of closer ties with Asia: `We have been willing to put on the clothes of Europe,' he told the House of Representatives in September 1961, `without seeing, first of all, whether they would fit.' Unlike many in the federal parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, Cairns could see past the bogeyman of the `yellow peril' to a region of many different countries and cultures struggling with decolonisation, nationalism and profound economic and social change. He believed it was in Australia's interests, as well as part of our fundamental human duty, to help our neighbours in those struggles rather than recoil in imagined fear. </para><para>Cairns' energy, his commitment and his ability made him one of the dominant figures in the Australian Labor Party in the 1960s. Indeed, he was the only credible alternative leader to Gough Whitlam. When Whitlam resigned the leadership on 19 April 1968 in a dramatic protest against obstruction of his plans to reform the Victorian ALP, Cairns stood against him, despite his dislike of political in-fighting. Cairns distrusted Whitlam's pragmatism and so Cairns, the man who wrote that `winning is not all', took on Gough, the man who said that `only the impotent are pure'. Cairns ran on the slogan `Whose party is this—ours or his?' and received 32 votes to Whitlam's 38—a close result that did much to chasten Whitlam's crash or crash through mentality. It is a measure of Cairns's stature and charisma that he was a serious contender for the leadership of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party against such a formidable opponent as Whitlam and despite factional disadvantage.  </para><para>In 1969 Cairns, his wife Gwen, his son and his daughter-in-law and four guests were brutally bashed by gatecrashers of an ALP fundraiser at his home. There have been many theories about that attack in August 1969, one of the most popular being that it was motivated by Cairns's opposition to the White Australia policy. Cairns and his family, however, have always held that there were no political motivations. `It was nothing more than four or five thugs showing off to their girlfriends,' Cairns later said. Some said, including some of his parliamentary colleagues, that Cairns was never the same after that bashing—a claim hotly denied by Cairns himself, and denied by his friends and family. Undeniably, his recovery took months and he was plagued with savage headaches for years afterwards. </para><para>By the time Labor came to power in 1972, Cairns had lost his faith in parliamentary democratic reform. With such low expectations, he was pleasantly surprised by how much the Whitlam government achieved. The simplistic summary of Cairns is to say that his radicalism suited him more to opposition than to government. This judgment is not justified by his performance as Minister for Overseas Trade or Minister for Secondary Industry, where he showed great capacity for compromise and moderation. It is perhaps justified by his performance as Treasurer. Like many others whose families had suffered dreadfully in the Great Depression, Cairns was deeply and emotionally committed to full employment. Embroiled in a personal crisis over his employment of, and involvement with, Junie Morosi, he was not able to master the new demands of an economy in stagflation.</para><para>Perhaps Cairns never really did understand that other people were not as eager to see only the best in him as he was to ignore the worst in them. Perhaps he was simply and unforgivably politically naive. He was certainly surprised and hurt by the media firestorm that erupted over Junie Morosi and over the loans affair. As John Hurst wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> at the time:</para><quote><para>He desperately wants to believe that other people are or can be as thoughtful, as charitable as he has tried to be ...</para></quote><para>These scandals and the perception that the Treasurer had lost his grasp on the economy were more than the staggering Whitlam government could sustain. Whitlam sacked his Treasurer and soon after axed Cairns from the ministry altogether.</para><para>Although Cairns stayed in parliament after the defeat of 1975, he was more and more preoccupied with his research into psychological and personal development as the key to social change and played little role in either the party or the parliament. His interest in the alternative lifestyle made it easy for enemies to mock him. Disillusioned with the possibility of creating a new social order through parliamentary means, Cairns was seeking other tools for social transformation. However, he became disheartened by the lack of interest most adherents to the counter-culture showed in general and genuine social change by the mid-1980s. </para><para>Cairns became a familiar figure around the Melbourne markets, selling his many books from a streetside table and taking the opportunity to engage passers-by in conversation and debate. This too was easy to mock, but Cairns saw it as a final—although he was aware that it was probably also futile—effort to change people's minds and move Australia perhaps a little closer to the utopian society he had first dimly envisaged as a teenager in the Depression years.</para><para>Gough Whitlam on Sunday spoke of Cairns's nobility. I think there is perhaps something a little noble in a former Deputy Prime Minister, a man in his eighties and increasingly frail, braving public indifference and occasional scorn for the chance of changing just one mind, for the chance of striking just one more blow in his lifelong battle. Jim Cairns was amply equipped with moral courage and he was almost immune to criticism. Though subjected to many fierce and vitriolic attacks in his career from without—and sometimes within—the Labor Party, he did not flinch.</para><para>Cairns's wife of more than 60 years, Gwen, died in 2000, the same year Cairns was made a life member of the Victorian ALP. He was deeply bereaved by her loss. Their son Philip predeceased them both. Cairns is survived by his son Barry. We extend our sympathy to Barry, his family and of course Jim's friends. Jim Cairns had the courage of his convictions, and we are diminished by his loss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>16315</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate relating to the passing of Dr Jim Cairns.

Jim Cairns lived a life that, as is quite clear from Senator Faulkner's contribution, was quite extraordinary. To many people it was an inspirational life. It spanned a range of careers. As Senator Faulkner outlined, Jim Cairns had been employed as a clerk and a police officer, had served in the military and had been an economics professor. He was a long-term member of parliament, a minister and, at stages, an acting Prime Minister of this country. As well, he was a self-described peacenik from the Vietnam War until his death. It is worth pondering occasionally what Australian history would have been today had three or four members of the Labor caucus voted differently in the late sixties on who the federal ALP parliamentary leader would be. I am not sure that any of us can predict what it would have been, but I think we can be sure it would have been different. </para></talk.start><para>Jim Cairns was raised as the only child of a sole parent and, from a relatively young age, he cared for an invalid mother. His wife, Gwen, who I understand was also known as Katie, was also a sole parent when he met her at the 1938 Empire Games in Sydney. She passed away a few years ago after a marriage of six decades in which she worked beside him, campaigned for him and marched with him. In paying tribute to Jim Cairns's life, I think that, with an association and a union like that over so many years, and with such support on those issues, in many ways these are also tributes to his wife's contribution to Australian society.</para><para>Dr Cairns's son Barry has described his father's greatest contributions to Australia as his `vitality' in the Whitlam government, his organisation and leadership of the anti-Vietnam War moratoriums and his respect for people from all walks of life. As part of that I would like to associate the Australian Democrats' initial leader, Don Chipp, with our comments today and link that to the fact that Jim Cairns did have respect for people across all walks of life. I am a bit young to remember much about Jim Cairns. The Whitlam government was terminated when I was only 13 and I really have only the vaguest recollections of the Vietnam War moratoriums. Therefore, virtually all of my understanding of Dr Jim Cairns's involvement is based on other people's perceptions and viewpoints of history. </para><para>When I asked Don Chipp if he had any views that he wanted to contribute to this speech, he said he did want himself associated with the Democrats' condolences. He has also spoken to the media himself in recent days paying tribute to Jim Cairns. They did serve in parliament at around the same time for close on 20 years but, of course, on different sides of the chamber. Indeed, Don Chipp had also been taught economics by Jim Cairns at Melbourne University in the 1950s, which may confirm some of the Liberals' suspicions about some of the Democrats' views on economics and where we got them from.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—Or where you didn't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—That it is very harsh. Jim Cairns retired from parliament after 22 years, in 1977, which was the year the Democrats were founded and were first voted into parliament. After Dr Cairns left parliament, over 25 years ago now, he remained an activist for a further full quarter of a century, writing, talking, protesting and organising on many social issues. Don Chipp spoke of often seeing Dr Cairns at the Melbourne markets, where he sold copies of his many books and was always available to have a hearty political debate with the public.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>Jim Cairns was a strong critic of the Liberal government's support of the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Don Chipp realised he had been wrong in his support for the war as part of the Liberal government at that time, and later admitted as much. Of course, few Liberal politicians of the time were prepared to do so, although, according to Don Chipp, in private many had quite strong concerns. I fear that that is probably not too dissimilar to the situation we have witnessed recently, when the entire coalition stood silent while the Prime Minister took us to war.</para><para>Jim Cairns argued that the reasons given at the time for the US and Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War were completely false and were based on misleading information, inaccurate details and misrepresentations to the Australian people, which, unfortunately, has had a bit of a familiar ring in recent times as well. He pointed to the tremendous human and long-term costs and cruelty of that war. His lifelong commitment to the peace movement included not just a commitment to the struggle against the Vietnam War but also speaking out against future wars as well.</para><para>In his early days as a politician, in the mid-1950s, in a newspaper interview Jim Cairns said:</para><quote><para>The peaceful must be heard against the nationalist and the militarist.</para></quote><para>For much of the 1960s, defiance of the National Service Act was confined to a small number of conscientious objectors who were routinely dismissed as ratbags. By the decade's end the situation was different. There were sit-ins, draft card burnings and large campaigns to encourage young men not to register for the draft—although I am sure that some people still insisted on dismissing them as ratbags. This civil dissent was defended and indeed promoted by Jim Cairns, who argued that the conventional expectation that people should `accept what governments do and should not much object' was an emasculated version of democracy. In arguing for the freedom to break the law according to an individual's informed moral conscience, he did put forward caveats that there must be no claim for the use of violence, that those who broke the law must be prepared to accept the consequences of their acts and that defiance ought not be specious or reckless.</para><para>In many ways Jim Cairns was well ahead of his time in examining the meaning of democratic participation and how it could be more effective. That is an ongoing challenge still facing many of us. He gave numerous speeches at universities, and there is little doubt that he was and will forever be seen as a leader of a protest movement that contributed significantly to building public opposition to the Vietnam War and to the success of the campaign that finally brought Labor and Gough Whitlam to power in 1972.</para><para>From 1970, Cairns led major protests against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, clogging capital city streets with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. He led 100,000 protesters against the Vietnam War down Melbourne's Bourke Street, finishing with a 12-minute sit-in. He was very much a peaceful peace activist—something that the peace movement today very much needs to continually remind itself of the importance of. He described being very concerned about the possibility of violence on the day of the first rally in 1970. He said:</para><quote><para>... and suddenly as I walked out into Bourke St, I saw the whole city was open to us and it was just a complete transformation of everything. People exuded peace and good nature. There was no violence there at all.</para></quote><para>Again, I think it is a great tribute in many ways that the even larger marches that occurred earlier this year prior to the war on Iraq had a similar atmosphere of peace, of good nature and of goodwill, despite the strong concerns that people had about what the country was about to get involved in. </para><para>The Vietnam marches were the largest marches Australia had seen and the lack of violence was in part attributed to Cairns's unique cooperation with the Victorian police force. Of course, he himself had experience as a police person earlier in his career. He effectively forged new ground by winning the right—and I suggest the respectability—to hold mass demonstrations, despite vehement opposition and vitriol from opponents in the community and in the parliament. This was not, of course, the end of his commitment to the peace movement. In the early 1990s he was active in opposing the Gulf War and, when an even greater number of Melburnians marched in February this year, this time against the war in Iraq, Jim Cairns was there again in his wheelchair. As I understand it, it was his last public appearance.</para><para>He was a man who was, and will remain, part of Australian history and, in paying tribute to him, we can and should learn a lot from that history. As others have said, he was admired for his actions as Acting Prime Minister when Cyclone Tracey struck Darwin in December 1974. Many spoke of him at times as an alternative Prime Minister and, as has been mentioned, he came very close to becoming at least opposition leader in 1968.</para><para>In 1995 the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper revealed documents about former US President Richard Nixon ordering a review 20 years earlier—in 1975—of the US-Australian alliance because of what the US administration saw as anti-US sentiment in the Whitlam government, particularly by the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Cairns. Twenty years later, Jim Cairns wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of the events of that period. He said:</para><quote><para>There was nothing unusual or unexpected in the apparently secret report of President Richard Nixon involving the US and the CIA in Australian affairs. Countries that consider themselves to be great powers always involve themselves in the affairs of other countries.</para></quote><para>Cairns indeed stated that he believed differences of views on security were one of the main reasons for Whitlam's dismissal. When Cairns was Acting Prime Minister, according to what he wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in 1995, he said that the then Governor-General, John Kerr, had visited him at Kirribilli and, in what he described as a long, rambling conversation, told him that the Whitlam government could not last at least in part because of security reasons—something that Jim Cairns said he then passed on to Whitlam.</para><para>In what might be seen as a prescient comment, even for 1995, Cairns went on to note:</para><quote><para>US and other security concerns have lessened with the end of the Vietnam and Cold Wars, but they are always there and will come back again ...</para></quote><para>Aside from his peace activism, Jim Cairns pursued other causes. He was an early opponent of the White Australia Policy and a supporter of closer ties with Asia. As a minister from 1972, his initial portfolios were Industry and Overseas Trade, where he championed opening links with China. He dismissed the idea of the level playing field as nonsense, always pointing to the gap between rich and poor and the power of the rich. He argued against economic rationalism and condemned economics that had no room for human values. He became increasingly interested in the effects that unbridled materialism was having on social connectedness, particularly on young people, suggesting that the next frontier of social progress depended on how we as a society nurtured our children. Given his own experience as a child, which Senator Faulkner outlined, no doubt he felt some special insights into that. </para><para>In his life post parliament he did many things, not least, of course—as has been mentioned—writing many books and seeking to sell them at markets in Melbourne. Being a supporter of peaceful protests, he was surprised to be thrown out of a Pauline Hanson One Nation meeting in 1997 for handing out leaflets arguing against racism. He is quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>It was the first time in 50 years that I had been handled physically by a member of the police force. </para></quote><para>In 1998, he lent his support to the Maritime Union of Australia's campaign against the introduction of non-union labour on the docks, and last year he supported a newspaper advertisement criticising the government's proposed new antiterrorist laws. He always felt Australia was more in danger of democratic lassitude than of a descent into lawlessness. As I mentioned, it is probably fitting that his last major public appearance was in a peaceful, popular and extremely well-attended protest against the Iraq war. As the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has acknowledged, he was a great warrior for genuinely left-wing causes. His biographer described him as `the conscience of the nation' and a `keeper of the faith'.</para><para>He was indeed an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life—a contradictory person, as Senator Faulkner said. He was once asked by a journalist if he was spiritual, an atheist or an agnostic, and he replied: `No, I don't want any labels, none at all.' Whilst he might not have wanted labels, I do not think he was ever able to avoid them. I am sure that now, on his death more than ever, he will be given lots of labels—some that have been mentioned, such as naive and idealistic. I have spoken myself a number of times about a little bit of naivety probably being an essential, if occasionally unhelpful, component of life in politics. Idealism, again, is one of those things that people continually try to balance with the desirability of achieving results. Maybe some of his naivety was because of the characteristic that has been mentioned, of his always looking for the best in people rather than expecting the worst. I think the labels that are most likely to be widely used in relation to Jim Cairns, even from people who are of very different political persuasions to him, are passionate, genuine and committed throughout his life to making social progress wherever possible. I think those are the sorts of labels that all of us would be keen and pleased to have attached to us and the work we have done when our time has finished.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>16319</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, rise to pay tribute to Dr James Ford Cairns. Pierre Elliot Trudeau, a former Prime Minister of Canada, claimed that his chief recreation was reading the reasonings of senior judicial decisions of his own country, from the American high court, from the Privy Council and from the high courts of other countries. He relaxed when he read the logic. If that was true of Pierre Elliot Trudeau then it could be said that the life of Jim Cairns, who was not a lawyer but an economic historian, would suggest that he, too, found a sense of joy and pleasure in reading history, in understanding economic history, in reading social commentary, in understanding what makes societies tick, in coming to grips with the role of citizens in a society and in a parliamentary democracy, in reading political thought—modern, at the time, particularly socialist political thought—and in trying to make a political contribution, as a citizen, to his country.</para></talk.start><para>He was, I believe, a fascinating individual. Cairns, at the time I first met him—and only then briefly and not since—was the towering political figure of his time. He did articulate the issues of the age. He inspired a generation of Australians and I believe remains the benchmark for many of us now. In embodying his time and his era, he was a mild but compelling figure. He was someone who understood, I believe, the importance of reaching a fundamental analysis of what the problems in society were, trying to lay them out comprehensively yet lucidly. In the era that he was a dominant political figure in Australia he made a massive contribution. </para><para>It was a tumultuous time for Australia and for the world. It was a time of war—of the Vietnam War. It was a time of a massive protest movement, not only here but in the United States—the movement in the United States gathering on the back of a civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. It was a time of sexual liberation and of new generations finding new relationships with one another. It was the time of rock-and-roll and the youth culture. At that time, Cairns stood as a towering figure. Later in life he became a sadder—at least from my perspective—and somewhat more flawed person. But it does not detract in the slightest from the impact he made on Australia in the period of the Vietnam War and the protest movement that he led. It is not necessary to agree with all of Dr Jim Cairns's views to hold those opinions that I have just uttered. I do not agree with all that he articulated, but I do think that the contribution he made to this country cannot be denied, and his significance as a symbol for his era cannot be gainsaid.</para><para>Cairns left school at a young age. He left school in difficult circumstances. He got educated by joining the police force and by taking some of the rewards of his athletic ability. He is an example of an educated person from the working class who ordinarily would not have had an opportunity to obtain higher education but achieved it through his own diligence and through his own efforts. It is not surprising, therefore, that he saw education as a way of liberating many people from the drudgeries of what would otherwise have been their lot, and to encourage people to realise their full potential by having an equal opportunity to educational access.</para><para>He became, as has been said in the fine speeches that have commemorated him here this afternoon, an Acting Prime Minister, a Deputy Prime Minister, and a Treasurer of this country, and a minister for trade. As a former minister for trade, might I acknowledge the role he played in opening up new markets for Australia, markets that are now among our most important. He led the inaugural trade mission to China, and China now is one of our biggest export destinations, continues to grow apace, and is responsible for the jobs of about five to 10 per cent of all Australians, given the demand for the products and the commodities that that market has. Cairns was the one that from a trade point of view, following on the heels of Whitlam from a political point of view, opened that market and laid the foundations for us to achieve that type of economic growth.</para><para>I freely and fondly admit that he, more than any other figure at the time, influenced my interest in politics. I remember the occasion that I met him. It was in the seventies, at a teach-in at Adelaide University on the war in Vietnam. It was, of course, the question of the time. He presented to that teach-in a rather long but always fascinating exposition of the issues in Vietnam—the historic development of the country, the occupancy by the French, the war of national liberation to throw off the yoke of French colonialism and how the Communist movement had taken over the national liberation movement. But he was always careful to make the point—which is the fundamental analytical truth, I think, of the Vietnam War—that it was not a war of dominoes ever descending in an expansionist Communist push throughout South-East Asia; it was, in its essence, a war of national liberation and a war in which the people of Vietnam backed those who fought hardest for their liberation. </para><para>He painstakingly stumped the country, relying on logic, relying on history, relying on reasoned argument and relying not only on a recognition of the correct points in the opposing argument but also on presenting the whole point of the case. As a consequence—more than any other single person, I believe—he provided the intellectual basis for opposition to the war in Vietnam, which ultimately led to the election of the Labor government in 1972. When he started on that process it was not a popular thing within the Labor Party to do. But, in the duumvirate of the first few days of the new Labor government, it was the popular thing for the Whitlam government to bring home the troops and end conscription. He was not a man for slogans; he was a man for reasoned argument. He was a man who believed in listening to the point of view of others and then dealing logically with their case.</para><para>One wonders what Cairns, if he were a member of the parliament of Australia today, would make of issues like the children overboard case and the question of where the weapons of mass destruction are. One wonders what contribution he would make to the debate about unilateral military force as opposed to multilateralism. One does not have to wonder too much, because his earlier life is a template for how he would have dealt with those issues. I think it is fair to say that, while he was an intellectual, he was an intellectual who above everything else respected and venerated the rights of individual Australians. He was a man of the parliamentary system, but one who believed that the people were, in fact, the true rulers of the country. He encouraged argument, to invite the people to participate in the political debate, thus making the democracy stronger. He believed in protest if, at the end of the debate, there was still outrage unanswered that needed to be protested against. It was from that point of view that he gained prominence. He led millions of Australians in the Vietnam moratorium.</para><para>Early in his political career he was attacked in a parliamentary speech. Being the sort of person he was, he went away and sat up all night reading the report that was the subject of the attack and all the other documents, and came into the parliament the next day and demolished the arguments that were used against him. The gallery at the time was amazed that someone had the diligence and the capacity to so thoroughly research an issue and then deal with it so effectively and politically the following day. It is the sort of parliamentary contribution that this chamber and this parliament should encourage. That is the Jim Cairns I remember and that is the Jim Cairns I pay tribute to. I pay tribute to him and to his surviving family. I pay tribute to his wife and to his son, who is also deceased.</para><para>In his later life, he ventured on a journey of discovering his inner self and faded from public view. He was derided over his relationship with Junie Morosi and his statement of `a kind of love'. I think this was a sadder era of Cairns's life, but one in which he obviously achieved much greater personal fulfilment than he may have achieved in his political activism. However, taken as a whole, while flawed, this was and remains a magnificent Australian life, and I am happy to join others in this chamber who have paid tribute to it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>16321</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Dr Jim Cairns was one of the giant figures of post-war Australian politics. He was a bigger figure than many who served as Leader of the Opposition. He was a bigger figure than some who served as Prime Minister. He published more books, I think, than any other Australian political figure—more even than Sir Paul Hasluck—and he had more biographies written of him in his life than any other Australian political leader. He was that rare thing in Australian politics: an intellectual. At the same time he was that even rarer thing, albeit very briefly in the late 1960s: a politician who was a popular hero. </para></talk.start><para>I have read a lot of what Dr Jim Cairns wrote and I can think of hardly a single word he wrote or uttered that I did not disagree with. And yet I admired him. I actually met Dr Cairns once, in Canberra in January 1973. I was a schoolboy, and one of my relatives had just been sworn in as a minister in the Whitlam government. My mother and I went to visit him in his office and, lo and behold, Dr Cairns—then the minister for overseas trade—arrived unannounced. I remember being presented to him by my cousin and being impressed by his modesty and his gentlemanliness. When Harold Macmillan went to Washington in April 1961 to visit the newly elected President Kennedy, he was asked on his return to Britain by one of his friends what Washington was like under the new Kennedy administration. He replied, `Rather like a pleasant northern Italian city shortly after it has been taken over by the Borgias.' That is what I suspect Canberra was somewhat like in January 1973 with the arrival of the Whitlam government.</para><para>Why is it that the news of the death of this man—this fearless advocate of ideas which increasingly through his life were shown to be patently absurd; this apologist for some of the bloodthirstiest dictatorships that mankind has ever seen; this person who, as a minister, showed an appalling lack of judgment rarely equalled in the annals of Australian politics; this man who, as other senators have said, in his later years became rather a sad figure, retreating into mysticism and benign eccentricity—was greeted this week with sadness from I think all sides of politics? It cannot have been anything to do with the ideas that he held. Perhaps it was to do with the way in which he conducted himself as a public man.</para><para>I believe Jim Cairns was one of the great romantic figures—one of the few romantic figures—of Australian political history. As a romantic figure, he could have walked straight off the pages of Rousseau. He was the Australian equivalent of the sort of politician whom in the United Kingdom we recognise in Michael Foot and Tony Benn. In the United States he bears comparison with Henry Wallace and perhaps with Eugene McCarthy. He was a man who, although as I say in my view was wrong about almost everything he said, nevertheless had many very fine qualities which lent his political career dignity and, with the news of his death, have vested his memory with respect. He was, as others have said, a conviction politician—and that is a quality which in these days of synthetic, dispassionate and managerialist politics looks more and more attractive, if more and more antique. He was a person who had integrity. He was a person who, as others have said, conducted his public life with moral courage. As I have noted before, he was a person graced with a civility and decency in the way in which he conducted himself as a public man—albeit saying the most absurd things—which many of us today would do well to emulate.</para><para>When I think about Dr Cairns, the remark that comes most readily to mind is the famous one of President Theodore Roosevelt about the man in the arena. No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President, you have heard many times President Roosevelt's celebration of the man in the arena. He said:</para><quote><para>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who shows how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood ... who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who if he succeeds knows the triumph of high achievement, and who ... if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat. </para></quote><para>That was the character of politician I think Dr Jim Cairns was.</para><para>But, in celebrating his life and paying tribute to his public conduct, we should never make the mistake of confusing sincerity and integrity of purpose with wise policy and good outcomes. Sincerity is never its own justification, and the conviction with which beliefs are held is no guarantee of their rightness. Indeed, if it were otherwise, all the great fanatics in history would be validated. I think it can be said in defence of Dr Cairns that he never crossed the boundaries of fanaticism; he was merely a man who was wrong. Yet although he was wrong, he erred while daring greatly on behalf of beliefs which he sincerely held. So today, as we celebrate his life, a life which I believe demonstrated a certain nobility of purpose in pursuing the career we as members of parliament all share, we can celebrate a noble spirit while giving thanks that the ideas on which he spent his life never came to pass.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16323</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Let me say from the outset that I am not here in the sort of sadness that Senator Brandis just spoke about; I am here to celebrate and be happy for the life of somebody who dared to be different and who dared to wear his heart on his sleeve. Politics is unfortunately about getting up the ladder and treading on the fingers of other people, and those who are least sensitive about that and most able to do it tend to get to the top. This is the great dilemma for politics: we have to end that. We have to get people who do have heart, who do have sensitivity, and we have to have a humanness and a recognition that this little planet we live on—this earth—is the only one we have. These were concepts that Jim Cairns had but that are far too rare in those on the other side and, I suspect, in the last speaker.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brandis said that the problem with Jim Cairns was to do with the way that he conducted himself as a man. I suppose it is a problem if you are open. I suppose it is a problem if you have affairs of the heart and everybody is prying to know the details and you decide not to give in to that—in other words, the hypocrisy of society does not do you in. I suppose it is also a problem for Senator Brandis that Jim Cairns went for mysticism and benign eccentricity. Yet he would be the first to get on his feet if I were to move again to do away with the benign eccentricity of the performance that we have at the start of every Senate sitting where we pray to God—and a Christian one at that, excluding all other faiths, let alone agnosticism and atheism—to save us from being awful to other people and then immediately get into it in the way that we have just heard from Senator Brandis. I would celebrate the mysticism and benign eccentricity of Jim Cairns rather than some of the other forms of mysticism and malign eccentricity that we sometimes come across in life, and that includes in parliament.</para><para>Yes, Jim Cairns was a turbulent character because he was open to the world as it happened not only outside his own personal domain but also within his own life. Life is a struggle. Life is complicated. Life is an infinitely complex process of dealing with not only the battle between good and evil but also the reason why we are here, where we are going to and what we can do best while we are here. Jim Cairns struggled with that. He made mistakes and he knew that. But the spectre of this man as an old man never losing faith in humanity, selling his books at the markets, speaks of an optimism in the goodness that there is in humanity. As Senator Faulkner said, the wish just to convert one other person, to give them courage to be themselves and to let their own complicated but inherent design of how the world should be a better place come out, bespeaks an optimism in humanity that is too often missing in the short-term, myopic and maligned point of view that we hear put forward in the halls of power everywhere. </para><para>I bless Jim Cairns for his role in advocating through the Vietnam War not only against violence and invasion but also for the peoples of the world to recognise our brothers and sisters around this planet as living human beings just like us and never allow distance or the tyranny of political debate to let us forget that. In fact, Jim Cairns was a holistic globaliser because he understood that we have to live together as a community in peace and live with this planet as if we valued it. If only in this world of market fundamentalism that sort of spirit could prevail. </para><para>It is because of Jim Cairns that many people hold their spirit in our great democracy for a better world in the future. His influence is on the whole of our society, in its own small way, and on many individuals like me who might not be here if were not for his sort of example—flawed, but uplifting—way back, decades ago, when people like me were struggling with our own concept of wanting the world to be a good place but seeing it overwhelmed by the powers that be, taking it in a direction which is not sustainable into the future.</para><para>When I think of Jim Cairns, I think of Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi and Martin Luther King. None of those people lived perfect lives—personal lives, sexual lives—but all of them have left a great legacy beyond themselves for the whole of humanity.

I think Senator Faulkner's speech stands out. I commend Senator Brown for the generosity of his remarks and I agree with the thrust of what he has said. It strikes me that it is never an easy business to be considered the conscience of any political party, but that was the difficult role that Jim Cairns filled, in Victoria especially and for Labor more generally, in those defining years before the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. He represented the wing of the labour movement that highlighted the politics of principle, the politics of compassion and the politics of commitment to the socialist objective. He was part of the great balancing force in the party which, at the time, was criticised by many for its plain preoccupation with pragmatism and opportunism.</para></talk.start><para>It is an irony that a man who was often said to be uninterested in electoral politics was so influential in building a huge constituency for Labor during the late sixties by winning to Labor's banner hundreds of thousands of people who were interested in social reform, which saw tremendous growth in Labor's vote in 1969 and of course ultimate victory in 1972. It was a remarkable achievement that Jim Cairns was able to be a consummate parliamentarian and, more especially, such an effective organiser throughout the political arena on a broader level.</para><para>Anyone who reads the history of the Victorian ALP following the split will acknowledge the role Jim Cairns played in rebuilding the Labor Party in those difficult years. He made a contribution to the labour movement and to the ALP during the 1950s and the 1960s which, in many ways, has been obscured by the public discussion of his work in the period after 1975. Take for example the federal seat of Yarra, which was based in the inner east, particularly in the suburb of Richmond. It was one of the great prizes in the bitter fight between the ALP and the anticommunist Labor Party, the DLP, following the split in 1955. Held by the grouper Stan Keon, Yarra was a seat the ALP had to regain if it were to avoid another dent in its electoral credibility. </para><para>Jim Cairns was preselected from a field of 10. He won a bitter campaign. The campaign was assisted by many activists from the Victorian branch of the ALP who would later gain political prominence in their own right, including Clyde Holding and John Button, both later federal Labor ministers. It is also interesting to note that those three men came to represent the three streams that made up the post-1970 ALP in Victoria: the SL, Labor Unity and the independents. My reading of the history at the time suggests to me that Jim Cairns's preselection was not without its detractors. Pat Kenneally, a noted operator himself, observed that it was remarkable the Richmond branch of the ALP accepted Cairns, remarking:</para><quote><para>... strangely well, when you consider it was someone who didn't live in the electorate, an ex-policeman, academic—it could hardly have been worse.</para></quote><para>He won because he was such a clean skin, a good organiser and so committed to honesty in politics, which were very strong assets in Richmond at a time when politics were characterised by all the opposite attributes. He succeeded where many expected him to fail only because he was able to articulate a vision of the Labor Party which was more in keeping with the ideals and traditions on which the Labor Party was founded. Through the seat of Yarra he was able to build a springboard for party renewal. It was a testament to his skills, both as an advocate for political ideals and as an organiser.</para><para>Jim Cairns was born in Drummond Street in Carlton in October 1914, a stone's throw from the Melbourne Trades Hall, the scene of many of his political battles in later years. When he was nine years old he moved with his mother to a dairy farm purchased by his grandparents outside Sunbury, which was then a village on the road to Bendigo. Jim Cairns grew up in a household that supported the Labor Party. His family were particular admirers of the radical MP Reg Pollard, who had won a seat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly a little earlier and who went on to have a distinguished career in the federal parliament. Shortly before leaving Sunbury state school in 1928 he was presented by the school principal, somewhat prophetically, with a copy of William Morris's utopian socialist novel <inline font-style="italic">News From</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Nowhere</inline>, with the advice:</para><quote><para>I was already a socialist. I had no choice but to continue to be one, and therefore I had better be a competent one.</para></quote><para>Works like those from William Morris proved highly appropriate because Jim Cairns lived his political life in that same spirit. While he was never completely convinced by Marxism—he was never a communist, whatever his detractors argued—Jim Cairns was an ethical socialist to whom compassion for humanity and its betterment was a more convincing argument for socialism than the rigours of economic determinism. His socialism drew on an instinctive belief in human equality and social justice and a passionate belief in the innate goodness of humanity. As a consequence, in so many matters of international affairs and social justice he was a politician well ahead of his time. He was often derided for the opinions he held, but I think he has been vindicated in so many ways by history. It is a pity that Senator Brandis is not able to appreciate some of that. I note in today's press that Malcolm Fraser acknowledges that Jim Cairns was right on the Vietnam War. </para><para>Jim Cairns was not a politician in the conventional sense because he was able to acknowledge that politics extends way beyond the parliamentary process itself. He was not afraid to stand up for views which he knew to be unpopular or to be in a distinct minority. This was characteristic of his entire political life. He drew upon his experience of the Depression as a source for his social radicalism. His first employment as a child was chopping wood. He later worked unpaid in an unsuccessful radio shop in Preston and then as a policeman, a job he obtained in the depths of the Depression after the intervention of Sir Thomas Blamey. It was not a job that I think suited him well; however, it was one he held until 1944 when he enlisted in the AIF although, as the war ended, he was not shipped overseas.</para><para>Jim Cairns's activities at the University of Melbourne, like so many ex-servicemen, led to a reawakening in him and a reopening of opportunities. He had a distinguished academic career and later attended Oxford, where he studied under G.D.H. Cole. He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in economic history. His radicalism dates particularly from these postwar years. At the University of Melbourne he became a prominent member of the Labor club, a flourishing socialist society that produced many of the figures of great public and intellectual significance to this nation. Jim Cairns is to be numbered amongst the best of them. Although critical of the conservatism of the Labor Party, he joined in 1947, seeing it as the most effective vehicle for political action in this country. At the same time he became a member of the re-established Victorian Fabian Society.</para><para>It was shortly before his departure for Oxford in 1951 that he became active within the party, immobilising opposition to Menzies' plan to ban the Communist Party. Although a critic of the Communist Party, he defended its right to exist. It was a principled position, vindicated by history and by the Australian electorate when Menzies' final attempt to suppress that organisation was rejected.</para><para>That in itself has lessons for us all. It precipitated quite a serious divide within the Labor Party. Members were ranged against each other. It was a campaign that some felt was useless, was fraught with danger and would ultimately lead to failure. It was a view challenged by those that said there was overwhelming public support for Menzies' position. It was during a time of cold war and, in fact, a time of hot war—that is, the Korean War. It was a time when many felt keeping true to principles was very difficult. Jim Cairns did that. It was a time when keeping true to principles in fact preserved one of the great principles of our society—that is, the right to dissent. It was quite clearly an example which Jim Cairns learned from in his political life. The lessons learned during that campaign were to be applied in equal effect in that generation during the Vietnam War, because a similar pattern emerged about people's perception of the prospect of failure in that campaign.</para><para>Jim Cairns was a man who, during the fifties, was able to front up to the great dangers facing the Labor Party. It was a period when the Labor Party was exiled from federal office, as it was in many of the states. It was during these years that he demonstrated a mastery of a wide range of interests and, unlike so many other politicians, he was willing to put principles to the test. He was never uncritical of the ALP. He appreciated its complexities and its foibles, but my reading of the situation was that he had an innate understanding of its potential as a vehicle for social change. </para><para>His policy interests and contributions were wide, including many fields of economics as well as trade and human rights. His commitment also found expression in heartfelt and sustained campaigns against racism, the White Australia Policy and anti-colonialism. In terms of our perceptions today, he was demonstrated to be correct in all of these beliefs. They led to his involvement in the anti-Vietnam campaign and the moratorium movement, which will be forever linked to Jim Cairns. He emerged as a national figure. He stepped up his campaign for a more radical agenda within the Labor Party. It has to be remembered that, in 1968, he came within a few votes of defeating that great Labor figure, Gough Whitlam, for the leadership of the federal Labor Party.</para><para>Jim Cairns was an inspiration for people such as me. I can recall that, as a student in Victoria at the time, it was his public presentation of the issues around Vietnam that led to my direct political involvement through the moratorium movement. He encouraged many people like me to see the value of the Labor Party as a vehicle for social transformation. Throughout these years, his primary powers as an advocate and organiser were used to great effect and were of great benefit to this nation. It was during these years that Jim Cairns was at the height of his political powers and was a major mobiliser of Labor's 1972 victory. He was the heartbeat of the nation's ambition and idealism.</para><para>The federal intervention in the Victorian branch in 1970 presents another side of Jim Cairns's politics and demonstrates one of his erratic positions. He was never convinced of the validity of intervention. Nevertheless, he served briefly on the transitional advisory council in the interests of party unity. When the Socialist Left was formed in Victoria in the wake of intervention, it was Jim Cairns who was a founding member. In fact, I am advised by a person who was actually at the meeting—a member who is employed in my office at the moment, Andrew Reeves, whose father was one of the co-convenors at the time—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—He was actually at the meeting?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—He was actually at the meeting—that Jim Cairns was the first name on the list of signatories in support of the formation of the Socialist Left in Victoria. He remains one of the great Labor leaders of the past half century. Jim Cairns has left an indelible impression on Australian society. His record of achievement ought to be acknowledged, even though it is derided in some quarters. His work in the Whitlam government has been much underrepresented. His work as trade minister and as Deputy Prime Minister, particularly during the period following Cyclone Tracy, has not been properly acknowledged. His work in the Treasury has been a matter of some public discussion, and I think it led to his final disillusionment with the political process through the parliamentary system. Jim Cairns's contribution to Australia ought to be acknowledged. I support this resolution because I think that Jim Cairns was one of the truly great Australians of the last 50 years.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16327</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make a few brief comments to recognise the passing of former Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns.

We were there, whether we remember most of it or not. I certainly recall that, when I joined the ALP in 1967 at the age of 15—when I was old enough to join and my father took me along to the Cronulla branch meeting—the ALP was in some degree of turmoil following the landslide defeat in 1966 in the famous election on the Vietnam War. Labor lost that election but was ultimately proved to be correct. At that time, Jim Cairns was the leader of the Left nationally and, for many of us on the Right, he was regarded as the enemy. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Indeed, during the leadership challenge in 1968 I vividly recall attending meetings of the Cronulla branch where we were passing resolutions supporting Gough Whitlam and condemning Jim Cairns and, only three miles up the road in the Caringbah branch, Senator Arthur Gietzelt's branch, they were passing resolutions condemning Whitlam—some-body who probably should have been expelled—and actively supporting Jim Cairns's challenge. We all know the result of the ballot, but that is how intensely these issues were fought out in the party at that time.</para><para>Events moved on. Whitlam was elected. Those of us who participated in the moratorium marches recognised that Jim Cairns was the leader of that movement. I can recall, when I first joined in 1967, being taken along to meetings in some rather drab halls in the shire—to attend, on one occasion, a meeting addressed by Jim Cairns about the Vietnam War and to watch some pretty grainy black and white film of the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Many of us were rather sceptical about Jim's position at the time. There were people in the Labor Party who still thought that the Vietnam commitment may have been right. But Jim Cairns increasingly convinced those in the party and then those in the nation that our commitment was wrong. I was proud to march, as a student, in the moratoriums.</para><para>In 1974, I had become the President of the Young Labor association in the Cronulla-Sutherland area, and we thought we would try and do something to assist the election campaign for the double dissolution in 1974. So we thought, `Let's invite a speaker out to a campaign meeting,' since the Young Labor association was getting involved, particularly to support the then member for Cook, Ray Thorburn. We approached a few people and eventually Jim Cairns agreed to speak at a public meeting. I have to tell you, that sent a bit of a shiver through some people, because they were a bit concerned that something provocative might be said. Jim came out, addressed the meeting—I think there were well over 200 people—and was well received. We regarded it as a great contribution that we had made to get Jim out to the shire to speak to the faithful.</para><para>A lot has been said about Jim Cairns and what happened in his later life. I can recall, in 1974, when Cyclone Tracy hit—I think Gough was overseas and Jim was Acting Prime Minister. If, at that time, there had been a poll of the Australian people as to who should be the Prime Minister, Jim probably would have won it. At that very difficult time for the people of Darwin, he led the nation with great skill and we saw Jim Cairns come to the fore as a politician and as a political leader. Whatever else is said, his leadership during that huge natural disaster was fantastic.</para><para>In conclusion, the ALP has a great capacity to recognise and honour its leaders, whatever their failings. Certainly, we should do that. Both in this parliament and, I know, in our party, we will continue to honour the contribution made by Jim Cairns.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I ask honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their assent to the motion. </para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INSURANCE: MEDICAL INDEMNITY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>16329</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>16329</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>16329</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to respond to a return to order made yesterday, following a motion moved by Senator Evans, that, as the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, I table certain documents by 5 p.m. today. The documents requested by the Senate are documents held by the Australian Government Actuary relating to its calculations of the incurred but not reported—IBNR—levy, following the collapse of the medical defence organisation United Medical Protection, including the formula used to calculate the estimated unfunded liabilities for IBNR claims.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to make a brief comment about the breadth of the order and the context in which it has been made. Recent press reports have suggested that the Australian Government Actuary, in providing advice about the IBNR levy of UMP to the Minister for Health and Ageing in accordance with the Medical Indemnity Act 2002, failed to take account of state and territory tort law reforms. The Australian Government Actuary assures me, and Mr David Lombe, provisional liquidator of UMP/AMIL, also assures me that the figures provided by UMP and calculated by its actuary incorporated allowance for tort law reforms and included the New South Wales legislation that had been enacted at that date—that is, the Health Care Liability Act 2001 and the Civil Liability Act 2002—and the New South Wales visiting medical officers initiative, whereby the New South Wales state government indemnified doctors for public work in public hospitals.</para><para>Next, the wording of the order wrongly implies that the Australian Government Actuary was responsible for calculating the IBNR levy. There have been claims that the IBNR levy was based on dodgy maths and involved flawed calculations. In fact, it was not and is not the role of the Australian Government Actuary to calculate the levy. Under the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002, the IBNR levy is based on a percentage of the annual membership subscription for each doctor. For the year commencing 2000-01 the basic percentage, set in the act and agreed to by parliament, was 50 per cent. That was what was used. The Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002 provides for the levy rate to be varied by regulation as appropriate from time to time. This feature of the act was included because it was clearly understood that, over time, the actual experience of the IBNR scheme could be different from the assumed experience of the scheme; therefore, over time, flexibility in the levy rate might be needed to ensure that the exact amount of IBNR levy would be collected.</para><para>As for the breadth of the Senate order, it requires a search by the Australian Government Actuary of his files and his contacts with third parties who may have provided information to or have had an interest in the information held by the Australian Government Actuary. As you will appreciate, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, some of the information contained on the Australian Government Actuary's files that fits the description of documents requested could be—and is likely to be—highly sensitive commercial data. There may also be other valid reasons that might go against the production of it.</para><para>The Australian Government Actuary is reviewing his files and is contacting third parties as quickly as possible, but all this cannot be done by today. It is hard to believe that the notice is pressed, given the suspension of the levy and the review into medical indemnity recently announced. I have already received a letter from Mr Lombe, the provisional liquidator for UMP/AMIL, indicating that information of the kind that may fall into the Senate's order is strictly commercial-in-confidence and the release of the documents could irrevocably damage recapitalisation of UMP/AMIL. </para><para>UMP/AMIL is the largest provider of medical indemnity insurance in Australia and, as Senator Evans would know, the company has been in provisional liquidation since it encountered serious financial difficulties last year. For the past 18 months, the company, with the assistance of a guarantee from the government, has been working to recapitalise and to get itself back onto a commercial footing so it can continue to provide medical indemnity insurance to its approximately 20,000-strong doctor membership. When the Australian Government Actuary has had a reasonable opportunity to review his files and to seek comments about relevant material from third parties, I will be in a position to consider the material and to respond as may be appropriate to the Senate's order.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>16330</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—The response we have had today from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, is totally unsatisfactory. In summary, she said: `No, we're not going to give you the information from the Government Actuary.' That is effectively what she has said, and that is totally unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. UMP, the private insurance company that was responsible for public liability for medical practitioners—mainly in the state of New South Wales, although not exclusively—collapsed, and the federal government responded with an attempted bail-out to cover the difficulties of medical practitioners who were supposedly insured by UMP. That involved a taxpayer funded initiative of some tens of millions of dollars or more over a number of years—`a guarantee from the government', as Senator Coonan admitted.</para></talk.start><para>One of the central issues in the current dispute between the government and some medical practitioners and their organisation, the AMA, is the levy that the government proposes to charge medical practitioners for public liability insurance. To ensure that the levy is struck correctly, the government has to have received advice from the Australian Government Actuary on the amount of the levy. The minister seeks to rely on UMP, the private insurance public liability company, which is a bit like arguing that we should rely on HIH for accurate information with respect to insurance in this country. The estimates of UMP, whether they were accurate or not, would need to have been checked by the Australian Government Actuary for the government's levy to have been struck. Through my colleague Senator Evans, Labor has sought the calculations that were carried out by the Australian Government Actuary. If the government wants to give us UMP's calculations, that is fine, but the Labor Party wants the calculations of the Australian Government Actuary. The Australian Government Actuary, through the minister, is responsible to parliament—to the Senate. It is quite a reasonable request to seek the file information from the Australian Government Actuary.</para><para>Unfortunately the Australian Government Actuary is not an independent statutory authority in this country, which it is in the United Kingdom, where this sort of information would be publicly available. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and claim that the checking of the information and the documentation that the Australian Government Actuary has carried out is commercial-in-confidence. That is not good enough, because the issue of the levy to be applied to medical practitioners is central to this government's mishandling of so many aspects of our Australian health system. No-one could deny that the dispute about the levy to be struck on medical practitioners is based on verification by the Australian Government Actuary, yet this government is covering up and will not produce the documentation from the Australian Government Actuary. </para><para>This is yet another example of this government's total mishandling of the health system in this country. The files are available, and the minister has confirmed that the Australian Government Actuary has carried out verification checks of the figures provided by UMP. It involves a significant public dispute—some would say a strike by some medical practitioners—because of the levy. It involves significant funding from the government—at least tens of millions of dollars by way of public subsidy—and therefore the minister should have to come in here and produce the appropriate documentation, removing all the wrapping and the verbiage. This minister, very arrogantly, is saying to the Senate: `We will not produce it. No, you can't have the figures from the Australian Government Actuary because they're commercial-in-confidence.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—That is rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—That is right: it is just rubbish to claim that when there is such a significant issue of public policy affecting thousands of doctors in this country and their patients. The minister, Senator Coonan, was keen to release information about doctors' incomes some weeks ago; we did not seek that information. It is not good enough. The Labor Party will continue to press this issue because we want to see what the Australian Government Actuary concluded in terms of the basis of the figures that needed to be calculated. We want to see it. It is another cover-up by this government, on the run, trying to hold together a failing public health system in this country and, I would certainly contend, trying to deliberately wreck the health system in this country. This information should be provided for the Senate and for the parliament, and for the public in order for it to make an informed judgment about how these figures have been calculated. We will continue to pursue this issue because it is an important matter of public policy and an important issue of the expenditure of public funds.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>16331</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I do not want to go into the detail of the specifics of the order and the minister's reasons for not complying with it. I think Senator Sherry has already done that relatively well. Suffice it to say that the Democrats do not fully accept the minister's rationale. I think the use of commercial-in-confidence is becoming one of the cheapest and flimsiest excuses for secrecy across a range of areas of public importance and public interest. It is another example of why the Senate and the parliament really need to do more to prevent such a feeble excuse being used to prevent information being made publicly available. The Democrats have made some efforts in that regard and have had some initial successes but clearly, as this latest refusal by the minister shows, there is plenty more to be done.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to comment a little more broadly on this being the latest in what is becoming a very long line of government refusals to comply with orders of the Senate. This government's record of secrecy and of covering up information would have to be unparalleled, I would suggest, in Australian political history. The number of non-compliances with returns to order undoubtedly is the largest number of any government in Australian political history. My understanding is that the current tally is now at 30—it may be one or two either side—returns to order that have not been complied with. They have been either fully ignored or only partially complied with. That is well over half the number of orders that have been made by the Senate for the production of documents. Again, that failure rate of over 50 per cent would easily be the highest in Australian political history. It shows that despite all the government's attempts in recent months to portray the Senate as being obstructionist what we have here is a government that is being obstructionist. It is obstructing the Senate from doing significant aspects of its business by preventing it from getting access to information to enable it to make informed decisions and preventing it from ensuring that important information is in the public arena so we have more informed public debate. It is something that really needs to be addressed. </para><para>I have said this a number of times before. Perhaps the greater the number of times I say we are going to do something about it and we do not, the more likely the government is to not take us seriously. I do again suggest to the Senate that we need to look at ways to more effectively ensure that the government complies with returns to order that the Senate puts forward. There are some possible hints in the standing orders, which I am not necessarily recommending but using to highlight that the Senate itself, when it framed its standing orders more than 100 years ago, clearly had the view that an order of the Senate is a significant resolution. It is not just something that we toss aside and say, `We might like to have a look at this; maybe we can have a look at that.' It is a formal resolution of the Senate ordering the production and tabling of documents. It is not an insignificant thing. That is why 30 refusals to comply is a major problem and a major slap in the face to the Senate's authority. That is why a failure rate of over 50 per cent is so significant.</para><para>If you look at some examples in standing orders, you can see that under standing order 203 if a senator wilfully and persistently obstructs the business of the Senate the President may report to the Senate that the senator has committed an offence and the senator can then be removed from the chamber. I am not quite sure how we would do that with the entire government if all the frontbench are persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the Senate, but it does raise the question of that standing order perhaps being inadequate. My attention is drawn, occasionally wistfully but I assure people not seriously, to standing order 206, which says:</para><quote><para>If a senator wilfully disobeys an order of the Senate, that senator may be ordered to attend the Senate and may be taken into custody.</para></quote><para>I hasten to add that I am not seriously suggesting that but I read it out to emphasise that the Senate clearly has in the past thought that complying with orders of the Senate is fairly significant and should not be taken lightly—otherwise I presume it would not have agreed to adopt standing orders that had the potential to have senators taken into custody. It may be a bit difficult to operate the Senate effectively if we have every minister taken into custody. I know Senator Coonan seems to get sent in a lot of the time to provide these explanations for other ministers, so perhaps they are trying to make us focus on her and get her taken away. Certainly we could not take all of the ministerial frontbench of the Senate away and continue to have things operating effectively, and I would not for a second seriously suggest that.</para><para>Not complying with returns to order is a serious matter and that is the point I make. We do need to look at ways to address that issue that are not so draconian as one might infer from the standing orders but do nonetheless prevent what I would suggest is becoming an epidemic of cover-up, secrecy and lack of respect for the institution of the Senate. I am sure all senators across all sides would not like to see it become a habit. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>16333</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—A petition has been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreements</title><page.no>16333</page.no><no.signed>2</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5F4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Calvert</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>As a citizen of Australia I question the government's right to sign this agreement without a full and open discussion and vote in our Australian Parliament.

The budget announcement in May was that excise would be introduced for alternative fuels starting in 2008 and that industry would pay the same amount as for petrol and diesel based on the equivalence of their calorific value. This came as something of a surprise to the Democrats, as it did to the alternative fuels industry—a surprise because the Prime Minister and Minister Truss, to name just two in the ministry, gave ironclad guarantees that this would not happen. Prior to the last election, Minister Truss wrote a letter to the biofuels industry groups saying that the industry would not incur excise for 10 years. He said:</para><quote><para>... I can confirm on behalf of the government that, as stated in the `Biofuels for Cleaner Transport' policy, the current exemption of fuel ethanol from the $0.38 per litre excise on petroleum products will be maintained and a capital grants scheme will be in place by July 2002. </para></quote><para>That letter was in fact presented to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Energy Credits (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme bills last week. Either that decision to impose the excise was made in ignorance—certainly in arrogance—or it was a wilful move to get rid of alternative fuels in this country, because that is precisely what will happen. An excise of between 23c and 25c per litre will make alternative fuels uncompetitive. Liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, would be in the strongest position, having built up $3.2 billion worth of infrastructure and a strong market over 20 years, and it could perhaps wear a small excise of around 8c per litre, but an excise of 20c, 23c or 25c would close the sector for business entirely.  </para><para>Already, the largest manufacturer of alternative fuel components in the country has been put under administration because orders dropped by 50 per cent post budget. The government has absolutely no modelling to show us that the industry would be able to survive after 2008 or 2012, when the full rate of excise kicks in. We in this place are supposed to have a blind faith in the market that this will happen. The proposal takes absolutely no account of the investment or the time frame required to develop an alternative transport fuel sector. The petrol industry has economies of scale and infrastructure that have been built up over 100 years, during which time there was of course no competition with other players.</para><para>Despite its great advantages, consumers will not take up alternative fuels while the infrastructure is not in place and without price incentives in place to do so. If you want an LPG car, you have to pay more for it, so the payback matters absolutely. At present, you need three years of high use before it is a paying proposition. Shove an excise on LPG and there is no payback—there is also no industry. Currently, we have 16,000 taxis on the road using LPG and over half a million vehicles altogether on that fuel and they will change to petrol. There will be no remote area LPG use for home heating, cooking or for rural industry. It will be prohibitively expensive, if it is available at all. If you do not have the transport system in place, then you do not have home heating on LPG.. </para><para>If you want to drive a compressed natural gas car, as I did until recently, you will find there is little or no access to refuelling. The federal government's program for infrastructure is totally inadequate at $7 million, and no-one is interested in taking it up. We have over 500 or so years of natural gas reserves. We could be more self-sufficient in transport fuel if CNG and LNG were serious players in our transport mix. CNG and ethanol are likely to be the forerunners to the hydrogen infrastructure that will be coming further down the track.</para><para>This decision went against the Prime Minister's much-vaunted target of 350 megalitres of ethanol production in 2010, which would have provided, by his own account, an estimated 1,100 new permanent jobs in rural areas. But it will not happen. Some $7 million has been invested by Dalby, CSR and Multiplex in projects that, since the budget decision, are on hold. They will never proceed if the excise is put on ethanol as planned. Gunnedah and Manildra will not develop their ethanol production and distribution. The decision went against the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme that was supposed to provide price incentives and funding for conversion of the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleaner fuels. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>16342</page.no><name role="metadata">Colbeck, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator COLBECK</name><name.id>00AOL</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to clarify the government's position in the matter of urgency raised by Senator Allison. In 1996 the government announced a five-year rolling exemption on natural gas and LPG as part of its resources and energy policy. During the 2001 election this commitment was renewed and the <inline font-style="italic">Biofuels for cleaner transport </inline>document was released by the government. This document confirmed the government's commitment to this industry by stating:</para></talk.start><para>	The level of support currently provided through the fuel excise exemption regime to fuel ethanol will be maintained.  </para><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>The Coalition's commitment on excise gives assurance to industry that Government support will not be removed at short notice and that investment in the industry is secure.</para></quote><para>In line with the government's commitment to the 2003-04 budget, long-term measures were announced which relate to excise treatment for alternative fuels. These are to be introduced from 1 July 2008. Through this decision the government has maintained its rolling five-year exemption commitment to the LPG industry. The measures announced in the budget provide certainty for the market and, importantly, provide the industry with time to adjust.</para><para>Fuels for the purpose of powering internal combustion engines, including liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, will be liable for excise; however, the use of LPG for non-automotive purposes will not be taxed. Later this year the government will make a final decision on the excise rate for LPG. However, this will not take effect until 1 July 2012, providing nearly nine years notice on excise treatment. I note that no rate has yet been set, and I question the figures that Senator Allison has provided. The generous transition period provided for currently untaxed fuels which will enter the excise system allows users such as taxi and fleet operators to consider the long-term commercial attractiveness of LPG while still benefiting from the preferential excise treatment for an extended nine-year period.</para><para>As Senator Allison has indicated, statistics on LPG usage indicate that LPG makes up 7.2 per cent of the total Australian transport fuel usage, and this is used by about four per cent of vehicles. About 550,000 vehicles in Australia use LPG. Of vehicles using LPG, the primary users are cars at 69 per cent and light commercial vehicles at 29 per cent. Of cars using LPG, about 330,000 are private vehicles and 22,000 are taxis—that is about 90 per cent of the taxi fleet. Non-automotive LPG, which will not be taxed in Australia, accounts for 34 per cent of use, including industrial, commercial and household users generally where natural gas is not available. Around $3.2 billion has been invested in LPG terminals, tankers and dispensing facilities at 3,500 service stations. Around 40 per cent of them supply LPG. A further $1.1 billion has been invested in vehicles themselves.</para><para>In determining the final excise rate the government is taking a very responsible approach to alternative fuels. It has established an energy task force to make recommendations to government on policy issues, and the government continues to consult with industry. The government has also given a commitment to making decisions on excise in the context of the energy content of the resource. The government's position is that it is not appropriate to deal with the longer term management of environmental and greenhouse issues associated with alternative fuels through large and growing tax exemptions. The government is keen to expand the production of biofuels by promoting an effective and commercially sustainable industry. During the 2001 election the government's objective, as Senator Allison mentioned, was to have Australian produced ethanol and biodiesel contribute at least 350 million litres to the fuel supply by 2010—two per cent of total transport fuel supply—an objective which I understand the industry also agrees with.</para><para>In support of this objective the government has taken active steps to achieve this goal. It has committed government resources to report on the viability and benefits of biofuels and is working cooperatively with industry to convey the positive outcomes possible through the use of biofuels. The government has provided a great deal of assistance to support biofuels through the following measures. In particular I refer to those for the ethanol industry. The government announced in May a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to the increased use of biofuels in transport. The study funded from the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program involves the strategy to increase biofuel production to 350 million litres by 2010. With $500,000 from an $8.8 million Australian Greenhouse Office grant, BP commenced trial marketing an E10 fuel from six Brisbane service stations. The trial was a technical success; however, following loss of consumer confidence in ethanol blended petrol nationwide, BP ended the trial. </para><para>In September 2002 the government introduced a 12-month fuel ethanol production grant program. The grant is paid for the production of ethanol in Australia from biomass feedstock to be blended into, or used as, transport fuel in Australia. Between October 2002 and the end of May 2003, a total of $17.9 million was paid to two fuel producers under the ethanol production grant program—$17.1 million to Manildra Energy and $758,000 to CSR Distilleries.</para><para>On 11 April 2003 Minister Kemp announced that a 10 per cent limit on ethanol content in petrol would be implemented to come into force from 1 July and that labelling of ethanol products at the pump would become mandatory. In the 2003-04 budget, the government announced that it will continue to provide grants for fuel ethanol from 18 September 2002 for five years until 30 June 2008. These grants will be reduced in five equal annual steps from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. Imported ethanol will also become eligible for grants from 1 July 2008, at which time grants will be paid on the blended fuel.</para><para>On 15 May 2003 the Deputy Prime Minister held a meeting of a broad range of stakeholders, including petroleum companies, ethanol producers, automobile manufacturers, motoring organisations and service station organisations, to focus on restoring consumer confidence in fuel ethanol. A task force of stakeholders was formed to plan measures to restore confidence in ethanol—the list goes on.</para><para>The benefits to rural and regional Australia through the use of biofuels are great. Many areas have suffered—and continue to suffer—extreme conditions, given the severity of the recent drought. Biofuels provide an opportunity for the development of industries and, importantly, jobs in regional areas. The government acknowledges that there are benefits in the use of alternative fuels, with recent achievements including the enactment on 1 January 2002 of the Fuel Quality Standards Act, which aims to provide cleaner fuel and cleaner engines. This ensures that quality fuel is available to the public, improving vehicle performance and public confidence in the product. It also provides air quality and cuts pollutants associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</para><para>For the very first time the Howard government has introduced the monitoring of fuel quality on a national basis through a fuel sampling and testing program. There has been a phase-out of leaded petrol, with a complete ban effected on 1 January last year. In-service diesel vehicles now have tighter emission controls, and the requirement for low-sulfur diesel has been introduced, which provides further opportunity for the integration of biofuels into the transport sector and delivers on a commitment made during the negotiation of the GST.</para><para>Diesel fuels account for approximately 60 to 80 per cent of particle emissions and 40 per cent of nitrous oxide from the road transport sector. Given that they represent less than 10 per cent of vehicles on the road, the introduction of tighter emission controls is an important policy decision. Two million dollars has been committed to reduce public transport emissions, and $75 million has been invested by the government through the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program to convert bus and fleet vehicles.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>16345</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the opposition, I would like to address this motion of urgency brought by Senator Allison on behalf of the Australian Democrats today regarding alternative fuels and the imposition by the Howard government in this year's budget of an excise on ethanol.

At that conference they dealt with weighty issues such as changing their name and logo in the face of their worst election result in 50 years. The Nationals, as they now wish to be known, think that this window-dressing may reverse their flagging fortunes—I think not. The only way they will do that is to stand up for their constituency, as they claim it—John Howard's forgotten people of rural and regional Australia—who have been left behind by the city-centric Liberal dominated government. But, of course, to stand up for your constituency you must have strength and direction, something the National Party—or the Nationals, as they call themselves—lack in this government, at least at the cabinet table. Nothing more potently demonstrates this than the confused position adopted by the National Party last weekend on ethanol.</para><para>It is my understanding that at last weekend's National Party conference a motion was carried that deserves some examination. It is my understanding that the first part of the motion was an endorsement of what the National Party describes as the strong:</para><quote><para>Federal Coalition policy on Development incentives for the ethanol industry as taken to the last Federal Election ...</para></quote><para>I suppose this is understandable from the minnow of the coalition. However, the great confusion within the National Party becomes immediately evident when you get to what I am advised was the next part of the resolution adopted by the conference, which indicated that the National Party `supports a 10-year excise exemption for ... ethanol'.</para><para>When I look back at the coalition's ethanol policy I note that, far from maintaining an excise exemption on ethanol, the Treasurer in a statement on 13 May this year announced that he would maintain excise duty on ethanol and introduce excise duty on biodiesel `at the current rate of excise duty on diesel fuel'—that is, an excise of around 38.1c per litre. This year the Treasurer merely maintained the excise on ethanol. It was effectively the Prime Minister who introduced the excise, when he announced on 12 September last year that the government would remove the then current fuel tax exemption on ethanol.</para><para>What a confused lot this new-look—but still only once-great—National Party are. They support the Howard government's policy on ethanol and then call for the cornerstone of that policy, the newly imposed excise arrangements, to be removed for 10 years. This new-look party have at their weekend conference also shown their hypocrisy.

So it is, I am told, that the National Party last weekend claimed to endorse: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... a mandate of 10% Australian-produced ethanol content for fuel sold in Australia.</para></quote><para>This endorsement, in the face of what the Howard government has done to the reputation of ethanol in the eyes of the public, is an act of either extreme naivety or political suicide. Can I remind those opposite that it was the Prime Minister, through his denials and obfuscation about his secret meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August last year, who has done more to damage the future prospects of ethanol than any other individual or organisation. Can I remind those opposite that on 26 September 2002 Labor announced two policies to protect motorists and other users of petrol and thereby restore confidence in ethanol. Our policy for more than a year now has been a limit of 10 per cent on ethanol blending in petrol and mandatory labelling of ethanol in petrol where the ethanol content is five per cent or more.</para><para>How long did it take the Howard government to act to protect the future of the industry by protecting customers? In December 2002, Minister Kemp tried to pass the buck to the states for labelling fuel blends. On 1 February this year, Minister Kemp announced that uniform labelling would be introduced by the Howard government and in place by March 2003 if the states did not shoulder what is a federal responsibility. Not until 11 April 2003 did Minister Kemp finally announce a 10 per cent cap on ethanol and reannounce a mandatory national labelling system. Then, on 26 June—a full nine months after Labor's policy was released—he finally introduced legislation for a labelling regime.</para><para>Labor has expedited the consideration of the enabling legislation by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. Interestingly, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, after his delays in adopting a cap and introducing the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003, now blames Labor for his delays in establishing a labelling regime that we are told will protect consumers, restore their confidence in ethanol and give ethanol a fighting chance of survival by protecting and building its market. Clearly, from the performance of the minister for the environment, it is obvious that hypocrisy is the preserve of not just the National Party but this entire government.</para><para>The National Party's support—if you can call it that—for the Howard government's ethanol policy, a policy under which one producer, the Manildra Group, receives around 96 per cent of the benefits, shows just how far they are from their obligation to represent rural and regional Australia. Clearly some in the National Party have forgotten that the feedlot industry is a significant contributor to the Australian economy and that this industry provides significant employment in regional Australia. They have clearly forgotten the enormous contribution also made to the national economy and regional employment by the pork, poultry and other intensive livestock industries. They have clearly forgotten that in some of these industries up to 70 per cent of business input costs are represented by feed grains. And they have clearly forgotten that feed grain prices have recently reached all-time highs due to the worst drought in 100 years and that those feed grain price rises threaten the viability of hundreds of intensive businesses and the future of potentially thousands of regional jobs. </para><para>The Howard government's subsidy plan for Manildra gives that company a significant taxpayer funded advantage over intensive rural industries in the feed grain market. The Manildra Group produces approximately 90 per cent of Australia's ethanol, and the vast majority of that production is derived from wheat. This places Manildra in the feed grain market and in direct competition with the lot-fed poultry and pork and other intensive industries. The subsidy of approximately 38c per litre provided to Manildra by the Howard government amounts to a benefit of over $150 per tonne of grains. The government funded increased demand for ethanol feedstock is likely to distort an already difficult domestic feed grain market that is still suffering—as I said earlier—from the worst drought in 100 years.</para><para>Despite the false promises held out to the sugar industry last year, the existing subsidy regime has not resulted in any benefit for sugar growers and millers. Labor is not anti ethanol as the bunkum of the Howard government would have the Australian people believe. Labor is simply not convinced the latest extension to the ethanol arrangements designed by the government to help its mates will provide any additional benefit to the sugar industry. Labor is also concerned, as the National Party should be, that any artificial inflation in feed grain prices will drive some intensive producers away from primary production and will cost regional jobs. Labor supports the development of a sustainable alternative fuels industry but not if that damages established and efficient intensive agricultural industries and the thousands of jobs they sustain.</para><para>I will now turn briefly to some of the other fuels noted in this urgency motion. The government announcement in May to tax LPG came only a year after it rejected the Trebeck fuel tax inquiry's recommendation to do just that. In fact, the Treasurer said then:</para><quote><para>The proposal to tax all fuels based on their relative energy content would impose tax on previously unexcised fuels such as ethanol and LPG. This would have implications for the LPG retail fuel industry and LPG conversion businesses, and is also contrary to the Government's election commitment to maintain excise exemptions for fuel ethanol and biodiesel. For these reasons the Government will not be implementing this recommendation.</para></quote><para>Those are the words of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. Already officially the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history, Mr Costello now proposes to raise at least $660 million as a result of this proposal. Under the former Labor government, gas transport fuels like LPG attracted no tax whatsoever. They now attract a 10 per cent GST and, under the Howard government's current proposal, they will be hit with an excise from 2008. It is a double whammy for LPG consumers.</para><para>Yet no recognition was given in the budget of the impact of the decision on the LPG industry, the potential environmental benefits of LPG and other gas fuels, or the price impact on consumers. Also missing was an alternative energy transport sector plan to address pressing environmental concerns. I note here that Australia's transport sector is responsible for 14 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>The government acknowledged that there would be implications for the LPG retail fuel industry and LPG conversion businesses, but it has done nothing to address these or to compensate those directly affected by the change. Meanwhile, as I said earlier, the government has made sure that its mates at Manildra will be looked after with special arrangements to apply for domestic ethanol producers. </para><para>The LPG industry, however, faced an immediate and dramatic downturn in business upon the Treasurer's announcement of the excise imposition. In fact, since November 2000, the industry has suffered a significant downturn resulting from the introduction of the GST followed soon after by erratic pricing policies pursued by the major oil companies. To now impose an excise on LPG, even if it is not effective until 2008, will decimate the industry.</para><para>Contrary to the government's statement that the phasing in of excise provides an extended transition path for industry and consumers, the reality is that vehicle manufacturers have a three-year development cycle with major fleet vehicles averaging three years usage. The challenge is that in 2008-09 the resale value of a dedicated LPG vehicle will be substantially less than the petrol equivalent because of the impending excise. This effectively makes the current life cycle cost of owning an LPG vehicle more expensive than the petrol equivalent. Therefore, fleet vehicle purchases are likely to be cut back almost immediately. Because of the fleet life cycle costs explained above and the requirement for long lead times with significant capital investments in research and technology, the vehicle manufacturers are currently assessing the viability of further developing the LPG vehicles already in the development process. The excise could halt the introduction of OEM LPG vehicles as early as next year.</para><para>The automotive LPG industry has developed into a world-class alternative fuel industry with over 2,000 small to medium enterprises employing tens of thousands of people. The introduction of excise on automotive LPG has an immediate and a dramatic effect on these families. The industry, the people employed in it and their families continue to live with uncertainty with no final excise rates as yet announced. </para><para>There could also be a large amount of capital investment lost, not the least of which would be $200 million invested in the Sydney LPG cavern. Losses of this magnitude cannot be sustained by small to medium enterprises without some serious repercussions. Labor will not consider the government's proposal in isolation but will strive to provide a broader proposal within its energy policy which addresses the transport sector's impact on the environment and our growing oil import dependency.</para><para>I say again that Australia's transport sector is responsible for 14 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Labor recognise the importance of an alternative fuels policy. We will not be stampeded into falling in behind the government's policy. We reject suggestions that Labor have been doing anything other than acting responsibly in drawing to the attention of consumers the pitfalls of using ethanol fuel blends where the quantity of ethanol exceeds 10 per cent. In fact, the reality is that the government has now fallen into line with Labor's policy in that regard, albeit nine months after the event.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>16348</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened to the speakers in favour of the so-called urgency motion and I see absolutely no gravity or urgency in their presentation, let alone in the wording of the motion.

Yes, we debate issues such as ethanol; we debate all sorts of issues.</para><para>I can tell Senator O'Brien the difference between a National Party conference and a Labor Party conference is that the motions moved at a National Party conference, while highly influential and studied by the parliamentarians—because they come from our members and from the grassroots, and it is a debate that brings together people from all around Australia—are not binding upon the parliamentarians. They are influential, as I say, but not binding. That is the way it ought to be. Whereas, when you go to a Labor Party conference, 50-plus per cent made up of unionists, any motion moved at that conference—usually at the Hobart convention centre—is utterly binding upon the parliamentarian or you face the consequences. Those listening on broadcast may ask the difference between the two: is not the elected parliamentarian first responsible to his electorate? His first responsibility is to listen to the voice of his electorate and not to be bound solely and wholly by his party—influenced of course, but not bound solely and wholly.</para><para>Senator O'Brien comes in as usual with his mixed up messages, which are always tainted with an attack on the National Party. He cannot have it both ways. He launched an attack on the government's policy of subsidy and support to the ethanol industry. The Manildra Group is a sizeable part of that industry; therefore, it gets a sizeable advantage of that policy, although not solely and wholly. On the other hand, in the same breath he condemns us for not supporting the ethanol industry—that shows just how much gall the shadow minister has. What a mixed up contribution that was. It really leaves me to say that this motion is not urgent at all; it is just opportunistic.</para><para>We have been debating in the parliament this week the ability of the Senate to block and frustrate the mandate of a government, which has brought about the government's tabling of the paper on the options for resolving deadlocks. I have to say that there are many ways of frustrating and blocking a government's legislative program, and wasting the time of the Senate on such trivial urgency motions is one. I have been in the parliament now for some time; in fact, I came in with my colleague here, Senator Patterson, way back in the old parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—It was a very good year.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—It was a good year. Senator Patterson would agree with me that, when an urgency motion was put on the table in the past, it really meant there was an urgent matter and it was debated with seriousness by both sides of the parliament. But this urgency motion sinks to the lowest possible level of what an urgency motion should mean in this parliament. The Senate's time is being wasted. I cannot think of a more trivial urgency motion being brought to parliament than the one we have before us. I am not just making that claim as a cliche. I invite senators to read the urgency motion before us. It cannot even muster the feigned anger of condemning the government, as most MPIs and urgency motions would; it just `notes' the government's comments. It cannot even muster a condemnation of the government and it is riddled with errors, which were highlighted throughout Senator Allison's speech. She will have an opportunity to correct those in the seven minutes she gets to sum up. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has given a 10-year lead in regard to its pending tax upon alternative fuels. The final level and stage of that taxation will not be introduced until 2012. On my estimate, that policy was set in 2002; that sounds like 10 years to me. This urgency motion is utterly full of errors and the government reject the whole tenor of it that we are not supporting the alternative fuels industry. The opposite is the truth. Point (b) of this so-called urgency motion is something we do agree with when it mentions:</para><quote><para>... the significant benefits derived from alternative fuels to public health, air quality, regional development and resource security.</para></quote><para>We are in utter agreement with that specific within the urgency motion. The government have a record of supporting this industry. We have subsidies, support programs and grants that all support the ethanol industry and the LPG industry. So we do support point (b) of the so-called urgency motion.</para><para>In conclusion, one thing this industry knows is that the Labor Party's form when in government is to increase taxes on everything, most of all on fuels. It knows that when the Labor Party were in government, to cover their deficit they used to ratchet up every excise they could get their hands on, and they will do the same if they are returned to government. The Democrats will do the same. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>16350</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The potential benefit to the Queensland economy, especially to growers of fuel crops, of an efficient and cost-effective ethanol policy is substantial. It goes beyond the mere monetary value too. As the case in the mid-western states of the USA has shown, a viable fuel cropping industry can be a lifesaver for rural communities. My interest as a senator for Queensland is therefore patent and clear. The role and place of ethanol in the automotive fuel picture of a future Australia should also be patent and clear. That it is not patent and clear at present is down to Labor Party hypocrisy and the ALP's politics of desperation. It would serve Australia's interest well if the Democrats, who have moved this urgency motion today, were to give some indication that they at least understand this. They should also understand that there is no natural justice in an excise policy that exempts one type of fuel that is competing in and contributing to market choice in fuel.</para></talk.start><para>That is not to say that bringing new fuels—at least, novel ones to most consumers—into the marketplace should not be attended by some phase-in arrangement that is designed to encourage consumer take-up arrangements, assist market penetration in the public good and provide some small measure of bridging subsidy for what is in effect new technology. Contrary to the position apparently adopted by the Democrats, it is not clear that, as its motion today states:</para><para>(a)	the Government's May Budget decision to impose a tax on alternative fuels such as LPG, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and biofuels from 2008 has already threatened the viability and development of the alternative fuels industry in Australia; and</para><para>(b)	the significant benefits derived from alternative fuels to public health, air quality, regional development and resource security. </para><para>What is clear is that the hopes of regional Australia that a viable national ethanol industry can be built have been dealt a severe blow by the Labor Party's extraordinary attacks on this biofuel.</para><para>Speaking as a Queenslander, I find the unethical and profoundly dumb assault on ethanol by the ALP both astonishing and painful. It is astonishing how short-sighted the Labor Party can be when it thinks it sees a faint gleam of light on top of some handy hill. It is painful that a party that aspires to government can deliberately set out to damage an important and emerging industry. Especially so is this the case when it is an industry that offers environmental as well as social benefits—in other words, cleaner air and a greater number of sustainable rural communities—just so it can pursue its vanity by pretending it can wound the Prime Minister.</para><para>It cannot wound the Prime Minister. It proves that fact of modern political life daily. On ethanol, all the Labor Party has proved—or re-proved—is that it is good for shooting itself in the foot. Sometimes it gets the help of the Democrats in these endeavours, and that is really unfortunate. Sometimes the Democrats allow themselves, by misadventure, to become collateral damage in the Labor Party's latest exercise in self-destruction. I respectfully suggest to honourable senators opposite that this is one of those times.</para><para>In fact, the record of the Howard government on cleaner fuels and alternative fuels is very good. I will list a few of those benefits in just a moment. But, first, I want to say that no-one can genuinely think that an expanded fuel range can be built on a differential approach that, on more than a transitional basis, creates privileges for one fuel against another in terms of excise. It makes sense to apply the excise on the basis of energy output. That indeed seems a sensible approach—not unlike that for income taxes—and that is in fact what the government proposes to do. It is not going to do it straightaway. Basically, nothing happens in terms of alternative fuels until 2008 anyway—and that is five years away.</para><para>Before listing some of the important factors that the Democrats appear to have overlooked and that the Labor Party, as usual, fails to see because as always it is an ostrich to fortune and has its head buried in the sand, I want to say a few more words about ethanol, which could be the saviour of sugar growers in my state of Queensland. It is crucial that we act to restore consumer confidence in ethanol. In other parts of the world, ethanol is strongly promoted by oil companies for its environmental, health and fuel extension benefits. We need to move to a sensible policy position in this country, which must be supported by the Labor Party to establish and then sustain a biofuel sector. This will not come to pass while the Labor Party engages in dodgy deals and fictitious news stories that destroy consumer confidence in ethanol. It will not come to pass while the Labor Party continues to insist on not seeing the point, where ethanol is concerned, in terms of the relatively small market that this country represents and the historic circumstances that have created, up to now, a producer system that is heavily skewed towards just one provider.</para><para>But the argument is much broader than that. The government supports the use of LPG and other alternative fuels. This can be seen by the extensive financial assistance provided for these fuels. It can be seen in the existing excise exemptions through increased eligibility for grants under the Energy Grants Credit Scheme and through mechanisms such as the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program. The government recognises the need for greater efficiencies in the production of alternative fuels so that they become commercially viable in their own right. The nine-year transitional period, with partial excise in 2008 and a gradual increase to full excise in 2012, will provide the alternative fuel industries with certainty over the long term. </para><para>The government is aware of the environmental gap between alternative and conventional fuels. It is also aware that the gap between them is reducing as the Howard government tightens fuel standards. The final excise rates for all fuels, including LPG, will be announced later this year. LPG in a vehicle using optimised technology may produce greenhouse and air quality emission benefits, but most LPG vehicles produce less than the maximum possible benefits and some poor quality conversions have higher levels of emissions than petrol vehicles. In the area of ethanol—which is, of course, the area of most interest to someone who represents Australia's premier sugar producing state—Howard government assistance to the ethanol industry has been extensive. It can still be highly productive in terms of sustainable long-term industry. It is an industry, a concept and a fuel embraced by the Queensland Labor government, incidentally—something that the Queensland caucus might like to impress on the present federal leadership of the ALP.</para><para>In May 2002 the Howard government announced a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to increase use of biofuels in transport. Also in May 2002 the BP ethanol trial commenced with an $8.8 million Australian Greenhouse Office grant, with BP marketing an E10 blend from six Brisbane service stations. Regrettably, while a technical success, loss of consumer confidence in the ethanol blended petrol nationwide led BP to end its ethanol trial. However, support for a potential ethanol industry is still very much at the heart of Howard government policy. It is just a pity that tonight we are debating a motion such as this, which clearly should not have the support of the Labor Party—the Labor Party which pretends to be the alternative government in this country—and is supported by the economic vandals that the Democrats are.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>16352</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the interests of time and in the knowledge that the government has 10 minutes of government business and there is a requirement to table a report, I will not sum up at this point.

The bill will also bring about improved and nationally consistent occupational health and safety arrangements for the offshore petroleum industry. </para><para>The bill also makes minor amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act unconnected to offshore safety. </para><para>One is to address an anomaly whereby the Commonwealth is currently required to remit to the States and Northern Territory an equivalent of the GST component of annual fees collected in respect of titles issued under the Act. The second is to make amendments that will remove the mechanics of petroleum data submission from the Act and place them in new objective based regulations. </para><para>The offshore petroleum industry is an important contributor to the Australian economy. The industry supports thousands of jobs; supplies a large proportion of our domestic liquid fuel and natural gas requirements; and is a major export industry. It also attracts billions of dollars in foreign investment for exploration, development of new oil and gas fields, and construction of gas pipelines and downstream gas processing plants. </para><para>In August 2001, the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources prepared a report on offshore safety titled “Future Arrangements for the Regulation of Offshore Petroleum Safety”. It found that the current system was inadequate. </para><para>In particular, it was noted that there are too many acts and regulations regulating offshore petroleum activities, with unclear boundaries and inconsistent application. Different sets of legal documents apply to the areas adjacent to each State and the Northern Territory. And there are overlaps in the applicable legislation.</para><para>In response to this report, and the wishes of industry and the workforce, the Government committed $6.1 million dollars in the 2002-2003 budget to establish the Authority as a single national safety regulator. It will cover offshore petroleum activities in Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory coastal waters from 1 January 2005. </para><para>The Authority will be established as a Commonwealth statutory authority which will regulate safety on offshore petroleum facilities on behalf of the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. </para><para>When it is undertaking its regulatory activities in Commonwealth waters the authority will use the powers conferred by the Commonwealth Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act.  </para><para>When regulating in the coastal waters of the States or Northern Territory it will use “mirror” powers conferred under State or Northern Territory Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Acts. </para><para>There is also provision in this legislation for the Authority to undertake regulatory activities requested by a State or the Northern Territory in inland waters or onshore. If such a request was made, the Authority would draw its powers from the relevant State or Northern Territory legislation.</para><para>If the States or Northern Territory seek the safety regulation of offshore petroleum operations in their internal waters, it will be undertaken by the Authority. This is the situation for Western Australia. </para><para>The Authority may also be invited to regulate associated onshore petroleum operations. Decisions about this will be taken on a case by case basis.</para><para>The Authority's key functions will be to promote the health and safety of persons engaged in offshore petroleum operations. It will effectively monitor and enforce the health and safety obligations in Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory legislation. </para><para>The Authority will have the power to investigate accidents or circumstances that could have increased the risk of accidents. It will report on these investigations to the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers. </para><para>The Authority will continue to apply the safety case approach to regulation which is currently used in the offshore petroleum industry in Australia and other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Norway. </para><para>Under the safety case approach, operators of offshore facilities assess all the risks to the facility, undertake formal hazard and risk studies, and describe the management systems for safe running of the facility. Once accepted, the safety case is “in force” and provides the basis for safe facility operations.</para><para>I turn now to the structure and governance of the Authority.</para><para>An important aspect of the governance arrangements for the Authority is that it will have an advisory Board. The independence and expertise of the Board members will be an invaluable resource for the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority. </para><para>The Board will provide advice and give recommendations directly to Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers on offshore safety policy and strategic matters, and the performance of the Authority. </para><para>The legislation requires the CEO to seek the Board's advice on strategic matters relating to the Authority's functions, and to have regard to the advice provided. The CEO must keep the Board informed of the Authority's operations, and provide any information requested. It is intended that this Board will be influential and effective in the activities of the Authority.</para><para>As the Authority is a national regulator, the CEO and members of the Board will be nominated for appointment by the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, and will be appointed by the Commonwealth Minister. </para><para>The Commonwealth Minister will be responsible for issuing policy principles or directions but, before doing so, will consult with State and Northern Territory Ministers. Should the principles or directions relate wholly or mostly to operations in State or Northern Territory coastal waters, the Commonwealth Minister will first need to obtain the agreement of each responsible Minister. </para><para>Directions will not relate to operations at a particular facility, although the Minister will be able to direct the Authority to investigate a particular act or dangerous occurrence at a facility. </para><para>There are emergency powers that allow the Minister to issue directions without first obtaining the agreement of the relevant State or Northern Territory Minister, but they only apply for a short period. There is also provision for the State and Northern Territory Ministers to request the Commonwealth Minister to issue a direction to apply in their coastal waters.</para><para>I turn now to staffing arrangements for the Authority.</para><para>The safety case approach gives the operator greater freedom to choose how it runs its facility but places increased demands on the regulator. The regulator has to be in a position to assess and, if necessary, challenge the operator's safety case.  </para><para>Difficult decisions will fall upon the regulatory staff of the Authority. For example, they may have to decide whether a safety issue is of such concern that oil or gas production should cease until it is rectified. It is an immense responsibility which must be exercised judiciously. The people with this responsibility need to possess a unique blend of technical competence, interpersonal skills and judgement. Above all they need the respect of industry, the workforce and Governments.</para><para>The staff of the Authority will be employed under the Public Service Act but the Authority will need to be able to specify essential qualifications and experience for offshore safety regulators. </para><para>It will need to be able to advertise for Offshore Safety Regulators, or Offshore Safety Team Leaders, without reference to more widely used Australian Public Service classifications. It will need to be able to offer salary ranges which are competitive in the international market and which are well outside the normal levels of public service pay and conditions. </para><para>For the regulatory staff of the Authority, all of these requirements can be provided through the flexibilities provided by Australian Workplace Agreements available under the Australian Public Service Act. </para><para>I now turn to how the Authority will be funded.</para><para>Regulation of industry activities is essential for three reasons. To provide a safe working environment for the offshore petroleum workforce. To provide the greatest possible confidence that there will be no environmental damage arising from any catastrophic explosions. And to ensure continuity of important energy supplies such as gas. </para><para>Governments will not allow the industry to operate without regulation. The regulation is like any other essential input into the industry's offshore petroleum operations. This is a case with clear beneficiaries of a service being provided by the Government and the industry must pay for it.</para><para>The offshore petroleum industry will receive an obvious benefit in the form of a greater level of confidence that their safety systems are robust. They will be less exposed to failures which could result in injury, death and interruptions to business operations.</para><para>This bill, and the related Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill, will provide the Authority with the ability to fully recover the costs of its operations and activities through industry fees and levies.</para><para>Where an operator requests the Authority to perform a service, the Authority will have the ability, under this bill, to charge fees for the supply of its services. These services may include the assessment of safety cases, assessment of pipeline safety management plans, and provision of advisory and other services as may be requested by industry from time-to-time. </para><para>The majority of the Authority's resources will be employed in activities associated with monitoring compliance with approved safety cases. These include conducting audits of facilities, reviewing and assessing updates to existing safety cases. Under the Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill 2003, the cost of these ongoing activities will be recovered through a safety case levy which will be payable by all exploration, production and support facility operators on an annual basis whilst there is a safety case in force for that facility. </para><para>The Authority will also have the ability to recover the costs of monitoring the safety of offshore pipelines through an annual pipeline safety management plan levy. However, it is expected that this levy will recover only a small proportion of the Authority's operating costs. </para><para>The Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill 2003, will also authorise the Authority to charge a safety investigation levy. This will be payable by an individual operator in the event of a serious accident or dangerous occurrence which requires the Authority to conduct an investigation. The levy will only be charged if the resources required to conduct the investigation exceed a level which will be set by the regulations. </para><para>The final level and structure of the fees and levies will be set by regulations before the Authority commences operation in 2005. The fees and levies will be designed in accordance with the Government's cost recovery policy. And there will be consultation with industry, through the preparation of a cost recovery impact statement. </para><para>The fundamental purpose of this bill is to improve offshore safety outcomes by simplifying regulatory arrangements under a single national regulator.</para><para>The decision to create the Authority, and the development of the legislation, has involved the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, a steering committee of Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory officials, industry participants and workforce representatives. The role of the working groups comprising members of governments, industry and the workforce has been invaluable.</para><para>The offshore petroleum industry and workforce have been strong advocates for the creation of a national safety authority. An important reason for this support is an acknowledgement that a strong and effective regulator will enjoy the confidence of industry participants. It will also be influential in ensuring that safety is considered the highest concern from the drilling rig to the boardroom. </para><para>The amendments contained in this bill should give the public greater confidence that the regulation of safety in the offshore petroleum industry will be performed efficiently and effectively. It will lead to greater protection of the livelihood of the offshore petroleum workforce and the Commonwealth's interests.</para><para>I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1904">OFFSHORE PETROLEUM (SAFETY LEVIES) BILL 2003</inline></para><para>The Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill 2003 is a bill for an Act to give effect to the decision of the Commonwealth and the States and Northern Territory to fully recover the costs of operating the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority from industry. </para><para>This bill, once enacted, will provide the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority with the ability to recover the costs of its regulatory activities through industry levies.

Under Farm Help, assistance is available to low-income farm families, who cannot borrow further against their assets, while they consider their future in the farm sector. The program encourages these farmers to work towards improving their family's financial situation, whether it is by improving the farm's financial performance or by obtaining off-farm income, or to re-establish themselves outside of farming. </para><para>The assistance provided through Farm Help is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. Key program elements include up to twelve months of income support at the same rate as the Newstart Allowance; financial assistance for farmers to seek professional advice such as financial, legal and business planning; and a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 for farmers who decide to leave farming and sell the farm. Farmers who receive the re-establishment grant can also receive a retraining grant to assist with the costs associated with re-skilling for employment off the farm.</para><para>Since the program commenced in December 1997, as the Farm Family Re-start scheme, until 30 June 2003, over 8,100 farmers have received Farm Help income support and nearly 1,000 farmers have received re-establishment grants. The program has funded over 9,100 professional advice sessions for some 7,000 farmers. </para><para>The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003 will give effect to the Government's 2003 Budget commitment to extend the application date for the Farm Help program until 30 June 2004. The closing date for applications for income support is to be extended from 30 November 2003 to 30 June 2004 with income support payments being made up until 30 June 2005. Amendments to the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme 1997 Instrument, which is established under the Act, will extend the closing date for applications for the Re-establishment Grant to 30 June 2004. </para><para>The extension will allow farmers to have continued access to the Farm Help program while the Government considers any new arrangements in the context of the 2004 Budget. </para><para>The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003 also introduces a number of administrative changes to the Farm Help program that will enable it to operate more effectively in supporting Australia's farmers. These changes have emanated from the on-going monitoring of the program's performance, a mid-term evaluation of Farm Help and the Performance Audit of Key AAA Programs undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office earlier this year.  </para><para>As Farm Help aims to assist low-income farmers who are no longer able to borrow against their assets, farmers are required to obtain a “certificate of inability to obtain finance” from a bank or other financial institution. It is proposed to streamline the administrative arrangements for these certificates by removing the requirement for farmers to obtain a new certificate every six months to remain on the program. Under the proposed amendments, a certificate will remain valid for 13 months as long as a farmer's application is lodged with Centrelink within one month of receiving the Certificate, effectively covering the full twelve months that income assistance is available under the program. </para><para>Under the proposed amendments, farmers will be required to obtain a certificate from the finance institution that is the farmer's primary lender. This amendment is directed at maintaining the integrity of the program by requiring the certificate to be issued by the finance institution that provides the bulk of the farmer's borrowings. It should ensure the certificate is issued on the basis of the farmer's current financial circumstances. </para><para>One of the key aims of the Farm Help program is to assist farmers to be better informed when making decisions about their future in farming. All farmers who join the program are required to arrange a viability assessment of their farm business within three months. This assessment allows a farmer to get an independent appraisal of their farm's financial situation. </para><para>Currently, if a farm business is assessed as being non-viable the farmer is required to develop an Activity Plan. This Plan is customised to suit each farm family's particular situation and helps to identify options that will best position the farm family for the future. It sets out the necessary actions required to improve the financial viability of the farm, to obtain income from alternative sources or to assist the family to re-establish off the farm. The cost of the initial viability assessment and Activity Plan are met through the program.</para><para>The Activity Plan is currently optional for farm businesses assessed as viable. With the passage of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003, the Activity Plan process will be broadened to apply to all farmers who join the program. As noted in the mid-term evaluation of the Farm Help program, the Activity Plan highlights the need for participating farmers to take action on their own behalf. All farmers on the program can benefit from undertaking the Activity Plan process because it identifies those strategies or actions that farmers can implement now to improve their prospects and avert financial difficulty “down the track”. It ensures that farmers are better informed and better placed to consider their future options. </para><para>The completion of the Activity Plan will also open the door for all farmers on the Farm Help program to access the professional advice and training assistance. Farmers will be assisted, up to a maximum of $5,500, to obtain professional advice and/or undertake training that has been identified in the Activity Plan as being necessary to improve their financial prospects.   </para><para>To facilitate farmers' access to both professional advice and training under the Program, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003 provides for the amalgamation of the existing retraining and professional advice grants into a single “Advice and Training” grant. </para><para>Currently, the program only offers retraining assistance to farmers who have received the re-establishment grant. By combining the existing retraining and professional advice grants into a single grant, all farmers on the program will, for the first time, be able to access training assistance. Moreover, the training component of the grant will be broadened to include activities that upgrade practical farming skills and the purchase of computer software, up to $500. As with the current Professional Advice grant, farmers will be able to use the combined grant to obtain advice on matters such as financial planning, business management, legal and personal issues.</para><para>The combined “Advice and Training” grant will provide greater flexibility in addressing the individual circumstances of each Farm Help recipient. The details of the combined grant will be specified in amendments to the Farm Help Advice Scheme 1997 Instrument, established under the Farm Household Support Act 1992.  </para><para>I would also foreshadow that, apart from extending the Re-establishment Grant components of the program, the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme 1997 Instrument will be amended to clarify the eligibility criteria for the Re-establishment Grant so as to ensure that the grant is only available for its original target group. It has become increasingly apparent that the eligibility criteria for the Re-establishment Grant are allowing a broad range of people who consider themselves to be farmers to access the grant when the original intent of the grant was to support farmers who have been and continue to be dependent on the farm for their livelihood. </para><para>As a consequence, the eligibility criteria in the Instrument will be clarified through the specification of thresholds in relation to the contribution of capital to the farm, the ownership of land, the level of income earned from other jobs and the receipt of other Australian Government income support payments.   </para><para>The Government remains committed to the development of self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries. It also recognises that there are significant pressures on farmers to remain viable and that some farmers, often for reasons beyond their control, have been unable to keep up with the pace of change. Accordingly, Farm Help has been instrumental in providing farmers in difficulty with financial relief and the means to assess their prospects and make informed decisions about their farming future. The proposed amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will both extend the Farm Help program and further improve the operation of the program. </para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16359</page.no><id.no>R1816</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>16359</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives returning the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003, acquainting the Senate that the House has agreed to amendments (1) to (4), (8) to (11) and (13) to (15) made by the Senate, and disagreed to amendments (5) to (7) and (12) made by the Senate, and desiring the reconsideration of the amendments disagreed to by the House.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of the message No. 427 in Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: ROAM CONSULTING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>16359</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>16359</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>16359</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Following Senate discussion on 13 October 2003 in relation to a Senate order to produce documents, I wish to read a statement on behalf of the Hon.

The relationship that we have with Indonesia is particularly important. This institute was established by the Australian government in 1989 to contribute to a more broadly based and enduring relationship between Australia and Indonesia and to project positive images about Australia and Indonesia in each country. I do not think there is a more important role than that of this particular organisation. Indonesia is a very large and important neighbour of Australia. It has 214 million people and is a mere 40 minutes flying time from Darwin. As one of our closest neighbours, the relationship between our two countries could not be more important.</para><para>The Australia-Indonesia Institute was established by the Australian government in 1989. A number of programs have been carried out by the institute to foster the economic, cultural, educational and social relationships between our two countries. The institute has quite a modest budget—in this annual report, the budget is just over $850,000. The work that the institute does is particularly important, certainly so since the Bali bombing on 12 October last year. This is one of a small number of bilateral institutes that operate under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There are similar organisations for India and Japan, but no organisation could have a more important role to play at this time than the Australia-Indonesia Institute in fostering the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. I encourage the institute in its work. I also encourage the government to continue financing this very worthwhile organisation.

He is in denial mode. For those of us who know him well and are exposed almost daily to his remarkable Indian rubber man capacity to twist the truth, the fact that he is trying yet again to evade responsibility is no surprise. It is sickening, but it is no surprise.</para></talk.start><para>In response to a statement by the Queensland opposition leader that he had no confidence in the inquiry, the Premier said, `I think the opposition want to play politics with the misery of children, and I think that is despicable.' It is despicable to play politics with the misery of children—even to want to do so—but the man who is playing politics with the misery of children in Queensland is indeed the Premier. It is he who heads the government that has tried everything it can to avoid doing what everyone has known for a long time needs to be done: to clean up the shocking performance of the Queensland authorities with regard to children who are in its care. The Crime and Misconduct Commission is today conducting an inquiry—an inquiry limited by time and by the resources the CMC can apply to the matter—only because, in the end, the Premier had nowhere to hide. The Queensland opposition leader says he has no confidence in the CMC inquiry. </para><para>I state frankly to the Senate tonight that I have no confidence either—no confidence in the CMC being able under the present arrangements to get to the bottom of the problem and to make the sorts of far-reaching inquiries that are obviously needed if the problem is to be fixed. It is not that confidence should be lacking in the officers of the CMC or in learned counsel assisting—that is very far from the truth. The issue is with the constricted nature of the reference made to the CMC and with the fact that the CMC, as I said in this place last week, already has its hands full inquiring into other defective parts of the Beattie empire. I said last week that what was needed was a royal commission, properly funded, with effective and far-reaching terms of reference and a capacity to concentrate on the matter without a deadline. The Queensland Premier says that the CMC has all the powers of a royal commission. That is a cop-out and it is a sell-out, and the Premier of Queensland knows that is the case.</para><para>What emerged from the first day of the inquiry yesterday was a damning indictment of the inaction over the five years that the Beattie Labor government has been in power. Counsel assisting the CMC, Trevor Morgan, said this:</para><quote><para>If the Government was considered to be the parent of the child, which in many cases it is, the Government would have its children taken from it.</para></quote><para>That is a truly damning indictment of the political chicanery continuously practised by the Beattie Labor government and an indelible stain on the Premier and the two ministers who have held the portfolio of families in the past five years. For the record, they are the current minister, Judy Spence, who holds the seat of Mount Gravatt, and the former minister, Anna Bligh, who holds the seat of South Brisbane, who is now education minister and who is being protected by the Premier, who views her as his heir apparent.</para><para>For the record, as I have previously stated in this place, it was Ms Bligh who failed to act in 1999 on allegations made by two members of the state legislature, one of them a Labor member—one of her own, in other words. It was Ms Bligh whose dereliction of duty in failing to act effectively on that occasion ensured four more years of misery for children in the `care'—I say `care' because they clearly were not in care—of a foster family now under investigation for years of suspected serial sexual abuse of children. That fact alone exposes the Premier as having played the political card in this sad and shocking affair. He pleads innocence—he always does; he would plead innocence beside a downed cherry tree if he were found still holding the axe—but his words are hollow. He has no credibility on this. He knows it. He is simply trying, as he always does, to evade responsibility for something that, as Premier, he knows he carries the ultimate responsibility. But it is not the defective Premier of Queensland who is the issue at this time in this context.</para><para>The issue is what must be done, not what might be done or what could be done, to remedy the appalling situation that exists in the state Department of Families and to give the children in its care or under its control some relief. This is not a problem that suddenly burst out of left field onto an unsuspecting government in the immediate past. It is something that has been a problem, and publicly identified as a problem, for all of the five years that the Beattie Labor government has been in power. It was a problem before then. There is no denying that, and no-one should seek to deny it. But the present Queensland government has been in power for more than five years. Fixing the problem is its responsibility. And when I say `fixing the problem', I do not mean that we need another Beattie political fix. This time the Premier has to actually do something, and it has to be more than just throwing dollars at it. </para><para>It certainly has to be more than his Minister for Families could manage in question time in the state legislature today. She would not—or could not—tell Queenslanders how many cases of suspected abuse of children in foster care had been reported to her department in the 2002-03 financial year. All she could—or would—tell the state legislature today was that the figures would be published in the Productivity Commission's annual report in January 2004. As the Queensland opposition leader said when confronted with the fact that the responsible minister could not or would not answer the question, `So much for open and accountable government.'</para><para>Let me say that the funding the state government has found to pump into the business of taking proper care of the children under its protection since the state budget in May, when it failed to provide funds for even one additional child protection officer, is welcome. But it is starkly apparent that the department itself is wholly dysfunctional with regard to its primary duty of care. That is the real problem. That is what the Premier and his minister have got to get to grips with.</para><para>Today the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> headlined `Chaos rules in Families Department'. That is what must be fixed, and it must be fixed now. As the Queensland opposition leader said in state parliament this morning, the children of Queensland cannot afford to wait five to seven years for the government to get the organisation right. They have already been waiting five years for the Beattie Labor government to get it right. The Forde inquiry long ago reported on how to get it right. If there are institutional problems—in the sense of the problems identified in evidence to the inquiry yesterday, in which it appears hearts are in the right place but brains are in neutral or off playing some away fixture—then they need to be sorted out now. That is a job for a director-general who has the required administrative authority, the required funding and the required political backing from the man at the top, the Premier.</para><para>I have now spoken four times in the Senate on the issue of the Queensland government failing the children for whom it is directly responsible. I first raised the matter directly on 25 June. I raised it again on 9 September. I raised it a third time last week in this place, in the matters of public interest discussion last Wednesday. I raise it again tonight in the context of evidence that is now being heard at the inquiry in Brisbane. I shall raise it again and again until there is a proper, full and comprehensive outcome, because if we fail to look after children then we fail ourselves as a society. It is as simple as that. Australians do not want to fail at this most crucial of all the public duties that confront them. No number of Goodwill Bridges over the Brisbane River can make up for a failure to provide the care that the young demand, deserve and have every right to expect. No amount of government promotion—and in Queensland there is an awful lot of government promotion—is worth a zack if children placed in care are in fact placed at risk.</para><para>The job the Premier and his government must do is a tough one. I recognise that in this place tonight. There will be political pain coming from the inquiry, which, however inadequate it actually is as a response to a serial lack of attention by the government, is now at last under way and will inevitably produce some unpalatable outcomes. No-one can take any pleasure from that. This is not a game to be played for political advantage. It is something the Queensland government and in particular the Premier simply have to get right. The department is dysfunctional. There is an extremely high turnover of staff. It seems there is a negative internal culture of attributing blame and repeated lapses in six monthly reviews of foster care placements. </para><para>The Ombudsman's report into the death of baby Kirra at 10 weeks, which resulted from a departmental failure to act decisively to intervene in her care arrangements, was a shocking indictment of the system. It was the clearest possible indication that the problem extends far further than simply protecting children from sexual predators. The limited inquiry that has been permitted by the Queensland government up to the present moment is, of course, good as far as it goes. In saying that, I underline that I make no reflection on the commitment and standing of the CMC or of counsel assisting. Indeed, the reverse is the case. But it does not go far enough. It has been designed by the state government not to go far enough. Nevertheless, the inquiry is now under way and must be supported because of that. It will be watched with intense interest, and the evidence it collects will be sifted with archaeological intensity. Its eventual recommendations will go under a lot of microscopes. Then I suggest—although no doubt the Queensland Premier will have been unable to change his spots and will seek, as he always does, to foreclose on embarrassing matters arising—we should have the real inquiry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nuclear Testing: South Australia</title><page.no>16364</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>16364</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak tonight because tomorrow marks an important but tragic anniversary in this country. It is an anniversary that reminds us of the shameful aspects of our history of relations with our Indigenous people and also reminds us of the nuclear burden that has been imposed on South Australia, my home state, by previous governments and by the British government.</para></talk.start><para>Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of the first atomic test by the British government in northern South Australia. This test was conducted at Emu Junction, where a full-scale atomic bomb codenamed Totem 1 was detonated on 15 October 1953. Emu Junction is a claypan 280 kilometres north-west of Coober Pedy. Totem 1's detonation sent a dense radioactive cloud—the black mist, as it is called by the Indigenous peoples—far beyond the testing range across north-west South Australia. It caused immediate long-term sickness and death amongst Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. In fact, the 1984 royal commission into the atomic testing concluded that the test was carried out under wind conditions that the preparatory report had shown would produce unacceptable levels of fallout, a decision that failed to take into account the existence of people at Wallatinna and at Welbourn Hill. The result was that many Indigenous people were affected then and continue to be affected by this detonation and by subsequent detonations in the Maralinga Pitjantjatjara lands.</para><para>These experiences and these stories cannot simply be dismissed as being a black armband view of history. They are real events and events that continue to resonate particularly for many of the Indigenous communities within northern South Australia now. I want to particularly pay tribute to the work of Kupa Piti Kungka Tjuta—that is, the senior Aboriginal women of Coober Pedy. Can I say that all of these women were living in the country when the government used the country for the bomb. One of them, Eileen Kampakuta Brown, was, somewhat ironically, awarded the Order of Australia by this government for her work in championing the cause of her people in seeking to have recorded the history and experience of her people and for her continued campaign, along with other members of her community, against the imposition of a nuclear waste dump on South Australia. I want to read briefly from one of her recollections of what happened when Totem 1 was detonated. At that stage Eileen Kampakuta Brown was working on an outback station. She said: </para><quote><para>We got up in the morning from the tent. Everyone had red eyes. Right here the smoke caught us.

Everybody was sick.</para></quote><para>I want to pay tribute to the work of Ms Brown and to the other members of the Kungka Tjuta for their continued work in this area and for the extraordinary dignity with which they discuss this tragic event and what it has meant for them and their families and people.</para><para>I had the opportunity to meet Ms Brown immediately prior to her presentation with her Australian honour, and I was struck by the absence of overt anger and hostility towards White Australia and by her quiet dignity and the dignity of her colleagues in the way they described what had happened to them. I recall thinking at the time that if I had been in their circumstances I probably would have been far more angry and hostile towards the members of parliament of both political parties who joined in the celebration than those women were. Instead of hostility and anger, what we saw was a very dignified and clear statement that this had happened and that they did not want any further nuclear waste imposed on their country. Fifty years after Totem 1 was detonated, we have seen a massive increase in radiation related illnesses and genetic birth defects in the Indigenous communities in far north South Australia. I emphasise again that these women are all survivors of the atomic testing program and to a great extent this does inform their opposition to the proposal for a nuclear waste dump.</para><para>These are the sorts of stories of our past that must be told and that we must continue to remember and recognise, not simply because we want to trawl through history and not because we have a black armband view of history but because it does inform the present. This history of shameful disregard for Indigenous communities over the last five decades, which is perhaps most starkly exemplified by the nuclear testing regime, stands as a stark reminder to this parliament as to what we must now do to heal those relationships and to ensure that the voice of Indigenous people is heard when considering many aspects of government policy. It is a sad irony that these women, who have lived through these tests and whose families have been affected by the subsequent radiation fallout, are those who are now struggling to ensure that this federal government does not impose yet more nuclear waste on the state of South Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Alternative Fuels </title><page.no>16365</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>16365</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to use the opportunity of the adjournment debate to summarise the debate earlier this afternoon on the matter of urgency. Senator Colbeck started the debate for the coalition by saying that alternative fuels had what he called a rolling five-year exemption and that that exemption was renewed in 2001. The problem with that statement is that the industry has for some time been pleading for certainty. They do not want rolling extensions of exemptions from the excise to be so short term. Investment decisions are made on time frames of much more than five years—10 years is the minimum. That is why a 10-year exemption from excise is an absolute minimum, which is presumably what the Nationals knew on the weekend when they moved the motion at their conference calling for a five-year extension and, therefore, a 10-year exemption for ethanol. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Colbeck said that no decision had yet been made. I think that is a nonsense. The decision was made in the last budget to apply an excise using full calorific value of the fuel—that is, it would be taxed on the amount of energy in it and that it would be equivalent to petrol and diesel. We know what that means. Depending on the fuel type, it will be somewhere between 20c and 25c a litre. That was spelt out very clearly in government budget documents. Senator Colbeck is saying that no decision has yet been made. If we can interpret that to mean the decision may be reversed, then I would be the first to welcome that decision because this, as I said earlier, is a disaster for the alternative fuel industry. It is going to close down entirely. I sincerely hope that Senator Colbeck is right in saying that the decision to apply excise on the basis of calorific value is not a final decision and that it is currently under review.</para><para>Senator Colbeck says that we should not be providing environment measures through tax exemptions. I would be quite happy if the alternative fuels industry had an excise applied to it and a credit was applied based on the environmental and other benefits of using that fuel. That is a perfectly logical and appropriate mechanism. Of course, we have seen no sign of the government doing that, except for with ethanol in the short time—the transition between now and 2008—when there is a compensating credit to be provided for ethanol so that we are not immediately swamped by imports of ethanol from Brazil. When exactly are we going to factor in those environmental health and resource security benefits? If you do not take them into account, then you do not get the benefit. </para><para>Senator Colbeck says the government is already doing a lot for biofuels. He went on to mention many programs that are under way, but pretty much all of them were instigated by the Democrats. The greenhouse gas abatement program, fuel standards, in-service testing and the alternative fuels conversion program were all initiatives of the Democrats. The last one that I mentioned, the alternative fuels conversion program, is not being taken up at present, and that is because the payback period is going to be too long if an excise is imposed. People out there in the transport industry are not stupid. They can work out the figures and do the mathematics, and they say, `This is not worth my dollar or worth my while to proceed with.' Either there is uncertainty on the part of the government or now we have certainty and that means excise. Whatever way you look it, it does not stack up.</para><para>Senator Colbeck mentions the AGO grant to BP for the E10 fuel trial which was, he says, `a technical success'—that is right—but has been dropped because of lack of consumer confidence. I blame both major parties for that: the ALP for its purely politically driven attacks and the government for not coming to the rescue of the industry and insisting that confidence be built in it and defending it. Instead of that, they sat back and did nothing. So if the E10 fuel trial was not a success then both major parties have to answer to that. </para><para>Senator McGauran said that this was a trivial motion, it was not urgent and there was no gravity associated with it. Senator McGauran, I ask you to tell that to the LPG, CNG and biofuel industries. Tell that to Dalby, CSR and Multiplex, who have sunk $7 million already into ethanol production at Dalby that stopped precisely when the excise announcement was made. Tell that to APA, the biggest component manufacturer of alternative fuel parts in this country. They have just gone broke because their orders have dropped by 50 per cent, and that drop is likely to continue.  </para><para>Senator McGauran's piece de resistance was that the Democrats have no policies. Senator McGauran, what I would really like to do is give you a cabinet submission that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services invited me to make based on a meeting I had with him on 15 September. It is approximately 12 pages long and sets out a number of things: the effects of applying excise based on calorific content; why Australia's transport fuels policies should include alternative fuels; why Australia's transport policy needs to foster all of these alternative fuels in the mix—for instance, alternative fuels are still cleaner than even ultra-low sulphur diesel and petrol; energy security; fuel policy in other countries that provides them with a competitive advantage; capitalising on Australia's natural resources; and rural and regional opportunities. I would have thought you would be interested in that, Senator McGauran. It goes on to talk about government promises on measures for a better environment, the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme, biofuels and cleaner transport—all of which have been ignored in this decision—the approach that would deliver a diverse fuel mix in Australia, confidence building in alternative fuels, particularly ethanol, and overcoming the short-term political mess that both major parties have ended up causing.</para><para>In our view, we do need a diverse fuel mix. It needs to have in it LPG, CNG, bio-fuels and, eventually, hydrogen. There is a range of very good reasons for taking this approach. You start with a target, you decide where you want to go and then you work backwards from that. LPG may be able to take an excise earlier than other fuels, because it has been around for 20 years, but CNG will not and biofuels will not. They need extra assistance to get economies of scale, to get their infrastructure in place, to get the networks going and, most importantly, to get the consumers confident about their fuel. We have said that you should take into account resource availability.</para><para>We have 500 years of natural gas that is available into the future, including feedstock. There are a lot of waste products, particularly from agricultural processes, that could be turned into ethanol and other products. We have economies of scale that need to be taken into account and realistic payback periods for viability. We need relative environmental effects. As I have said, all of these alternative fuels have different benefits with regard to the environment and clean air—which is what we should all be interested in—so you need to take those into account. You need to look at the economic benefits, particularly for country areas, and at jobs. We need to look at national energy security.</para><para>The government may not think this is important, but we are running out of our locally produced oil and we are becoming more and more dependent on the Middle East, as is the rest of the world. Excise rates based on calorific values, as proposed, are a nonsense. Let us look at ethanol. It may have a lower energy content per volume, but what does it do for improving fuels by virtue of the fact that it is an oxygenate? It can be a substitute for the many, often toxic, materials that need to go into petrol to boost its oxygen qualities. </para><para>Our policy is for rebates or credits against the excise which are phased out as target milestones are met. You start with the target and then you work out milestones, you work out how to get there and then you put in place the measures to do that. We need OEM assistance packages. That is, vehicles that come off the production line cost a lot more money to produce for alternative fuels, and we need to assist those. We need to extend current grants for alternative fuels to light and medium vehicles. We need to establish an alternative fuels commission within the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to provide advice and policy direction. At the present time, there are at least four departments of government that are dabbling in this question, not least of which is the Prime Minister's own department. We need to sort this matter out. We need to have a direction to go in and we need to seriously put in place the measures that would achieve that. Senator McGauran, I encourage you to be involved in such a policy debate within your party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title><page.no>16368</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>16368</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week in both chambers much has been said about the victims and families affected by the Bali bombings and how their lives changed forever on 12 October last year. For me, the constituent calls commenced at approximately 4 a.m. Perth time on 13 October. I want to take this opportunity today to make mention of some of the people in Western Australia who worked behind the scenes as part of a massive team effort from all kinds of support organisations to help in their own small way to ease the burden of tragic loss and injury bestowed on so many people in my home state.</para></talk.start><para>Their efforts were particularly noticed by the Kingsley Football Club community after losing seven members in Bali. Kingsley was the most affected community in terms of the single greatest loss of life in Australia. I think it is beyond the comprehension of most of us as to how that event in Bali has affected so many people involved with that football club. Just to give you an idea, many players from Kingsley who died in the bombings took a very long time to be identified and to be brought home to their loved ones. After 12 October last year, nearly every week for seven to eight weeks there was a boy's remains flown back to Perth and a funeral for the club members and families to attend. It was nearly Christmas by the time they had buried their last mate, the oldest player being 30 years of age and the youngest being 18.</para><para>It is something you never want to have to comprehend in a country such as ours, but Bali has forced us to do just that. Most people who helped those affected by Bali that I came across through my office would say that they were just doing their job and would never seek to gain recognition. They were not just doing their jobs. It is important to recognise exactly how they did go above and beyond the call of their duty. This included the staff from the state based Department of Community Development, who were charged with the task of going out to the airport to meet those families who had come back from Bali without a loved one. They wanted to ensure that these people knew they were there to help and that they were not alone.</para><para>Often, when one flight was coming in late at night, the staff would then sleep on the couches at the airport so as not to miss another flight coming in very early the next morning. I know that other counselling based staff from DCD, as well as volunteer counsellors who in particular became part of the Kingsley Football Club, would provide a calm presence and a shoulder to lean on in those first few weeks when there was a lot of well-meaning people trying to make sense of what had happened and what to do next. They would open avenues where before they had appeared closed. They often offered referrals to help with everyday things, such as money to pay rent and other mundane domestic tasks. They could call to arrange professional counselling or sometimes they were there to listen. </para><para>There was also a group of Federal Police officers who had heard about a young German man evacuated to Perth with very severe burns who was going to be celebrating his 21st birthday before his family had a chance to make the long journey from Germany to Perth to see him. These officers made a special visit to his hospital bed with a present of an Akubra hat and a bit of birthday cheer to lift his spirits, and I am sure the thoughts of these total strangers did just that.</para><para>Then there were the Centrelink staff who were on call in Perth for 24 hours a day and who were happy to help my staff when they would ring on a Saturday afternoon to arrange a flight for a family member to visit a burns victim who had been evacuated to Adelaide or some other far-flung capital in Australia instead of Perth. It was no problem for them to make the link between people and bureaucracy so smooth that people affected by the Bali atrocity could go and get on with what they had to without the additional worry and without the worry of red tape.</para><para>There was also the local state member for Kingsley, the Hon. Cheryl Edwardes, who showed time and time again that there are still some local parliamentary members out there who completely defy public cynicism about politicians. She was a rock for the Kingsley Football Club. She was there for every grieving parent, for club officials, for players who returned after surviving the blast, for every constituent, no matter how they were affected by the Bali tragedy. Any day of the week, any time of the night, they knew they could rely on Cheryl to open her door to them and to help them through what was a completely unprecedented time of grief and confusion. It was Cheryl who suggested and then facilitated a relief fund committee to assist in disseminating the donations that poured into the club after the Bali tragedy. She ensured that it was a legally formed and aboveboard fund so that the club would not end up in any auditing trouble while they handled these donations—and we are talking about quite large sums, in excess of $100,000. </para><para>She rallied local organisations and charities to donate money, as well as donations in kind, and I know that there are very few people who can refuse a dynamo like Cheryl. For weeks after Bali, donations were coming into her office from the local clothing boutique to the neighbouring retirement village, which did a whip-round to help Kingsley victims and their families. This showed that a compassionate, hardworking local member could also have constituents from the same stock with the same community spirit. I know she is still helping in any way she can for the club and was there in Bali on Sunday to support her local club members—something that I am sure everyone from the football club greatly appreciated.</para><para>The personal sacrifice and genuine support that Cheryl Edwardes has shown in the past 12 months to the Kingsley community will most likely never be the subject of a commemorative newspaper article, medal of honour or anything of that nature. That isn't what she is about. She is simply a hardworking local member who was placed in an extraordinary set of circumstances and rose to the challenge in a way not many of us could manage so admirably. I take my hat off to you, Cheryl, and put on record that I am glad I was able to assist you in whatever small way I could.</para><para>I want to also pay a short tribute to one of my staff members, Rebecca Horton, who I seconded to Cheryl's office to assist for some three months with these technical and difficult issues for the members of the Kingsley Football Club and their families and broader community. It was an amazing effort by Rebecca to deal with these tragic events and these people in such a personable, friendly and efficient way. I extend my sincere thanks to Rebecca for that. To all the staff behind the scenes, from local and federal departments and other organisations in Western Australia who are still helping those in need after the Bali event, I offer you my wholehearted gratitude. On behalf of all Western Australians I say thank you. Continue doing what you are doing for those victims. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Shenman, Mr George</title><page.no>16370</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>16370</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to speak about a man who has for many years worked and provided inspiration as a great social justice advocate in Tasmania. He is a quiet man who has paved the way. He has been a great example to many Tasmanian ALP members and social justice advocates and has been a great example and inspiration to me in particular. His determination, despite many personal tragedies and health problems, to tenaciously work for the rights of others, in my mind, makes George Shenman a great person.</para></talk.start><para>Like many of our Australian immigrants, George's life before reaching Australia was one that those born in Australia can only read about. It is quite fascinating. George Shenman was born on 24 February 1926 in the Soviet Embassy in Berlin. George's parents were socialists, part of the bolshevist revolution. His father, Aaron, was a member of the politburo and President of the State Bank of the USSR. Maria, his mother, the first woman to graduate in law from Moscow University, worked in Lenin's office. It is amazing that he ended up in the Labor Party. They lived and travelled between Berlin, Moscow and The Hague until the family finally fled to the United Kingdom. The move was necessary, as Aaron, George's father, had fallen out of favour with Stalin, and the family's safety was paramount. George attended school in Berkhampsted until he and his mother moved to Australia to seek refuge, his father fearing that the Germans would invade England.</para><para>The trip to Australia in 1940 itself was not uneventful. The ship they travelled on collided with another and the passengers spent a few months in Cape Town waiting to find passage to Australia. Whilst in South Africa, George was unaware of the issues surrounding race and he happily played with all children, defying those who told him whom he was not to play with and whom he was to play with. In Australia, George attended the Armidale School. This is where he was to forge lifelong friendships.</para><para>He and his best friend, Keith, moved on to study veterinary science together at the University of Sydney, qualifying in 1950. George decided to travel to England for a while to practise as a vet and met his wife, of 51 years, the fantastic fellow veterinarian Doreen. They moved to Tasmania in 1953 and began a family when their eldest daughter, Susan, was born. George and Doreen lived in small rural communities and quickly became a part of them. Being natural activists they joined local groups and associations. They moved from the north-east of Tasmania to the north-west and on to the south-east of South Australia. They remained there for 11 years before moving back to England for a short stay.</para><para>The family, now with four children, moved back to Tasmania in the late 1960s, but this time to Hobart where they have stayed. George's community service is extensive. In veterinary practice, he, Doreen and his partner, Michael Heynes, provided free treatment and medication to the Guide Dogs for the Blind and the Canine Defence League Dogs Home. George and Michael Heynes have both been recognised as life members of the Guide Dogs Association. George has been state president of the Australian Veterinary Association and was rewarded for his service to the organisation by life membership. </para><para>His interest in the peace movement was fuelled by the Vietnam War and the moratorium marches. In the late seventies, he and Doreen established the Hobart Peace Group and later People for Nuclear Disarmament. George's interest in the promotion of human rights continued through his membership and work with the United Nations Association of Australia Tasmania Branch. During his period as state president he was an advocate of the independence of East Timor and an opponent of the Gulf War. He was instrumental in establishing the Human Rights Week Organising Committee with fellow human rights advocate Barry Smith. George, a lifelong member of the association, remains an active member, currently holding the position of vice-president.</para><para>George also pursued his interest in his first language, Russian. Speaking Russian as a child, he never learnt to read or write it. He studied in Hobart for a time and soon became proficient. In 1984 he travelled to Moscow and studied Russian at the Pushkin Institute, graduating with a diploma of Russian language. He now teaches Russian language at the University of the Third Age. George's devotion to extending the hand of friendship to the Soviet Union was seen by his membership and longstanding support of the Australia-USSR Friendship Society.</para><para>In 1978 this same commitment to social justice issues and equal opportunity—and the Labor Party's potential for initiating and instigating policies that would build better lives and futures for all Australians—drew George to the Labor Party. He has served on numerous committees and is happy to share his thoughts and opinions with others. One of my fondest memories of George is of an extensive raffle ticket selling exercise throughout the pubs of north Hobart. From memory, we did relatively well.</para><para>As all good party members know, polling booths are invariably—especially if you are allocated to them—in the coldest and windiest positions. It almost always rains or, in the case of Tasmania, snows on the day. I was talking to my colleague Senator Conroy earlier about the 1987 election. That was a doozey if you were living in places like Tasmania or, as Senator Conroy was at that point, helping out in Ballarat. George's commitment to the party meant he has often stayed out in constant rain to staff booths all day without complaint and then stayed on at the same booth to scrutineer.</para><para>To recognise their extraordinary commitment, George and Doreen were presented with life membership of the party in 1999. Despite ill health, George and his wife, Doreen, are still actively involved in the Labor Party. George is still on two committees as well as being an active member of his branch. They are also actively involved in Tasmanians for Refugees, the reconciliation movement and the new groundswell of the peace movement brought on by the war in Iraq. In fact, there is not a social justice rally or meeting where you will not find George and Doreen Shenman.</para><para>The most wonderful qualities that George possesses are his great wit, his welcoming smile, his commitment to his family and his innate self-deprecation. George does not think that he is any better than anybody else or that anybody else is better than him. He loves all his children and grandchildren, but, especially, he loves his fantastic wife and co-conspirator, Doreen. I stand here tonight to pay respect and homage to a person who has worked tirelessly for social justice and equality for all of us throughout his life. Thank you, George, for your enthusiasm and your humanity. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lifeline Australia</title><page.no>16372</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16372</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Several weeks ago I had the honour of officially launching the new Lifeline centre in Armidale in northern New South Wales. I rise tonight to pay homage to the valuable contribution that volunteer organisations such as Lifeline make to rural communities.</para></talk.start><para>Since Lifeline was established by the Reverend Alan Walker in the early 1960s, it has had a long history of providing immediate service to people in rural and remote areas. It plays a key role in assisting individuals to cope with problems in their lives, with the only 24-hour crisis counselling service in Australia. Lifeline counsellors are available all over Australia in cities and regional areas. In addition, Lifeline plays a vital and pivotal role in the care and help for people at critical points in their lives. Lifeline makes a unique contribution to building communities' capacity to assist others, through its education and training programs, which support local community volunteers.</para><para>Lifeline is an accredited training body that offers approved qualifications in telephone counselling, assessment and workplace training, and responsible services to gambling. Lifeline's focus on providing help to communities is consistent with the National Mental Health Strategy's action plan for rural and remote communities. This plan aims to give communities the skills to respond to their own needs and to build resilience to adversity.</para><para>More than 10,000 Australian volunteers contribute to Lifeline's community services. Many of these services are made available to rural communities. The Australian government is pleased to recognise and support the work of Lifeline in rural Australia by providing funding under the Regional Health Services Program. The broad aim of this program is to support communities to identify primary health care priorities relating to the prevention and treatment of illness in small rural and remote towns. This program is one of a number of measures that the Australian government has taken in order to break down the barriers that rural communities face in gaining access to health care services.</para><para>In the 2000 federal budget, the Australian government announced the $562 million rural health strategy—the largest ever effort by an Australian government to redress the historical imbalance between city and rural health areas. Since then, we have continued our commitment to improving health services for Australians living in regional locations. This was further demonstrated in this year's federal budget. Over the next four years the Australian government has committed $46.2 million to maintain funding for the Regional Health Services Program, providing primary health care that normally would not be available in small rural communities.</para><para>The Australian government is working in partnership with Lifeline to expand services in rural areas, including increased access to, availability of and quality of counselling services through Lifeline. People living in rural and regional areas suffer the same personal problems as people living in cities; however, they generally have much less access to counselling services. Under this Australian government program, we are now providing $1.3 million extra to Lifeline Australia for a range of new services, including $50,000 for the establishment of the Armidale Lifeline centre, which my wife and I opened. My wife, Pam, is the CEO of Lifeline in the Hunter Valley.</para><para>In many cases, it is extremely difficult for people who live in isolated areas to find people to talk to about their problem. Lifeline aims to raise awareness in the community about the plight of those with depression, to make the community see depression as a valid illness and to help those affected by it to cope. Domestic violence is another issue that Lifeline is equipped to handle, and to give information to help those affected by domestic violence to gain strength and make informed choices in their lives. Lifeline helps those with gambling addictions to break the habit and move on to more constructive activities. Relationship advice is a key service at Lifeline. By providing quality information via the telephone, Lifeline is teaching the community the value of happy and healthy relationships. </para><para>Lifeline is frequently contacted on the issue of family financial management. Helping families in financial need to take control and manage themselves is a vital outcome of Lifeline services. Youth issues are also dealt with by Lifeline. Boredom, drugs, unemployment and youth stress are areas in which Lifeline makes a real difference in people's lives. Lifeline also works in the area of mental health, offering advice or support services to those affected by mental illness and the ones who care for them. In this way, Lifeline is making a difference in many communities. Helping people to come to terms with living with disability is another area in which Lifeline offers its service to the community. Ageing communities also benefit from its services.</para><para>Lifeline is not just a telephone counselling service. It also offers programs to help people cope with adversity through suicide prevention education, legal and community information services and recycled clothing and goods stores. Lifeline's web site is an online resource that offers a wealth of information for individuals and communities. The web site contains details of Lifeline's counselling services; Living Works, which is a suicide intervention training program; and Just Ask, which is a mental health information service for rural Australia. All these are available on the web site. Lifeline.org.au works to complement the counselling service and contains details of Lifeline services across Australia. Over half a million people use Lifeline services every year and, now that we have opened the centre in Armidale, people on the northern tablelands will be supported by their own volunteers rather than having to rely on other services that are more distant. This project is a good example of how government and non-government organisations can work together with local communities to create a vital human service.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title><page.no>16373</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>16373</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to speak of the detention of David Hicks, an Australian citizen who has been held in a purpose-built US military detention centre in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since November 2001. This is the second time I have spoken on this issue in the Senate. In March this year I presented the Senate with a petition signed by 1,600 South Australians calling for a fair go for this Australian citizen. Yesterday I tabled a further petition with over 400 names of people who wished to add their voices to the calls for better treatment for Mr Hicks. David Hicks was captured by the US military in Afghanistan almost two years ago. He was then transported to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where he has been for a period approaching two years. He is joined there by fellow Australian Mamdouh Habib, who is from Sydney. During the time of their incarceration, neither Mr Hicks nor Mr Habib has had access to Australian consular support nor has either been able to access Australian legal representation.</para></talk.start><para>As I told the Senate in March, the actions of the United States government in its treatment of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay amount to a breach of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva convention in relation to prisoners of war. Yet the Australian government remains silent. For over 1½ years the Australian Labor Party has been urging the government to make strong representations to the United States, and use up some of our saved-up goodwill, in order to get better treatment and justice for one of our citizens. The disturbing thing is that the only US combatant captured for fighting for the Taliban, John Walker Lindh, was offered a criminal trial in his home country with full legal rights and due process under US law. The Australian government, on the grounds of the value of upholding Australian citizenship and the rule of law, should demand the same for Australians in the same situation as a US citizen. </para><para>I am not saying here that David Hicks is innocent. He could well be guilty of some crime, in which case he deserves punishment. If there is a case to answer then he must be brought to justice. What I am arguing is that there are fundamentally important procedures, rights and principles in this case that are being ignored and undermined. The Australian government must advocate on behalf of its citizens. No person should be subjected to cruel and indefinite detention, and everyone deserves a fair and open trial. The US justice department has ruled out a trial of either Mr Hicks or Mr Habib. Even if a trial were to take place, it would not conform to international standards of justice. In fact, a report in August this year in the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> suggested that Hicks and two British detainees were going to plead guilty in a plea bargain with the US government. Such a suggestion intensely angered Mr Hicks's Australian lawyers. His legal team, as I said, have been denied access to their client and have had no opportunity to know what charges he faces, let alone to advise him of his options. His Adelaide lawyer, Stephen Kenny, said:</para><quote><para>After 18 months in a cage ... he's clearly not in a position to make an informed decision ... We don't know what the military has told him about his options.</para></quote><para>In the past week, new and disturbing allegations have come out of Guantanamo Bay. According to American based Australian lawyer Richard Bourke, the US military is torturing the detainees to force confessions from them. One detainee told Mr Bourke that he was tied to a post and shot with rubber bullets and that others were forced to kneel in the sun until they collapsed. According to Mr Bourke:</para><quote><para>The reports about the number of suicide attempts and the mental health of the detainees is evidence of the treatment that they're receiving.</para></quote><para>Mr Hicks's father, Terry Hicks, believes that there are other forms of torture being used against detainees, including belting the bottom of the detainees' feet. Both the United Nations Association of Australia and the Law Council of Australia have called for an immediate investigation into these claims. What has been the Australian government's response to these claims? In an interview reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> yesterday, Mr Ruddock indicated that there would be no softening of the government's attitude towards the fate of the two Australians in Guantanamo Bay. While Mr Ruddock confirmed that inquiries were being made with the US authorities about the recent allegations of torture, he was reported as having said:</para><quote><para>I am sceptical would be a way of putting it—we've been assured by the US that people have been humanely treated.</para></quote><para>It appears that for the Australian government and for the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, Mr Hicks represents less an issue of seeking justice for an Australian citizen and more an issue of not troubling our American allies. </para><para>It has now been over three months since the United States announced—due largely to the representations made by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to the United States President—certain concessions in its procedures for dealing with the detainees. Yet no action has occurred. As I said in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> at the time:</para><quote><para>Aided by Australia's strong friendship with America, the Prime Minister should also make strong personal representations to the US President to secure justice for David Hicks. Instead, he sent to Washington one of his junior ministers, Senator Ellison, who simply secured the same concessions that the British had already fought for.</para></quote><para>It now seems that even these concessions have amounted to nothing. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General must use the occasion of the US President's visit to Australia next week to demand a better deal for Mr Hicks.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party have consistently argued for better treatment for David Hicks. Labor created the US alliance and will always support it; however, we understand that our close relationship with the United States is strong enough to survive disagreements on fundamental differences in policy and outlook. This situation—where citizens of our country are being detained without charge in another country—is a perfect example of when a mature, confident nation such as Australia should be able to stand up and make representations to another country, especially a close ally such as the United States, for the rights of its citizens.</para><para>While the world has changed after September 11, we must not lose sight of principles such as the rule of law, the abolition of torture and the modern system of criminal justice. These principles are exactly what free nations like ours should be trying to protect, not disregard. We cannot allow important principles such as these to be sacrificed in a climate of fear and uncertainty. David Hicks may well be guilty; however, he must be given the chance to plead his case and clear his name. The Australian government must understand that the war on terrorism should not diminish the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I have no idea what David Hicks may have done, what laws he may have broken or whether he is guilty of any crime. But to be honest, that is not really the point at issue here nor is it what the 400-plus petitioners were concerned about when they signed the petition I tabled in the Senate yesterday. The issue is that an Australian's rights have been violated. I hope the new Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, can do what his predecessor Mr Williams did not—that is, make a stand on behalf of a fellow Australian.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>16375</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>16375</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On any analysis the much heralded United States led `road map to peace' for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in shreds. Another one bites the dust. The merciless horror of the suicide bombers upon Israel's civilian population, of which men, women, children and babies have been targets, has again snuffed out the hope of peace—though I add, hope itself shall never die. It is with black humour that I note the last time I spoke on the Middle East conflict in May 2002 I said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... Yasser Arafat in his headquarters at Ramallah, has yet again taken the area to new heights of terror and hatred.</para></quote><para>Since this statement, death by terror has continued to escalate to unimaginable levels. The terror plots coming out of the Palestinian territories have taken on an even greater evil—they are all designed to sink any hope of the road map to peace working and, moreover, any chance of Palestinian democracy being achieved. The latest suicide bombings—namely, the Jerusalem bus bombing on 19 August, the Hillel Cafe in Jerusalem on 9 September and the restaurant in Haifa on 4 October—have invited the strongest retaliation from the Israelis. That retaliation has included the assassination of Hamas leaders and striking at terrorist bases inside Syria, along with this week's military incursion into the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. These actions are wholly justified in the name of the self-defence of their country. </para><para>Moreover, this unbridled terrorist activity also led to the resignation in September of the first Prime Minister of the Palestinian territories, Abu Mazen. His resignation was on the grounds that he was given no power or authority over the Palestinian security forces so he could act against the terrorist groups set up within Palestine. The Prime Minister had said on his appointment that he would progress the road map to peace by acting against the terrorist groups based in Palestine. But Abu Mazen lost in a power struggle to long-time foe Yasser Arafat, who has proved once again that he is still the power behind all aspects of Palestinian life regardless of his international isolation. Now it seems that newly appointed Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei has faced the exact same powerlessness in his position, and it has been reported that he is also on the verge of resignation.</para><para>As the Senate would be aware, that is the state of play in the Middle East today with its usual mixture of hopeful developments followed by shattered hopes. This familiar and old story will continue to be told as long as the central destructive character remains: Yasser Arafat. Yasser Arafat's history of hate, lies and terrorism dates back to 1948 when he joined a resistance group to fight the creation of the state of Israel. In 1959 he co-founded the nationalist group Fatah, which translates as `armed struggle'. In a bloody struggle in 1969, Fatah eventually took control of the PLO, with which Arafat is most commonly identified, and thus commenced Arafat's corrupt and violent regime and reign.</para><para>In one way or another, Arafat has been associated with every terrorist attack upon Israel and its people—from as far back as his association with the members of the Black September group, who were most noted for their kidnapping and murder of Israeli Olympic athletes in 1972, through to the Palestinian intifada and now the notorious suicide bombings. He knows nothing else but terrorism. He wants nothing else in his pursuit to destroy the state of Israel. His seemingly ailing physical condition of late has not and will not extinguish his burning heart of hate for the Jews. We know his life dedication by his own words `to throw the Jews into the sea'. Under Yasser Arafat, every opportunity for peace and to advance the welfare of the Palestinian people has been lost.</para><para>What choice does Israel have but to respond swiftly and ruthlessly and to use its obvious might to protect its land and its people—a people under relentless terrorist attacks by the Palestinian terrorist groups which are themselves supported by corrupt and extreme regimes in the Arab world? What other country would not respond in the same way as Israel? Australia would do the same. Yet Israel has proven that it will cease using armed force against Palestinian targets if the campaign of terrorism against its citizens and the state stops. The opposite is not true. History shows that throughout Yasser Arafat's reign, right up until today, peace between the Jews and Palestinians has always been within reach. What must be done can now only be done without Yasser Arafat. As long as Yasser Arafat and his terrorist regime remain, lasting peace will never be brokered. This will be to the detriment of the welfare of the Palestinian people, who continue to slip and slide further into misery and poverty while he reigns over a corrupt regime. I understand and support the Israeli government's declaration last month to remove the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat. The wording of the Israeli government's announcement has left open the meaning of the word `removal'. The Israeli cabinet's statement claimed that Arafat was `a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians' and, as such, removal was to be carried out in a manner and at a time that will be decided upon. Whilst it was widely accepted that the word `removal' meant exile, in its editorial the <inline font-style="italic">Jerusalem Post </inline>took the meaning a step further when it said: </para><quote><para>The world will not help us; we must help ourselves. We must kill as many of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders as possible, as quickly as possible, while minimizing collateral damage, but not letting that damage stop us. And we must kill Yasser Arafat, because the world leaves us no alternative.</para></quote><para>In response, an Arafat aide warned an attempt to harm President Arafat would lead the region to the edge of the abyss. The truth is that these are very idle words, given the region is already looking into the abyss. Yasser Arafat long ago took this conflict to the abyss. His hate for peace has kept the conflict at the abyss. Therefore, I call on the Australian government, my government, to recognise that the existing Palestinian regime under Yasser Arafat can never be reformed and must be confronted. This means that we can no longer support the legitimacy of the current President with all his links to terrorism.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Whyalla Career Employment Group</title><page.no>16377</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>16377</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about an awards ceremony that I was invited to attend on 3 September last year. Circumstances prevented my being able to bring that ceremony to the attention of the Senate, but I do so tonight. The ceremony was to mark the 15th anniversary of the Career Employment Group in Whyalla, my home town. The Career Employment Group began as a very modest venture, with very limited resources, in 1988. Along with its modest resources, it being a modest venture, it did have a great deal of support from those who thought it would fail. The majority of people were convinced that this venture would be a fly-by-night operation to get one or two people rich from the benefits that could be reaped from training. I recall that the CEG was housed at its beginnings in a very small room at the Whyalla campus of TAFE. The talk at the time was that this enterprising group would not make it through the first year. That was coming from civic leaders, the union movement and, sadly, the government of the day.</para></talk.start><para>But they did make it through the first year. Indeed, on the occasion of the first 15 years celebration they could proudly boast of having employed almost 1,300 apprentices and trainees who have worked for more than 600 businesses statewide. The first intake of young people in 1988 comprised seven apprentices in two trade disciplines: fitting and turning and boilermaking. This is vastly different from today's operation when there are 215 apprentices and trainees in more than 70 vocations. These vocations cover the broadest possible range, from areas as diverse as the traditional trades, deep sea fishing, retail, gardening and clerical work.</para><para>As a leading employer of apprentices and trainees, particularly in the north and west of South Australia, CEG goes further than most other group training schemes. They go further than the expected organising and monitoring of job placement people, they go further than organising and monitoring apprentices, trainees and employers to be sure that the relationship gets off on the right footing and continues in a way that maintains harmony throughout the relationship and they go further than ensuring the trainees' needs and travel arrangements are met. It is a big task for a small group of people to comply with, as the training and travel needs are quite a significant part. They often have to arrange for people to get from the west coast of South Australia, from Port Lincoln and Whyalla and from the northern, remote areas to Adelaide for training. This is all organised and taken care of with the full knowledge of the individuals taking part and, indeed, in most cases, of their families, because their families are also living quite remote from the young people in training. </para><para>This group actually goes to the extent of forming a close relationship with each of its apprentices. It is a genuine, close relationship, with a lot of mentoring and a lot of care given to the young folk who are living distant from their families. A lot of counselling and support is given that would normally be given by the families when an apprentice is in training. The group takes on a very large, important and responsible role to ensure that the trainee has not only the work training skills but the living away from home skills and the ability to survive in what is, for quite a number of trainees, a hostile environment to them. This personalised care for the individual has led to the success of the Career Employment Group. </para><para>I spent some time on the board of the CEG when I was a union official living in Whyalla, and I know the highs in their history have been balanced out by their fair share of lows. But the strength and character of those involved has ensured that the highs vastly outweigh the lows that have confronted them. One very real example of the low points that they were confronted with was about 13 years ago, when the now South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, then in his capacity of Minister for Employment and Further Education, helped by providing emergency funding to pay the apprentices and the staff of the organisation. It is a testimony to the hard work in and the genuine commitment to this venture that that money was repaid to the state government in full, and from there they have gone from strength to strength.</para><para>While all this sounds very positive, CEG is confronted with the pressing need to answer the question of public liability insurance and the effects that that has on host employers. Group training is seen by insurers to be in the same category as labour hire companies, and this has led to greater risk and higher premiums for host employers. An example of this is where the host employer handed back two apprentices because his public liability premiums increased from $5,000 to $90,000, as well as having to pay the first $150,000 of each claim. I believe that the federal government has a very real role to play in ensuring that these types of situations do not inhibit the good work of those who are seeking to ensure that Australia is supplied with the right people for the right jobs in our future. What the CEG is doing is exactly what is required—and that is clearly seen from the evidence that has been given to the workplace relations inquiry into Australia's future skills needs.</para><para>Clearly the CEG has put its early doubters to shame. It has survived, and it will be around for many years to come, despite some of the hardships confronting it at the moment. Like the South Australian Premier, the Hon. Mike Rann, I am looking forward to an invitation to attend the awards ceremony to celebrate the completion of 30 years of the CEG's operations, providing young people with the opportunity to serve South Australian industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family and Community Services</title><page.no>16379</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>16379</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I might be new to the portfolio of Family and Community Services as minister, but I am not new to the portfolio in terms of my experience as a senator. I have learnt very quickly about the antics of and the reckless disregard for the facts by my Labor counterpart, Mr Swan. He fires off media releases in rapid succession—he is Quick Draw McGraw when it comes to media. However, he has shot himself in the foot a number of times in the last week, and I have seen it a couple of times in the past few days. </para></talk.start><para>His antics are characterised by taking cheap political shots to try to needlessly scare and mislead the public about important issues. They are not worthy of the paper they are written on; they are not worthy of me doing a doorstop and bothering the journalists. He will be a bit like the boy who cried wolf. I think the journalists will begin—if they have not done so already—to see through him. I want to take the opportunity to set the record straight and to take to task some of Mr Swan's misleading statements. If he continues to do it, every Tuesday I will get up here and go through systematically, chapter and verse, the way in which he has misled the Australian public and played loose with the truth.</para><para>On Monday, under the headline `Patterson admits how mean and tricky its carer allowance review is', Mr Swan disingenuously claimed that I had overturned the government's undertaking that carers of dependent children with disabilities which are currently on the lists of recognised disabilities will not require medical review prior to their 16th birthday. That was totally wrong, totally misleading, and he ought to be ashamed of himself. The commitment stands.</para><para>What I said, which Mr Swan chose to misrepresent, was that, in line with what was previously announced by Senator Vanstone, Australian carers of dependent children with disabilities which are currently on the lists of recognised disabilities will not require medical review prior to their 16th birthday. Mr Swan needs to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> carefully before he issues press releases based on false assumptions about what has been said. I am not sure whether it is wilful misinterpretation or just plain stupidity. In line with continually improving the delivery of assistance to those with disabilities, the list of recognised disabilities has been and will be reviewed to ensure it is appropriate. Carers should feel secure that individuals who have a disability on the list of recognised disabilities will not be reviewed; only the list of conditions will be. As I said in question time yesterday:</para><quote><para>I believe the number of children who were reviewed and deemed to be still eligible would indicate that it is highly likely that those conditions will remain on.</para></quote><para>I was saying that it is highly likely, in the review, that those conditions will remain on the list. The children will keep being assessed under that list until they are 16. When the list is reviewed, as it is every two years—as I said in my answer—it is highly likely that those conditions will remain on, given the number of children who were reviewed and deemed to be still eligible.</para><para>If that is not bad enough, Mr Swan's efforts to mislead have seemingly snared at least one victim, and that is him. In what anyone would have called a confusing and topsy-turvy statement, Mr Swan ran out to call a doorstop this afternoon after question time. This is what he had to say:</para><quote><para>We supposedly had an iron-cast guarantee from Senator Vanstone that six disabilities would be removed from the list.</para></quote><para>I might give him some benefit of the doubt. He may have said `not removed from the list', but it is not in the transcript. He says:</para><quote><para>We supposedly had an iron-cast guarantee from Senator Vanstone that six disabilities would be removed from the list. It is clear from what Senator Patterson has said, they are on the list, and continue to be in the firing line of the Howard Government. </para></quote><para>He clearly has no idea what he is talking about. It is on the list; it is off the list. Nobody would know what on earth he is talking about. Those new disabilities that Senator Vanstone put on will mean that the carers of children assessed will remain eligible for the carers pension. The condition will be reviewed in due course, as has been and will be the case. Before Mr Swan goes running off to confuse and mislead, I would suggest that he sit down and have a little think, if he is capable of thinking, to be sure he does not bamboozle himself—as he has done—and bamboozle the public.</para><para>In that same press release, he said that `Senator Patterson argued that previously carer allowance was being applied for for children who are not, in fact, disabled.' He took part of a sentence—he did not even quote the full sentence, which would have made sense. I had said that, when Labor was in government, carer allowance was being applied for in situations where children were not, in fact, disabled. But the way he has chosen to quote it is totally out of context and totally misleading.</para><para>Today brought another new dawn, and Mr Swan must have been up at sunrise to dredge up the next instalment in his attempt to mislead the public. He issued yet another press release, headlined: `Government pays millionaire families, but won't pay catch-ups'. In that release, Mr Swan claims that:</para><quote><para>... the Government voted against Labor amendments to back-pay 25,072 families who were underpaid family tax benefit three years ago ...</para></quote><para>He then goes on, in the same release, to further claim that most of the 25,000 families are `owed a whole year's worth of payments by the government'. That is untrue. He is wrong. His deceit was further compounded in this release by misrepresenting my answer in Senate question time yesterday about a review of 664 income support customers with incomes apparently over $100,000. Either knowingly or otherwise, he appears to have mixed this group of people up with people who are not in receipt of income support. He needs to be more careful—but then, I do not think care appears to be his strong suit.</para><para>This evening Mr Swan issued another media release—it is like confetti warfare. This press release says, `Treasury admits most families don't want their tax returns stripped.' That is not what Treasury did. When we were having a discussion about the bill—Senator Bishop was here in the chamber—I was saying that we were opposing an amendment put forward by the Labor Party about allowing people to choose whether their tax rebate would be used to offset their family tax benefit. We were opposing that because the family tax benefit and the tax rebate are part of the total tax system and are reconciled at the end of the year. The Labor amendment would have had financial implications. Treasury had done some preliminary figures, and I said they were preliminary. I said I would go back and provide, for Senator Bishop, various assessments of people choosing that option. We do not know—none of us know—how many people will choose. Treasury does not know. We would know how many people would choose the option only at the end of a year in which it was operating, and I said that clearly in my discussion during the debate. But I said I would ask the Treasury to give estimates of whether it might be 25 per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent or 80 per cent. Treasury did not admit that most families do not want their tax returns stripped. That is absolute nonsense. They were saying that, if people chose the option that the Labor Party was putting forward, a debt, assessed as a public interest debt, would be incurred because people would be taking longer to pay back their family tax benefits. </para><para>I want the Labor Party to know that its amendments would have a financial implication. We have only had the amendments for a very short while. When the bill comes back, we will be able to give more details on the level of that cost depending on how many people, if they had the choice, would choose the Labor Party's option. I was just pointing out that there was a cost involved, and now we get this sort of press release. I would suggest that Mr Swan spend more time developing policy as well as some reforms like the government has made in social security, for example reducing the number of Youth Allowance payments from two down to one and streamlining other payments, making it clearer. I can go through a list of reforms that we have undertaken. Mr Swan needs to go back to the drawing board, stop all this nonsense, learn about the policies and find out what his portfolio is about. Otherwise he will find out that he will be a rooster in more than one way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Health Services</title><page.no>16381</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>16381</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on the adjournment this evening to speak again on the issue of health care for our serving ADF and special forces when deployed overseas in the context of their care downstream after discharge as veterans. The Senate will recall earlier remarks I have made about deep concerns held by veterans later in life that their illnesses are service related but without sufficient evidence either on their service record or in medical science to support any compensation claim. Past instances of this have been exposure to radiation in Japan after the war and during the atomic tests in the 1950s; exposure in Korea to a mix of chemicals, including pesticides; and, of course, Agent Orange in Vietnam. Despite royal commissions and other efforts, veterans with personal illness or birth defects in their children are not dissuaded from their view that their service is the root cause. This is the rationale for the pending inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee into the institutional arrangements looking after this matter.</para></talk.start><para>We should also remember that this is not just an issue of history. The deployments to East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq all have the same potential. Experience of the Gulf War, in 1991, remains current as well. Hence, this evening I wish to address one of the issues of risk—namely, depleted uranium—and in particular the risk of exposure of Australian troops. Since the Gulf War began in 1991, there has been a surge of unexplained respiratory illnesses, cancers and genetic deformities among the Iraqi people, allied veterans and their children. The official US death toll by the end of the conflict was reported as 300 dead and 500 wounded or ill. Today these figures have reportedly escalated to more than 8,000 dead and about 221,000 ill. Likewise, in Britain, more than 600 Gulf War veterans have now died and a further 9,000 are seriously ill with multiple ailments. The average monthly death rate in Iraq has rocketed from just over 2,000 in 1989 to 15,000 in more recent years. This recent fluctuation in service related deaths and illnesses is unparalleled. Depleted uranium is suspected as the primary cause. The fear we have is that Australians may have been exposed either as members of an Australian unit or during secondment to US and UK forces.</para><para>Depleted uranium is uranium 238—the remnants of fissionable isotopes extracted from the core for use as fuel for nuclear reactors or bomb material. Over the past half a decade, over 700,000 tonnes of depleted uranium have accumulated in the world, but it is only recently that the US and British militaries have discovered its usefulness in armament manufacture. Prior to its debut in the early 1990s, depleted uranium was regarded as nuclear waste. Producers of this biohazardous matter were therefore only too happy to give it to the US military, which solved existing storage problems. Alternative and safer materials such as tungsten were ignored or not used due to vast disparities in cost. </para><para>Uranium 238 is an extremely hard, heavy metal that is twice as dense as lead. It is incredibly indestructible, with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years and a boiling point of about 3,800 degrees Celsius. It also has superior armour-piercing capability, making it an ideal material for precision-guided projectiles and missiles. Unlike other heavy metals, which tend to flatten on impact at high speeds, depleted uranium is pyrophoric and hence ignites spontaneously on exposure to air. Upon ignition, however, up to 70 per cent of the depleted uranium oxidises into microscopic, insoluble particles. These particles are chemically toxic and can easily infiltrate the lungs if exposed.</para><para>Inhalation of depleted uranium poses the greatest danger. The particles reside in the lungs for years, emitting alpha radiation that damages soft tissue. As a carcinogen, it damages cells in the lung, bone, kidney, prostate, gut and brain and promotes cancer in those organs. Depleted uranium also enters the body through ingestion. Five years post the initial bombings of the Gulf War, depleted uranium particles remained in the air. The dust enters the soil, surface water and eventually ground water. These noxious particles are then deposited onto plants and grass that are grazed on by cattle and the like and eventually passed on to the unsuspecting top of the food chain—that is, people.</para><para>The transition of uranium 238 does not stop there, however. Iraq now has a higher than normal incidence of birth defects. Studies of Gulf War vets have found that excretion of depleted uranium through semen is not uncommon. Blood infections, respiratory problems and severe malformation of the head, limbs and genitalia are amongst some of the horrendous congenital defects. One survey of 250 veterans' families in the US revealed that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of children born since the Gulf War had rare genetic problems and illnesses.</para><para>What is worse, the horrifying effects of depleted uranium are a lot closer to home than we think. Australian service men and women in both the Gulf War and the more recent conflict in the Middle East are among those reporting symptoms of uranium related illnesses, generally described as `Gulf War syndrome' but on which research continues. Australia, we are told, stopped using depleted uranium munitions and armour in 1990 and has since ceased to use the substance as counterbalance weight in aircraft. However, we need an assurance that Australian forces are fully equipped to prevent exposure and to deal with it thoroughly. Australian service people are reporting illnesses that they believe are related to their service, with the possibility that the illnesses might derive from this very substance. The Gulf War Veterans' Health Study has not allayed those suspicions. These are serious claims. Unfortunately, the government does not seem to think so. In the past, the government has been quick to deny any suggestions that our returning troops should be tested for uranium contamination.</para><para>In August this year, urinary screening was at long last made available for Australian service men and women returning to Australia. This is a useful and worthwhile start. This, though, was clearly a change of heart. Only one month prior to the new offer, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, said that he was quite confident that the way in which our service men and women were employed or deployed would not have exposed them to any significant effects of depleted uranium. Perhaps the British government's decision to offer their returning troops urinary scans earlier this year prompted the change of heart. Despite Senator Hill's confidence, there is nothing to say that our troops were not in the vicinity of active depleted uranium munitions, particularly when the toxic dust is known to travel up to 10 kilometres with the wind. This is a distinct risk for those SAS whose movements are clandestine for good reason. In spite of recent action to test for uranium contamination amongst our troops, the government continues to demonstrate a less than desirable approach to the issue. It is frightening to think of how much more of this debilitating waste will be unleashed upon the world before we fully recognise the risks involved. </para><para>In conclusion, may I repeat the context in which I raise this issue on behalf of the ALP. We are very concerned at the risks we put in front of our military personnel abroad. We need to be as sure as we can that we know what we are doing, that we are properly prepared and that appropriate remedial action will always be immediately available for those troops on return to this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scouts Australia</title><page.no>16383</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>16383</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to talk about an important youth movement in Australia. Robert Putnam in his book, <inline font-style="italic">Bowling Alone</inline>, says that in the United States there has been a significant decline in the proportion of the population involved in community groups, sporting groups and P&amp;C associations. He says this has led to a significant decline in what has been termed `social capital'—that is, the ability of people to trust each other and work together towards common social goals. I think it is true that there has been a similar trend in this country, and there has certainly been a trend towards a breakdown of social capital among younger Australians.</para></talk.start><para>One organisation that has been working very hard for a very long time in this country and elsewhere to build social capital among young people particularly has been the Scouts. I acknowledge that the scouting movement may be unfashionable to many impressionable young people influenced by some of the popular values of today's culture. But trends come and go. The values of scouting are timeless and, in a world of moral relativism and uncertainty, are as relevant as ever. Scouts Australia remains the largest youth movement in this country, with over 80,000 boys and girls involved. The founder of scouting, Lord Robert Baden Powell, was a soldier who wanted peace. His rationale for founding the movement remains sound today. He said:</para><quote><para>Only through the education of the youth of the world, can world peace and understanding be achieved.</para></quote><para>Nearly 100 years later, Scouts Australia defines its mission as the following:</para><quote><para>To contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Promise and Law, to help build a better world, where people are self fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.</para></quote><para>Scouts Australia achieves this through the provision of opportunities for leadership and responsibility, learning by doing, encouragement of activities in small groups, an award scheme and a commitment to a code of living. At the heart of this, as senators are probably aware, is a wide range of attractive and challenging activities which include outdoor exploration and adventure. These activities very often carry an element of risk. That element of risk has caused Scouts Australia some considerable problems in recent years as it grapples with the consequence of rising public liability insurance premiums. </para><para>The cost and availability of public liability insurance in a range of community activities is an issue of great concern to all of us, particularly the government. Premiums have skyrocketed in recent years, and that is attributable to a number of circumstances. It is very difficult to exaggerate the effect of rising insurance premiums on a large number of community organisations, and I exhort particularly state and territory governments to accelerate their own programs of reform of tort law to ensure that many community based activities are able to proceed in acceptable circumstances. In the meantime, Scouts Australia's premiums continue to rise. If this trend does not quickly change, they will carry more financial risk with a diminishing funding base and there will be more activity exclusions. These escalating insurance costs will continue to be passed on to families, putting downward pressure on membership numbers. In the ACT, Scouts membership has fallen from 2,600 a decade ago to under 1,500 today.</para><para>Blaming the decline in membership on rising insurance costs would be misleading. Young people today have significantly more leisure options available to them and they have more purchasing power. They also live in a liberal and fluid society whose popular culture is based increasingly on electronic media and advertising rather than on the dominant institutions of 50 or 100 years ago. Yet scouting has an enormous amount to offer young people. In January this year, 150 Australians attended the second World Scout Jamboree in Thailand. Activities included visiting royal palaces, elephant riding, craft activities, competing in sporting tournaments, abseiling and badge swapping. Venturers from Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa joined in 12 days of friendship and fun. It was a truly international event. That same month, over 400 venturers and leaders from around the world attended the 12th Australian Venture here in the ACT, at Camp Cottermouth. Venturers participated in activities that included gliding, ballooning, sailing, surfing, scuba diving, whitewater rafting and caving.</para><para>I would like tonight to pay tribute not merely to the general aims of scouting in Australia but also to one particular person who typified the kind of commitment which scouting represents in this country. I pay tribute to Jack Deeble, a pioneer of the ACT scouting movement, who passed away in June of this year. Born in Melbourne in 1924, Jack joined scouting as a 10-year-old with the 1st Victorian Sea Scouts. He attended Melbourne High School and Melbourne Technical College. After war service with the Royal Australian Navy from 1942 to 1946, Jack returned to the sea scouts and was a scoutmaster from 1947 until 1955.</para><para>He worked in Melbourne until 1956, when he moved to Canberra to join the Academy of Science. In 1959, Jack was appointed scoutmaster of the Manuka scout hall. In 1961, he became the district commissioner of scouts in south Canberra. From this point, he filled the roles of Rover leader, assistant area commissioner—training, Woden Valley district commissioner, as well as group scoutmaster and senior scoutmaster at the Lake Burley Griffin Sea Scouts group. In 1969, he was appointed area commissioner for the then Canberra-Monaro area within the New South Wales branch of Scouts Australia. Arguably, his crowning achievement in the scouting movement was his involvement in the creation of a separate ACT branch of scouting in 1981, in which his close friend, the late Ross Hohnen, also played a significant role. Jack was chairman of the ACT branch until 1987. That same year, he was awarded the Silver Kangaroo, a major honour in the Australian scouting movement. </para><para>Jack Deeble's contribution to Australian society was not confined to scouting alone. At various times, he had been secretary to the Goodwin Homes for the Aged in Canberra, chairman of the ACT Child Welfare Committee, foundation rear commodore of the Canberra Yacht Club and was a member of its general committee for nearly 10 years. In 1988, Jack was awarded an Order of Australia Medal. At all times, Jack Deeble imparted to young Australians the values expressed in the scout law—values such as trustworthiness, loyalty, thrift, courage and cheerfulness. I commend Jack Deeble for his contribution to scouting and to the broader community over many years, and I commend Scouts Australia for their spiritual and practical commitment to the ideals that Jack Deeble lived by.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title><page.no>16385</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>16385</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with great disappointment that I rise again tonight to speak on an issue that I first raised in the Senate over 13 months ago—an issue which the Howard government has done very little to address. Before I do so, I would like to compliment Senator Kirk on her excellent contribution on the same issue earlier in the adjournment debate. The fact that Senator Kirk also chose to speak on this issue tonight demonstrates the importance the Labor Party puts on human rights and the rule of law.</para></talk.start><para>The issue concerns the detention of two Australian citizens in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba—held there by the United States military. It is an issue that continues to raise alarm throughout the Australian community—as it should, as it centres on this government's continual lack of assistance to Australian citizens overseas. The United States military has held Australian citizens Mr David Hicks and Mr Mamdouh Habib for the best part of two years, denied them fundamental human rights and effectively holds them incommunicado.</para><para>As an alert representative of the Australian people, I am alarmed at recent reports that suggest detainees in Guantanamo Bay, including the two Australians, are being subjected to US military torture tactics. Lawyers in the US have stated that detainees, including Hicks and Habib, have been tortured using medieval techniques to force confessions. Reports indicate that detainees have been tied to posts and shot with rubber bullets, while others have been forced to kneel cruciform in the sun until they have collapsed. Hicks's father has said he has also heard of torture tactics being used such as belting the bottoms of detainees' feet.</para><para>Reports of torture have resulted in organisations such as the Law Council and the United Nations Association of Australia calling for immediate investigations into the claims. However, the only response we have had from our federal government is to reassert that Hicks and Habib are being treated humanely. There is little expectation that the Prime Minister or any minister will bother raising the allegations of torture when the government recalls parliament next week for a brief speech by the US President, George W. Bush.</para><para>It is now widely recognised that the Australian government is doing little to ensure that the human rights of its citizens being held in Guantanamo Bay are upheld and respected. The Prime Minster must communicate Australia's concern about the current US policy of imprisonment without charge, trial or access to a lawyer and its contravening of multiple fundamental and longstanding principles of law. Amnesty International consistently states that it believes the US has violated many international laws in its treatment of `enemy combatants' being held indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay. </para><para>The period of two or so years the Australian detainees have awaited due process to run its course is outrageous at best and illegal at worst. It took over 500 days for the US to arrive at a decision that Mr Hicks is subject to the military order of 13 November 2001, thereby making him eligible for a trial before a military commission. It has now been over three months since the US made this announcement and still today there remains no indication as to when this trial may occur. For Mr Habib, there is still no indication as to when he may become eligible for a similar trial.</para><para>Mr Hicks's eligibility for trial before a military commission is of little comfort to Mr Hicks and his family in Australia, given there is no judicial review or avenue to appeal a decision of the commission and, even if acquitted, Mr Hicks may still be held indefinitely as an `enemy combatant'. However, it appears there may be little chance of Mr Hicks being acquitted, as it is widely understood that there is a very strong possibility that he may have been pressured into pleading guilty to relatively minor terrorist offences in return for a fixed jail term.</para><para>It is understood that the US administration is keen to have Hicks and a handful of other detainees accept a plea bargain in order to legitimise its policy of unlawful detention and to more easily process and find guilty most of the other 660 detainees. Representatives of the Hicks family in Australia have expressed concern that if David Hicks has indicated a willingness to enter a plea bargain, which may have been extracted through the use of torture tactics, he has had no legal advice as to what the outcome of such a plea bargain may be and he certainly does not know that his family's lawyers are trying to have him released on the grounds that he has not actually committed any crimes.</para><para>This kangaroo court that the US has constructed to process detainees is illegitimate, immoral and illegal in the eyes of many local and international institutions. It is ironic and hypocritical that, at a time when the US and Australian governments are running the mantra of democracy to justify war, one of the worst contraventions of democratic principles is occurring under the guise of the US administration and military and is backed by the Howard government. The Prime Minister claims to have some sort of special relationship with the current White House administration but will do little to utilise this relationship to promote the rights of our citizens overseas and to promote the principle of the rule of law.</para><para>It is a fundamental duty of the Australian government to defend its citizens from false arrest and imprisonment and unfair judicial proceedings by a foreign power—a duty this government continues to shirk. The Minister for Foreign Affairs loves to drop names when answering questions in the other place. I call upon him to drop a couple of names to President Bush when he addresses the federal parliament—the names of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib. The government's inconsistency when it comes to dealing with other states and nations cannot be emphasised more than it has been in this case. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the former Attorney-General have been reluctant to comment or pursue the case for legal principles to be followed in dealing with detainees being held in Guantanamo Bay. In stark contrast, however, when it comes to commenting on legal proceedings in Indonesia in relation to trials involving suspects of the Bali bombing, there is a conga line of government ministers willing to give their two cents worth.</para><para>If this government had half a clue about international relations, it would suggest to the US that the open and accountable manner in which the Indonesians are dealing with suspected terrorists has publicly exposed the evil of terrorism and is the kind of exposure that acts as an important deterrent to terrorism in the future. A kangaroo court in the form of a military commission that has been constructed by the US will not be credible and will not assist the US or other nations trying to combat terrorist organisations or in exposing the indisputable evil of groups involved in terrorist activities. </para><para>It is time for the government to defend all aspects of the Australian way. These include the right to the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. Australian democracy has a long tradition of accepting only one overriding judicial system and one rule of law for all. The US has now instituted two systems: one law for US citizens and another for non-citizens. Allegations of torture that have surfaced in recent weeks must not be merely swept under the carpet by the government. The government must have the will to defend its citizens being held by an international power and must not accept being given the run around by the United States. Australia cannot be taken seriously when it comes to promoting the principles of democracy and condemning acts that are detrimental to the principles of democracy whilst it stands by and does little to nothing to defend the democratic rights of its citizens overseas.</para><para>I take this opportunity to recognise the tireless work of Terry Hicks, the father of David Hicks, in his efforts to promote the fundamental rights which his son is entitled to under international law. It must be an extremely difficult exercise for the families of both David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, who hang in limbo wondering if and when they will ever see their family member again. I urge the Prime Minster to think about this when he spends time with his family, especially in the lead-up to the Christmas holidays, and to think long and hard about the strain it must be placing on the families of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. I urge the Prime Minister to use the opportunity of President Bush's visit to raise the allegations of torture and other issues concerning the denial of fundamental human rights in relation to detainees in Guantanamo Bay.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Poverty</title><page.no>16387</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16387</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week, from Monday, 13 October to Friday, 17 October, is Anti-Poverty Week. The week aims to strengthen public under-standing of the causes and consequences of poverty and hardship around the world and within Australia and also to encourage research, discussion and action to address these problems, including action by individuals, communities, organisations and governments—all of us. This Friday, 17 October, has been designated by the United Nations as International Anti-Poverty Day. Across Australia, as indeed across the world, during this week there will be events and activities to focus our attention on the issues of poverty—its causes and its impacts around the world and at home.</para></talk.start><para>In launching this week in Canberra last Monday, Julian Disney, a former World President of ACOSS and the President of the International Council on Social Welfare, stated that in the world anti-poverty cup Australia would not even make the quarterfinal. Our record, both at home and in our overseas aid, does not place us anywhere near the top of the ladder. In 2003 over a billion people around the world are desperately poor and suffer real hardship. At home, by any estimation, more than a million Australians are facing disadvantage. During Anti-Poverty Week, we have a genuine opportunity to learn, listen and definitely take up the challenge to do better. Through activities around the country, we can find out more about the real stories and the people behind the quite terrifying statistics. Internationally, the world's leaders adopted the millennium development goals, known as the MDGs, in 2000. We are part of this international community and we have accepted a wide range of goals. I quote: </para><quote><para>We are sharing the battle to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. We want to achieve universal primary education. We want to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. We want to reduce child mortality, we want to improve maternal health, combat the horrors of HIV Aids, malaria and other life threatening diseases, ensure environmental sustainability and develop a global partnership for development. </para></quote><para>These are strong aims and we share that responsibility. Part of the aim of Anti-Poverty Week will be to make those goals real and to ascertain that we can do better and we must.</para><para>At home sometimes I think we run away from the issue of poverty. It is almost comfortable to accept that internationally there are areas of extreme poverty. But at home people are suffering disadvantage and we must see that. During Anti-Poverty Week we must face up to the individual challenge. As Uniting Care Australia has publicly stated, `Poverty exists.' Poverty is more than just income deprivation; it is about being vulnerable, excluded and different and feeling as though you do not matter. The aim must be to empower and support individuals, families, communities and governments from the ground up as we work together to build a just and compassionate society, where everyone has access to social opportunities and the basic goods required to live a decent life. </para><para>Over the last few months the Senate Community Affairs References Committee has had the opportunity to visit every state in Australia and to meet with people who are the living faces of disadvantage in our community. These people tell us their stories. They tell us that we have no option to hide from these issues. We as a parliament must accept responsibility and awareness, because poverty exists in our community. Most terrifyingly, it exists for families and children. Almost 680,000 Australian children are growing up in jobless households. The link between unemployment and the lack of education, poverty and disadvantage is clear. We cannot run away from that. We know that children are facing immense risks of not being able to build their lives. The challenge for all of us must be that we work together to overcome this issue. </para><para>There are so many statistics that we can quote and they all confront us. Within Australia at the moment, at least a quarter of a million Australian job seekers have had no significant amount of paid work over the last 12 months. Terrifyingly, most have had little or none for at least two years. What kind of opportunity does that give to Australian families when all they can see before them is a pattern of unemployment and lack of opportunity? More than 10 per cent of the work force are either unemployed or have identified that they want more work. The total number of job seekers is several times higher than the number of vacancies. During this period, when we all celebrate the increased economic stability in Australia and surpluses of amounts that still boggle my mind, we have people in families who are disadvantaged who do not understand that there are opportunities that we must share. </para><para>Many organisations now have united to put together a cry to governments at all levels, not just the federal government. This is not just an issue for people who sit here; this must be an all-of-government, in fact an all-of-society, response. As part of Anti-Poverty Week—I do not like the term poverty week; I prefer Anti-Poverty Week—a letter has been sent to the Prime Minister, state premiers and territorial chief ministers, signed by leaders of all faiths in Australia. They have taken up a challenge. In fact, they have called upon governments at all levels to get their act together—to get our act together—to acknowledge the following: </para><quote><para>We write to seek your support for the concept of a national forum, the purpose of which is to develop a national strategy for the reduction of poverty, and hopefully the elimination of child poverty, in this country. We are also urging you to take positive steps to bring this about.</para></quote><para>This is the challenge to us all. They go on to say:</para><quote><para>If current trends of wealth distribution continue, our country is in danger of losing its traditional national character. Notions such as a `fair go' and `mateship' could become empty. We will become two, not one, country, and certainly not a `Commonwealth'. We risk becoming a country of `haves' and `have nots', with all the undesirable social consequences which must follow.</para></quote><para>That challenge is clear. We must now overcome divisions amongst ourselves and look at the genuine issues facing our community. During Anti-Poverty Week there are activities in all parts of the country to raise awareness of the issues about which we are speaking and to identify that poverty is not just a lack of income; it is a lack of opportunity and awareness. We can overcome this. We can work together to achieve some kind of result at home as well as overseas. The challenge that we are given during Anti-Poverty Week 2003 is to accept that poverty exists and identify ways to fight it, so that by Anti-Poverty Week 2004 the Australian community will have taken steps to ensure that we have a better society in which the circumstances of the haves and have-nots are closer together. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title><page.no>16389</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>16389</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to speak for up to 20 minutes.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—The Australian media has been dominated for weeks by the plight of the remaining 52,000 sheep penned on the livestock carrier MV <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>.

We are now looking at two equally unattractive options: the return of the sheep to Australia or slaughter at sea. We have all been hoping for a market to be found for these sheep, but that now appears to be a forlorn hope. There have now been two independent assessments of these sheep by the international animal health organisation, the OIE. The first inspection on 5 September gave the animals a clean bill of health. The second inspection took place last week and again the sheep were given a clean bill of health. It is clear that the management of this saga by Mr Truss has heightened international concern over the condition of these sheep and has negated any leverage that may have flowed from these inspections.</para><para>It is also clear that this saga is causing Australia international damage.

The European Union is in fact challenging our entire quarantine system. The United States of America is seeking to weaken our quarantine standards through free trade agreement negotiations. It is my view that our current conservative regime, which has been supported by successive governments, is both appropriate and defensible; however, it now appears that the integrity of that regime—and, therefore, the foundations of our defence against challenges to that system—may well be ripped away to get the government out of a political imbroglio.</para><para>My concern that this disaster will lead to a collapse of our current appropriate quarantine system is heightened by Mr Truss's refusal to release details of how he plans—in the event that this is the course the government decides upon—to let these sheep back into Australia.

There will also be significant regional economic implications, as imported products undercut key domestic rural industries.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There have been increasingly worrying signs from the government in relation to our quarantine system. For example, a close look at the risk assessment process under way in relation to the application from the Philippines to export bananas to Australia exposes the increasing politicisation of our risk assessment process. I must say I am alarmed by the actions of Mr Truss, Mr Vaile and the Prime Minister in relation to the assessment of this application. I am now very alarmed that the decision to collapse our quarantine system—if in fact that is what Mr Truss does in relation to these sheep—will be the last straw for not only Australia's banana growers but a significant number of domestic industries that enjoy a physical environment free of diseases that blight much of the rest of the world. </para><para>The 2,300 growers that make up the banana industry contribute around $350 million to Australia's economy. This is one of Australia's largest horticultural industries. Queensland accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the national production. The processing of an application from the Philippines to export bananas to Australia commenced in June 2000, when AQIS initiated an import risk assessment. AQIS sought comment on whether there should be a routine or non-routine import risk assessment. Some senators may be aware that the former is a simple process, usually followed where there is little quarantine risk associated with an application. The non-routine course is designed to assess complex, high-risk applications.</para><para>The decision to follow a non-routine path was taken in August 2000. The risk assessment panel was assembled in early 2001. That panel then established three technical working groups looking at pathogens, arth-ropods and horticulture environment and operations. The issues paper that flowed from that process was released in May 2001. Throughout this process there was considerable interchange between the risk assessment panel and the relevant Philippine authorities, as well as direct contact with the Philippine industry. Unfortunately, the government did not take the same inclusive approach with Australia's banana industry.</para><para>I have been following this process closely, and I must say that it seems to have been adequate from a technical perspective. I was advised by the director of Biosecurity Australia in an estimates hearing in May last year that the initial responses from the Philippines to technical issues raised by Australia were `mixed'. An initial set of questions was contained in a document entitled Import risk assessment on fresh banana fruit from the Philippines: report of visit of chairs of technical working group to the Philippines, produced in August 2001. There were 75 questions in that document. I note in passing that the report from this visit was not released until April last year—some eight months after the visit.</para><para>At that estimates hearing I was advised that, while the chairs of the technical working groups were in the Philippines, they undertook extensive visits to different parts of the banana industry in the area from where exports are proposed. After that initial list of 75 questions, there was a follow-up list. That second list contained another 44 questions. This second set of questions was put by Biosecurity officers to their Philippine counterparts during a visit to the Philippines on 18 and 19 February last year. The Philippine authorities responded to those questions on 20 March 2002.</para><para>A Philippines delegation then visited Australia in April last year, and further issues were raised in that second batch of questions and they were discussed. This process led to the release of a draft import risk assessment, released in June 2002. That draft import risk assessment concluded that the disease Moko, present in Philippine bananas, presented an unacceptable risk to the Australian industry. The report concluded:</para><quote><para>In summary, for Moko there do not appear to be feasible measures capable of reducing the quarantine risks to an acceptable level.</para></quote><para>This conclusion appears to have been based on a proper, science based analysis of the risks. I am concerned that that is where the science based assessment process ended and the politicisation of the process commenced. Biosecurity Australia invited comments on that draft import risk assessment, with a closing date of 30 August last year. That was nearly 14 months ago. If the minister, Mr Truss, had ensured that integrity was protected and proper process was followed, a final import risk assessment would have been released long ago. Alarm bells have been ringing, and they have been ringing within the industry for some time. </para><para>In June last year the minister for agriculture, Mr Truss, confirmed in parliament that the trade minister, Mr Mark Vaile, had already given an assurance to Philippine authorities that an import risk assessment would be released within a certain time frame. I said at the time and I repeat now: having the trade minister influencing quarantine processes is a dangerous conflict of interest. It is Mr Vaile's job to promote trade, but it is Mr Truss's job to protect the integrity of our quarantine regime. It should not be a matter for the trade minister to set deadlines for quarantine risk assessments. That should be a matter for the director of Quarantine.</para><para>In July this year the Prime Minister announced plans to establish a forum with the Philippines as a means of resolving agriculture related quarantine disputes, such as the dispute over bananas. As I said earlier, Australia's quarantine regime has long been based on a proper, scientific assessment of the risks associated with importing plant and animal products. Mr Howard's plan to establish what will be, essentially, a political forum to broker agreements on proposed agricultural imports from the Philippines is likely to compromise the integrity of that regime.</para><para>Last month, reports appeared claiming that the Australian government had agreed to allow the importation of tropical fruits from the Philippines. According to a Philippines News Agency report, negotiations with the Howard government had advanced the Philippines' campaign for reduced quarantine controls on fruit exports to Australia. The news agency said that negotiations to `penetrate' the Australian market will involve private sector interests. The <inline font-style="italic">Philippine Star</inline> reported:</para><para>... Australia's readiness to reopen talks could be the breakthrough being sought by the Philippines to finally settle its brewing trade row with Australia, a result of the latter's refusal to accept fresh bananas and pineapples by imposing rigid phytosanitary standards.</para><para>According to this and other reports at that time, negotiations were set to involve more than just bananas, mangoes and pineapples. The Philippines government wanted to negotiate the export of forage grass to Australia. I called on Mr Truss to reveal any concessions the government offered the Philippines and to detail planned future negotiations. His office responded by saying that we should not believe everything we read in the Philippines media. It is worth noting, however, that the story ran in the same form in a number of different papers.</para><para>There is now a body of evidence building that increasing pressure is forcing Mr Howard, Mr Vaile and Mr Truss to shift away from defending Australia's quarantine regime as a stand-alone, science based process, in search of solutions to current political dilemmas. When these alarming trends are coupled with the extraordinary course Mr Truss appears likely to embark upon in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo</inline><inline font-style="italic">Express</inline>, it is clear that the Howard government is moving to trade off the integrity of our quarantine regime to deal with short-term diplomatic problems—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—I agree; it is absolutely disgraceful that Mr Truss is proposing to do that—to seek some short-term advantage or to get itself out of a huge political mess. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—It would be better if senators decided not to come back after a lengthy dinner if they are going to behave in this way! There is another developing problem with our quarantine system, and that relates to its administration. Responsibility for this problem rests squarely with the minister who oversees it. A significant number of applications for imports remain bogged down while Mr Truss procrastinates. Failure to advance these applications in a timely fashion is frustrating for both the country seeking access and the domestic industries that may be adversely affected if the application is approved. The draft import risk assessment on Philippine bananas is a classic example.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>—Order!

It was released at the end of last June. It found bananas from the Philippines represented an unacceptable disease and pest risk. But, a year later, we are all still waiting for the final decision from the director of Quarantine and for an announcement from the minister. Rather than let these import risk assessment processes drift on and antagonise our key trading partners, Mr Truss should do his job and ensure that all applications are dealt with by Biosecurity Australia in a proper, scientific and timely fashion. Any move by Mr Howard and Mr Truss to undermine the integrity of our quarantine regime risks exposing our rural industries to a suite of exotic pests and diseases that could decimate production and cost farmers, rural communities and the national economy dearly. If the Howard government does collapse our quarantine system to get itself out of political strife, the world could reasonably claim that our quarantine system is no longer built on science but has political expediency as its new foundation stone.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—I have laid out a number of challenges for members of the coalition for when they come to their senses and decide to think about them.

I listened very carefully to hear your solution to this particularly difficult issue. I listened the last time you spoke, I listened when you spoke on the MPI last week and I listened very carefully to the questions you have asked on this issue. I know that you and I share a great concern for the future of this industry because we agree it is of great value to this country. This issue is about Australia and Australian trade. Senator O'Brien, I know you understand how complex it is—you have set that out in a number of your speeches—but regrettably neither you nor any of your colleagues who have spoken on this issue have been able to come up with a solution. It is no surprise to you or to any of your colleagues on the other side of the chamber that this issue has no easy solution. There is no simple solution because it is not a simple issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There now appear to be three options facing the government in relation to the sheep. One option is to bring them back to Australia. That is very clearly the option of last resort, not the option of first resort. We are still trying to find a destination for these sheep. As you said in question time today, they have now been at sea for 71 days. There is not a person in this chamber, in the other chamber or in the Australian community who wants those sheep to remain at sea for one more day; but, Senator O'Brien, neither you nor any of your colleagues have come up with a realistic solution to this problem—you have not made a single suggestion. There has been criticism day after day of Minister Truss and of the government by you and your colleagues but not a single solution offered.</para><para>As I said a moment ago, the best option for these sheep is to find a destination close to where they are now. That has been explored by the government day and night for weeks. You know that has not been possible, Senator O'Brien. The second option is to try to find somewhere the sheep can be taken to. It is no secret that Cocos Island has been explored as an option but, as you know, there are difficulties there. Christmas Island has been explored as an option, but there are also difficulties there. Both of those options are still being looked at, as is the option of bringing them home as a last resort.</para><para>This is a boatload of healthy sheep. There is nothing wrong with these sheep. The vets on board and international vets have said that they are healthy sheep. One of the great difficulties we have with this issue is trying to convince the international community that there is nothing wrong with these sheep and that they are healthy animals. The criticism of the minister day after day, night after night, by Senator O'Brien and his colleagues does nothing to assist Australia to deal with this problem. I appeal to Senator O'Brien, his colleagues and indeed the wider Australian community to understand that, just as there is no simple answer to this issue, there is no point in bucketing it and bucketing ministers who are doing what they can to bring about a resolution. It does no good to Australia and it does no good to the live animal trade, which is at the basis of this issue.  </para><para>The future of the live animal trade is of critical importance to this country and has been for 20 years. The last thing we need to do in this chamber tonight is to bag an industry, bag a boatload of healthy sheep and bag a minister who is trying to come up with a sensible resolution to a very difficult issue. I appeal to Senator O'Brien and his colleagues to come into this place with some sensible solutions, some ideas and some ways in which we can resolve this issue for the good of Australian agriculture and for the good of this industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.16 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>16395</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>16395</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Aboriginal Hostels Limited—Report for the period 24 June 2002 to 28 June 2003.</para><para>Aboriginal Land Commissioner—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australia Council—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australia-Indonesia Institute—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Film Commission—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Film, Television and Radio School—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian National Training Authority—</para><para>Australian vocational education and training system—Report for 2002—Volumes 1, 2 and 3.</para><para>Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Research Council—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Tourist Commission—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE)—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Civil Aviation Safety Authority—Corporate plan 2003-04 to 2005-06.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Crimes Act 1914</inline>—Authorisations for the acquisition and use of assumed identities for 2002-03—</para><para>Australian Customs Service.</para><para>Australian Federal Police.</para><para>Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC)—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Gene Technology Regulator—Quarterly report for the period 1 April to 30 June 2003.</para><para>Indigenous Land Corporation—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>National Archives of Australia and National Archives of Australia Advisory Council—Reports for 2002-03.</para><para>National Gallery of Australia—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>National Residue Survey—Report for 2002-03, incorporating the report for 2002-03 on the National Residue Survey Results.</para><para>Reserve Bank of Australia—Equity and diversity—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Social Security Appeals Tribunal—Report for 2002-03.</para><para>Torres Strait Regional Authority—Report for 2002-03.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>16395</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Instrument No. CASA 430/03. </para><para>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act—Notice under paragraph 16(6)(c)—Notice No. 18 of 2003.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew Act—Dispensation granted under section 20—Dispensation No. 9/03.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>16397</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Regional Solutions Program</title><page.no>16397</page.no><subtitle>(Question Nos 1550 and 1551)</subtitle><id.no>1550 and 1551</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16397</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator Nettle</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 June 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Regional Solutions Program, can a breakdown be provided of funding in Western Australia for the years 2001 to 2003, including (a) Local Government areas receiving funding.

quoted by eligible detainees for not accepting the offer of transfer into the RHP include:</para><quote><para>- not wanting to be separated from family members who would be remaining in the detention centre;</para><para>- wanting to maintain continuity in their children's education where they are;</para><para>- liking the current management and facilities of the centre they are located in; and</para><para>- the distance of Woomera from the associated detention centre, particularly since the closure of the Woomera IRPC.</para><para>The recent establishment of Port Hedland RHP and current plans to expand alternative detention arrangements, including establishing an RHP in Port Augusta, will mitigate some of these issues. Children will be able to continue to attend the same schools as they did in the relevant centre and family members remaining in the detention centres will be in closer proximity to women and children in the RHP. The creation of the new RHPs will also increase the number of places available under the scheme.</para></quote><para>(14)	DIMIA negotiates payment on a case by case basis and funding is not broken down in the categories listed in the question. For June 2003 the cost for alternative detention was a total $605,207 (including Woomera RHP). </para><para>(15)	(a)	The Department does not identify costs in the categories listed in the question but reports on expenditure as follows: </para><quote><para>- RHPs - Currently, the only operational residential housing project is at Woomera. The cost for June 2003 was $294,215.</para><para>- Hotels/Motels - In South Australia, costs for June 2003 were $80,348. In Western Australia, costs for June 2003 were $230,644.</para></quote><para>	(b)	The Department normally monitors expenditure on a financial year basis. Due to the variations in monthly expenditure for each Detention Facility, the use of an average across all facilities for a financial year presents a truer figure for the cost of detention per person per day. For this calculation, the average cost of detention for the financial year 2002-03 was $273 per detainee day. For June 2003, this would equate to $270,270 for the number of detainee days in detention in this same period compared to $605,207 in alternative detention arrangements.</para><para>(16)	The direct cost of accommodating people in the Woomera RHP from May 2002 to June 2003 was $2,168,095. This cost covers the operation of the entire RHP irrespective of occupancy levels and does not include some costs borne by the Woomera IRPC and centrally by ACM to support the facility. Based on actual usage for the period, 4057 detainee days were accrued which represents $534 per detainee per day for those direct costs. </para><para>(17)	On 25 June 2003, Mr Ruddock announced that, following community consultations, vacant South Australia Housing Trust land at Ellis Close had been selected as the preferred site for the establishment of an RHP in Port Augusta. A contract with the Trust was finalised on 9 September 2003. Building contractors commenced work at the site on 10 September 2003. The contractor is also close to completing preparation of transportable houses at Woomera for relocation to Port Augusta. Completion of building works is expected in early November. This RHP will provide capacity for around 40 people. </para><quote><para>On 15 May 2003, Mr Ruddock announced community consultations on the establishment of an RHP in Port Hedland utilising The Lodge, an existing Commonwealth facility some 700 metres east of the Port Hedland IRPC. This RHP, which has the potential to house up to 12 people, was commissioned on 18 September 2003. Preliminary offers of a place in the RHP have been made to eligible families in the IRPC. One family has moved into the facility.
