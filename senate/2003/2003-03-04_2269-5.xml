I refer to a statement by the Attorney-General last night that he had ordered Australia Post to destroy returned antiterrorism kits. Given that postal workers are reporting in many places that the kits are being destroyed without being counted, why did the Attorney-General decide to override Australia Post's commitment to the parliament to keep and count the kits and also the contract between Prime Minister and Cabinet and Australia Post to keep these kits in case of further demand? Given that Minister Alston yesterday labelled Labor's revelation that the kits were being destroyed as `nonsense' and bizarre, why didn't the Attorney-General bother telling Senator Alston of the instruction to destroy the kits?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8935</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We can see we are on the big issues here, that is for sure! What we had with that information campaign was a very important campaign to inform the people of Australia in relation to the current security environment. Of course, it is interesting that the opposition were the first to say, when we upped the security alert back in November last year, that we should have an information campaign of this sort. They said, `You should inform the people of Australia as to the threat and how to deal with it.' And so it was that the Prime Minister's office, in conjunction with the Attorney-General, embarked on a comprehensive information campaign, and that has been very well received. In fact, in the press today, it says that it is one of the best remembered advertisements of those recently shown on television. That shows you just how important a campaign it has been. The fact is that the opposition do not want to acknowledge that we have an environment that we have to deal with and that we have to inform the Australian public about. They are more interested in how many kits were sent to Australia Post and whether they were destroyed.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—What about the facts?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I am about to tell you, Senator Sherry. The advice that I have from the Attorney-General is that approval has been given for the destruction of some kits in the Canberra mail centre to address storage issues. Instructions will be issued shortly to Australia Post to destroy all other returned kits. The government will not allow Commonwealth workers to be put at risk by exposure to any possible contaminant. You have to realise that there has been an irresponsible campaign by some people who have said, `Return the kits and put some white powder in in order to send a message.' We know that the opposition do not care about workers. They are not interested in the safety of the workers or the Australian postal workers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we are concerned about is the possible anxiety that could be caused to workers if there were some kits returned with powder in them. Some irresponsible elements of the Australian community are saying, `You should show your opposition to war by putting a hoax—white powder—in a kit and returning it.' If you were an Australian postal worker and you got a kit like that and there was white powder in it, of course you would be quite anxious about it. What we are about here is safety and addressing that possible concern of Australian postal workers because of the thoroughly irresponsible actions of some people in the Australian community—a very small minority, too.</para><para>There has been a suggestion that the decision to destroy all returned kits will prevent Australia Post from counting the number of kits returned. That is not correct. I have outlined reasons for the destruction of the kits, and I am sure the opposition would agree with that. The arrangement has always been that Australia Post would estimate the number of kits returned. This will continue to be done prior to the destruction of kits, so there will be no hiding of the number of kits that have been returned. The estimating will be done by Australia Post. But first and foremost we have to address the threats of irresponsible people in the community to send a hoax through the mail by putting white powder in these kits. You can just imagine the concern that could cause to Australian postal workers. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8936</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

One can only assume that Australian postal workers would be involved in that and in the detection of the tampering with these kits.

Recent labour force figures, for example, showed that employment rose by 111,000 to a record high of over 9.58 million in January of this year. Full-time employment increased by 72,400 to also stand at a record high, while part-time employment rose by 38,600. The unemployment rate declined to 6.1 percent. Since the coalition were elected in 1996, we have created more than 1.2 million jobs—or 470 new jobs every day.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another clear indication of our position as one of the world's leading economies is our recent restoration to a AAA rating by the international credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's. Australia's foreign currency credit rating was of course downgraded in 1986 and 1999 under the Labor government's reckless mismanagement of the economy. As we approach the May budget, our continuing campaign of economic reform must be allowed to continue. The OECD points out that, in line with the government's objective of raising living standards, further reforms will be needed to encourage more people to join and remain in the work force and to steadily raise productivity. That leaves the Labor Party hopelessly out of step. Their only policy, as we know, is to oppose everything the government try to do to strengthen our economy and provide more jobs and to provide a better standard of living for all Australian families. We all remember how Labor mindlessly opposed our tax reform package that delivered $12 billion of personal income tax cuts to Australian families. We all remember how Labor predicted that the GST would mug the Australian economy. How wrong they were! </para><para>The government remains committed to its sound economic management. While we know the Labor Party has no policies of its own, Labor owes it to the Australian people to support the government's efforts. It can start by passing our reforms relating to the labour market and the key measures from last year's budget, Senator Cook.

The government took to the last election, and budgeted for, a policy to allow the opening of child accounts. The measure is only one of a comprehensive suite of measures to make superannuation more attractive and more available. It allows parents, grandparents and indeed other relations—if Senator Sherry produced a child, he could even open an account on its behalf—to make contributions of up to $3,000 every three years on behalf of a child. This measure has been in effect for a short time only, with commencement on 1 July 2002. The government recognises that Australians tend to have several key savings goals throughout their lifetime, which may include saving for retirement, a home, education, travel or a car. The priority assigned to each of these savings goals will ultimately depend on the preferences of individual Australians, so the superannuation for life measure gives Australians more choices as to how they save for their retirement.</para></talk.start><para>The measure is a voluntary savings vehicle. It builds on the government's commitment to provide an increasingly flexible and available system that meets the diverse needs of Australia and its ageing population. As the measure has only been in place since July of last year, and in circumstances where it is not always possible to identify where such an account may be, it is not possible to say how many there are so far. But what is of great interest is that whilst Senator Sherry and those on the other side of the chamber obsess about one measure—child accounts—they continue to obstruct the measures that this government wishes to introduce that will bring real flexibility into the superannuation system and real choice for Australians. It is a scandal.</para><para>This government wishes to wind back the surcharge so that those who can afford to save for their retirement will be able to do so and those on low incomes will get a much needed boost—up to $1,000—to match the contribution. The package for surcharge and co-contribution is a sensible measure. The Labor opposition originally opposed the surcharge and now they are opposing rolling it back. The Labor Party are all over the place. We never hear of a policy from the Labor Party or Senator Sherry, who has been shadowing retirement incomes for seven years.

Unfortunately, Labor continues to succumb to its union master's influence and has again rejected this important government initiative. Labor does nothing to help small businesses to grow, to employ more Australians and to improve the living standards of our nation. Without the protection of the government's small business protection bill, small business is effectively denied the full protection offered by the Trade Practices Act and will continue to bear the costs of unlawful strike action by militant trade unions.</para><para>The playing field is not level for many of Australia's small businesses.

The powerful trade unions have resources that a small family-owned business simply cannot match. No wonder so few small businesses take on the unions in unlawful secondary boycotts or in unfair dismissal cases. I have said it before and I am sure I will have to say it again: Labor's actions will continue to oppress small business, not help them, and Labor need to start taking the nation's interests to heart rather than their own trade union interests.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Banking: Credit Card Schemes</title><page.no>8939</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>8939</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

Is the minister further aware of recent reports that the ANZ Bank are considering tripling all annual credit card fees in response to the RBA reforms?

The impact of the credit card changes is of course something that has to be very carefully monitored. It is certainly true that the ANZ have made that announcement. ASIC and the ACCC are maintaining a watching brief on the surcharge developments and ASIC is monitoring merchants to ensure that surcharging, when it occurs, is in accordance with the standard. The ACCC will ensure that there is no anticompetitive behaviour between merchants in setting surcharge levels. The other elements of the RBA reforms, which involve regulations to facilitate the access regime, will obviously have to look very carefully at allowing non-banks to offer services, and they are currently being developed. </para></talk.start><para>The standard to regulate the fees charged between banks and merchants is not to commence until 1 July this year. In those circumstances, the introduction of a transparent and cost based system for setting interchange fees and fees between financial institutions to deliver credit card services should in fact result in reductions. The reduction was thought to be nearly 40 per cent in average interchange fees in Australia, so there is no doubt that there is the potential there for consumers to benefit from these changes through a reduction in the general level of prices. The ending of the restrictions imposed by credit card schemes on which financial institutions can provide credit card services should also reduce merchants' costs and increase the choice of those who acquire their transactions. Allowing merchants to surcharge does provide customers with clearer market signals that credit cards are a more expensive means of payment. In September last year both Visa and MasterCard had foreshadowed action in the Federal Court over the reforms, but now the reforms appear to be well accepted. It is certainly the case that the ACCC will continue to monitor to ensure that consumers get the benefit of the savings and that they can be passed on. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8940</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

We have a program to get doctors into outer metropolitan areas which started at the beginning of this year. We have to ensure that we do not have incentives that attract doctors back from rural areas. Mr Smith has been saying that one of the things that has caused the issue with bulk-billing has been that the coalition have screwed down the increases on rebates. Let me get the facts on the table. In the last six years we have increased the rebate for a standard consultation—because there are standard and long consultations— by $4.20, a 20 per cent increase. In their last six years in government the Labor Party increased it by $1.70, which was nine per cent. In the same comparative period we have increased the rebate by 20 per cent; they increased it by nine per cent. So do not let Mr Smith try and mislead the Australian public that we have screwed down the rebates.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With a longer consultation where people can spend time with their general practitioner and have an issue or an illness looked at in more detail we increased the rebate to $80.40, a 23 per cent increase.

We put the rebate for short consultations up by 20 per cent; they put it up under the same period by nine per cent. For a long consultation we put it up by 23 per cent; Labor put it up by five per cent. Talk about screwing down the rebate!

Despite the fact that this survey was done on a relatively small sample size, it indicates how relatively easy it is to either deliberately or accidentally come across highly offensive and inappropriate material. The problem to date has been that, while it is relatively simple to close down content sites that are within our jurisdiction, it is much more difficult when the servers are located offshore. We established an online content scheme back in 1999 and at the same time we established NetAlert to try to promote community awareness of these issues. We established a complaints based regime which allowed people to bring matters to the attention of the ABA. The ABA in turn was able to require all ISPs to make people aware of the filter packages that might be available. It is fair to say that, even in the relatively short period of time since then, there have been a number of important developments which indicate that some of those software filter packages are much more effective now than they were a few years back, with artificial intelligence being applied to keyword technologies and the ability to trace graphics through and identify them. There is a lot to be said for taking another look at whether we should expect more from ISPs.</para></talk.start><para>I do not take the laissez-faire attitude that the Labor Party takes on this issue. Senator Lundy puts out a press release every week which says, effectively, that it is all too hard, you cannot do anything about it and the solution is user education. The fact is that every child in Australia knows you can get this sort of material on the Internet, and I suspect the vast majority of parents do as well. Senator Lundy ought to take notice of what was said in that report. It said: </para><quote><para>Too often the global nature of the Internet has been used to argue that nothing can be done about the problem of pornography.</para></quote><para>That is a very succinct summary of the Labor Party position on the issue. We do not share that view; we take the view that, if it is possible to do something about it, you ought to. It is not good enough to say that you will not bother because you will not get 100 per cent coverage. That is what Labor says. Labor says, `Of course it won't be 100 per cent effective, so don't even try,' which is the ultimate in policy laziness. Most laws are not 100 per cent effective, but that is no excuse for not making a serious effort.</para><para>We are pursuing the matter. We are conducting a review at the moment of the online content regulation regime. We also have a review of spam going, because spam is another way in which many teenagers and others access pornographic material—quite often accidentally via attachments to emails. People who are subscribers to Hotmail find vast quantities of unwanted material being made available to them, interfering with the way in which they would much prefer to use the technology. So in the course of those reviews, we will have a good hard look at what more might be done in expecting ISPs to take a more effective position than perhaps they have to date. Some of those filter packages are not all that effective, and there may be better ways of identifying a minimum standard that should be expected.

One of the more draconian is to require all material to go via a proxy server so that you can have a black list that filters out any unacceptable Internet sites. There are many sites that appear out of nowhere on a daily basis, so it is a very difficult job tracking down a lot of these sites. It is probably overstating the case to suggest that the ISPs are calling all of the shots. They obviously have a view and a commercial interest and we ought to take that into account, but, at the end of the day, we have to make judgments based on what we think the community expects in terms of effective protection. Certainly some material is criminal or morally unacceptable—most of the take-down notices issued with respect to online content regulation relate to paedophilia in Australia. Clearly, you cannot just sit back and do nothing, as the Labor Party would do.

We have two memoranda of understanding with different departments in China and we are working on a third, which is not far away. We have had a couple of projects in China that we have worked on with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipality Finance Bureau.

The speech is not an intellectual tour de force—that is pretty clear. In fact, it would not be too rude to describe it as deeply shallow. All she really says is that China is important because it has a big economy and is a growing power in our region. I think a kid in grade 7 could have told you that some time ago. It is a clear example of where the basic facts are ignored in a speech. I recommend it to Ms Macklin's colleagues as an insight into the vacuous state of Labor's policy development.</para><para>Ms Macklin lovingly referred to Gough Whitlam's trip to China in 1971 as though that was the first time Australia had discovered China. History, of course, starts with the Labor Party, when Gough Whitlam was there. Mind you, she was a bit discreet. She did not mention Mr Whitlam's apparent remarks about our Vietnamese friends and she had a complete mental blank when it came to Arthur Calwell's remarks. So we will move on from those. But she did make the entirely fatuous claim that this was the first involvement of Australia with China. Of course, what she does not know, or deliberately omits, is the fact that the first Australian government to send a representative to China was the government of Sir Robert Menzies. It was, in fact, this side that first sent an independent person to represent us in China. Be that as it may, in her speech, which is insightful, Ms Macklin informed the audience that her then upcoming trip to China was very timely because it was a critical opportunity for the new leadership in China to meet the alternative Australian government: Kim Carr and Peter Cook.

Can the minister confirm reports that, while private health insurance funds have sought increases of around six per cent in premiums this year, Australia's major private health insurance companies have been massively increasing the fees paid to their own directors? Is it the case that Australia's biggest health fund, Medibank Private, increased the fees it paid to its directors from $700,000 to $1.3 million? Is the minister also aware that last year MBF reportedly doubled its directors fees from $1 million to $2 million and Australian Unity also doubled its directors fees from $1.1 million to $2.2 million?

Membership was down to 33 per cent, hospitals were threatening to close because they had insufficient patients, because too few people were in private health insurance, and private health insurance was in an absolutely diabolical state. By giving the 30 per cent rebate, which Labor has refused to support or indicate that it will—and I am sure that the nine million people who belong to private health insurance would be very interested to know whether Mr Smith and the Labor Party would actually get rid of the 30 per cent rebate if they were ever to come into office— we increased membership through lifetime cover. We have now seen private health insurance cover going up to about 44 per cent—sustainable. That is nine million Australians who now are able to use private hospitals, who have taken the strain off public hospitals. We have seen an increase of 12 per cent in the number of people who have procedures done in private hospitals, while in public hospitals we have seen a decrease of 0.1 per cent. So it has taken a huge strain off.</para></talk.start><para>What the directors are paid is a commercial decision by the companies. PHIAC, which is the prudential regulator, looks at any increase that they request and looks at all those issues to ensure that the increase is based on the need to meet the claims of their members. It is a commercial decision by those companies as to what they will pay their directors. Let me just remind people that, under Labor, private health insurance premiums went up by 12 per cent per annum, and one year they went up by 20 per cent. They have gone up 4.7 per cent under us. That 4.7 per cent is reduced by 30 per cent because of the rebate. Let me remind Australians that under Labor they would definitely pay 30 per cent more because Labor refuses to support the 30 per cent rebate.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8946</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Is it not a fact that a third of every increase in directors fees is paid by the Australian taxpayers? So it is relevant to ask the minister what she is doing to protect taxpayers' interests.

So Senator Evans is assuming that the increase in directors' fees is just an increase, without any increase in productivity. Let me just remind Australians that, under Labor, their private health insurance would be 30 per cent dearer until Labor stand up, make a commitment and sign a document that says they will maintain the 30 per cent rebate.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>8946</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>8946</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.

That operation was set up for the humanitarian objective of protecting the Shiites in southern Iraq from Saddam Hussein. Those overflights have either been fired on or had radars attached to them from time to time. When that has occurred, the fighter aircraft are entitled to retaliate.

This government and this particular minister have presided over the collapse of bulk-billing. It is interesting to go back and have a look at history, as the minister tried to do when she sought to avoid answering the questions that she was asked in question time. The Prime Minister himself is somewhat of a student of history, or he claims to be. The problem is that he and his government are seeking to repeat history. Therefore, it is instructive to go and have a look at just what is on the record from the Prime Minister back in the 1980s.</para><para>In 1986 the Prime Minister—then the Leader of the Opposition—Mr Howard, said, `Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.' In 1987 he said, `Radical surgery will be performed on Medicare.' Again in 1987 he said on radio: `The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulk-billing system. It's an absolute rort.' In the same interview he said, speaking again about Medicare and bulk-billing, `We'll pull it right apart.' These are definite, clear statements by the Prime Minister about his and his party's attitude to Medicare—that is, to rip it up, to destroy it, because they have never liked it. They did not like it when it was first introduced as Medibank under the Whitlam government, and they did not like it when it was reintroduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1983.</para><para>They are the real views of the Prime Minister and they are the views that he still has today. Notwithstanding having his and his party's policies rejected by the people on a number of occasions throughout the period of Labor government and notwithstanding having given a commitment back in 1996 in the health policy launch prior to the 1996 election when he said, `Medicare will be retained in its entirety,' the Prime Minister has continued through inaction and other decisions of government to whittle away at Medicare and destroy it. He was never game, after his experience of rejection by the people, to come out openly again and say that they would destroy Medicare, but that is what they have been about. We now see them—and I am sure other senators will pick up on it—trying to reduce the role of Medicare to what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have indicated would be, essentially, focusing only on the needy. </para><para>What have we seen under the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson? Since she was appointed health minister after the last election, we have seen a further decline in bulk-billing of some 5.6 per cent. Under the Howard government since it was elected in 1996, bulk-billing rates have declined by about 11 per cent. Indeed, in some parts of the country, in outer metropolitan and rural areas, it is down to as low as 65 per cent and it is heading south. I can give examples of towns in rural New South Wales that I am aware of where there are large populations of retirees and gold card holders and yet there is no doctor who bulk-bills. Those people have to travel many kilometres to find a doctor who will bulk-bill. This is a disgrace. It is not as if the government was not warned that this was happening. As I said in question time, the minister was advised back in December 2001, only one month after the re-election of this government—supposedly because, they say, they are committed to protecting Medicare—by her own department that the rate of bulk-billing was falling. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>8949</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Here we are yet again.

Senator Forshaw quite clearly decided to overlook in his contribution the intent of it, by saying that now, under this government, there is an emphasis on ensuring that bulk-billing is available to those to whom Dr Blewett referred; to treat `pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services' now somehow makes the government derelict in its duty, when seven out of 10 services are bulk-billed! Did we ever hear Senator Forshaw, or Senator Anyone over that side, talk about seven out of 10 of all facilities currently being bulk-billed? No, we did not. </para><para>No wonder the opposition are trying to go on about this. Mr Smith has given a commitment to do away with the 30 per cent rebate; he has given a commitment on bulk-billing that he will not be able to keep. Mr Crean's leadership is in absolute turmoil. Therefore, we have them coming in here with an argument about bulk-billing that does not stack up with their own history, does not stack up with what is currently under way today and does not stack up with their own record on funding.</para><para>It is worth noting that under the coalition government the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation increased by 20 per cent. During the last six years of the Labor government, that rebate increased by less than nine per cent. Do we hear the Labor Party talking about that gap? No, we do not. Do we hear them talking about what happened during their last six years in government? The Medicare rebate for longer consultations increased by only five per cent under their government compared to 23 per cent under this government. No, we do not hear that, because that does not serve their purpose. That simply makes the whole issue a furphy to try and protect Mr Crean's abysmal, nonexistent leadership and Mr Smith's desire to abolish the rebate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>8950</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is always interesting to follow Senator Knowles, because you know that when the government has to defend a bad message, particularly in the areas of social security or health or community services, Senator Knowles will be wheeled out.

As a New South Wales senator, whether I go into the outer metropolitan areas or into regional New South Wales, I realise that the availability of health care to our citizens is being denied. Like a number of my colleagues in the Senate, I look after a number of duty electorates. I had the opportunity to go to Orange last weekend. I was spoken to by a number of people in that mid-western region of New South Wales. In towns like Orange, Lithgow and Bathurst only 18 per cent of GPs intend to offer full bulk-billing services in six months time. In Bathurst itself, a town with a population of 32,000 people, only one surgery offers full bulk-billing services now. According to official government figures, the rate on the Central Coast of New South Wales—where the seats of Robertson and Dobell are held by the coalition—has fallen by 15 per cent over the last two years. But local medical professionals say that the crisis is worse than that: only 28 per cent of GPs on the Central Coast intend to offer full bulk-billing services by August this year.</para><para>If you heard the answers from Senator Patterson today or the valiant effort by Senator Knowles to defend her, you would think that there was no crisis in the system. The crisis is there because GPs are no longer going to bulk-bill. The number is declining. We have heard from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over the last two days that they are going to isolate access to bulk-billing to people who are card holders. I do not know where they get off thinking that people in this country are not disadvantaged financially when they isolate the opportunity for access to bulk-billing to pensioners and card holders. If that is the case, you will see a number of families who will make a decision about whether or not they themselves, either individuals or their families, will go to the doctor. Already there is a copayment of $12.78; the copayment will possibly increase if this system proposed by the Prime Minister is implemented. There is also a bill before the Senate, which we will be debating later, about whether or not we will increase the basic cost of prescriptions. </para><para>If we do not comment on the fact that the government is trying in its own way to abandon the universal health scheme, if we do not make it clear to the Australian people that this is a deliberate policy of the government to isolate in communities the haves and the have-nots, then we are not doing our job. There is nothing that has been said over the last few days that gives me or the people that I represent in New South Wales any comfort that there will be an increase in the standard of health care or the availability of it. I have highlighted to you, Mr Deputy President, a number of regions in New South Wales that within six months will feel the full force of not having access to universal health care or the opportunity for free service or discounted fees. This is a crisis, and there is nothing that I have heard in the last 24 to 48 hours that leads me to believe that anything has been done about it. All I have heard is that the government is going to try to charge the working community more money to access health care.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>8951</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would hate for people in Australia listening to this broadcast to get the impression from Senator Hutchins's remarks that the standards of Australian health are going to drop or that the universality of access to health services is going to cease because there has been in some way a small reduction in the number of bulk-billed services provided by GPs. Nothing could be further from the truth. The centre, the core or the essence of Medicare is the provision of free treatment to all Australians in public hospitals. That is really what Medicare is all about. There is no suggestion at all that that availability of free treatment in public hospitals will be changed by any slight reduction in the availability of bulk-billing GPs around this country.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>—When was the last time you went to a hospital for medical services?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—I actually went to a hospital last week, Senator Hutchins.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>—How long did you have to queue up for?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—Not too long, I must say, and that means that our hospital system is working very well. We as Australians should be very proud of our hospital system because it is a very good one. There has been, it is true, a small reduction in bulk-billing by GPs around this country; nevertheless, something like 70 per cent of all GP services are bulk-billed. That is a pretty high percentage. I find it very hard to take very seriously the claims by the opposition that the small reduction in the number of bulk-billed services or the small percentage drop in the level of bulk-billing of GP services means that the end of the world is nigh in the effectiveness of our health service, because that simply is not the case. It is the case that 80 per cent of services provided to pensioners are bulk-billed. That means that most doctors in this country are ensuring that the most needy and perhaps underprivileged in our community, the elderly who are on pensions, receive free treatment from their general practitioner. It may be that there are doctors in an area who have ceased bulk-billing, but a pensioner or anybody else who shops around I am sure will find other doctors in other clinics who are prepared to bulk-bill them for their general practitioner services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us move on and look at bulk-billing in other medical specialities, such as pathology. There has certainly been no change that I have heard of in bulk-billing for pathology. Pathology is a very expensive kind of medicine, and almost all pathology services these days are bulk-billed. The Labor Party seems not to want to mention that. There has been no change that I have heard of in other areas, such as in radiology, or in the levels of bulk-billing by various specialists. Admittedly, some specialists bulk-bill more than others: surgeons tend not to bulk-bill many patients and people like psychiatrists and physicians bulk-bill more. In fact, we have not heard anything about any changes in the levels of bulk-billing for specialist services. So, if we take a broader view than the one the opposition seems to be peddling about bulk-billing, the reality is that there has been very little change and that there is no threat or danger to the effectiveness of the Australian health system. </para><para>Since the coalition has been in office, we have seen Medicare rebates increase by something like 23 per cent for long consultations. In the era of the Labor government, they increased by only five per cent. The Howard government has spent some $640 million on special programs to encourage more doctors to practise in rural and outer metropolitan areas and generally has strengthened our health service. The ALP's only answer to the problems as they see them at the moment, as expressed by Simon Crean on 3 March in Canberra, is that they would increase the Medicare levy.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>8952</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think what we saw in the Minister for Health and Ageing today, other than a fairly extraordinary obsession with Mr Stephen Smith, is a minister who is not prepared to confront the critical issues that the opposition is raising. The issues that we raised today were in relation to the future of Medicare, the decline in bulk-billing under this government and what is happening in relation to directors' fees in terms of private health insurance. Speaking on the last issue first, the minister completely ignored the fact that Medibank Private is owned by the government, owned by the people of Australia, and that the government is the shareholder. My understanding in respect of Medibank Private is that the minister is required to approve directors' fees. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and say, `This is something that is beyond our purview or outside our bailiwick.' As I understand it, she has the delegation to approve or not approve increases in directors' fees for Medibank Private. She did not say anything about that, so we had a complete obfuscation.</para></talk.start><para>The second issue is the future of Medicare under this government. The Prime Minister himself, as pointed out by Labor Party senators today, has said that, in his view, bulk-billing should be available only for pensioners and for people deemed to be disadvantaged. What does that mean? We all know that means that Medicare goes back to what this government likes to call the `needy poor'—a Dickensian concept—moving away from universality. That is what the Prime Minister is saying. I wish this government would get its lines straight about that. The Treasurer himself said this morning that Medicare was never intended to be a universal health system. Well, excuse me! The Labor Party introduced Medicare and, yes, it was intended to be a universal health system. So let us not allow the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to skate around and use weasel words about one of the major icons that the Australian Labor Party stands for, one that we will not tamper with, and that is the universality of Medicare.</para><para>Everybody knows we have a budget coming up. Was the Treasurer foreshadowing a change to Medicare? We know from statements made in the 1980s by the now Prime Minister that his intention right from the word go was to dismantle Medicare. He said that when the Liberal Party made it clear that was their view when Medicare was introduced, and in the 1980s, along with his other fairly outrageous conservative views, he indicated that it was his aspiration that Medicare be dismantled. Is the Treasurer foreshadowing an announcement about Medicare? You have to ask that question. We will put it together: first of all, we have the Prime Minister talking about Medicare never being intended to be universal and that it was always about helping people who are disadvantaged—the Dickensian notion of the needy poor—and, then, we have the Treasurer reaffirming that and indicating perhaps that in the budget they will be moving to an income based Medicare system rather than a universal Medicare system.</para><para>Bear in mind that Medicare is very popular, as previous Liberal Party oppositions have found out to their detriment when they have tried to make an issue of this. This time the government has not made an issue of it; it is trying to sneak it through and undermine by stealth the fundamental principle of the universality of Medicare. We will not be fooled. The people of Australia will not be fooled. We know what the government's intention is with respect to Medicare. We know the Prime Minister has not changed his views one iota since the 1980s when he said that Medicare should be scrapped and bulk-billing should go. That is the bottom line, that is what the minister has got to face up to, and it is about time she came in here with better briefs and more information with respect to our questions. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>8953</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>8953</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to Medicare and the decline in the rate of bulk-billing.</para></motion><para>I also take note of the statements made by the Prime Minister in recent days about bulk-billing. I point to what I think most people regard as not even the thin edge of the wedge but the thickish edge of the wedge in universal health care in this country. We have seen a major decline in bulk-billing and the government has shown very little in the way of interest in seeing that we have more access to free health care by GPs. The fact came to light a couple of weeks ago that the Association of General Practitioners, which is primarily funded by the federal government, had conducted workshops—and is no doubt still doing so—for doctors in how to get out of bulk-billing. It has not been made clear to doctors or the general public that this government does support bulk-billing and does support that universal health care which we all thought we had signed on to. So, far from wishing to allow doctors to exit from bulk-billing, we should be looking for ways to encourage them to continue to bulk-bill.</para><para>One of the major problems for the Democrats in all of this is that, whilst the minister says that seven out of 10 doctors bulk-bill, we now know that the vast majority of those doctors only offer bulk-billing to a very narrow sector within their communities—those people who are on pensions or benefits. We also now know that very often a doctor will not even indicate to patients that this is an option for them if they are on those low incomes. So for us that is problematic.</para><para>It is clear as well that people in country areas are having more and more limits placed on them in their ability to access bulk-billing. In fact, in many cities—Wagga Wagga is one that comes to mind, as is Bendigo—there is now no longer any practitioner at all who offers bulk-billing and therefore fees are charged which are well over the medical benefits scheme level, and the government has shown no interest in limiting that or capping it in some way. I would argue that a family which is on a low income—say, $30,000 a year—and which may well have children or other members of the family who have chronic illness to not have access to bulk-billing would be a huge burden and a huge cost to the expenditure of that family, to the point where they might not be able to afford to access GPs for health reasons.</para><para>We do not know the extent to which people are not going to their GPs and getting advice about their health because they cannot access bulk-billing. We understand that there are some people who have been denied services by GPs because they could not pay their bill. This is now a terribly worrying situation. It is disappointing that the minister is not focusing on getting some of those stats. Instead, she says that seven out of 10 doctors bulk-bill and that therefore gives us nothing to worry about. That is not the case. The number of people who have access to bulk-billing is probably very low and is diminishing. The Senate ought to be interested in this.</para><para>I think it is not too long a bow to draw to ask what this government's intentions are with regard to our public hospital system.

Senator Nettle has done me the courtesy, which I appreciate, of seeking agreement for, and giving me forewarning of, what she wanted to do with the tabling of a number of copies of the document distributed by the government in relation to the increased threat of terrorism within Australia and how the public should respond to it. I have indicated to Senator Nettle that I will not agree to the tabling of all of the return mail. Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, made an appropriate response to some questions about that in question time today. He has raised serious concerns about a number of security threats that have been made in relation to some of those documents.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am aware that in Perth in Western Australia Greens state MPs have been running a campaign, as part of their anti-war campaign, to have these information packs returned unopened to the Greens offices or, as I recall, one day they were encouraging them to be returned to the Attorney-General's office. I went on the radio and made the point that the government is trying to do the responsible thing by providing information to the community about what they can reasonably do to be aware of increased threats to personal safety, and I said I thought that was the responsible thing to do. I also made the point during the interview on Paul Murray's 6PR talk show that I would be happy if in a few months time the government was lampooned for overreacting. I think it would be a great achievement if the world got through this current threat unscathed and the government was told that it had been overreacting. I certainly hope that the government is not accused of underreacting to the current threats.</para><para>The main objection that I have to the tabling of these documents is that it is, without any doubt in my mind, a stunt. The tabling of documents is done within the parliament to ensure that a document that is not available is made widely available. Tabling a document ensures that the tabled document may be circulated to any senator and, I think, made available to any member of the public. Clearly, this document has been made available to all members of the public. It is widely available. So to table the documents in the Senate is a waste of time and energy.</para><para>Senator Nettle also wants to ensure that messages for John Howard from the Australian people—which are in her writing in the document that I have in front of me and were quoted from the returned terrorism packages—get through. She lists a number of pages summarising those messages. It is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister and the government be made aware of people's feelings about the international security situation. To show my bona fides, I am happy to have this document tabled, because it serves the purpose of informing the parliament of the views of all of those people who have taken the time to communicate them. That is what a parliament should be about. It should be about informing the parliament, informing the government, of the plurality of views within this great democracy. It should not be demeaned by the pulling of mindless and childlike stunts. I am happy to make an offer to the Greens if they would like to table this document which summarises the views of all of those good Australians. I will pass it to the Opposition Whip so she too may make a judgment. In fact, I think she is getting one from the Greens. I now make the offer to give leave to have this document tabled so that all senators and members and the Prime Minister may receive a copy of the views of these good citizens, but I will not give leave to table a document that has already been distributed, at taxpayers' expense, to every household in Australia. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>8960</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to table the document summarising the messages to Prime Minister Howard that were written on returned antiterrorism kits and which have been circulated in the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>8960</page.no><id.no>R1685</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>8960</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 3 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>8960</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I only had a few minutes last night to make my contribution and I welcome this opportunity now to continue my remarks. As we have been advised, the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> is one of the bills that the government is making a determined stand on—and so are we. Last night I said that it was revealed in the Senate estimates that the government planned to spend $49.6 million on an advertising campaign `to inform the community of the high-quality medicines system funded by taxpayers'. I would suggest that, in light of the supposed budgetary necessity of cutting the PBS, proposing to spend $49.6 million on advertising a system which has been destroyed by this government is verging on deception. As far as I am concerned, this is a slap in the face to hardworking Australians. It is entirely unacceptable that the government would cut $1.1 billion from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and then spend almost $50 million of taxpayers' money to make it seem rosy. It is an abuse of government and a failure to recognise the needs of Australians.</para></talk.start><para>The proposed cuts to the PBS are just one element of the government's oversight of the destruction of the health care system. The coalition government has seen a slow erosion of the bulk-billing system. The most recent figures show that only 69.6 per cent of visits to GPs are bulk-billed, which is a drop from a high of 80.6 per cent just after the 1996 election. In fact, the percentage of doctors visits which are bulk-billed has decreased every year since the coalition was elected. Under Labor, it increased every year. That is because Labor has a commitment to accessible health care. Because of that commitment, we have rejected this bill before and we will do it again.</para><para>The New South Wales Department of Health recently conducted a statewide survey of GPs, asking them to indicate whether they would provide full bulk-billing services in six months time. In six months time, it is expected that only 28 per cent of GPs on the Central Coast will provide full bulk-billing services. The Central Coast is an area which has a high proportion of retirees and young families, yet the government, and in particular the members for Dobell and Robertson, has done nothing to ensure the healthy future of the people of the Central Coast. People on the Central Coast have not been adequately represented by their coalition members, Mr Ticehurst and Mr Lloyd. Central Coast residents have seen a drop of 15 per cent in the number of bulk-billed visits to general practitioners. Now the government is, for the second time, attempting to increase the copayment for essential medicines. The members for Dobell and Robertson have a duty to represent the best interests of their constituents, but have instead supported a government which has allowed bulk-billing to erode. Mr Ticehurst and Mr Lloyd had both supported increasing the cost of essential medicines, not once but twice. They will be reminded of it and so will the people of the Central Coast. </para><para>All government members when they vote for this bill should bear in mind the serious impact it will have on Australian families. An additional cost of $190 per year on a family can mean the difference between getting by and doing it tough. For pensioners, an additional cost of $52 per year is a very serious increase. Many pensioners have trouble making ends meet as it is. An extra $52 could put them over the line.</para><para>Fortunately, the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties rejected this measure the last time it came before the Senate. If we had not, Australian families would have been slugged with an increase of 30 per cent for each prescription. Evidence provided in Senate estimates suggests that pensioners would go without five million prescriptions and families would go without half a million prescriptions if this bill were passed. It is entirely unacceptable that the Treasurer's cost-cutting exercise should stop Australians from accessing essential medicines.</para><para>The final budget outcome has shown that there is no budgetary justification for the proposed increase in the PBS copayment. The final budget outcome showed that the government's expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was $224 million less than had been estimated in last year's budget, the figures of which were the basis for the current bill. The annual increase in expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was lower than the average of the past decade rather than the 20 per cent increase the government expected. If this legislation is simply a reaction to expenditure rather than an ideological move against public subsidisation of medicines then the government should not have reintroduced the legislation once the final budget outcomes were known.</para><para>The moderate increase in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the 2001-02 financial year should dictate the maintenance of the PBS subsidy at its current level. The government should not punish Australian families for its mistakes in the 2000-01 financial year and the resulting blow-out in expenditure for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>I wholeheartedly oppose this bill. The result of the bill being passed would be a less accessible and less fair PBS system. The Australian Labor Party supports the right of Australians to have access to affordable medicines. Health care is something which should not be determined by the ability of individuals to pay, because it is essential that all Australians live healthy and comfortable lives. The Labor Party has a strong and lasting commitment to the public provision of health care, most clearly manifested by Prime Minister Whitlam's introduction of Medibank and Prime Minister Hawke's introduction of Medicare. Continuing Labor's tradition of ensuring the accessibility of the health care system, the Labor caucus will again vote against this bill. I opposed this bill in the first instance and when it comes before us to vote on, whether today or later this week, I will vote against it again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>8961</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. This is the second time the Senate has debated the measures in this bill, and it is the second time I have risen to speak on the issue. It is becoming a hallmark of this government to regurgitate the same bill over and over again. But interestingly the government only regurgitates and persists with those bills that affect those members of our community who will suffer and be hurt the most.</para></talk.start><para>Like the previous bill, the purpose of this bill is to introduce into the Health and Ageing portfolio budget measures, outcome 2, a specified increase in the patient copayments for the purchase of drugs subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. When the government originally introduced this bill last year, it had the outcome of increasing patient copayments by 28 per cent from $22.40 to $28.60 per prescription and safety net threshold payments from $686.40 to $874.90. That was to be effective from January 2003. This translates to an extra $190-odd per year for the cost of essential medicines and an extra $6.20 per script for each of the 300,000 Australians who reach the general safety net. </para><para>In the same manner, this bill seeks to increase concessional copayments by 28 per cent from $3.60 to $4.60 and safety net threshold payments from $187.20 to $239.20, also to be effective from January 2003. We need to ask ourselves how many pensioners and concessional card holders can afford to fork out an extra $1 for each prescription. I would suggest that very, very few could afford to pay. The government calculations attained through Senate estimates proved that the consequences of a proposed increase in the concessional copayment from $3.60 to $4.60 affecting Australian pensioners and concession card holders would result in almost five million prescriptions for essential medicines remaining unfilled. The same calculations showed that Australian families under financial pressure will go without almost half a million prescriptions as a result of the proposed increase in the general copayment from $22.40 to $28.60.</para><para>In total, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme calculated by the government will result in families, pensioners and concession card holders going without almost five and a half million prescriptions simply because they cannot afford the increase. And this is from a Prime Minister who fantasises that Australians are relaxed and comfortable. That might be the case for the top end of town, but it is not the case for the average Australian.</para><para>Labor rejected this bill the first time, and today we are rejecting it again. The only thing this bill will achieve is to once again leave all Australians, in particular the sickest and poorest Australians, under the peril of not being able to afford the essential medicines they need. Commonsense tells us that essential medicines will keep people healthier longer. The reality is, if prescriptions go unfilled because Australians are unable to afford them, their health will suffer. As a consequence this will lead to greater expenses for medical assistance down the track.</para><para>Labor agree that it is essential to deliberate on the value of growth in the PBS, but only through sensible policy. Last year in the budget there were a number of measures that Labor supported and felt were sensible policy. These included increasing the use of generic drugs where appropriate, stopping pharmaceutical fraud both on and by pharmacists and improving the listing procedures for new medicines. Other measures included providing better information to consumers and doctors and increasing the focus on evidence based medicine.</para><para>Instead, we are witnessing the consequences of bad decisions made by this government. It is now trying to recoup losses caused by its bad decisions, through false economy, by looking for consumers to pay a larger proportion of the cost of drugs they legitimately need. For the most part, it is looking to concessional patients. This government is banking on 2.8 per cent of pensioner and concession scripts and 1.4 per cent of general scripts going unfilled because people are not able to afford them. Fifty per cent of the $1.1 billion the government wants to save from this copayment increase over four years will come from pensioners.</para><para>The true foundation of this bill is to restore the budget bottom line without any consideration or fairness to those most in need. How does the Howard government justify this after making such detrimental mistakes with the PBS in the past, bad mistakes made contrary to wise counsel? I am referring to the blow-out costs created in June 2001 when former Minister Wooldridge listed Celebrex against the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and did nothing to control the huge costs. The committee recommended that Celebrex be priced at $1 a day. The government failed to follow through on a contract negotiated with pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer that would have resulted in the price being halved once a certain number of scripts had been issued. Instead, what resulted was a $140 million blow-out in the first nine months of listing, up from an estimated $40 million. That is $100 million more than was estimated. Celebrex was not the only bad decision made by the government. The antinicotine drug Zyban was also listed by the government against expert advice on cost control mechanisms. </para><para>Another perspective the government has had on the PBS was highlighted in November last year when Labor asked Foreign Minister Downer whether he would rule out putting on the agenda for a free trade agreement with the United States the abolition of Australia's PBS. Mr Downer refused to rule out abolishing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as part of a free trade agreement.</para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been in operation for 50 years. It is one of the cornerstones of Medicare and a guarantee for every Australian that essential medicines will be available and affordable. This government is clearly willing to place the health of Australians at risk because of pressure from the United States for Australia to abandon the PBS as a condition of entering into a free trade agreement. We can see that the pharmaceutical industry is again seeking to have the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme put on the table so far as free trade negotiations are concerned. The government should rule out changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as part of those free trade agreement negotiations. The scheme has served this country well.</para><para>In summary, on the seventh anniversary of John Howard's election, we have seen bulk-billing go from 80 per cent to 69.6 per cent over a seven-year period. That is an 11 per cent decline in bulk-billing, and over half of that has come in the last 12 months. Now the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, is saying that if this legislation is not passed then more money will be spent on the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme and there will be less money for other areas. Yet if we allow logic to prevail in this scenario what we are likely to see is a shifted burden of cost onto other areas of Commonwealth and state expenditure, most likely through greater hospitalisation for those people unable to afford their prescriptions. Inevitably, other repercussions will include people with untreated infections and sicknesses spreading those infections and sicknesses around schoolyards, offices and workplaces, adding more financial strain when an adult is at home sick and not out working or when a child is out of school and not getting the benefit of education.</para><para>What does the government have to say about the consequences for employers when workers are off work? The government is so adamantly pushing the point that the employer needs to be protected and not disadvantaged in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No.2]—which was again rejected yesterday—that I guess the government response would simply be: `Sack them. You're protected.' Labor ardently opposes this bill and sees the time, effort and expense of debating this issue once again in the Senate as the government's political swindle to get, yet again, an opportunity for a double dissolution trigger.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>8963</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I am sure most senators in this chamber—if not the Australian public— will recall, the Australian people were on a promise. Of course we have come to understand that some promises are core and some are non-core, but at the time this promise was made in 1996 there was no such distinction. The current Prime Minister told the Australian people that he wanted them to be `relaxed and comfortable'. Here we are seven years on and we find this government taking steps to renege on that promise. How is it that an Australian can feel comfortable and relaxed about the state of health care in this country when costs just keep going up and up? New technologies and procedures mean that we should all feel more comfortable and relaxed about health care today than we did seven years ago. It is one of those things that Australians have come to prize over the years. New cures for diseases, new equipment to treat patients and new hospitals are an ingrained expectation for many of us. Over the course of the last century, we have seen diseases such as polio wiped out through new advancements. New equipment to screen for disease and early identification to increase survivability have been taken for granted.</para></talk.start><para>Health care is one of the most important things to nearly every Australian. If you are sick or a member of your family is sick, you want the best services and facilities that are available. You want to know that Mr Howard's promise, his vision of relaxation and comfort, will be a reality in 2003, especially in the key area of health care. But what we have is one failure after another. Less relaxed but more anxious and less comfortable and greater discomfort is what we have. The coalition government would have us believe that we need to change the way the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme operates by increasing copayments or else the whole system will collapse. We are told constantly that the <inline ref="R1570R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> amends the scheme to increase the copayment for general and concessional patients to cover the higher cost of drugs. We are told over and over again that health costs are increasing all the time, and the only policy response from this government is to charge us all more. There is no response that looks at efficiencies within health care, at ways to reduce costs or even to increase funding.  </para><para>Over the last seven years, we have had to take out private health insurance before we turn 30 or run the risk of higher premiums later in life. At the time we were told that this approach would relieve pressure on the public hospital system and keep premiums down. Those opposite claim that more people in private health insurance means fewer people in the public hospital system. That was the logic behind the policy, we were told. To do this, we have had to fund the rebates on private health insurance to the sum of billions of dollars each year. This amount increases with each year, but do the premiums stay the same? Of course they do not. The fact that the government's policy forced many Australians to take out health insurance when they did not need or want it was irrelevant. Ideology wanted it and ideology got it. Of course, everyone is shocked and amazed that, when someone has to pay for something they do not really need or want, they demand some form of value for money—they want some kind of return. This meant that people put in claims—lots of claims; more claims than anyone expected or the health funds had budgeted for. This must mean that it worked. However, more claims meant more costs in processing them and more payouts—payouts for all sorts of wonderful things like relaxation music and golf clubs.</para><para>Instead of premiums becoming cheaper, the funds put their prices up and this government let them. In fact, the Prime Minister's private health insurance rebate costs Australian taxpayers over $2 billion a year and people are still not getting value for money. The Prime Minister has frightened people into taking out private health insurance by making cover two per cent more expensive for each and every year after a person turns 30, if they had not joined prior to turning 30. His policy increased the profit, though, of private health funds fivefold from $176 million in financial year 1998-99 to $852 million in financial year 2000-01, but people are still not getting value for their money.</para><para>In his efforts to frighten people into private health insurance Mr Howard has broken two promises, and people are still not getting value for money. In the lead-up to the last federal election, the Prime Minister said that his policies would make private health insurance more affordable. Mr Howard said that his policies would reduce premiums. Since the federal election, we have seen an 18 per cent increase in premiums for HBF and a 66 per cent increase for excess. Again, in the lead-up to the last election, the Prime Minister said, in what he called an `absolute guarantee' as opposed to a core and non-core promise, that any future increases in private health insurance premiums would require his personal approval. Since the federal election, Mr Howard has wiped his hands of his guarantee and broken his promise. On 11 September last year—perhaps when he thought no-one would notice—the Prime Minister announced that he would allow private health funds to increase their premiums each and every year without any explanation. This broken promise will cost the average Australian family with private health insurance an additional $50 to $100 each and every year. It would seem that must have been another non-core promise. I am sure that all Australians are feeling more comfortable and relaxed about these cost increases!</para><para>Medicare bulk-billing is collapsing. If it continues at the same rate, within 10 years it will not be available for any Australian. Medicare—an approach that most Australians felt very comfortable and relaxed about prior to 1996—is now something that they feel quite betrayed about. I am sure it is easy to be comfortable and relaxed when it costs you more and you then have to undertake additional effort to get some of the money back through being privately insured! Prior to 1996, you went to the doctor, they swiped your Medicare card, you signed a form and that was that. In retrospect, we now realise that that must have been more difficult, stressful and inconvenient than what we are forced to do today! That must be why presentations at hospital emergency rooms are increasing at an astronomical rate. </para><para>At the Armadale Kelmscott Memorial Hospital in the eastern suburbs of Perth, the rate of presentations at the emergency rooms increased by 2,700 in the year 2001-02. This is in no way linked to the decline in bulk-billing. We know that because the minister tells us that, so it must be true. People must prefer going to emergency rooms to scheduling a visit to their local doctor. People must prefer sitting in waiting rooms for hours on end to see a doctor in a public hospital to making an appointment at the local practice. This novel approach must mean that people presenting at emergency rooms are more comfortable and relaxed about going there than to their local doctor. The time wasted and the inconvenience are obviously all part of some government relaxation plan that the rest of us are not yet privy to.</para><para>Now we have the attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Since the Howard government has come to power, over 60 medicines have been removed from the PBS, but the cost of medicines has increased. The Howard government spent all of last year, and now it has spent some of this year, trying to push through legislation to raise the cost of PBS medicines by 30 per cent. This was necessary, the Prime Minister claimed, because PBS costs were spiralling out of control. This was a lie. Government figures released on 30 September last year showed that the Howard government spent $224 million less on the PBS than its estimate for that item in last year's budget. Despite the government's underspend of that $224 million on the PBS, the Prime Minister is still trying to slug the sickest and poorest Australians with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines.</para><para>At the time that this legislation was first introduced, the Labor Party suggested a course of action to the government as a means of saving money without having to increase the copayment. But that suggestion was ignored. The government's option is the only one to be considered. Their approach is to increase the copayment, and that is that. Perhaps there are other approaches. Should we not be looking to see whether there are alternative sources of pharmaceuticals? Should we not be negotiating with drug companies to see what can be done to keep costs down? Why should we simply go along with the prevailing trend in health care, which is that we allow drug companies to set high prices for newer procedures and treatments?</para><para>The minister has told us in the past that medicines are expensive, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is extremely generous and there are some courses of drugs that cost thousands of dollars. My question to the drug companies is: why are they so expensive? Of course, I will be told that years and years of research, the cost of getting patents and copyrights, and market developments mean that the drug companies have to charge high prices to get a reasonable return. My concern is what independent analysis of these claims is ever undertaken. Are we being ripped off by drug companies? It is a question that caused no end of discussion in South Africa about certain medication for treating HIV-AIDS. South African authorities sourced cheaper generic medications and then were in legal dispute with the big drug companies. How many other examples of that problem exist? Do we know and, more importantly, do we care? Have we allowed a situation to develop where the health needs of our fellow Australians are being mortgaged to the financial needs of drug companies?</para><para>One area that needs to be investigated is how we can source pharmaceuticals on a more cost-effective basis rather than simply paying increasing amounts of money to drug companies. None of the alternative responses are seriously considered by the government as a means of overcoming the problems of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Instead, we get the simplistic approach of simply jacking up the price. Why should any of us be surprised that they take this approach? We see it as yet another example of their basic philosophical premise: they are all about comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted. Whilst this government and this Minister for Health and Ageing are in power, there is no capacity for Australians to be comfortable and relaxed about the state of their health care. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>8966</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> is the second attempt by the coalition government within the past 12 months to undermine one of the most important components of Australia's public health system, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This bill would increase the copayment or the proportion of the cost of prescription medicines that a patient pays by 28 per cent. The government likes to remind us that this amount is as little as an additional $1 per script for concession card holders and $6.20 for everyone else. These proposed increases would take the cost of a script to $4.60 for concession card holders and $28.60 for general patients. We know that around 80 per cent of people who use the PBS are concession card holders. Those who are ineligible for a health care card but who are on low to middle incomes will pay the higher increase proposed in this bill. Modelling by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling a few years ago showed that a flat 25 per cent increase in the copayment—that is less than the percentage rise proposed in this bill—would place a burden on the lowest income earners among general patients, taking their expenditure on pharmaceuticals to an average 8.6 per cent of disposable income. To claim that increasing the copayment by 28 per cent is of little consequence to these people further demonstrates how out of touch this government is with the way many Australians struggle to make ends meet.</para></talk.start><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or PBS, is a vital component of our public health system. Its goal is to make necessary medicines available to all Australians. The Treasurer announced the rise in the copayment in the 2002-03 budget. The government asserts that the rise is essential if the PBS is to be placed on a sustainable footing. Without the increase, the government claims, the very future of the PBS is at stake and the listings of new medicines threatened. This claim is ludicrous, as the government knows. What is driving this increase is an ideological obsession with a budget surplus. </para><para>The Australian Consumers Association has calculated that by 2006 the copayment rise will pay 12.4 days of the government's share of PBS costs, or 3.5 per cent of the estimated total. The Australian Consumers Association further calculated that the copayment would need to rise between 10 and 20 per cent every year to maintain its relative share of the total cost of the PBS. This is unacceptable. The copayment has already almost doubled through CPI indexing since the Howard government came to office in 1996. Targeting those on low incomes, the sick and those with chronic conditions to pay substantially more through a direct payment is unsupportable. As the Australian Consumers Association has noted, increasing the copayment does not affect the total amount that the community spends on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; it merely shifts the financial burden and does nothing to improve value for money. Nor will it improve the health of Australians. </para><para>Department of health figures show that a significant proportion of the $1.1 billion that the government anticipates saving over four years will come from a fall in demand for medicines, or five million scripts not being filled. The government either believes there is a dreadful amount of unnecessary prescribing going on—and that increasing the cost of drugs will not address this issue—or is prepared to sacrifice the long-term health of people to improve its budget outcome. Even then the department's figures show that reduced demand caused by the copayment increase will cease by the fourth year. This is not a formula for long-term sustainability. It ignores the benefits to the Commonwealth budget and to the health of the nation in ensuring that people can afford necessary medicines, and it ignores the cost of more serious illness and disability if people cannot afford to take essential medicines. This obsession with the short-term budget position does not even make good economic sense. It fails to appreciate the principle of value for money. Even if the PBS continues to take a growing share of the health budget, this does not automatically mean that it is money poorly spent. On the contrary, a well managed PBS has the potential to save the public money, not to mention the benefits to individual wellbeing. </para><para>The Commonwealth spent $4.8 billion on the PBS in 2001-02, a rise of around 13.6 per cent on the previous year. This is in line with the average annual expenditure growth rate for the past decade. The proportion of funding that Australia allocates to pharmaceutical subsidies is lower than that of other OECD nations. However, the rate of growth in the proportion of funding that Australia allocates to the scheme is greater than that of other OECD nations. There are cost pressures on the PBS. These include expensive new medicines and a community expectation to have access to these drugs. They include drug manufacturers spending a large amount of money to promote their products in ways that are not necessarily beneficial to the Australian public. Drugs are not always prescribed for the conditions for which they were listed, thereby undermining the cost benefits of the particular drug in terms of health outcomes. There are also government-induced pressures, such as the decision to grant access to health care cards which provide the PBS listed drugs at the concessionary rate to as many as 50,000 self-funded retirees in 2001. Pharmaceutical companies have also refused to pass on to the government GST savings, through abolition of the wholesale sales tax, of around $250 million.</para><para>It is clear that many facets of the PBS need addressing to ensure it remains a viable scheme. The government has addressed some of these aspects, but spending millions of dollars to tell the public the full cost of PBS listed medicines is of little merit. The government's approach is piecemeal. Several changes were announced in the budget, others have been announced since then and, for all we know, still further measures are in the pipeline following the interdepartmental committee process that has been occurring beyond public scrutiny. The public has been told little about the committee process. The committee was tasked with examining the overall effectiveness of the PBS. The precise terms of reference are cabinet-in-confidence. We do not know why they are such a mystery. The Australian Greens consider it unacceptable to conduct this process in private. This secret review has the potential to lead to changes that affect every Australian. The government continues to insist that the Senate must pass the copayment increase, yet it refuses to tell the public what else it is considering. The fact that the review was conducted while this bill was before the parliament simply strengthens our suspicions that the copayment rise has nothing at all to do with ensuring the viability of the PBS and finding the best means of getting maximum value for money for the public. </para><para>Amid the government's alarmist claims that the PBS is unsustainable, we have seen some troubling proposals emerge from the Australian pharmaceutical industry's lobby group, Medicines Australia. In its submission to the interdepartmental committee, Medicines Australia, among its key messages, stated:</para><quote><para>Policy reform needs to transition from the current system to the long-term new world view where those who can afford will assume greater responsibility for their health care and medicine needs.</para></quote><para>It suggested different copayment rates based on categories of medicine and excluding high-income earners from the scheme, but allowing them to buy private health insurance to cover their drug costs. This proposal comes from an industry that spends an estimated $750 million each year in Australia to market, promote or advertise to doctors the benefits of the newest and most expensive drugs. The sorts of changes that the industry suggests are at odds with the core qualities of the scheme—that is, being comprehensive, universal and affordable. It concerns us that not once during the debate on the future of the PBS and on this bill in particular has the minister committed the government to maintaining the PBS as a comprehensive and universal scheme. </para><para>There are other ways to approach the matter of the cost of the PBS, such as reconfiguring the financial arrangements that deliver a good return for the Australian public and a fair return for manufacturers. One alternative has been developed by Ian McCauley, a lecturer in public sector finance at the University of Canberra. Under this model, the Australian government would pay a flat licence fee to the manufacturer if it decided to list an item on the PBS. This fee would be designed to cover the largest component of costs to the manufacturer—that is, research and development. A further small payment would be made for the drugs to more accurately reflect the cost of production. These are the sorts of innovative approaches that we need to be examining.</para><para>It should come as no surprise that this government considers it acceptable to shift $300 million more of the financial burden of essential medicines to the sick and those on low incomes. The government's record on health is a poor one. It shows little concern for the falling rates of bulk-billing for Medicare services, which cause hardship for millions of Australians and place an intolerable burden on our public hospitals.</para><para>After years of neglecting Medicare, the Prime Minister has finally revealed the government's real agenda. He told parliament yesterday that bulk-billing, a critical feature of Medicare, was never intended to be universal. He is trying to rewrite history to justify his plan to turn Medicare into a safety net for the less fortunate. He wants Australia to have a two-tiered health system: charity for the poor, and everyone else gets the health care that they can afford. This is poor social and economic policy. All Australians contribute to the cost of Medicare through the levy and general taxation. We all have a stake in keeping it strong and able to provide good quality health care to all on the basis of need and not income.</para><para>Promoting a system that will leave many people unable to afford primary health care will lead to complications, more serious illness and increased personal and public costs. The Prime Minister said Australia could not afford a universal health care scheme, but the government pours billions of dollars of public money each year into subsidising private health insurance. The Australia Institute has calculated that around half of the private health insurance rebate goes to the top 20 per cent of taxpayers and nearly three-quarters goes to the top 40 per cent. This money— some $2.3 billion a year, and rising—has not delivered a single additional hospital bed or theatre or paid for employing health professionals in the public system, the one on which most Australians rely. It pays for insurance, marketing, promotion and, as a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> earlier this year revealed, for large fees for directors of health funds.</para><para>In a report released last month, one of the architects of the universal health care system, Professor John Deeble, concluded that, if the money had been spent instead on public hospitals, the same services that were purchased in private hospitals would have been purchased for far less cost. That is because 12 per cent of money paid to private hospital services goes to administration and only 40 per cent is spent directly on health and medical services.</para><para>The rebate has failed the government's own tests. It has done nothing to alleviate pressures on public hospitals; in-patient numbers have fallen a fraction of one per cent in 2000-01. It has not kept young people in private cover, even with the financial penalties imposed under the lifetime cover policy, nor has it kept down premiums. The cost of private insurance continues to rise and the proportion of the population with private hospital cover has fallen during the past two years. The government finally appears to have acknowledged the runaway cost of this rebate and it now plans to introduce legislation in this sitting to contain excessive premium rises. It would be better placed, and all Australians would benefit, if it redirected the money to the public system which provides services to all Australians.</para><para>We should never forget that the provision of health and medical services is a public good that benefits us all, collectively and individually. None of us will go through life without drawing on these services. Some of us will need them more than others. It is in the interests of all Australians that our public health system is not only on a strong financial footing but that it can deliver essential services to all who need them. </para><para>Private profit has a place in aspects of health and medicine, but profit should not be made at the expense of need and fairness. We must withstand any attempt to undermine the PBS by stealth through, for example, trade negotiations. The long-term sustainability of the PBS lies in a thorough review of all aspects of the scheme, not in a budgetary context and with disregard for other constituent elements of our public health system.</para><para>The Australian Greens are proposing a Senate inquiry to undertake a comprehensive review of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to examine the government's assumptions of cost and sustainability, and to consider a range of possible changes to the scheme, including how we fund it. All parties and some Independents have expressed a desire to safeguard the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Our proposed inquiry will contribute to that end and I look forward to the Senate's support for the proposal when it is moved later this week.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>8969</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I recently saw a movie called <inline font-style="italic">John Q</inline>.

The father, played by Denzel Washington, has just found out that his working hours have been cut back in the factory where he works. He is now essentially working casual hours. Obviously his income has been reduced and he has had his car and some possessions repossessed because of his increasingly difficult financial circumstances. Then his son is suddenly diagnosed with a severe heart condition and needs a heart transplant. When the father goes to the hospital to find out about getting this transplant done, he believes he is covered by the relevant health insurance policy that he has been paying into, through his workplace, for years. Then he finds out that the company, unbeknown to him, has downgraded his level of health cover and his son will no longer be able to access the treatment he requires unless the family can come up with a substantial amount of money.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will not go further other than to say that, in desperation, the father takes dramatic action, which one would hope never to see, where he takes hostages in the hospital, demanding that his son be given the medical treatment he needs. I am pleased to say that the movie has a happy ending, but it is illustrative of a situation that we know exists in other parts of the world, and particularly in the United States health system: that is, if you find yourself in financial difficulties and in need of health care, and you do not have access either to insurance or to a universal health system—such as we have here with Medicare—then you are in serious trouble.</para><para>What is happening to health care in this country is that we are heading down the road to that sort of situation. I am going to come to the particular measures contained in the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> in a moment. First, let us place this bill in context. This bill seeks to amend the National Health Act to allow the government to increase prices for pensioners and concession card holders accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is another of those bills that the government has brought in this week that have been rejected by this parliament previously. Only yesterday we dealt with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. That bill also targeted the most needy, or those least able to cope in this country. It attacked employees in small businesses by seeking to deny them the right to take action under the industrial relations legislation in the event that they were dismissed from employment. In a sector of the work force where you find people on the lowest rates of pay, on minimum award rates, who have difficulty getting permanent full-time employment and where there is a high incidence of casual and part-time work, this government is targeting those very workers by removing rights which are enjoyed by all other employees in the country. </para><para>In this bill, people who need to access the health system more regularly than others and who need to obtain prescriptions through the PBS are being hit hardest—particularly pensioners and concession card holders. We are also aware, as we discussed only a couple of hours ago in question time and as was discussed yesterday, that what is happening with bulk-billing in this country is the destruction of Medicare through the continuing decline in the level of bulk-billing. The government is now trying to dig up some quotes from previous Labor ministers to say that Medicare and bulk-billing were only ever intended for the needy, for the less fortunate. Everybody knows that is absolute nonsense. Bulk-billing under Labor governments reached 85 per cent. Bulk-billing operated in virtually the entire field of general practice. Now you can visit country towns in New South Wales, as I pointed out, where you will not find a single doctor bulk-billing in areas where the population comprises retirees, veterans, people on welfare and so on. So even under the government's own changed criteria, bulk-billing is not available for those most in need.</para><para>We can see in another area that the changes this government has proposed in the so-called welfare reform agenda are taking away the rights of people with disabilities— and others—to access social welfare and are requiring them to do more in order to access the benefits that they so desperately need. That has been the agenda of this government since it came to office. I can recall, not long after the government got in in 1996, debating proposals by this government to change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by removing a range of prescription drugs from that list. What did the government choose? It chose drugs that would be prescribed for treating blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes, and drugs that would be prescribed for people who needed to take antidepressants. They were areas where large numbers of prescriptions were written, as we know. People, particularly those with some form of mental illness or depression, were suddenly being told that there was a limit on the number of prescriptions that they could have per year and that there was going to be a reduction in the availability of drugs that they could be prescribed that were subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It was one of the most disgraceful proposals ever to come from a health minister—to target people suffering from depression. Fortunately, the government saw the error of its ways and, after a campaign, changed its proposal and exempted those particular drugs from being removed from the list.</para><para>There is a history of this government targeting those who are least able to afford it. When the government gets into economic difficulty, when it has to try to keep the budget in surplus or to pay for some of the other programs that have run over budget or for commitments that it has made, such as the potential war in Iraq, the government looks around and says, `Where can we raise the money quickly and with the least fight-back?'—to pick a word that has gone down in the lexicon of the Liberal Party. It picks on the weakest, those on the lowest incomes, those finding it hard to keep work or to obtain employment, those who are on welfare and those who may be age pensioners and so on. If you pick out the areas—unfair dismissal, disabilities, reform to social welfare and now the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the pattern is all the same. Why does the government do that? It does it because it knows no other way. It does it because it is the easy way out. It thinks: `We need a few more million to keep the budget bottom line up, so what will we do? We will go and hit people who are accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and those who are doing it tough—more so than the general community—such as pensioners and concession card holders.'</para><para>What does this bill do? It directly attacks Australian families and pensioners who need access to vital medicines. It is clear that it will make some medicines simply unaffordable. It will dramatically increase the financial pressure on Australian families. The proposal in this bill is to increase Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments by almost 30 per cent. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It is still the best system in the world.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—It still is the best system in the world, Senator McGauran!

This is a real issue out there in the community. People may have their minds focused at the moment, obviously, on the serious international issues that are occurring at the moment, but they have not forgotten about the problems here in Australia in health, education, employment, aged care and so on. They will hold this government accountable when the time comes. This bill will increase the copayments by 30 per cent. It will bring in an extra $1.2 billion over the next four-year period. That is $1.2 billion sucked out of the pockets of those least able to afford it. Almost five million prescriptions, it is estimated, for essential medicines will not be able to be funded under the proposed changes to the scheme. It is clear, if you read the evidence that came out in the Senate estimates hearings, that this increase in the concessional copayment will result in many Australian pensioners and concession card holders being much worse off. That is this government's prescription— if I can use a bad pun—for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </para><para>We understand that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the great hallmarks of the Australian health system. It is a pillar upon which our health system—which has been regarded internationally as the best in the world—stands. Along with Medicare and the public hospital system, working with the private hospital system, the PBS is an integral part of the fabric of the Australian health system. It is something that Labor governments and the Labor Party have always supported and will always fight to maintain. We introduced Medibank. The Liberal coalition government got rid of it. We introduced Medicare, and the current Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, promised to destroy it. On each occasion, the Australian public have given the coalition parties the message that they will not accept any downgrading of our health system— Medicare, the PBS or other components of it. And they will not accept it on this occasion. We will oppose this legislation. It will go down. If the government has any sense, it will put it in the dustbin along with its inequitable proposals on unfair dismissal laws and start focusing on the real issues—that is, how to assist Australian families to ensure that we maintain the health system that they deserve.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>8971</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I must say that it is disappointing, but not unpredictable, to see the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] </inline>back in the Senate.

It is recognised internationally as an effective health measure that is affordable both to the individual patient and to the community through their government. And it is designed to encourage a viable pharmaceutical research and manufacturing industry here in Australia. </para><para>For over 50 years, the PBS has delivered on those objectives successfully. But this government is intent on deconstructing our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the scheme that has received such international acclaim. By increasing costs to the patient, through increasing the copayment and the safety net threshold, which this legislation provides for, the bill undermines the PBS by undermining the principles that underpin it. The principles of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are, firstly, universal access— that is, it is only fair that every Australian should have access to essential medication. Secondly, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is designed to be comprehensive— that is, access to a wide range of medications should be provided to meet the variety of needs in the community. Thirdly, the PBS is designed to deliver responsible costs to the community—that is, a drug is not listed unless its benefits outweigh the cost to the community.</para><para>The government, through this legislation, is attacking the PBS on two fronts. Firstly, it has attacked the independence of the listing process in a range of ways. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, representing independent expertise, has traditionally assessed drugs prior to their listing and placing on the PBS to ensure that they meet the community benefit criteria. Under the former health minister Dr Wooldridge, as we all know, we saw the independence of the PBAC undermined by the appointment of a pharmaceutical lobbyist to the committee, which led to the subsequent resignation of a number of long-serving committee members. This was an inappropriate action by the former minister that I am sad to say has not been overturned.</para><para>The government has allowed interference in what should be a robust process, at arms length from the political process. The blow-out in the cost of some pharmaceuticals— notably, Celebrex and, to a lesser extent, Zyban—because of the manner in which they were listed resulted in increased costs to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Traditionally, price volume agreements have been used to manage costs, in which an increase in volume is offset by a reduction in price paid to the manufacturer. However, this sensible practice was not adopted by the government in the case of Celebrex, for one, with significant impacts on the PBS budget.</para><para>More recently, we have seen the Prime Minister responding to a campaign run by Mr Alan Jones on his radio program about Glivec, a drug for sufferers of chronic myeloid leukemia, and it being listed outside the policy framework soon after. Let us remember that the health minister said on ABC radio on 5 September 2002:</para><quote><para>When a company wants to have a drug put on the PBS, it applies to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. They then advise the Government as to its cost effectiveness. If it's over $10 M I have to take the recommendation to cabinet ...</para></quote><para>and she went on—</para><quote><para>At the moment I don't have any recommendations before cabinet.</para></quote><para>On 10 September, five days later, on the Alan Jones program, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said:</para><quote><para>I am very pleased to tell you that later this morning Kay Patterson, the Health Minister, will be putting out a statement indicating that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council has recommended the listing of Glivec for the early stage of treatment, and the recommendation has been accepted by the Government.</para></quote><para>The cost of Glivec in a full year is more than $10 million and under the government's policy it should have gone to cabinet for approval. But it did not. It is clear to me and to the pharmaceutical industry and to health professionals that due process in that case was not followed and that the Prime Minister intervened in the proper process as a direct result of Mr Jones's interest in Glivec. The process of the listing of most drugs takes many months from start to finish, but we were in the middle of an election, weren't we? </para><para>All of us here in this place get correspondence both from constituents and from the pharmaceutical industry advocating the listing of certain drugs on the PBS. Our answer to those requests should be that due and proper process of analysis of the costs and benefits should be followed and that interference in that process is inappropriate. But it is increasingly harder to defend the process when it is evident to all that there has been from time to time political intervention in that process.</para><para>The government is attacking the affordability of the PBS, not to the government itself but to average Australians. This government, the highest taxing government in our history, says we cannot afford the PBS, a centrepiece of Australia's health care system. The government says that it can no longer afford the costs of the PBS and so its policy response is to make it unaffordable to the average Australian. We need to remember that the argument the government is proffering to support its position is the discredited Intergenerational Report delivered as part of the last budget. The Intergenerational Report is not based on sound Department of Health and Ageing planning advice but ostensibly on advice from Treasury. It is regarded widely as a political document, not a planning document. The assumptions underpinning the modelling on the PBS in the Intergenerational Report are widely understood as a joke. What is so sad is that the government is trying to make the public believe that Australia cannot afford the PBS because of the long predicted changes in the age of the population when it is in fact its own mismanagement of the listing processes that has caused much of the blowout.</para><para>A simulation by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, of PBS expenditure in the year 2020 found that price increases would have a much more significant impact on the PBS growth in expenditure than an ageing population. In fact, management of the spiralling costs of new technology is a far more significant issue in ensuring sustainability of the PBS than an ageing population. Sure, there is an increasing array of more expensive drugs to be considered for listing, but what you will not hear those in government talking about is the cost-benefit analysis of a drug's listing and the importance of mechanisms like price volume agreements to manage leakage. When a drug is listed a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken on new medications. This is because the PBS is a preventative health initiative as it keeps people out of more expensive care like hospitals and aged care facilities. So when a drug is being considered for listing an estimation of the cost of the drug and the likely benefits in terms of savings to the health care system in total are made. Drugs are not listed without a positive cost-benefit analysis.</para><para>The second stage is to ensure that the cost assumptions are met, that there will not be blow-outs in the cost of the medication to the PBS. When a drug is listed there is an argument with the manufacturer that a price will be paid for an initial quantity that is expected to produce maximum benefits to the broader population in Australia. When prescribing goes beyond the estimated usage of the medication then leakage starts to occur. In many cases the drug is being prescribed for those for whom it was not listed. </para><para>It has been estimated that leakage—that is, the prescribing of new and expensive medicines to patients with conditions not subsidised under the PBS restrictions for those drugs—costs the government up to $1 billion every year. One mechanism to prevent this happening is what is called a price volume agreement. When a drug's use starts to blow out the manufacturer receives less money for those additional sales. This takes away the incentive to promote the drug to users outside the target population. The government's move away from price volume agreements, and its general failure to look at savings for the PBS at the manufacturing and prescribing end of the supply chain, are the main reasons we are here today having this debate. The problem with the PBS is not, as the Intergenerational Report would have us believe, that the population is ageing, but far more due to this government's mismanagement of the scheme. But what it wants to do to solve those problems is to hit up Australian families. The minister says she wants to save the PBS by making it too expensive for the average Australian. Where is the logic in that?  </para><para>Increasing copayments undermines the integrity of the PBS because it makes it increasingly difficult for Australian families to access affordable medications. Families are struggling already. Many cannot afford to see a doctor because of the bulk-billing rates. In the electorate of Herbert in North Queensland, the bulk-billing rates sit at 54.7 per cent for the September quarter. It is one of the worst rates in Queensland. It has plummeted 11 per cent in the last two years. For a visit to a general practitioner, the out-of-pocket expense of the copayment has increased 23.8 per cent in the last two years. The average out-of-pocket expense for a GP visit at the moment is $15.98. There is a similar situation in the electorate of Dawson, also in North Queensland, where the bulk-billing rates sit at 65.7 per cent and the out-of-pocket expense to see a GP is $15.13.</para><para>Those statistics paint a very sad and sorry picture for the people of North Queensland. It is becoming increasingly difficult to see a doctor and, when you get a consultation, it is becoming more and more expensive. And now the government wants to hit families further for their medication. This legislation will increase the PBS copayments by 28 per cent to $28.60 for general patients and to $4.60 for concessional patients. The safety nets will also increase to $874.90 for general patients and to $239.20 for concessional patients. If you add these increases together with the cost of this government's 1996 increases, you have a 70 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines for families and pensioners. Under these PBS price increases, we risk people self-prescribing. Anyone with children knows that children often get sick at the same time. A working family with, say, three children with ordinary common illnesses, such as a cold or the flu, is now going to pay up to $85.80 to get the appropriate medication to assist those children. That is a lot of money in one hit from the ordinary family budget.</para><para>We need to understand that the PBS is designed as a preventative health measure. Commonsense tells us that those on low incomes will be the most disadvantaged by the government's copayment increases as they will add to these out-of-pocket expenses. But we do not simply have to rely on commonsense. Published research supports what commonsense tells us. The Monash University study that I discussed earlier found that, where high copayments must be incurred to access services, those on low incomes will tend to underutilise needed care, both reducing their health status and potentially creating more costly needs downstream. There are both efficiency and equity implications of the policy to increase copayments.</para><para>A 1998 study by NATSEM found that those on low incomes were the most disadvantaged when they modelled a 25 per cent increase in the PBS copayment and safety net. NATSEM found that general patients— that is, those who are not on health care cards—would spend 8.6 per cent of their disposable income on essential medicines. Given that the government is seeking a 30 per cent increase, we could expect prescribed drugs to be costing this group up to 10 per cent of their disposable income. These people, general patients, are the people who have been described as Howard's battlers. These are the working poor with children at home. No wonder they are battling when they are spending almost $30 a week on essential medicines.</para><para>This legislation clearly undermines the universality principle of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under this legislation, not everyone will have access to affordable medication. This policy is not cost effective and it is not healthy. A Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that is administered effectively and efficiently—operating under the guiding principles that I outlined earlier—is not a burden to the community. In fact, as we know, it produces benefits for the community and that is why we are increasingly living longer and healthier lives. The Australian government, with an ageing population and a declining birth rate, should be doing all it can to keep people healthy and actively making a productive contribution to society for as long as they can. </para><para>Sustaining the PBS is essential to ensuring a secure future for all Australians. However, this legislation attacks the universality of the PBS by making medicines too expensive for many in the community, and it hits the consumer for the failure of the Howard government to effectively administer the cost-effectiveness of the PBS. This will effectively undermine the comprehensiveness of the system. We have a government attacking every principle that underpins the PBS. Australians value the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme just as they value Medicare. If the Howard government wants a double dissolution election on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, I say bring it on.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>8975</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In debating this legislation—the<inline ref=""> Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, which is designed to increase the cost of medications for Australians—I would like to make four points: firstly, to look at the history of the PBS and why it was originally put in place; secondly, to look at the pressures on it; thirdly, to look at what the government is already doing; and, finally, to look at some issues surrounding the government's attempts to increase copayments at this point in time.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, let us look at the history of the PBS. The PBS has been in operation in Australia now for over 50 years, and it is a scheme that is envied by many other countries around the world as they struggle with some of the pressures that we are facing due to the increasing cost of medications. It was originally set up to provide equitable access to necessary medication. Up until 1950, there had been some medications made available free of charge to pensioners and war veterans. From that, changes were made to provide a list of 139 `lifesaving and disease preventing drugs'. These were made available free of charge to the whole community. I do not think there are many of us here today that could think back to when drugs were actually free of charge.</para><para>The idea of a copayment was adopted 10 years later in 1960. It was five shillings for general patients and hardly supposed to be a major source of funding for the scheme. More likely, from what I have read, it was to flag to patients that there was a cost for the medications they were using and therefore they should be used wisely. Most importantly, back in those days there was no copayment for pensioners. This lasted until the Hawke-Keating government introduced one in 1990 at a cost of $2.50 a script. Between 1983 and 1996 the Labor government was responsible for lifting PBS contributions for general patients by 320 per cent. This certainly has created problems for those families who just miss out on health care cards or who have family members with episodic or continuing illnesses. The government's web site says:</para><para>The Commonwealth Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) helps improve the health of all Australian residents by ensuring they have access to necessary and lifesaving medicines at an affordable price.</para><para>That is the issue at the heart of the debate that we are having today. I argue strongly that medications are moving out of that affordable range for many low-income families, particularly those families who just miss out on health care cards. Basically, the scheme was set up to make sure we could all get the medications we need and that not only the wealthy could get the latest medication.</para><para>When we debated this bill last time I noted some of the specific pressures that had led this government to try to put up charges in the last budget. I lamented the way Treasury seems to deal with the health budget, looking at the PBS as a silo, seeing a large amount of money being used and thinking, `Don't worry about that, we will just take a few million dollars here and another couple of hundred million dollars there.' But some of the pressures are long-term pressures, not just ones that are spotted during a budget process, and they go beyond specific ones relating to those two drugs that drove the very rapid and sharp blip on the screen at the time of the last budget. </para><para>One of the key pressures is the new and more expensive drugs. Some drugs are meant only to target a very small and precise group within the population, so their cost is not a big issue; but for those drugs that are more generally and widely available, such as those for arthritis, that can mean tens of millions of dollars being added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I stress here that any drug has to be proven to be cost effective before it can be listed. It does not just have to do what the manufacturers claim by way of treating or curing the illness. It has to be cost effective. The government has already moved in and is specifically targeting the cost blow-out.</para><para>The next obvious reason for pressure is that the population is ageing. The population is a lot more fussy about quality of life issues as it ages. Modern medicine has taken us down the road of more very expensive but successful drugs that have replaced other procedures, particularly surgery. The final reason for pressure is that more people have access to health care cards. This was a specific issue that the government did not budget for when they made the decision to extend health care cards to self-funded retirees—a move that I do not question at all— but they should have budgeted for it and made allowances for the fact that these people, being elderly retirees, were going to be fairly heavy users of the PBS. Therefore, the government should not have been as fussed as they were about the part of the increase that was attributed to more people having access to the PBS.</para><para>Those are the only problems I will deal with today. I will move on and look at what the government is already doing. I congratulate this government—indeed, I congratulate the former government and the former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge—for starting and continuing with better prescribing campaigns and other measures. The swiping of Medicare cards was introduced to make sure that those accessing medication were Australians who were entitled to access medication. I know the government now gets a lot more information, and some of that information will enable them to more tightly target medications to those Australians who need it, to limit excessive use and to further restrict wastage.</para><para>The price-volume agreements have already been discussed in this chamber. Some would argue that the process is now getting a little too tight. Price-volume agreements are a process by which a government tries to limit the cost of medication by driving down the price it is prepared to pay the drug companies for their new drugs. This was the problem with those two specific drugs that were discussed today and the last time we dealt with this legislation. I can say, from looking through some of the recent rulings and measures that are now being taken, that it certainly now is a very tight process. The impact of all of that has yet to wash through the system.</para><para>The government has done a number of other things—a crackdown on pharmacy fraud, wider use and availability of generic medication, restrictions on doctor shopping and tighter restrictions on prescribing. These restrictions upset some doctors, and I can understand their frustration in constantly having to seek approval for the use of some medications, but this is aimed at targeting medication specifically at those who can most benefit from them. Then there has been the introduction of the lifestyle scripts, something I have been working on in this chamber for eight or nine years. The system is not fully under way, but it is well on the way. I look forward to being able to assess the results of the system of lifestyle scripts as doctors are able to use them to support what they tell patients by writing down on a script, similar to the script given for medication, some lifestyle suggestions relating to diet or exercise, giving up smoking or reducing alcohol consumption. It is up to the doctor to reinforce what they are telling their patients by putting it in writing. We note that, since the last budget and since the cries of the Treasurer that the PBS was out of control, expenditure has fallen in some months. For example, expenditure in March last year was about 7½ per cent down on March of the year before—and so it jumps around. We will not really know exactly what impact all these measures have until they are given the chance to work. </para><para>I will finally look at some issues surrounding the government's proposal to increase copayments. Copayments already go up every year—they go up with inflation, something this chamber decided to do several years ago. We need to look at the impact of a large increase, which is certainly what the government is talking about. The government itself admits that people are going to think twice before they go to the doctor. Indeed, it is one of the reasons for putting up the prices. If they decide that they really have to go to the doctor, despite the fact that the doctor is not bulk-billing anymore, and they get perhaps two or three scripts, they then have to ask the question, especially if they do not have a health care card: `Can I actually pay for two or three scripts in one hit?' Pharmacists are being asked by people: `Which script is the one I have to have tonight? I can come back on Thursday when I get paid and fix you up for the other two.' In some cases I find pharmacists are running up debt because patients are not able to find the money immediately out of their pocket, particularly if they have already had to put $35, $40 or $45 on the table in order to see the GP and then get the paperwork to claim some of that back from Medicare.</para><para>Research by the Health Economics Unit at Monash University has shown that some pensioners are already paying up to 12 per cent of their income on medical copayments. This is a mixture of costs—some of it because of reduced bulk-billing and some of it because of the pharmacy bills they already have to pay—and there is a range of other health costs, such as pain killers, which are not on the PBS. So many elderly patients are already finding a large slice of their income is going on health costs. The federal Department of Health and Ageing estimates that pensioners and other concession card holders will avoid filling about five million scripts if these changes are introduced. I am sure some of that is fair enough. There are people who probably should not have even bothered to go to the doctor, who have spent a day or so in bed and taken some time to get over whatever the illness was. But I am sure just as many, if not more, would genuinely have needed that medication. What will happen, as sometimes does now, is that they end up in the queues in our public hospitals.</para><para>If fewer scripts are filled, obviously the PBS silo is going to show at least some stabilisation or a decrease, but this will not be saving any money from the health system as a whole. Many people will end up needing more urgent treatment and far more expensive treatment. The government claims to put so much emphasis on primary care, and we can see some very good examples, such as the immunisation programs, continued funding of antismoking campaigns et cetera. But I do not understand why a government that has done some positive work in the preventative area now wants to turn around and undermine a lot of that by planning these changes. Indeed, I would argue that, if this were to go ahead, it would largely be a cost shift over to the states because it would be in our public hospitals that the bulk of this would be picked up.</para><para>In closing, I say, with all the changes and positive measures the government has put in place to assist doctors with better prescribing practices, to target medications to those Australians who need them and will benefit from them and to reduce wastage and fraud, let us give them some time to work. If we then have a situation where the increase in the PBS is considerably more than inflation—I think we have to allow for inflation, but if it is still considerably more—then let us look at other ways of funding this. Let us look at a fairer way of funding this than targeting those most in need, who are the sickest and poorest members of our community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>8977</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I almost feel that it is not really worth while standing up, because I am not going to convince anybody to change their mind, but I really need to put on the public record—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bolkus)</inline>—Sit down then, if you like.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—I do not need your advice from the chair, thank you. I will just reiterate, to remind people, that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has grown by around 14 per cent every year for the past 10 years, from just over $1 billion in 1990 to $4.5 billion or $4.6 billion in 2002, and it is still growing. I think it is actually the fastest growing part of the health budget, one of the things that drives up the cost of health care more than almost anything else because of its rate of growth, which has been well in advance of major health programs such as Medicare and public hospitals. In 2001-02 it grew by around 10 per cent. People have acknowledged here some of the things that have been brought in to try and rein that in— for example, swiping the Medicare card. However lacking in absolute integrity the card is, at least that began to get some measure of whether people actually had a card. By 1 May this year we will have a year's worth of data that we can investigate. I will be very interested if there are some people who have had sufficient Celebrex for five years in one year. I think most people would agree that that would be like being in receipt of an overpayment in social security. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think most Australians would agree that, if a drug is one that a person takes on a regular basis, we should subsidise enough for a 12-month period but not enough for five people to have taken in a year. So we will be looking at that data for ways to ensure that people get the medicine they require, but not more than they require because they are hoarding it or because they are just losing track of what medicine they have got, especially when they get it after the safety net and have got it for nothing. It may sometimes not have the same value then, and they pop it away and think: `I will just start again next year because it's too hard,' or `I think things have changed,' or `I don't know how to use it.' We have to educate people that hoarding medication is putting enormous pressure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, that giving it to someone else who is not on a health care card is also unfair, and that sending it to a relative somewhere overseas is inappropriate. Those sorts of measures will actually help to maintain that growth.</para><para>The National Prescribing Service has been running a number of campaigns on the better use of medicines. One of them is `Common colds need commonsense'. That is being run to try and reduce the overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics. About a third of upper respiratory episodes or infections are viral and do not respond to antibiotics; therefore, antibiotics are inappropriate. We have to educate the public not to expect that when they go to visit a doctor they will always get antibiotics. One GP, for example, has been using a technique of providing people with a script, especially if it is near a weekend, and advising them that it really is not necessary for them to take antibiotics. She gives them all the things they should do for a cold—rest, lots of fluid et cetera—and then says, `If these symptoms occur you might have this script filled.' The use of antibiotics amongst her patients has been reduced. That was an interesting little study I read last year.</para><para>So individual doctors are attempting to do things that will reduce the use of antibiotics. That not only saves on the PBS, which is a factor, but also reduces the likelihood that we are going to have more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. That is very undesirable and also very concerning as our population ages and we find that we have antibiotics which are ineffective in dealing with resistant bacterial infection.</para><para>The PBS grew around 10 per cent, but it still remains very high. It is more than three times higher than inflation. While the government welcomes the moderation in the growth, which vindicates, as I have said, the measures we have put in place, it would be foolish to believe that it lessens the need to take further action to make the PBS sustainable. A short, blinkered view, such as the view that we have seen displayed here this afternoon and yesterday by the Labor Party, by the Democrats, by the Greens and by the Independents, ignores the reality that if spending continues to increase at the current rate the cost of the PBS will nearly double to about $9 billion by 2007. Currently the Commonwealth spends $31 billion on health. By 2007 we will be spending $9 billion on pharmaceutical benefits alone. We cannot let this continue if we are going to continue to provide every Australian with the latest medicines when they become available at affordable prices. </para><para>In 2002 medicines worth around $100 million were added to the PBS, many for common, painful, debilitating and life-threatening conditions. I must add here that I found Senator McLucas's comments about Glivec totally unacceptable when she said it did not go through due process. It went absolutely right through the due process. The Prime Minister has every right, once it has been recommended by PBAC and I bring him the PBAC recommendation, to make a decision, not cabinet. Senator McLucas implied that there was something done that was inappropriate. I wanted to make sure that Glivec was on by October, the date when the new schedule comes out—I cannot remember the date exactly—so people in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia could get access to Glivec before Christmas. That is why I did it. Senator McLucas said that we were in the middle of an election. I do not know what she was talking about. I thought it was a humane and caring thing to do to have the Prime Minister make the decision, which he has every right to do, in lieu of cabinet to ensure that we got it onto the schedule so that people who had failed to respond to first-line treatment could have access. It has been demonstrated that for people in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia this medication is efficacious. I do not usually find Senator McLucas unfair and unreasonable, but I thought that those comments were totally inappropriate and ill-informed.</para><para>Glivec costs $6,600 a month per script. People on a health care card did get it for $3.60; it is now $3.70 because of the increase in the CPI. Non-concessional card holders get it for $23.10. It is almost the only country in the world where people get access to that sort of medication for that cost. If they are on a health care card, once they have had 50 scripts they receive that medication for free. There are many other medications lining up for approval on the PBS. It is going to put a greater and greater strain on the PBS. In the not too distant future it is quite possible that one single medicine for the treatment of a common condition, such as arthritis or diabetes, might cost taxpayers $1 billion in a single year. That is the sort of demand that is going to be placed on the PBS. I can assure senators that the Howard government is absolutely committed to sustaining the PBS, but it is ridiculous for anyone to argue that 10 per cent growth represents a sustainable situation when it is going to cost $9 billion in 2007.</para><para>When this measure was introduced in the budget, I did lots of talkback and I found people were not angry. Some of them said, `I think we should contribute more.' Last year when I first became Minister for Health and Ageing and I saw these figures I asked for some research to be done. We asked people how much they thought an expensive drug was and how much they thought they contributed. I cannot remember the exact questions, but that is the essence of them. People on a health care card thought an expensive medication was $20 and it was being subsidised. People not on a health care card thought that they were paying for the drug and cross-subsidising people on a health care card. They had no idea that the most commonly prescribed medication on the PBS costs $80 per person per month. The health care card holder now gets it for $3.70 until they have 50 scripts and then they and their family get it for free. The non-health care card holder, a general concession, pays $23.10, and once they have got to about 31 scripts they get it for free. I am talking about the most commonly prescribed medication— a statin—costing $80 per person per month. We have to somehow get a grip on reality: there are going to be more and more of those medications. </para><para>Labor can sit over there piously giving us a lecture on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, but they went out in their last year in government and borrowed $10 billion. The year before that they borrowed billions, and the year before that they borrowed billions. They were borrowing money from overseas to pay for things like the PBS. To pay for us to have medication they were borrowing from the next generation. We cannot afford to do that. At some stage we have to all understand that we have to pay our own way and not leave the next generation with a debt. They borrowed $10 billion in the last year. We could have played merry hell paying that back. We have paid back $60 billion and I think: what could I have done with that $60 billion and with the interest on the loan? I ask Senator Lees, since we both have an interest, what could have been done in health prevention. But, no, the profligate Labor Party was spending the next generation's money. </para><para>I came into this place to give kids the sort of opportunity I had when I grew up, when this country was not in debt and the world was my oyster. That is why I came in here. It was not to spend the next generation's money. That is what you people are doing right now, by the decision that you are making. It is even worse, because we introduced a measure that meant that the pension and benefits would go up in relation to average weekly earnings, which is greater than the CPI. The PBS goes up by the CPI. So every time the PBS and the pension go up, they go up at differential rates. I am sure there will be people out there listening; I do not know whether the people here will get the drift of what I am saying. At the beginning, the proportion of my pension that I pay on pharmaceuticals is a constant figure. Every time the pension goes up by MTAWE and the PBS goes up by the CPI, the next group of people, or the next cohort or even the same people, pay a smaller—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—I suggest that you listen to this because it is quite complex and I hope you get it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—People pay a smaller proportion of their pension each time they get an increase—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—Senator Crossin, I know that you do not want to hear this, because it hurts.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bolkus)</inline>—Order, Senator Crossin!

At some point in time, the chickens will come home to roost and light will dawn on the other side, and they will have to increase the PBS copayment. Those people will then be paying a much bigger contribution than they will need to as part of their pension. </para></talk.start></continue><para>As I was trying to explain in question time the other day, if I have a family with small children the highest use of the PBS is in the first four or five years. So I am in the period where my income or my welfare benefit is going up by MTAWE and the PBS is going up by the CPI. When the chickens come home to roost, the copayment has to go up significantly and the next generation of people with children aged one to five—they are in the same real generation; it is an intragenerational unfairness—will pay a significantly higher proportion of their income, welfare payment or family benefit on pharmaceutical benefits. That, to me, is unfair.</para><para>What motivates me in this place is trying to make sure that people have the same sorts of opportunities that I had when I was growing up—which is fair—and the same relative cost in terms of their income, as best we can do that across and within generations. Tonight you are not doing justice to people who at some stage will have to pay that increased copayment. It is unsustainable that we do not have a moderate increase to allow us to put on the PBS medications that are coming up for arthritis, and the Glivec medication, which costs $6,600 per person per month. I want to be able to do that, but I also want to make it fair for people across generations and, as I said, within generations. But maybe that argument is too hard for some people. I have been through it with Senator Allison and I have been through it with Senator Lees. Senator Allison has the view that we should not do it, but it seems fair to me that we make a decision, for example, that a percentage of the pension—it might be one per cent or 0.98 per cent—is contributed. Now it fluctuates. It goes down and then it goes up again when there is an increase in the copayment, and it is not fair across and within small cohorts of a generation. </para><para>We heard all this pious nonsense from the other side of the chamber. I need to get the facts on the table. Under Labor, from 1983 to 1996 the general PBS patient copayment increased by 420 per cent—from $4 to $16.80. In 1986, Labor imposed a one-off increase in the general copayment of $5; in 1990, they imposed another one-off increase of $4. The average annual increase was 17.75 per cent. Do you know what? The coalition supported that because we try to behave in a fiscally responsible way. We most probably got up and complained about it, said how terrible it was and said that the then government could not organise themselves out of a paper bag, but then we agreed to it because we were fiscally responsible. </para><para>When there comes a time that we have a problem putting medications on the PBS because they blow it out, I will sit back and say, `Thank you, Labor Party; thank you, Senator Lees; thank you, Senator Allison and the Democrats; and thank you, Greens and Independents. Thank you for being so absolutely irresponsible.' We are asking for a modest increase of a dollar for concession card holders and a 50-script limit for a family safety net. We are asking people to pay an extra $50 over a year when they have a MTAWE increase in their allowances or pensions. We hope to have it in by July so that those people who are very sick will be in the safety net, will be getting their medications for free and would have had five to six months warning before the increase. I had thought that through.</para><para>I hope that Senator Allison is squirming and I hope that Senator Lees is squirming. I do not think the Labor Party have the conscience to squirm. They increased the PBS copayment, and they sit on the other side and go on with a whole lot of pious nonsense that would make you think that they had never introduced the copayment and they had never actually increased it. But no, they used to borrow to pay for their excesses. We believe that the Australian public and the government have to face the fact that we need to pay our own way in each generation.</para><para>The Intergenerational Report always comes up in these sorts of debates. We are accused of having introduced it just because of the PBS. That is not the case. It was introduced under the Charter of Budget Honesty, and every government will have to give an account of itself every five years about the levers. I tell you what: I will remind everyone, every time they look at an intergenerational report, that one of the reasons that we have a problem with the PBS is that people on the other side of the chamber failed to do something that was a little difficult but right and absolutely fair—and fair to those people who will come on and need to use the PBS in the future.

However, it does have an interesting history. This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives last year and was amended by the government 24 hours prior to being debated. In spite of the late notice of the amendments, Labor did not oppose this bill in the other place. The bill relates to four distinct issues. It proposes changes to the operation of the transitional rules applying to compulsory third party, or CPT, insurance; it provides an exemption for interest withholding tax, IWT, in relation to certain international transactions; it exempts from capital gains tax compensation payments in relation to the German Forced Labour Compensation Program; and it enables products issued by friendly societies to have the same tax treatment as similar products issued by other bodies. Today I will focus on the IWT exemptions.</para></talk.start><para>The bill makes a number of exemptions in relation to interest withholding tax. The bill, in its original form, proposed an exemption for the interest paid on nostro accounts held by authorised deposit-taking institutions. Nostro accounts are foreign currency accounts maintained by certain financial institutions with foreign banks for the purpose of settling foreign currency transactions. The government amendments extended the original exemption to nostro accounts held by financial institutions which are not ADIs but which conduct banking business with the public. The amendment to exempt nostro accounts from interest withholding tax aims to reduce the compliance burden on financial institutions and facilitate business conducted by financial institutions. The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>The compliance costs imposed on financial institutions in meeting the IWT obligation are very high relative to the amount of tax collected. Exempting interest paid on nostro accounts from IWT will eliminate the compliance costs imposed in meeting the current IWT obligation associated with these accounts.</para></quote><para>Labor support the principle of reducing the compliance burden on business. However, we support this principle for small business too. The Howard government are only interested in reducing the compliance burden on big business. They consistently ignore the burden on small business. Last week the Yellow Pages Business Index—Small and Medium Enterprises found that one of the most significant criticisms by small business of the federal government is that there is too much paperwork due to the GST. The same study also found that small business' most significant criticism of federal government policies was that the federal government were only concerned with big business. It is not just the Labor Party saying that the Howard government's main priority is big business: the Yellow Pages survey shows that it is everyday small business people who can see that the government's mates at the big end of town get the priority whenever they make a call. They can see that the government has a two-tiered approach to Australian business. Big business gets all the breaks and even gets legislative help to reduce the compliance burden, but no such luck for small business. The Howard government are saying to small businesses who are struggling under a mountain of paperwork, `You're on your own.' The Howard government's main priority is big business. It always has been and always will be.</para><para>According to the second reading speech, the changes to IWT are aimed at enhancing Australia's development as a centre for financial services in the Asia-Pacific region. To enhance Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region we need to be doing much more than offering tax concessions to financial institutions. Australia's presence in the Asia-Pacific region has reached an all-time low. Australia has failed to secure a place at regional economic forums. We failed to attain a place at ASEAN plus 3. How can Australia position itself as a `financial services platform for ASIA' if we are not even part of the regional economic forums? If we cannot get the fundamentals right, why are we bothering to tinker around the edges with tax concessions?</para><para>The groundwork done by Paul Keating in the 1980s and early 1990s to promote Australia's role as an equal partner in the Asia-Pacific region has been squandered by the Howard government. The Howard government is short-sighted. For John Howard, Asia holds little appeal. There are no votes in engaging Asia—as Paul Keating found out— but it is about more than just winning votes. It is about engaging our Asian neighbours. It is about becoming a part of the region. It is about the future of the region and Australia's role in it. I see Australia's future as mortgaged to Asia. If we fail to engage the region, if we cannot work with our neighbours, if we are suspicious of them and if we unduly criticise them, our future is compromised. </para><para>We should be working with our South-East Asian neighbours to assist the creation of sound financial infrastructure throughout the region, not as an imperialist act but as a way to create a vibrant economic region which attracts global capital flows and investment. We should also be working with China and Japan to foster economic growth in the region. Economic growth is not an end in itself. It provides the means by which to create jobs, prosperity and stability in the region. Economic growth, whilst providing these benefits, is not the only reason for strong regional cooperation. It is also important in these uncertain times, when the threat of terrorism is a daily event, to ensure that there is an open and friendly dialogue between Australian and our regional neighbours. We need to strengthen those ties now and in the future. Clearly, we have a lot of catching up to do. Labor will not oppose this bill and will assist its speedy passage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>8983</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1621">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002. </inline>This bill would ordinarily be treated as noncontroversial by the Senate. However, I note that Labor was frustrated by some late changes to the bill in the House of Representatives and has decided that it should not be given noncontroversial status. That is not a decision with which I disagree since it gives all parties concerned the opportunity to express opinions which otherwise they might not have had the opportunity to express.</para></talk.start><para>I will deal with the various aspects of the bill briefly. Firstly, the amendments to the interest withholding tax exemption for specific corporate debenture issues will reduce some of the technical anomalies that the current law has produced. The Democrats understand that Australian companies are competing for debt funding in a global environment and that the tax laws should not act as an undue restriction. Secondly, the bill deals with the capital gains tax exemption for compensation payments received by Australian residents under the German Forced Labour Compensation Program. When I read that I found it difficult to believe that Australia's tax laws would treat a compensation payment for an injustice that occurred 60 years ago as a capital gain. However, if there is even a remote possibility that our highly complex tax laws could or would operate in this way, we should attend to it. It seems that our tax laws have always had a capacity to be an ass at times. The Democrats fully support an amendment that clarifies that tax should not be paid in these circumstances.</para><para>Thirdly, the bill deals with the taxation treatment of friendly society products, such as income bonds, funeral bonds and scholarship plans. I understand that the treatment of these products is similar to that of life insurance products and that the amendments again clarify the technical position of the various transactions involved, ensuring that there is no double taxation. Finally, the bill amends the GST transition act with respect to compulsory third party insurance premiums. This minor amendment ensures that the 30 June 2003 transition date will not cause unreasonable compliance difficulties for the various state authorities and private insurers providing compulsory third party insurance, or a green slip as it is sometimes known. </para><para>However, these amendments represent more bandaids for our complex tax system. These bandaids are required, but they are bandaids that should be put into context. They should be put into the context of the principles of good tax policy. The three principles of good tax policy are really easy to say—equity, simplicity and efficiency—but they are frighteningly difficult to achieve. Tax is about money—getting it and spending it for the good of society. The greatest problem facing the Australian government is that it is short of money to meet the needs of government and the needs of society. The government has made decisions that mean it does not have enough money—decisions on going to war, for instance. The need for additional revenue is strong. Fortunately, finding that additional revenue is possible if the government will address at least two of the principles of taxation—namely, equity and efficiency.</para><para>We know that the upcoming budget will not provide the resources that are needed to ensure the adequate health, education and social security of all Australians. We know that the government has committed Australian troops to a United States led war on Iraq, but that Mr Costello and Senator Hill have no idea of the anticipated cost of that policy and of that war. They expect it will be several hundred million dollars, but it seems that the defence department has effectively been given a blank cheque, so perhaps hundreds, based on precedent, could turn into billions.</para><para>Where will the money come from? Mr Costello has held down expenditure in health, education and other important areas of government. The pressure is building up and the government simply cannot put off spending more in these areas without risking the wrath of the Australian people. So where will the money come from? Despite the claims of some, Australia's tax take is amongst the lowest in the OECD, yet a major campaign for income tax cuts is again under way. Economic rationalists say reducing government expenditure on goods and services should pay for them. Can tax cuts be paid for by more major cuts in government expenditure? The answer is no. This is a democracy. The electorate calls the shots and the vast majority of voters are rightly demanding the government spend more, not less, on legitimate unsatisfied needs.</para><para>There is a great cry from most Australians for more government spending on creating jobs, on the environment, on defence and internal security, on industry programs, health and education services, and drought relief. More expenditure to be America's deputy sheriff or for health and education services means raising more revenue. Instead of simply increasing tax rates, an alternative is to reduce other income tax concessions and the hidden subsidies that the government has used in recent years to provide high-income earners with de facto tax cuts.</para><para>Let me provide some examples of how Mr Costello can increase his revenue flow without further destroying essential government services. Firstly, the government's private health insurance rebate should be means tested. The cost of the program will soon reach $3 billion per year. Based on tax statistics, nearly 75 per cent of the money goes to the top 40 per cent of income earners. Why is the government cutting back on health spending for ordinary Australians but providing a 30 per cent subsidy for very wealthy individuals to stay in five-star hospitals and to have access to state-of-the-art gymnasiums? A reasonable capping and means testing of this rebate, without getting rid of it, could deliver savings of at least $1 billion. There would be minimal, if any, impact on the health system as the Medicare levy surcharge and a stressed public system ensure that the rich and well off would never give up their private health insurance. So $1 billion or one-third of that private health insurance rebate could be saved by setting the appropriate means testing mechanism. </para><para>Secondly, the government has announced that it will back down on the equitable taxation of family trusts. This will cost it at least $450 million a year. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommended that the taxation of companies and trusts be aligned. That is a matter of equity as well as greater efficiency and greater revenue generation. This would have improved the simplicity of the tax system and would have reduced the use of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle. The government has decided that that is too hard. They do not want to take on the tax cheats who use family trusts to hide and inappropriately distribute their income.</para><para>Thirdly, the concessional treatment of company cars used for salary packaging could be reviewed. Fringe benefits tax treatment of company cars not only provides the incentive to salary package motor vehicles, it also provides an incentive to drive them as much as possible. The more you drive the car, the less tax you pay. The deadline each year is the end of March. Throughout this month we will hear of people who know they must drive their cars to reach the relevant minimum number of kilometres for the year, whether 25,000 or 15,000. These people will deliberately use their cars as much as possible to reach the minimum number of kilometres. Driving the cars as much as possible reduces their employer's tax bill and, therefore, in a salary sacrifice context, increases the employee's income. It is environmentally stupid, it costs the Australian taxpayer $900 million a year—which is the government's own figure—and it is not equitable. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation estimated that even modest reforms to the taxation treatment of company cars could save $200 million per year. Again the government has not accepted this challenge. </para><para>Additionally, up to $600 million could be raised by reforming employee share schemes that benefit some employees and not others. Restoring the indexation of the petrol excise would also provide hundreds of millions of dollars and hopefully help encourage more environmentally sustainable fuels and methods of transport. The overall value of work related deductions is about $7 billion. Up to $500 million could be raised by rationalising and capping work related deductions. Reviewing negative gearing is a real possibility. The majority of overseas countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, either do not allow or severely restrict negative gearing. It costs Australia well over $2 billion a year, perhaps approaching $3 billion, and tax reform could save at least $700 million, or one third of that. Removing the mutuality provision tax exemption from the large big business clubs and others that operate on a commercial basis and rort the intention of that mutuality provision would save $200 million a year. We could reduce funding to wealthy private schools by $150 million. Other revenue creating possibilities include reviewing the $12 billion of concessions for superannuation and the capital gains discounts for individuals and institutional investors.</para><para>I could go on with the list but, for the Democrats, eliminating tax rorts and cutting wasteful tax expenditure will always be attractive options. Now is the time, when the government is short of money, to take the hard decisions and address these areas—then you will get our support. Corporate welfare and welfare for the well-off will always be good targets for us to improve the budget bottom line. So the government should not consider that they can cut back on essential services simply because they have spent too much on favourite programs or on a blank cheque war. Reducing unwarranted tax expenditures and concessions is a possibility. Tax expenditure, as the tax statistics show, is over $30 billion and, as I have shown, the Democrats believe a $7 billion to $10 billion reduction may be feasible. As a nation, we need to agree on how much we want to reform income taxation and how much more we need to spend on essential needs. We need to add the two together and work out how to pay for it and what the trade-offs are. That is the challenge in the upcoming budget. The tax expenditure policies, budgetary cost, distributional implications, efficiencies and imperfections have not been systematically studied, but they should be. If they were, reform would release many billions of dollars for the government's needs.</para><para>Another area that desperately needs reform is the interaction of the tax and welfare systems. Low income Australians moving between welfare and work can be hit with effective tax rates of up to 87c in the dollar. As they enter work they lose 70c in welfare benefits and have to pay 17c in tax. The consequence is that the gross income they achieve by either a salary increase or by going to work is massively eroded so that their disposable income increase is minor. The unemployed are in the unfortunate position of knowing that if they get a job they may be only 13c in the dollar better off for their efforts. After taking into account their transport costs, clothing, additional food expenditure and other on-costs, they may not be better off at all.  </para><para>I see that the Commonwealth Ombudsman noted last week that the family tax payment system is causing families unavoidable debt. Almost 50,000 families have racked up more than $400 million in debt at an average of $801 for each family. In question time yesterday, Senator Vanstone boasted that a single income family on $30,000 per annum with two kids would get $9,442 tax free. This is a significant amount and there is no wonder that these payments can create large family tax payment debts and high effective tax rates when there is an income movement. Analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that 22 per cent of the poorer half of the nation face effective marginal tax rates of more than 60 per cent. So the problem for us in equity terms is much more at the lower end than at the upper end. At the upper end, corporate welfare and the benefits that go to the wealthy mean that the effective tax rates are lower. At the lower end, the nature of the welfare system and the tax system means that effective tax rates are high.</para><para>Those statistics do not include the high number of people who are discouraged from entering the work force by these poverty traps. The most promising area of reform is the concept of the tax credit. Tax credits are designed to soften the impact of high effective tax rates. Such proposals may have a cost, but I outlined earlier the many areas in which the government can reduce the existing tax concessions for the wealthy, including means testing private health insurance to save $1 billion a year, taxing trusts properly to save $450 million per year, or removing tax concessions on salary packaged cars to save $200 million a year. It is not the right area to want to spend that money in, but it would also pay for a lot of war. If you want to wage war, you need money. There are plenty of savings that can be made. These could be redirected into a tax credit system to reduce the high effective tax rates faced by persons moving from welfare to employed work. We cannot attack the welfare system— it is bedded in the modern economy's view of how to deliver equity. What you have to ensure is that maximum equity is delivered with the least effect on the efficiency of the country. I think it was Bismarck who first began the modern welfare system over 150 years ago by introducing pension systems. </para><para>The welfare system is not a slug or a brake on the community. It is actually a great aid to civil society and to the way in which our society works. The most disadvantaged in our society have a right to be given income support and to be treated with respect. Most of all, they have the right to the same opportunities that many in this chamber have had—that is, to emerge from a lower income situation and to aspire to a higher one where they can get better education and better pay. Shouldn't our tax and welfare systems interact in a way that encourages rather than penalises an individual's effort to escape that poverty trap? Surely any measure that can reduce unemployment, thereby increasing economic activity, should be carefully considered. The Democrats encourage the government to consider a tax credit system and to consult on a multiparty basis in that area.</para><para>So far, the government have focused in law on trying to restrict the living wage. The problem with the living wage is the increases. Living wage increases increase gross wages and add-on costs like superannuation, so they deliver a high cost to the employer and a low benefit to the employee because of the consequences of the high effective tax rates. The disposable income of the employee only results in a low net increase. It would be far better to look at how the tax and welfare systems interact than to try to artificially restrain the negotiating and the institutionalised process by which people seek to keep the low-wage members of our society at least in some competitive situation. In my view, it is more important for the government to pursue the issue of tax and welfare offsets than to pursue the living wage legislation which they are looking at currently. I find it interesting that Minister Abbott is running both agendas. He is running the industrial relations agenda of trying to restrain the abilities of people to put the living wage case, but, on the other hand, he is also running hard up against the Treasurer and the Prime Minister by saying, `Let's look at the tax and wage intersection.' I find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister appears to have ruled out the sensible idea of examining the tax credit system thoroughly and in concert with others. </para><para>There is an urgent and great need for a system that delivers significant real disposable income increases for the lower paid, to encourage a move from welfare to work, to deliver social equity and to give working people a chance to get off the floor and to aspire to upward mobility for their families. I note that the Commonwealth Ombudsman said that under the family tax system large numbers of people are experiencing very high debts. That plainly is an unattractive situation as well and needs to be urgently corrected by the government. I should indicate in closing that the Democrats will support this bill without amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>8987</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am grateful to my colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Conroy for their support for the <inline ref="R1621">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002</inline>. Their comments have ranged very widely across the taxation landscape. The bill contains a number of very important measures which I will return to in a moment. I should say that it is not my intention to canvass in detail each point that has been made by Senators Conroy and Murray. However, there are a couple of issues that I want to make a few comments on. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I welcome the fact that Senator Conroy supports interest withholding tax. I certainly hope that his commitment to developing Australia as a regional centre for financial services will also be as forthcoming when the foreign expatriates tax reforms are before this place. That is an equally important issue. Senator Conroy also mentioned— at least, I think this is what he was saying— that if we do not get into Asian economic forums, there is no point in providing tax concessions. But in the real world we all know that these concessions can make a real difference—indeed, the difference—to business decisions that will enhance the role of Australian business in the Asian region. The concessions are a very positive move that will make a great difference to business and will no doubt be enhanced by the review of international tax.</para><para>Senator Conroy also spoke briefly about what is becoming a very familiar topic—at least advanced by the Labor Party—and that is the government's support for the big end of town, supposedly at the expense of the small end of town, in particular in relation to the compliance burden that all businesses have in managing in the tax system. I want to refute that because there is no doubt that this government has not only addressed but is concerned on an ongoing basis—and I can say this because it concerns me greatly— about business concerns about compliance, particularly with the change to the new tax system. The government recognised business concerns about the compliance burden of the GST and following extensive consultations—which are now the hallmark of this government, particularly in relation to tax laws—made significant changes to streamline the GST payment and reporting arrangements for small business. It has borne fruit, because the December 2001 Dun and Bradstreet National Business Expectations Survey revealed that 76 per cent of respondents found it easier to complete the new, simplified BAS form.</para><para>There are a range of views on the issue. Notwithstanding perhaps some recent claims, most professional bodies have reported within the last couple of months that complaints about BAS lodgment have dropped off significantly. Other evidence also suggests that compliance costs have eased as businesses have become more familiar with the new tax system, as indeed the government expected. This was reflected in the survey results of the Yellow Pages Business Index—Small and Medium Enterprises. In the May survey of last year, only six per cent of respondents cited the GST as a concern. Over the financial year, the Australian Taxation Office has also noticed a continuing downward trend in the time taken to prepare and complete business activity statements. </para><para>So the compliance cost implications of the GST must be viewed in the light of the entire tax reform package. Incorporated businesses are benefiting from cuts in company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. Businesses are also benefiting from the removal of the old wholesale sales tax and other embedded taxes. In September last year, in fulfilment of its election commitment to Australian taxpayers, the government introduced legislation into the parliament to establish a statutory office of the Inspector-General of Taxation. It is a great pity that the Labor Party and the Democrats have, thus far, not seen fit to pass the bill to set up the office of the inspector-general, which, as a taxpayers' advocate, would provide significant assistance to small business in the whole area of compliance. The Senate will soon be asked to reconsider the bill, and it is important that the legislation be passed as a matter of urgency so that the inspector-general can start on the important task of improving tax administration for the benefit of all Australians and that, of course, includes ordinary taxpayers and small business. It is a much-needed office to bridge the gap in the current administration of the tax office and it should be passed forthwith.</para><para>Senator Murray, in his usual exhaustive and careful way, has outlined what one might regard as a wish list or certainly a list of areas to which he would like to see some attention given in relation to rearranging the tax landscape. In particular, while not replying in detail to every point raised by Senator Murray, I would like to point out that tax cheats are suffering under this government, and will continue to suffer further. I am sure that is something that most Australians— those who pay their fair share of tax—would welcome because we do want a fair system where everyone pays their fair share of tax. In this year's budget, in which we were able to increase the tax office's resources, an initiative taken by the tax office to do with tracking down tax cheats is expected to yield additional tax revenue of about $1,500 million over the forward estimates. </para><para>Recently, the tax commissioner released an outline of the tax office compliance program for 2002-03. I commend it to Senators Conroy and Murray, if they have not had a chance to have a look at it already, because the compliance program identifies possible risks to the revenue and strategies that the tax office has under way to manage these across the range of taxpayer segments. The tax office continues to provide a high level of help and education to assist the vast majority of people who do do the right thing. However, its focus has shifted to more active compliance, including verification activities, field visits and other audits. A key priority, contrary to what Senator Conroy might say, remains targeting big business and high-wealth individuals. In the past five years, the tax office's extensive audit program at the so-called `big end of town' has netted an extra $2.64 billion for the community. This year, one in 10 businesses will be subject to some form of audit, and more than 135,000 people will be required to confirm their tax deductions. The tax office will boost its GST compliance staff by around 350 and its serious noncompliance investigations group to 300. Some other high-profile risks which are receiving close scrutiny from the tax office in 2002-03 are aggressive tax planning, the cash economy, work related and rental property expenses, the correct reporting of capital gains and losses, and illegal tobacco and fuel substitution.</para><para>I want to spend another moment or two on the taxation of discretionary trusts. The government has said that it will legislate, with effect from the handing down of the Board of Taxation's report on discretionary trusts, to introduce new provisions in place of section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act dealing with distributions from trusts. The board has recommended these measures, and the government has accepted that they are required to improve the effectiveness of the deemed dividend rules so as to more actively prevent beneficiaries accessing trust income that has borne tax only at the company tax rate, and to remove the unfairness in the operation of section 109UB that is currently inducing some small and medium sized business operators to establish arrangements that enable them to avoid the operation of the section completely. In addition, the board has recommended that the ATO clarify and publish its views on interest deductibility for borrowings used to finance non-assessable distributions to beneficiaries of discretionary trusts. The government has requested clarification and will, if the rulings are unable to deal with the matter, also consider a legislative solution. </para><para>The report notes the success of previous government measures in the following areas: use of non-resident trusts to transfer funds offshore, inappropriate utilisation of losses, circulating distributions and tracing distributions through to the ultimate beneficiaries, personal service income rules and revised social security means test treatment of private trusts and private companies. The report recommends that the government should retain the current flowthrough treatment of distributions of non-assessable amounts by discretionary trusts rather than a company type taxation model. So tax cheats have been suffering under this government, and they will suffer more. This is clearly identified in the compliance schedule.</para><para>Having made those remarks, I do not want to take up too much time on the bill which, as I have said, is supported and contains some very important measures. The bill demonstrates the government's clear commitment to a better tax system. It contains four measures, all of which will be of value to taxpayers. Firstly, it will enhance Australia's development as a centre for financial services in the Asia-Pacific region. Secondly, the bill exempts payments made to Australian residents, and their heirs, who suffered injustices and loss during the Nationalist Socialist period. Thirdly, the bill reduces compliance cost for compulsory third party insurers at the time when the transitional rules are ending and they are implementing a new compliance system. Lastly, friendly societies will be allowed a deduction for investment income paid to recipients of income from special purpose investment products, thereby preventing double taxation that may have arisen in some circumstances. Finally, I repeat that I am pleased that my colleagues support this bill and the very sensible measures, the necessary measures, contained in it to ensure the ongoing program of having a fair tax system. I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>8989</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTRIBUTORY PARENTS MIGRATION SCHEME) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>8989</page.no><id.no>R1696</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MIGRATION (VISA APPLICATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1697</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>8989</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 3 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>8989</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are dealing with two bills cognately. In addressing the <inline ref="R1696">Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1697">Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, I think it is important to start with an acknowledgment of what migrants have contributed to Australia. Migrants have built this nation. The Australian story is in many ways a migrant story. Apart from our Indigenous peoples, we are a nation of migrants. People have come from all around the world, some under the great post-war immigration program, which was aimed at strengthening and populating the nation. Others have come to Australia as the result of war and conflict in their home countries. People have come to Australia under the skilled program and as members of families. Many have come as refugees, having fled their homelands seeking safety and peace for themselves and their families. I am pleased to say that many refugees have found that safety and peace in this country and have been able to rebuild lives and make major contributions to our nation. </para></talk.start><para>No matter how people have come, it is an understandable desire for migrants to seek to have their family join them. For many people the family is the foundation stone for their lives. I know that the family is the centre of many people's lives particularly their parents' lives. In fact this government would have us believe that they are the only ones in this place concerned about families. But this concern for family life does not seem to extend to migrant families and their overseas parents. It is also important for children to have access to their grandparents. This is particularly important for migrant families. Grandparents are an important source of their language, culture and history. </para><para>Necessarily, parents tend to be older migrants, and research on the economics of migration has consistently shown that age plays a critical role. Younger migrants prove to be a net economic positive, with skilled younger migrants making the greatest economic contribution. Older migrants tend to be a net economic negative, with a cost of support in terms of health and welfare payments outweighing their economic contribution to the nation. Some interesting research recently published in the United States attempted to put a dollar figure on the differences. A highly educated migrant arriving at age 21 was calculated at having a net present value to the economy of $332,000 over their lifetime. For a poorly educated migrant age 21, the net present value was $9,000. For a highly educated 70-year-old migrant, the net present value drops to minus $148,000. For a poorly educated 70-year-old migrant, the net present value drops to minus $166,000. </para><para>Australian research by Dr Birrell and Dr James Jupp shows that welfare dependence by immigrants increases with the age of arrival. Understanding this, but also understanding the importance to families of having their parents with them particularly as parents age, the Labor government sought to strike an equitable balance between the costs of the migration of parents that should be borne by the Australian community and the costs that should be borne privately by sponsoring individuals.</para><para>A little bit of history: obviously there have to be some limits on parent migration and in 1998 the then Labor government sought to reduce parent migration by introducing the balance of family test. This means that the number of adult children, Australian citizens or permanent residents living in Australia is equal to, or greater than, the number of children living outside Australia. This helped to ensure that the migration program was focused on those parents who needed to be united with their families in order to achieve adequate personal, social and economic support.</para><para>Further changes were made in 1991 when the then Labor government introduced the assurance of support bond at $3,500 for each principal applicant and $1,500 for each additional applicant. Under the scheme the sponsor of the parent migrant paid the bond to the Commonwealth government. The bond was used to fund any welfare payments claimed by the migrant. At the end of two years unused funds were repaid with interest. Welfare payments that exceeded the value of the bond were recoverable from the assurer as a debt to the Commonwealth government. In addition, the then Labor government introduced a migrant health service charge. Under this scheme a non-refundable levy of $822 had to be paid by the sponsor of each parent migrant. </para><para>The aim of these changes was to strike an equitable balance between the health and welfare costs of parent migration that the taxpayer, the Australian community, should bear and the health and welfare costs of parent migration that the sponsoring family should bear. It is important to note that Labor structured these changes so that those seeking to sponsor did not face hardship and those seeking to have their parents migrate faced the same barriers not different barriers. Under these proposed changes the situation will be very different. The bottom line of these changes, introduced by the Liberal government and supported by the Australian Democrats—much to our surprise—is that if you have money your parents can come; if not, you wait in a queue. That queue is now so long, with waiting times well over 10 years, that many parents will die in the queue. </para><para>Labor's understanding of the need for parent migration meant that in the last intake of 1995-96, under a Labor government, the number of parent visas issued was 8,900. On coming to office, the Howard Liberal government immediately took an aggressive approach to limiting parent migration. In addition to announcing a review of the whole system, the Howard Liberal government did the following. Firstly, it introduced measures to tighten the balance of family test. This tightening would have required more than 50 per cent of a parent's children to reside in Australia. In the case of parents with two children, a fairly standard case, this measure would have required both to be living in Australia. The Senate disallowed this change. Secondly, almost as soon as coming to office, the Howard Liberal government successfully introduced a two-year waiting period for social security benefits. Thirdly, the Howard Liberal government introduced a cap on parent visas of $7,600 in 1996-97, which was then slashed to $1,000 in 1997-98.</para><para>As a result of this review, the Howard Liberal government amended the relevant regulation in 1998 to introduce new parent visa classes with an assurance of support of $4,000 for principal applicants, $2,000 for additional applicants and a migrant health service charge of $5,000. Under this regulatory regime, 2,800 places would have been made available for parent visas under transitional arrangements for applicants under the old visa classes—that is, the queue with the usual assurance of support and the migrant health service charge. An uncapped number of visas would have been available for those seeking parent visas in the newly created and more expensive queue. With the support of the Democrats, Labor disallowed these regulations in the Senate on the basis they would have imposed hardship on families seeking to have their parents migrate. In response, Minister Ruddock reduced the number of places available for parent visas to a cap of 500, and the cap still remains in place—that is, 500 visas annually around the globe.</para><para>In 2000, the Howard Liberal government introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000. Part of this bill provided for a new parent visa class with an assurance of support of $10,000 for principal applicants, $4,000 for additional applicants and a migrant health services charge of $25,000 or proof of satisfactory private health insurance cover. The Liberal government was proposing that 4,000 places be allocated to the new and more expensive visa classes. Labor and the Democrats defeated that part of the bill dealing with parent visas. Once again, Labor took the view that the proposal would have created hardship and inequity in creating two queues: one for those with financial resources and one for those without. At that time, the Democrats, particularly Senator Bartlett, agreed with the Labor Party. Senator Bartlett said:</para><quote><para>... regulation, particularly on the grounds that it provided a mechanism which meant that basically people who have significant amounts of wealth would get an advantage over those who do not.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... the Democrats certainly believe that wealth or otherwise of parents should not be a determining factor in whether or not people can get into the country ...</para></quote><para>It seems that, in supporting these new measures, the Democrats have now decided that wealth should be a determining factor for parents migration. In 2002-03, the parent visa class remains capped at 500 places. The conditions applying to the visas are the need for an assurance of support of $3,500 for principal applicants and a migrant health services charge of $1,050. Save for the indexing of the migrant health services charge, these visas have the same conditions as imposed by Labor in 1991. Obviously, 500 places per year are nowhere near sufficient to meet demand. If we contrast that cap of 500 places with the 8,900 places available in the last year of Labor government or even the 7,600 places available in the first year of the Howard government, 500 places stand out starkly as a very draconian cap. In implementing and maintaining this cap, the Howard Liberal government has deliberately created a crisis in parent migration. </para><para>There are currently 22,400 applications in the pipeline with 14,800 fully processed and with queue dates. Given the age of many of the persons seeking entry, they will die before they ever reach the front of the queue. This means that families with parents in the queue are desperate. The situation is now so hopeless for them that they will pay any price and do anything that is necessary to get their parents here.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>8992</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</title><page.no>8992</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>8992</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>It is appropriate to draw the amendments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to the attention of the Senate and of the general public. It is one of the major global mechanisms for trying to protect and preserve endangered wildlife that is subject to international trade. These amendments, made at the last convention of the parties in November 2002, highlight the extreme environmental impact that can occur from trading in wildlife of all sorts. It is one of the reasons the Democrats believe all trade agreements should be cognisant of potential environmental impacts, rather than having separate treaties completely disconnected from trade agreements—for example, the free trade agreement with Singapore—and to have trade agreements implicitly recognise the need to ensure that there are not significant environmental impacts as a direct consequence of the trade.</para><para>These amendments and the reasons for the proposed treaty action detailed in here quite clearly indicate that trade in wildlife can have a direct negative consequence on the very survival of particular species. There are 12 species, different taxa, that were either listed or moved into appendix 1 of the convention—and appendix 1 is basically those species where international commercial trade is prohibited. All are significantly endangered as a direct consequence of trade in those species, and that is why they are listed here. For example, a chameleon from Madagascar that is significantly endangered is listed as a direct consequence of a high demand in trade for pets. We have many people here in Australia who advocate that we should be trying to build an international pet trade in Australian wildlife. Indeed, there is expanding trade in the United States in some Australian wildlife. I think that is a dangerous practice to promote willy-nilly without a clear examination of the potential environmental impacts on each particular species as well as there being significant animal welfare issues that can apply when Australian native animals are exported into foreign environments and kept as pets. It is no coincidence that many of these species that have been transferred onto appendix 1 are the subject of interested trade from collectors, pet traders and the like. In addition to the chameleon, many different species of birds— six different subspecies of parrot and macaw—as well as different types of turtles have been put into the convention for the first time. </para><para>Plants are also an important part of the convention. In recent times we have seen a little bit of publicity about Australian business people who have been involved in illegal trade in exotic plants. That is a dangerous approach from an environmental point of view, not just because it may make plants extinct but also because it can, and has, led to plants escaping into the wild in foreign environments and becoming exotic weeds and pests. A number of different plant species—orchids, cactus and various types of palm trees—have been listed because they have become endangered due to trade.</para><para>It is worth noting a couple of sharks as well: the whale shark and the basking shark are species that are under threat. They are common in Australian waters, but obviously not common enough or they would not be listed in this trade in endangered species convention. It is an important convention, and this is one area where the Australian government have a fairly good record. I support them and encourage the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to keep up those efforts because it is important. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—Do you care to seek leave to continue your remarks?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships</title><page.no>8993</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>8993</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>The International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, as with all those I speak to tonight, will be examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Whilst I am in the rare circumstance of saying nice things about the government, I should also note that one of their good initiatives was the establishment of that committee, which enables better examination of these sorts of important documents. Highlighting them here now shows how significant these conventions are.</para><para>This is a very important convention that has been put together. Without saying that it is watertight, it is a significant advance in trying to get controls on the use of antifouling systems on ships. In particular, it aims to ban the use of organotin compounds which act as biocides in antifouling paints, specifically tributyl tin—or TBT—based antifouling paints. These paints act as a biocide to prevent the growth of algae, barnacles and other organisms on ships hulls, which might sound like a good idea, but they do pose a significant toxic risk and have significant impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. Basically, TBT is a toxic poison and its widespread use is leading to significant poisoning of our marine ecosystems. So the fact that this convention has been put together to seek to phase out or eliminate the use of TBT as an antifouling device is very welcome and is a significant advance.</para><para>One point I would like to emphasise is that there are still TBT based antifouling paints available for use in Australia as well as elsewhere. There are many, particularly small level, operations that still use these sorts of antifoulants on ships, in ship repairs and ship maintenance in Australian waters, marinas and shipyards. I urge the government, as part of the implementation of this convention, to work as quickly as possible to eliminate the use or the production of TBT based antifouling paints in Australia or, indeed, the import of those paints. There are already alternatives non-TBT based antifouling paints available domestically and overseas. That being the case, the Democrats urge the government to move very quickly to eliminate the production, sale and import of all TBT based paints in Australian. It is not just a matter of the TBT paints being used on large vessels sailing the oceans; they are being used regularly on small vessels in Australian waters, creeks, rivers and bays. We need to try and ensure that that form of pollution and poisoning of the marine and water environments is eliminated as soon as possible.</para><para>The Democrats believe the implementation of this convention is a significant advance, but there is still action that needs to be taken at government level. We urge that that action be taken as quickly as possible.

I do not have that report with me, but I am aware of the content of that report and, unfortunately, it does not reflect accurately what is occurring with the implementation of the regional forest agreement. Unfortunately—and I raised this as an issue at the outset—I believe that one of the people involved with conducting this review had formerly worked for the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania and was not in a position to make a value judgment about the progress of implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. I think that probably allowed bias to be incorporated in the judgments and recommendations of the report. </para><para>The sad situation is that the forests in Tasmania are still not being managed in a way that will deliver the best outcomes for the Tasmanian people, neither in an employment sense nor in an economic sense. I think that is unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that the Resource Planning and Development Commission did not recognise that. In large part we have a situation where land clearing within public native forests is occurring on a very significant scale that, in essence, is in breach of commitments given by the Tasmanian government that where native forests were being harvested—that is, clear-felling of native forests—those forests would be replaced with the same species as were harvested from them. That requires not just having a eucalypt plantation, a blue gum plantation or a nitans plantation put in place of, quite often, temperate rainforest species. It is unacceptable that that is allowed to continue. As we know—and this has been a source of debate for some time—there are less than adequate forest practices being applied. The forests practices code is being breached, on some occasions by the manager of the public forests in Tasmania. That really is not good enough. </para><para>The consultation process that occurred with the Resource Planning and Development Commission was inadequate. Although they did hold public hearings, it would seem that the report did not take a lot of notice of some of the issues that were raised by people who made submissions to the Resource Planning and Development Commission. As a result, we have what I believe is a totally inadequate and in many respects inaccurate report.</para><para>With regard to the implementation of the agreement by the Tasmanian government, no government in Tasmania has really sought to build up the economic development aspects of forestry in Tasmania. We always hear the argument about jobs but, unfortunately, we continue to lose jobs in the industry. Until there is a significant change, that will continue to be the case. I just hope that at some time some government will stand up and do something for the further development of the industry in Tasmania and maximise the benefits and outcomes that can be realised from a well-managed forest resource in my state.

I could speak at great length about the great contribution that Queensland women political representatives have made to the political life and fabric of Brisbane, Queensland and Australia—and I could list many names and many achievements to illustrate the point—but I will leave this exercise for another time, for tonight I wish to recognise some of the unsung heroines that are part of all political organisations (Labor Party, National Party, Democrats and Liberal Party) and in particular tonight those who are in the Queensland Liberal Party. </para></talk.start><para>As an introduction to my substantive remarks I will mention the names of my very distinguished Queensland women colleagues in this parliament, including Kay Elson, the member for Forde; Teresa Gambaro, the member for Petrie; and Margaret May, the member for McPherson. They are outstanding representatives for their electorates who bring into this parliament a unique and often inspired perspective and they represent their constituents and their party with great distinction.</para><para>At a state level, how could I go beyond Joan Sheldon, former parliamentary leader of the Queensland Liberal Party, former Deputy Premier and former Treasurer—in fact, the first woman leader of a major party in Queensland, the first woman Deputy Premier and the first woman Treasurer. I had the honour and the privilege of serving with Mrs Sheldon as her deputy for three years and subsequently as a minister of the Crown in the Borbidge-Sheldon government. I cannot speak more highly than I am doing tonight of her performance and of the way that as a parliamentary leader she conducted the affairs of the Liberal Party. And, of course, there is Sallyanne Atkinson, the first female Lord Mayor of Brisbane, who almost single-handedly transformed Brisbane into a modern 21st century forward-looking city—a mature city that today has the confidence to take on any other major city in Australia and indeed in the world. It has done so on many occasions. It has hosted many a significant national and international event, and again that is the result of the efforts of former Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson.</para><para>Clearly, the Queensland Liberal Party has facilitated the advancement of women to senior political ranks in a most exemplary and successful manner. Often, these women have started their distinguished political careers within the Women's Council section of the Liberal Party of Australia in Queensland. It is interesting to note at this point that the objectives of the Queensland Women's Council clearly state: to provide equal opportunity for women to make their own decisions, develop their own skills, interests and personalities, always having regard for equal rights of others; to play an active role in researching the specific needs of women in developing policies; to encourage women to realise their full potential; to assist women who wish to seek preselection in any one of the three tiers of government and to provide support and information to them as candidates. These objectives have been pursued by many fine Queensland Liberal women— women who have not only established a loyal and dedicated commitment to the Liberal Party but also gone out and put down roots in the broader community and therefore speak within the Liberal Party, on behalf of the Liberal Party and about the Liberal Party in Queensland with great credibility.</para><para>There are three distinguished women within the Queensland Liberal Party who have presided in more recent times as chairmen of the Women's State Council, namely Mrs Cassie Solomon, Mrs Elaine Bowers and current president, Mrs Rae Watkins. These women have sought, identified and provided encouragement and support for many fine women to run for positions within our state and federal parliaments, the Brisbane City Council and the Liberal Party organisation. In many instances, they have played a mentoring role for Liberal women. Through their roles as chairmen and now as President of the Women's State Council these women have also provided a valuable women's perspective to areas of campaigning and policy. Tonight, I pay tribute to them.</para><para>In particular, I pay a special tribute to Mrs Cassie Solomon, who for so many years played such a central and vital role in the affairs of the Queensland Liberal Party's Women's Council. In the end, Cassie personified the Women's Council and represented it with grace and distinction in many Queensland and national forums where significant issues were discussed and debated. Cassie's health is currently failing her and we wish for her the very best for the future. I say a very hearty and sincere thank you for the great contribution that she has made to the welfare of not just the Women's Council in Queensland but the Queensland Liberal Party and, indeed, the national Liberal Party as a whole. </para><para>It would also be improper of me not to pay tribute to good Liberal women who have contributed enormously to advancing the cause of women, families and the community as a whole. For example, Mrs Ailsa Scurr has served as a delegate to the National Council of Women for many years and has been involved in that great drug organisation Drug Arm. Mrs Audrey Dickie has made a valuable contribution through her involvement in the Australian Family Association, as has Mrs Faye Shadlow in the area of family planning.</para><para>As honourable senators would appreciate, Queensland is a big state and much good work is done by Liberal women in rural and isolated communities. For example, Mrs Rhonda Hermann has worked with and supported women and their families in more difficult and remote areas within the federal electorate of Blair. A few years ago, Mrs Hermann and her Blair Women's Council group ran a successful forum dealing with many issues affecting local communities, particularly isolated communities.</para><para>And, of course, Mr President, we cannot forget the wives in what are still male-inhabited state and federal parliaments. These unsung heroines contribute enormously to the ability of their husbands to do their jobs in places such as this—by looking after our children and our homes, often supplementing the family income, and on many occasions representing their husbands at many an event both within the party and in the broader community.</para><para>I mention these fine women as excellent examples of women committed to advancing the interests of the Liberal Party and worthwhile community causes. Undoubtedly, when one mentions a lot of individuals in a speech like this, one may forget some. If I have forgotten people who feel that they should have been mentioned because of their great contribution, I will make up for it at another time. But there have been and there still are many thousands in the Queensland Liberal Party, and indeed throughout the Australian Liberal Party, who work happily, quickly and efficiently for causes they genuinely believe in—in this particular case, from a Liberal perspective. Women like Heather Eveans, Trish Sargeant, Sue Boyce, Erna Lee, Lesley Goodwin, Shirley Bertoldo, Kylie Denman, Gladys Potter, Jeannie Fairlie, Joan Spelling, Lila Cameron—that stalwart, Lila Cameron—Shirley Lehmann, Greer Tucker, Sharon Thompson, Elaine O'Keefe, Astra Ciobo, Kerry Freeburn, Julie Wallerstein and Ella King are just some of the office-bearers of the Queensland Women's Council who I know and who work tirelessly for the causes of women in the Queensland Liberal Party and within the community.</para><para>It is important at this stage to go back to our roots. With what better quote could I conclude a speech like this than one from the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies? At the closure of the Albury conference on 16 December 1944, when speaking about the role of the women's organisation in the Liberal Party, he said:</para><quote><para>Women are unquestionably destined to exercise more and more influence upon practical politics in Australia. There was a time when they thought to stand aside, exercising only passive influence. That has gone.</para><para>In the educating of the electorate in liberal areas they have for many years been an effective force. Now we have an organisation in which all distinctions have gone, and with men and women working equally for the one body the resultant education value of our movement is going to be extremely increased ...</para></quote><para>That is what our founder, Sir Robert Menzies, said about the role of the women's organisation within the Liberal Party—on that distant day, 16 December 1944. The sentiments that he expressed were very valid at that point in time. They are even more valid today. Again, I pay tribute tonight to the role, the influence and the effectiveness of the women's contribution to the Liberal Party of Australia and, in particular, to the contribution of the Women's Council of the Liberal Party of Queensland. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Will Dyson</title><page.no>8997</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>8997</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Eighteen months ago I informed the Senate that the London burial place of Will Dyson, a great Australian artist, and his wife, Ruby, also a talented artist, was unmarked and missing its headstone. I also expressed some dismay that no plans were in place to restore the headstone of the grave of this great Australian. I believed we had to ensure that this terrible wrong was put right. Fortunately, at around the same time I had the opportunity to speak at the inauguration of the C.E.W. Bean Foundation. In my speech, I alerted the foundation to the situation and urged them to consider assisting in the restoration of the Dysons' gravesite. I told the C.E.W. Bean Foundation of my hope that an appropriate headstone would be reinstated and that Will Dyson, who was a good friend of Charles Bean, would no longer lie in an unmarked grave.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight, I am able to bring good news to the Senate. Work is well advanced on restoring Will Dyson's grave at London's Hendon Cemetery. Since 2001, an enthusiastic group of Londoners and Australian expatriates have been raising funds to assist with the restoration. I believe that this is a very important project. Those who are aware of Dyson's career, especially his role as the Australian Imperial Force's first official war artist, have been surprised to learn that he and his wife are buried in an unmarked grave. </para><para>Will Dyson, who grew up in Ballarat, was a remarkably gifted artist, political satirist and writer. In his early years he became friendly with Norman Lindsay and through this friendship met and later married Ruby Lindsay, Norman's sister. Ruby was also a talented artist and was praised for her black and white illustrations in both Australia and London. Will and Ruby had one child, Betty, who in her adult life was also a talented artist designing sets and costumes for plays and ballets, notably for Sadler's Wells. </para><para>In 1910, Dyson and Ruby moved to London. By 1916, Dyson was famous for his artwork and had published a number of books, including <inline font-style="italic">Kultur Cartoons</inline>, which consisted of 20 large drawings with a foreword by H.G. Wells. It was a bestseller. Dyson's art and writings focused on issues such as inequality and suffering. His work stood for the underdog. Dyson's friend the writer Vance Palmer said:</para><quote><para>The British workman had always been presented pathetically—a depressed figure in bowyangs, with his hand on the head of his starving child. Dyson made him young, militant, triumphant—an image of energy and hope, with an upraised fist.</para></quote><para>But many best remember Will Dyson for his graphic depictions of war on the Western Front. Dyson—the first official Australian war artist, commissioned by the Commonwealth in 1916—lived with the soldiers on the Western Front for two years. He greatly admired them and felt that it was his task to interpret, for national preservation, the special Australian characteristics of the men from the Australian Imperial Force.</para><para>During Dyson's time on the Western Front, he was wounded twice. Despite this, he continued to work at the front, ensuring a comprehensive record was maintained of the soldiers: how they lived and how they fought. Not only did he produce an astonishing collection of artwork, he was also praised for his writing about the war. Dyson's inscriptions in his book <inline font-style="italic">Australia at War </inline>were described in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> as `profound in thought' and `always vivid in description'. It was said that his writing was no less remarkable than his drawings. </para><para>It was during his time on the Western Front that Will Dyson met and became good friends with Charles Bean, who was Australia's official war correspondent. Charles Bean wrote of Will Dyson:</para><quote><para>No official artist, British or Australian, in the Great War saw a tenth part as much of the real Western Front as did Will Dyson.</para></quote><para>The Australian War Memorial received 270 of Dyson's drawings from World War I, and Bean even envisaged a special Dyson gallery at the memorial.</para><para>Tragedy struck Dyson in 1919. Ruby died suddenly, aged only 32, after she became the victim of the influenza epidemic. Dyson, like many of his generation, was changed forever by the war. He was shattered by the death of his wife. During the 1920s and 1930s Dyson continued to draw and write. But, after his experiences, Dyson had become disillusioned. He was never the same again. In 1938 he died suddenly from a heart attack. He was buried in England at London's Hendon Cemetery in the same grave as his wife Ruby. </para><para>In January this year, I was able to visit Will Dyson's unmarked gravesite at Hendon. The gravesite is located next to a well-maintained Commonwealth War Graves Commission grave. Robin Ollington, a design artist and the main organiser of the Will Dyson trust, was able to show me the precise location of Dyson's grave. Although there are no remnants of the original grave and headstone to be seen, it is still possible to be precise about its location through cemetery records and the well-maintained adjacent grave.</para><para>At the cemetery office I was able to examine the documents that explained why maintenance of Will Dyson's and Ruby Lindsay's grave ceased. After the death of Betty Dyson—Will and Ruby's only direct descendant—in 1956, responsibility for maintaining the gravesite passed to Betty's former husband Baron Yves Chanteau. After Baron Chanteau's death, the annual payments of £1 for the maintenance of the grave were not kept up. By the late 1960s the grave had fallen into disrepair. In 1969 the cemetery authorities dismantled the headstone because it had become a danger to public safety.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chelsea Arts Club in London, of which Dyson was a former chairman, for allowing its facilities to be used for a lunch bringing together all those working on the Dyson grave project in England. At the lunch in January, I was able to thank the dedicated people who have contributed to the project: Robin Ollington and many others who have given much time and effort to this important cause. I indicated to all those present that many Australians sincerely valued the work of Robin and his team of Australian expatriates and UK nationals. I also expressed my thanks to Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, whose generous donation has been crucial in ensuring that a marked grave for the Dysons will become a reality. I expressed my appreciation to the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Michael L'Estrange, and the Australian High Commission for their support of this important project.</para><para>The work of designing and making a new headstone is now well advanced. It will be essential that the refurbished grave continue to be maintained so that it is does not deteriorate again. I understand the High Commissioner has discussed the ongoing maintenance of the new grave with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and has received a positive response. I intend to follow this up with the War Graves Commission. I believe this to be a very important project that will ensure that two great and talented Australians will no longer lie in an unmarked grave but will receive the recognition and respect they so greatly deserve. I want to take the opportunity tonight in this adjournment debate in the Australian Senate to sincerely thank the very many people both here in Australia and overseas in England who have involved themselves in what I believe is a very important project.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Exercise of Power</title><page.no>8998</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>8998</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The ultimate exercise of power is to commit a nation to war. When that happens it exposes who has that power, what checks there are on its exercise, and whether the people as a whole have any countervailing power. With Australian troops predeployed for war, the powers of the Prime Minister and his executive have again been confirmed as nearly absolute. The Australian parliament has been exposed as having no power to oppose a war by cutting off the money for war, no power to prevent predeployment, no power to determine what policy applies to the processes that lead to war, and no power to authorise or prohibit a war.</para></talk.start><para>The Governor-General is no help either. The Governor-General is the Prime Minister's to appoint and dismiss. His role has been to support the Prime Minister. With the office of the head of state captured by the executive and the executive controlling the House of Representatives, there is no effective separation of powers, and executive power to make war is guaranteed. Being independent of the executive, the Australian Senate does exhibit characteristics of a separation of powers, but in respect of matters of war it can only take a view, not exercise authority. </para><para>The issue of the structure of executive power was at the core of the debate over the Australian republic. As one of the authors of the no case in the republic referendum, I argued long and hard that what Australia needed was a more accountable system of government that appropriately restrained the power of the executive. The Prime Minister's power to commit an unwilling public to a war in Iraq again highlights the importance of the issue. </para><para>In recent weeks I have been trying to have an op-ed piece on this issue published in newspapers around the country, including the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>. I will be making similar points tonight to those made in my op-ed piece. I am aware that far fewer people are reached by an address in the Senate and by the recording of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> than in a newspaper. I do not read anything into the rejection of my article by the papers I have named, but I do believe it is an accurate reflection of the difficulties faced by direct election republicans with a reformist bent such as me in getting their views on the public agenda. Throughout the republic debate the media showed far more interest in the appointment model than in the more popular direct election model. As we continue to see examples of unchecked executive power, I hope that focus shifts.</para><para>If the republic referendum had been passed in 2000, would there have been more checks and balances on the Iraq question? The answer is no. If anything, that appointment model entrenched executive power even more, making the proposed Australian president—as in that famous quote—`the Prime Minister's poodle'. It is a little ironic that many of those opposing a war in Iraq outright or opposing the predeployment of Australian forces were great supporters of a constitutional model that reinforced the Prime Minister's authority to do just that without the approval of parliament. Other nations have sensibly used the presidential office as a check on prime ministerial power. For those who tried to con the people into believing that the republic was about having an Australian head of state and nothing more, the likely Iraq war is a reminder that the constitutional debate is really about who has power and how it is exercised.</para><para>One weakness of the current system of government is that power is centralised in the executive arm of government. The separation of powers is modest. Section 61 of the Constitution provides the main source of the Commonwealth's executive power. Executive power is exercisable by the prime ministerially appointed Governor-General, as the Queen's representative but on the instructions of the Prime Minister exercised through the Executive Council. The scope of section 61 empowers the executive government to make certain decisions with constitutional legitimacy, without the need for parliamentary or legislative sanction. The power to declare war and make decisions about the disposition and control of the armed forces is one such action. Many of those who argue for a directly elected president with limited and codified powers seek to constrain this power by requiring the president to approve a Prime Minister's commitment to war. Not everyone who argues for a directly elected president with codified powers seeks to give the president some control over a Prime Minister's decision to go to war. Some versions of this model would require a president to accept a Prime Minister's advice on that, as on other matters. I am not one of those.</para><para>A separate safeguard to be considered is whether parliament should have any power to approve of war action. If a president were given the power to confirm, or not, a Prime Minister's commitment to war, the present parliamentary relationships and powers could remain unchanged. Alternatively, the Constitution could be changed to give parliament—or the parliament could pass legislation—the power to confirm or deny the propriety of any proposed war action.  </para><para>A comparison of the United States presidential system versus the Australian prime ministerial system of government is interesting. It is true that the President of the United States is the head of the executive and is also commander-in-chief, but his power and authority to wage war are given to him by his parliament. The War Powers Act became law in the United States in October 1973 over President Nixon's veto. It was an attempt to reassert congressional control over war-making. It provides that in the absence of a declaration of war by Congress the President only retains the power to lawfully initiate hostilities under four limited conditions. Those four conditions are: to repel an attack on the United States, to protect American armed forces overseas, to protect the lives of Americans abroad or to fulfil the statutory military obligations of the United States. Some argue that the broad language of these exceptions prevents the act from being a strong check on the practice of presidential war-making. Nonetheless, it is a useful illustration of an alternative way to structure the war-making power.</para><para>The presidential system in the United States has accumulated enormous symbolic and real power status. As head of state and of government, President Bush does indeed wield tremendous power. Unlike Mr Howard, President Bush is, after all, acting under an authorising congressional resolution empowering him to take the kind of action against Iraq on which he has embarked. And it is not as if just his party or just the House of Representatives back him: he has the support of a majority of both houses, including many who are not of his party. American congressmen and senators have a free vote on these sorts of matters. </para><para>What I would argue for is an elected president with codified powers but with the additional safeguard, adapted from the United States system, of a requirement for parliamentary approval of warlike action. When war threatens, the last thing you want is absolute power without check. It is a compelling reason why a reformed Australian system, improved by a directly elected president with specific limited and codified powers, would be better for Australia than the American model. It would certainly be better than the current Australian system.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>HMAS Yarra Association</title><page.no>9000</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>9000</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— On 4 March 1942, 61 years ago, as dawn broke over the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and Australia, a small convoy of two merchant ships and a minesweeper escorted by the sloop HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline>, with Lieutenant Commander Robert Rankin of Cobar, New South Wales in command, was intercepted by a Japanese force of three heavy cruisers and two destroyers. At 6.30 a.m., the <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> made an enemy sighting report, ordered the convoy to disperse, moved to delay the enemy by laying down a smokescreen and advanced to attack in a bid to buy time for the other ships to escape. The sloop <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> was the second ship in the Royal Australian Navy to bear that name. Built at Sydney's Cockatoo Dockyard, she was a Grimsby class lightly armed escort sloop with three four-inch guns and a top speed of 16.5 knots. Commissioned in 1936, she served in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean before returning to convoy duties between Australia and Singapore after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour.</para></talk.start><para>In her last action on 4 March 1942, the <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> faced three Japanese cruisers, each armed with 10 eight-inch guns and with a top speed of over 30 knots—and that was not counting the two destroyers, each of which would be more than a match for the <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline>. She was outgunned, outnumbered and outsped. Nevertheless, the <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> engaged the enemy for more than an hour. By 8 a.m. the ship was on fire and sinking.

Mr Buckley was one of the 13 rescued by the Dutch submarine <inline font-style="italic">K11</inline> in 1942. He went on to serve 11 more years in the Royal Australian Navy. As one of only three survivors of the 1942 action, Mr Buckley played a major role in the erection of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> National Memorial in November 2000 in Newport on the foreshore of Port Phillip Bay. Mr Buckley is survived by his wife and son, both of whom are members of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> Association. The erection of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> National Memorial was achieved by the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Yarra</inline> Association with the support of the City of Hobson Bay, the Australian Defence Force, the Rotary Club of Williamstown, and many others.

The service was attended by over 100 members and friends of the association, including Mr Rob Taylor, the nephew of Leading Seaman Ronald Taylor. I particularly thank Mr Angus Walsh OAM, the association's honorary memorial coordinator, for extending the invitation to me. I commend the association for maintaining the spirit and the vision of Australia, particularly at this time of difficulty and challenge. Australia again reluctantly faces the possibility of war to rid the world of evil we cannot be rid of otherwise. Yet we will face it squarely, taking on and discharging our responsibility to the civilised community. I commend the association for its effort to preserve that spirit and show us the way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Information Kits</title><page.no>9003</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>9003</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take the opportunity tonight to lay down what has become a most perplexing and sad and sorry saga with respect to what is happening with the returned antiterrorism kits, of which we suspect there are hundreds of thousands. I have just been informed about an Australia Post press release in which they have indicated that they do not feel it appropriate to disclose the number of returned kits to the Australian parliament because they are not in the habit of disclosing this information to third parties, despite having taken this question on notice at a Senate estimates hearing and indicating that they would. Once I get hold of the release, I will be taking this matter further in relation to a potential contempt of the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Many in this chamber—or a few, anyway—may be aware that on 10 February during Senate estimates I asked Australia Post to count the number of antiterrorism kits being returned and to report back to the Senate committee with this information. On 10 February at the hearing Australia Post informed me that it was a condition of the contract that they had entered into with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that the kits be set aside, not destroyed, which would be the normal process for returned mail. That is the first point: there was a contract with the government who had requested that they should be set aside. At that point, Australia Post advised the Senate committee, of which Senator Eggleston is a member, that they would provide details to the committee of the numbers of returned kits by, I think, around 25 February. We then made inquiries about that, which I will come to in a minute.</para><para>Around a week ago the date expired and Australia Post indicated that they would not be able to provide the information by the agreed due date, but in fact would rather take it on notice. Of course, as many senators know, this potentially means months of waiting. I made inquiries with the CPSU in New South Wales and found that many postal workers were completely unaware of the directive from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to Australia Post that the kits be set aside. Therefore, normal procedure was happening and the kits were being destroyed, which is what happens with returned mail. So Australia Post, in its contractual arrangements with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had not in many states, we suspect, passed on this directive to set aside the return to sender mail and, in fact, they were being destroyed by the postal workers. That is stage one. </para><para>From the inquiries that I have made so far, I am satisfied that maybe hundreds of thousands of these kits have been destroyed in post offices, possibly right across Australia, and not kept as per the provisions of the contract with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That means that we will never know the true extent of the protest by all those Australian people who took the trouble to return the government's antiterrorism kit. We will only be able to guess at the extent of protest, be it a protest in relation to the expenditure of $20 million, be it a protest in respect of Iraq—whatever the reason, it does not matter. It is a legitimate political action to take. Yesterday when I made this assertion, Senator Alston labelled it `bizarre' and `complete nonsense.' That was yesterday. How wrong he was. At approximately 10.30 last night, Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, confirmed that in fact kits have been destroyed on his directive. Apparently the Attorney-General had forgotten to mention it to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Maybe he did mention it, I do not know; we will find out eventually in trying to get to the bottom of this. Who knows what the reason was, but we may speculate.</para><para>Today in question time I asked Senator Ellison, who was representing the Attorney-General, to explain why the Attorney-General had issued the instruction for these kits to be destroyed. At least they are coming clean and formally saying that they were being destroyed. One of the reasons for this that he gave today in question time was a lack of storage space in one location—Canberra. On that basis we can hypothesise that obviously a huge number of Canberra residents at least—the government is on the record in relation to this—have returned their kits to the extent that the post office has run out of room and has had to destroy them. Even more incredible was the other reason he gave, which was safety—he alleged—to protect postal workers. There was an allegation that white powder was being placed in some of the kits that had been returned. </para><para>If the government was so concerned about the safety of postal workers, why had Australia Post or the government not told any of the workers of these threats? No postal worker in Australia had been advised of these threats, in terms of the potential occupational health and safety issues, by Australia Post. It is very strange, isn't it? They have not advised them and, clearly, the fact that postal workers are still clearing the postboxes and sorting the mail as normal shows that the reason given by the government is either completely untrue or—and this the best complexion you could put on it—it has been negligent.</para><para>Let us take people through this. The government is saying that there have been threats in respect of the returned antiterrorism kits, to wit, white powder in some of the kits. Therefore, it says they have to be destroyed. Let us just assume that is the case. Australia Post workers have been handling these kits for weeks. That is the first thing. Why had nobody told them at the beginning that these were a potential issue? The second thing is: why does this become a potential occupational health and safety issue when they hit the post office? Is it not an issue for the postie when he or she picks up the mail from the postbox? Or do they not count? Why is it only an occupational health and safety issue or an issue in relation to a potential terrorist threat, or whatever, when it gets to the post office? The whole thing just does not make sense when you think about it logically. If there is a potential threat from the antiterrorism kits, Australia Post, firstly, should have told its workers, or the government should have told its employees. Secondly, they should not have been handled from five weeks ago, not from last night when Daryl Williams made an announcement on the run that the kits were being destroyed. I suspect the convenient excuse was used that there had been some emails in respect of this. I have to say, just as a fairly snide aside, that it would be the first time I have seen this government care two hoots about Australia Post workers, but that is another issue. </para><para>This afternoon the New South Wales CPSU branch secretary, Jim Metcher, wrote to Australia Post to demand to know, if this safety threat was real, why postal workers had not been consulted or advised. We hope that this story has been concocted by the ministers otherwise you potentially have thousands of Australia Post workers who have been under threat for five to six weeks. So, we hope it is a cover-up by the government, otherwise they are totally negligent about the safety of these workers. What the union is saying is exactly that: if these returned kits are a threat, they are a threat from when they get picked up at the postbox. They do not just happen to turn into a threat when they go to the post office. If that is the case, the logical conclusion is: if you are really concerned about Australia Post workers, the posties should not be picking up the mail. That is the logical conclusion.</para><para>Let us assume that it is correct. If it is correct, this is a major, serious issue for Australia Post workers who have been kept in the dark by both Australia Post and the government. Let us assume it is a concocted excuse; let us assume that it is a cover-up. Let us assume that it is the government saying, `We know there are hundreds of thousands of returned antiterrorism kits and we know we are getting a message from hundreds of thousands of Australians. We do not like the message, so we are going to destroy the message.' I think it is more like that. I hope it is more like that. Whatever, this has been a total debacle from go to whoa. From a simple question in estimates—which was: can you please tell us how many antiterrorism kits have been returned?—it has turned into a potential major industrial dispute on a national level.</para><para>Well done, Daryl Williams and Richard Alston, for creating this situation to attempt to cover up the democratic right of people to return these antiterrorism kits, and to cover up the fact that hundreds of thousands have been returned. This is still a democratic country. It has difficulties, but it is still a democratic country. If it is a cover-up, if this is basically an Orwellian conspiracy, this is the kind of thing that would have made Joseph Goebbels blush. In fact, I think Joseph Goebbels probably would have done a better job in relation to this. In any respect, it is either a total foul-up by the government or it is a major issue for those Australia Post workers. The government cannot have it both ways. I will wait with interest to see what happens in New South Wales. I will wait with interest to see what happens on a national level in respect of the antiterrorism kits. I will wait with interest to see if the government, if it is true, stops the mail deliveries in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights: Vietnam</title><page.no>9005</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>9005</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 21 February, just a few weeks ago, I was visited in my Perth electorate office by a delegation representing various elements of the Vietnamese community in my home state of Western Australia.

As it happens, on 26 February this year we marked and acknowledged the 30th anniversary of Australia embracing and engaging in diplomatic relations with Vietnam. So I think it is timely to look at the issues that were raised with me by the delegation. </para></talk.start><para>I was met by about seven or eight local leaders of the Vietnamese community who were keen for me to present to the parliament a petition outlining their concerns in relation to Vietnamese people under house arrest or otherwise being persecuted for peaceful expression in that country. I needed to politely explain to them that the form of the petition which they had presented to me did not give me the opportunity to formally lodge it. It is not structured in the required parliamentary format for lodging as a petition, but I was pleased to give them an undertaking that I would be happy to read it into the record on their behalf. The petition which they presented me with is addressed to Prime Minister John Howard and members of the Australian parliament. It reads as follows:</para><quote><para>For the past 27 years, since the day the Vietnamese communists governed the whole of Vietnam with a stern discriminatory policy of differentiating classes within the Vietnamese society, the communist government of Vietnam has led the country into the darkest period of Vietnam history and caused it to become one of the poorest and most backward countries in the world. </para><para>In considering religion as enemy, the Vietnamese Communist Party has implemented policies that are in nature destructive to religions, with administrative measures that aim at restricting and nullifying all religious activities: the communist government of Vietnam always interferes in the internal affairs of all religions with the specific purpose of politicising them all. For 27 years the communist government of Vietnam has confiscated many properties and establishments of various religious congregations, specifically Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, Cao Dai and Hoa Hao. Many religious leaders have been imprisoned or put under house arrest. People who express their viewpoints different from those of the Vietnamese Communist Party have been subjected to constant surveillance, brutal detention or rude probation.</para><para>On the occasion of the International Day for Human Rights, December 10, we, organisations as well as individuals in the Vietnamese community in Western Australia, have organised at the Pho Quang Buddhist Monastery a prayer ceremony for religious freedom and human rights for Vietnam.

I was struck in particular by one biography and illustration—that relating to Nguyen Vu Binh, a journalist who, born in 1968, is two years my junior. He was a graduate of the school of economics at Hanoi University and for eight years worked as a correspondent on economic affairs for the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Communism</inline>, the official ideological review of the Vietnamese Communist Party, until he became disillusioned with the Communist system. He is one of a number of young democracy activists in Vietnam today.</para><para>On 2 September 2000, Nguyen Vu Binh submitted a petition to the highest leaders of Vietnam to form an opposition political party. Along with that petition, he distributed an essay titled `Vietnam and the road to national restoration', which analysed the impasses facing Vietnam and concluded that a democratic system is the only way out. Authorities never formally responded to the petition, but began to follow and harass him. In September 2001, he publicly endorsed a petition to form a citizens watchdog group against corruption. Like other supporters of this petition, he was detained and repeatedly interrogated by authorities. Authorities disconnected the phone service at his home and banned media organisations from hiring him. And so it goes on. In July 2002, Human Rights Watch honoured him with the prestigious Hellman-Hammett Award, which recognises the courage of writers facing political persecution. After several months of being periodically detained and interrogated, Nguyen Vu Binh was arrested by authorities on 25 September 2002. His current whereabouts continue to be unknown. </para><para>There are opportunities for the Australian government and for the foreign minister to engage in greater human rights dialogue with Vietnam. I think on this, the occasion of our 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations, it is timely to do so. I am pleased to present this report, testimony and petition to the parliament on behalf of the Vietnamese communities that I have named. I look forward to better communications, more fruitful dialogue and better diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and I am sure the government does, too.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murray River</title><page.no>9007</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>9007</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on the issue of the River Murray. I do so as a representative of the people of South Australia, who are those in this country who probably stand to be most adversely affected by the continued degradation of the river and who, in many respects, have the least capacity to remedy the damage that has been done. I, along with a number of parliamentary colleagues, was among the many South Australian state and federal members who participated in a multipartisan forum on Tuesday, 26 February, which was held in the state parliament house in South Australia. At that meeting—which was attended by Senators Bolkus, Kirk, Lees, Chapman and Ferris, and also the member for Kingston and the member for Sturt— there was a declaration made on cross-party lines as to our joint commitment to work towards a political solution for the River Murray. This was more than a talkfest, in my view. What was important about it was that we have South Australian members of parliament, both federal and state, who are prepared to work across our political divisions to come to an agreed set of principles surrounding what we intend to do to push this national issue in all the forums that we can. At the end of the day, this issue is a national problem; it is not an issue that can simply be handballed to any one state. It is an issue on which national leadership is required.</para></talk.start><para>I probably do not need to remind the Senate that the state of the River Murray is appalling. Many scientists have been telling us this for a number of years. We have seen the Murray mouth close up for only the second time since recorded history. We know that water quality is poor. We know that we have lost a great number of native plants, animals, fish and wetlands and that there has been an increase in pests, such as carp. The reality is that the Murray is in decline, and not addressing this decline will mean our living standards—our wealth and our health—will decline as well. This is an issue not only for environmentalists but for those who wish to ensure that agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin region is sustainable and continues to be productive. If the river continues to degrade, as it is now, we will have a problem not only in terms of our environment but also in terms of the profitability of those industries which rely on the waters of the River Murray.</para><para>We know, for example, that projected water quality issues in the state of South Australia indicate that, unless things improve in relation to the River Murray, water salinity levels in Adelaide will exceed World Health Organisation standards around 40 per cent of the time within 20 years. Without doubt, the most critical issue to reform of the Murray is environmental flows. People can talk long and hard about efficiencies measures and engineering solutions in the hope that technology will create the answer. These issue are important, but they will only serve to maximise the benefits of investment in environmental flows—they are not themselves the solution. At the end of day, we need more water back in our river.  </para><para>Scientific advice tells us that, at the very least, we need an additional average flow of 750 gigalitres just to provide a low to moderate likelihood of restoring the health of this river system. To give ourselves a moderate or positive chance of restoring the river, we need around 1,500 gigalitres, and I am very pleased that the Labor Party federally has committed to this amount. It is a significant step in the right direction. Of course, as I have outlined, there have been many reports in which scientists have identified the problems for us and have proposed courses of action to help save the Murray. We had a lot of press late last year from the Wentworth Group and we were privileged at the forum last week to have Professor Mike Young, a member of that group, address us on the issues that the Wentworth Group has gone through and give his views about the various different policy parameters that have to be addressed if we are to deal with this issue.</para><para>But at the end of the day this is not a scientific issue. The science is reasonably well established. What is required is political commitment and political leadership. I do commend the work that has already been done on the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. I also commend the past work of South Australian governments, both Liberal and Labor, that have moved to cap water extraction from the Murray as far back as the 1970s. Indeed, I commend the past Liberal government in South Australia for continuing to work not only on conserving water in South Australia but also on improving the efficiency of water use. I commend Minister Hill, the state Minister for the Environment in South Australia, for his continued work in this regard.</para><para>However, at the end of the day this issue cannot be solved in one state alone. There has to be a substantial transfer of rights in relation to the River Murray from consumptive users toward environmental users. There has to be an establishment of water trading arrangements for the allocation of access to the basin's scarce water resources. The Commonwealth role in this is critical. This is one of the most complex sets of problems facing us and one of the most urgent environmental crises facing the nation, if not the most urgent. The Commonwealth government must take a leadership role in this regard. It must bring all stakeholders to the table and ensure an adequate solution including funding mechanisms. </para><para>I am most disappointed in the position which has been articulated by the Deputy Prime Minister regarding the issue of property rights and compensation. No-one who is genuine about reforming the water allocation rights would argue against the importance of compensating those people whose livelihoods would be affected. In fact I would also argue in favour of a system of property rights which are tradeable and clearly definable and which are properly priced as part of a market mechanism to assist with more sustainable water management. However, any such system of property rights has to be done in the context of proper environmental flows. You have to actually establish how much water you can sell and trade in and remain sustainable, rather than over-allocating and creating rights in respect of over-allocation and, frankly, duping people into believing that they actually have a long-term sustainable water allocation when they do not.</para><para>In my view the Commonwealth has to take far more leadership than it is currently taking. It is not sufficient for the Deputy Prime Minister to simply say that he thinks there should be property rights and adjustment assistance but that any costs of reduced water access to individuals is a state responsibility. That is not national leadership. The states do have to play their part but ultimately the Commonwealth has to ensure that we put more water back into the Murray. If there is a price associated with that—as there will be—they cannot simply handball this issue to the states. This is a national issue and it requires national leadership, and unfortunately that has not been provided to date. I look forward to future policy announcements by the government in this regard. More importantly, I look forward to continued cross-party work by the politicians, members of parliament from South Australia, on probably the most important issue to face our state in 20 years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Industrial Action</title><page.no>9009</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>9009</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to inform the Senate about a dispute that is currently taking place in Queensland in the construction industry. The reason I do so is that this particular dispute has the fingerprints of the dead hand of this government all over it. In the normal course of events, when parties seek to strike an enterprise agreement, the parties would meet, they would sit and they would exchange ideas. They would both put on the table the sorts of things each party would like to see included in an enterprise agreement. Those negotiations may go on for some considerable time. The majority of agreements are struck through that process. </para></talk.start><para>The few enterprise agreements that are not struck then go to the next stage and the parties may seek some assistance from an independent body such as the Industrial Relations Commission to help to resolve those outstanding issues through conciliation. The vast majority of outstanding agreements that are not reached are then reached through that process of conciliation. In very few instances the parties are left with no alternative but to pursue their rights, which they have under the Workplace Relations Act, to take industrial action to try to resolve the dispute.</para><para>Employers often then move by managerial prerogative to lock out workers or to place restrictions on their access to overtime or they use other issues to pressure the employees into agreeing with their demands. Employees are faced with the possibility of industrial action, which is a significant decision for them because normally it involves significant hardship. At the end of the day both parties always have to weigh up what is necessary in terms of resolving the dispute.</para><para>The current dispute in Queensland has followed a path where the parties seem to be in a significant dispute, to the amazement of one of the parties, where the differences between the parties are matters which have been widely agreed to by many employers in Queensland and which are in fact common and normal practices in most other states. There is nothing cutting edge or new about the sorts of claims in dispute. I now draw to the attention of the Senate an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> on 1 March 2003. Under the banner, `Strikebreakers Tipped for Stadium', the article states:</para><quote><para>Contract labourers could be used on the troubled Suncorp Stadium project in a bid to end a deadlock caused by a building union strike. The federal government's building industry task force has offered “safe passage” to contract labourers in a provocative move.</para></quote><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Yesterday the task force confirmed it was providing legal advice to employers caught up in industrial action.</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para>Russell Thompson, Chief Executive for Suncorp's electrical contractor, John Goss Projects, yesterday confirmed that the company had been taking advice from the task force. Mr Thompson said he had been assured, `If we wanted to play hard ball, we could. The task force would ensure that could happen.' He said that included using workers if necessary.</para></quote><para>This is interference by the building industry task force in an industrial dispute. Instead of allowing an industrial dispute to be resolved through the normal legal means provided for by the act, we have seen a provocative move by this government through its building industry task force to provoke a dispute where there ought not be one. In fact, the parties have been discouraged from reaching agreement. In the waterfront dispute, we saw this government encouraging the use of mercenaries and ex-service people to be trained overseas to come in and break strikes. What the building industry task force has been doing is worse. They have been going to group training companies that train apprentices and to other contract labour companies, encouraging them—in fact pressuring and intimidating them—to supply labour to break a strike. I find it absolutely unconscionable that an arm of this government would try to encourage young people who are doing apprenticeships to be involved in pursuing its own political ideological agenda of breaking unions. It is an outrageous situation.</para><para>We know that the building industry task force came out of the interim report of the royal commission into the building and construction industry—a royal commission that has spent $60 million of taxpayers' money trying to achieve the political aims of this government's industrial relations agenda. Taxpayers are now also funding the building industry task force. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has stated that the goal of the task force is to be a policeman to ensure that all parties in the industry obey the laws of the land. Clearly, we are not seeing the building industry task force ensuring that the laws of the land are being obeyed; we are seeing the task force intervening in disputes on behalf of employers and being a taxpayer funded union buster and a taxpayer funded legal adviser—not legal advice in the sense that a company might get independent legal advice in the best interests of the company but legal advice with the pure aim of busting unions. We have seen that the building industry task force has become a taxpayer funded industrial consultant—again, not a consultant that tries to reach agreement and conciliation between parties but one that tries to provoke disputes to pursue this government's industrial relations agenda. </para><para>I am not surprised that their first target for this sort of interference is, in fact, the building and construction industry. The government want to establish a case to justify the very predictable outcomes that will come from the royal commission report when it is released. The government want to set the scene and say: `Look at what is happening in Queensland. This is a justification for the $60 million of taxpayers' money in the royal commission and this is why we need to support the outcomes.' But it is pretence because they are driving the outcomes; they are the ones that are actually causing the industrial chaos and providing the instability. This is certainly an unacceptable and outrageous thing for the government to be doing.</para><para>The political agenda of this government is very clear and it is an un-Australian agenda. It is an agenda to smash unions. It is an agenda to drive down wages and conditions. It is an agenda to reduce safety standards. It is an agenda to increase the working hours of workers in this country. It is no wonder that the Senate regularly refuses to pass this government's industrial agenda because it is not in the interests of the working people of this country. In conclusion, Australians do not want this sort agenda. They do not want confrontation where there ought not be any. They do not want the government interfering in industrial relations when, in the normal course of events, the current act allows for the vast majority of enterprise agreements to be negotiated without any industrial action. In the very few cases where there is industrial action, it is done lawfully and within the confines of the Workplace Relations Act. We do not need a government that provokes a situation where instability is created and the workplace is disrupted.</para><para>In Victoria during the last week of the recent state government election, we saw the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, Mr Doyle, saying that industrial relations was the number one issue on the agenda for Victoria. Taking on unions was the No. 1 issue for Victorians. They ran full-page ads in all the daily newspapers. This was their issue. What happened? Victorian workers and the Victorian people smashed the Liberal Party. They are now mere rumps in the parliament. The Labor Party sits on both sides of the house in the Legislative Assembly. That is the message that Victorian workers sent this government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>9010</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title><page.no>9010</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Meeting</title><page.no>9010</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator FERRIS (South Australia) (8.21 p.m.)—by leave—At the request of the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, Senator Johnston, I move:</para><motion><para>That the committee be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on Tuesday, 4 March 2003.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>9010</page.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>China: Australian Labor Party Delegation </title><page.no>9010</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>9010</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Tonight I wish to speak of a delegation of Labor frontbenchers led by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Jenny Macklin, that spent last week in China at the invitation of the Communist Party of China. The delegation included Dr Craig Emerson, Mr Martin Ferguson, Mr Mark Latham, Senator Peter Cook and me. Also included were Mr Geoff Walsh, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party; Professor Peter Drysdale from the Australian National University; and Ms Carolyn Turnour from the office of the opposition deputy leader. This was the first in what will be a program of biennial exchanges between senior Australian Labor politicians and senior Chinese political leaders. The program provides opportunities to establish direct personal contact with senior members of the Chinese government and ruling party, as well as providing a valuable foundation for future relations between a Labor governed Australia and the People's Republic of China, one of our most important regional neighbours. </para></talk.start><para>It is a disappointment to me to find that the Labor Party was not the first Australian political party to embark upon such a program. The fact is that the Liberal Party has that honour. Senator Cook, who I have no doubt will be on his way to the chamber shortly, will be able to go into the full detail of these exchanges. Senator Cook, being the Labor Party's international secretary, will also be able to explain how it is that the Chinese Communist Party were guests at the Liberal Party National Convention last year. He will also no doubt be able to explain how it is that the Liberal Party sent its warmest fraternal greetings to the Communist Party's most recent conference in Beijing. However, meaningful and productive relations must go beyond these mere formalities, and our brief visit helped to highlight the enormous, yet unfulfilled, potential of the bilateral relations between Australia and China.</para><para>Visits such as our delegation undertook provide an opportunity to broaden mutual understanding, to engage in a dialogue, to question, to probe and to exchange information about each other's countries, our political and economic systems and our aspirations. We had the opportunity to establish personal contacts which I sincerely hope will be maintained and be of lasting benefit. Our delegation had access to the most senior levels of the Chinese government and the party. We met with Mr Huang Ju, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo—the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—and Minister Dia Bing Guo and Vice Minister Zhang Zhiajin of the international department of the Communist Party, both of whom impressed me, and the whole delegation, with their detailed knowledge of social democracy and of Australian politics. We met with other ministers, senior academics, government advisers and government officials in the fields of foreign affairs, trade, education, science, transport, infrastructure and urban planning. All of the people we met demonstrated a keen interest in the issues that were raised by us and they, in turn, put questions to us which were often penetrating and thoughtful.</para><para>I suppose it is the common practice that stereotypes abound when it comes to discussions about China. Personal contacts and observation provide an opportunity to challenge preconceived ideas. The sheer scale of the social experiment being attempted in China is little understood in this country and its importance for Australians has equally been neglected. Knowledge and understanding of recent developments within the People's Republic is of profound importance for the prosperity of this country. It is arguable that the momentous reform processes under way in the People's Republic are as significant as any of the changes in Chinese society that have been undertaken since the creation of the People's Republic in 1949.</para><para>The reform program is driven by decisions taken by the recent Communist Party conferences and reinforced by the new leadership that has been in the process of taking up office over the last six months. They will culminate in this week's appointment of new ministers and the restructuring of government departments through the formal meetings of the Chinese legislature. Reform measures are driven by a determination to lift the living standards for ordinary Chinese citizens by a greater level than at any time since the destruction of feudalism in the 20th century. The modernisation of Chinese society and its economy involves massive changes in all sectors. Under way is a remodelling of education, health and the legal, transport, agricultural and manufacturing systems within China. This remodelling signals a break from the past but also continuity with it. Those who are managing this program seek to learn from the experiences of the Soviet Union yet not repeat the mistakes of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. </para><para>It would be a mistake, however, to see this as an abandonment of many of the traditional aspirations of the social reformers that established the People's Republic in 1949. This remodelling program is being conducted within the framework of what the Chinese call a socialist market economy. It is a reflection of the priorities set by the Chinese leadership over the last 20 years, highlighted by the changed conditions within China itself. While China has abandoned the command economy, it has not abandoned economic planning, which provides the framework within which the Chinese market mechanisms operate.</para><para>The leaders of the People's Republic of China are determined to engage the world as an equal, not in a matter dictated by other countries. The Chinese leaders we met have a very strong sense of history. There is a determination that I experienced amongst the Chinese groups that I met for China to be seen as a country that will never again be taken advantage of by great and powerful nations or by great and powerful corporations. They believe this occurs when the Chinese are weak, backward and poor. The main purpose of the reform is to ensure that China will be none of those things ever again. Those who wish to invest in China or participate in the Chinese economy should understand clearly that China is not there to be plundered. Investment is welcome, but only investment made on a long-term basis and for mutual benefit, not for the purpose of making a quick one-sided gain.</para><para>The Chinese are equally determined to learn from the world. Numerous delegations, researchers and missions have been despatched across the globe to gather information about the way problems are dealt with in other countries. Through this means, the Chinese are seeking to pick the eyes from international experience. For instance, foreign investment is actively sought by the Chinese government but not just in any field nor under any circumstances. Take the case of transfer pricing, which is an important issue when dealing with multinational corporations: the Chinese have sent delegations to Australia, Canada and Europe and, as a result of these trips, the Chinese have adopted what they see as the best of all worlds and they have adjusted their taxation systems accordingly.</para><para>In any analysis of the future prospects of the People's Republic, two broad groups seem to have formed. There are the pessimistic and the optimistic schools of thought. I am a member of the optimistic school. China's economic prosperity is, and in the future will be, heavily dependent upon China's political and social stability. This stability in turn is heavily dependent upon the Chinese economy continuing to grow strongly. If growth rates fall below the levels required to keep unemployment below acceptable rates and to meet the growing aspirations of the Chinese people, the political and social effects could be profound. The legitimacy of the reform process now depends heavily upon delivering an improved standard of living to the people of China. The expert economic advice that I have been able to tap is that the annual rate of growth for the Chinese economy is likely to be about seven per cent over the next five years. Last year, the growth rate was around eight per cent. I note that the growth rate last year in the United States was about 1.4 per cent. Even in Australia, growth rates are less than half the Chinese growth rate.</para><para>While in China the domestic sector remains the strongest driver for growth, consumer spending and investment in housing look set to continue for some time. Urbanisation and technological change as well as the growth in international trade are also contributing to economic growth. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The huge investment by the Chinese government in infrastructure underwrites this growth. An examination of the development of the Pudong New Area within the Shanghai district highlights the resources that the Chinese government is prepared to place behind these projects. The determination to build the largest sea port in the world at Shanghai highlights the scale of the projects that are currently being undertaken in eastern China. </para><para>Governing 1.4 billion people is inherently a complex task. Nonetheless, the Chinese leadership face a number of serious and quite specific challenges. These include, firstly, a fragile financial system, which will need to maintain its commitment to simultaneously supporting the struggling state owned enterprises while financially restructuring those enterprises. This will be important, particularly for social policy reasons, for some time to come. While the reform process will continue at great speed, the Chinese government will need to balance the conflicting pressures of maintaining economic efficiency while protecting social equity. Secondly, there are serious disparities in income levels between the eastern and western regions of the country which the government will have to address. It is already attempting to do so by way of a very large program to encourage new economic development in the western provinces. In my judgment, it will take time for these incentive programs to work.</para><para>Thirdly, there are high levels of underemployment in both the city and rural areas which may involve the movement of up to 200 million workers and their families over the next 20 years. These mobile workers will place pressure on social infrastructure, especially the education and health systems. It is likely that policy changes will have to be made to adjust to these pressures. Fourthly, there are inevitable structural changes to enterprises and to agriculture as a result of accession to the World Trade Organisation. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that the policy will be reversed. Fifthly, there is the problem of containing corruption, which the government regards as a serious problem. The Chinese will have to rely upon the establishment of the rule of law as well as judicial reform as a means of containing arbitrary misuses of power. This problem represents, to my mind, one of the most serious issues that the Chinese government is facing. Corruption has the potential to corrode the integrity of decision-making processes and the authority and legitimacy of the Chinese state.</para><para>As far as I am concerned—and, as I say, I am an optimist—these are all risks that are manageable and, while the economy is principally driven by domestic growth, China is essentially insulated from international world economic trends. The very high savings ratio of some 40 per cent of GDP and the strong current account surplus are tremendous assets for the reform program. The domestic and the international political situation therefore will remain major areas of attention for the Chinese government.</para><para>Turning to my specific areas of portfolio interest, in our discussions I was interested to pursue Australia's involvement and partnership with Chinese counterparts in education, science and research. In these areas, China is of enormous significance for Australia. It would be wrong to think of China as just a market for Australian resources, for our goods or our services. In my judgment, this is a mistake that has characterised our relationships with other countries in the region. We can offer a great deal more for long-term relations than just being a reliable supplier of agricultural or mineral products and technology. Our advanced education and science systems are of interest to the People's Republic of China. This is because we have a solid track record of solving problems for our society which, in many instances, are the same problems faced by the Chinese.</para><para>Cooperation between our nations has improved dramatically in recent years. We now have some 50,000 Chinese students studying in Australia, an increase of about 15,000 every year. However, while we cooperate in terms of university levels and support for university administration and research management, more needs to be done. The Chinese Education Vice Minister, Zhang Zhiajin, explained that the growth has to be looked at on a sustainable basis, not in terms of immediate gains. He said more has to be done to improve the quality of the programs offered and greater attention has to be paid to government-to-government relations. The vice minister suggested that a joint working party needs to be established to improve our quality assurance regime, similar to that established between the Chinese and New Zealand governments. It is quite clear that the Chinese government considers the exchange of cultural contacts to be just as important as the economic ones. Information and ideas can be as valuable to both nations as goods and services. </para><para>Like Australia, China is a large country in area and subject to the forces of nature at its extremes. We both suffer droughts, floods, earthquakes, cyclones, soil erosion and salinity. Both countries face environmental degradation as a result of industrial and agricultural development. Like Australia, China is attempting to join the new economy. We share common interests in biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology and communications, and in many areas China shares Australia's scientific and technological ambitions.</para><para>While the list of formal agreements between our nations is quite a lengthy one, the level of direct cooperation between our scientific agencies and our researchers remains underdeveloped and underfunded. For instance, in polar research, China intends to spend $US100 million in the period 2001-05—that is, within the current Chinese five-year plan. Our scientists in the Antarctic currently cooperate on a number of projects; however, much more could be done in areas such as astrophysical research and oceanography. This could have important consequences for climate research in both countries. Australia and China ought to be cooperating more fully to ensure the Madrid protocols are extended and the Antarctic remains an area of pristine environment preserved for scientific research. While we currently cooperate on areas such as salinity, only small amounts of money are involved in the programs with the CSIRO, as is the case of earthquake research.</para><para>The first major agreement between the CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Science was signed in April 1985—so it is not that long ago. That agreement paved the way for delegations of scientists from Australia and China to visit each other's countries. The pace of collaboration expanded following the signing of memoranda of understanding between the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the Chinese State Science and Technology Commission. A number of joint projects were established during the administration of Senator Peter Cook—who I note has now joined us in the chamber—when he was the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, in 1994-95. These areas included earth sciences, the environment, technology and the management of basic research.</para><para>Under the Hawke and Keating governments, APEC was seen to be an important forum for cooperation within the region. Part of that process was the establishment of meetings of ministers for science and technology. While an important meeting was held in 1995 of 17 APEC ministers of science and technology in Beijing, which established the four major areas of collaboration, very little has been done to follow up that program under the life of the current Howard government. The most recent ministerial meeting was held as long ago as October 1998.</para><para>The developments in China have a profound importance for Australia's prosperity and security. Australia has to come to terms with the fact that our prosperity will increasingly be associated with that of the Chinese. We as a nation will need to balance our policy pursuits with those of others that live in our region. Our future is as much tied to North Asia as it is to South-East Asia, and that needs to be balanced with our historical ties to North America and Europe. We will need to clearly identify our own interests and understand the interests of others and reorient our policies so that we maximise our advantages as an independent, advanced industrial nation capable of acting as an honest broker within our region.</para><para>Asia is our neighbourhood. We have tremendous opportunities here if we embrace our place in the world rather than running in fear of it. We need to seek security in Asia, not security from Asia. The Howard government is obsessed with playing the role of the deputy sheriff to the United States. We cannot realise our full potential in our new strategic situation unless we understand our role within the region. </para><para>In summary, the Australian government is falling down on the job. China represents a country of enormous significance to the future prosperity of our nation. Australia and China have a great deal in common and there are many areas in which fruitful cooperation could exist to strengthen our relationships and improve the living standards of the people of both countries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>China: Australian Labor Party Delegation</title><page.no>9015</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>9015</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week, like Senator Kim Carr, I took part in a parliamentary Australian Labor Party delegation to the People's Republic of China. I think this is exactly what the Remuneration Tribunal had in mind when it awarded to parliamentarians a study allowance. I was pleased to draw on my study allowance for the purposes of making this visit. We visited Shanghai and Beijing and met with Australian business people who are there carving out a niche for our exports in this burgeoning economy. We held talks with various think tanks, with government departments and with officials from the CPC on topics of national interest to Australia and on issues of mutual interest between Australia and China.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight I want to talk in some detail about this visit. I want to stress the importance of the Australia-China relationship and I want to draw the Senate's attention to some of the conclusions that I have drawn from what the delegation saw and heard. Before I do so, however, I want to pay the Liberal Party of Australia a compliment that is both deserved and timely. Like the Labor Party, the Liberal Party has been active in cultivating a sensible and mature relationship between Australia and China. But the Liberal Party has stolen a march on Labor and it deserves to be acknowledged. </para><para>No-one can gainsay the ALP's commitment to the bilateral relationship between these two countries. Thirty years ago, Gough Whitlam, then opposition leader, was one of the first serious political leaders from the West to visit the People's Republic. It is worth recalling that at the time the coalition government of the day roundly criticised him for doing so. Their words, however, died in their throats a few months later when Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's secretary of state, followed in Gough's footsteps. As an emissary for a conservative US President, Kissinger set up his celebrated ping-pong diplomacy with Chairman Mao Tse Tung. This diplomatic initiative led to the normalisation of relations between China and the United States. But Gough was first; Henry and Richard came later, and when they did the Liberal Party of Australia meekly fell in behind the Americans. </para><para>All through the Hawke-Keating years, Australia's trade and foreign policy emphasised Asia. We set ourselves the goal of making friends in the region and breaking down the old shibboleths and stereotypes. Never at any point did we compromise our values or our identity as Australians in doing so. Those values are intrinsic to who we are. But always we looked for constructive engagement. We took initiatives that helped the region as well as Australia's place in the region. APEC is emblematic of this approach. We sought a partnership, and a partnership with the region was forged. So successful were we that today, according to the government's white paper, East Asia takes 57 per cent of our exports and China is our third most important trading partner. Moreover, this region, led by the rapidly expanding Chinese economy, is the fastest growing of all our key export destinations. It provides the lion's share of our tourists and is overwhelmingly the biggest source of our full fee-paying foreign students.</para><para>We in the Labor Party have a lot to be proud of in building the Australia-China relationship. But, as I have said, the Liberal Party has stolen the march on us and it deserves to be acknowledged. The Liberal Party is the first major political party in Australia to have invited the Communist Party of China to attend its national convention. A delegation from the Communist Party of China was a guest of the Liberal Party at its national convention last April. We in the Labor Party had not, at that point, taken such an initiative. It took the Liberal Party to break the ice, and I congratulate it on a notable first. Certainly, at the time of the April national convention, the $35 billion LNG contract with Woodside was hanging in the balance. However, it is obvious that the Liberal Party's invitation was not prompted by any crass commercial considerations. That is clear because in November, when the contract had been awarded to Woodside, Mr Lynton Crosby, on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia, cabled his organisation's best wishes to the Communist Party of China on the occasion of the 16th national congress of the Communist Party of China. </para><para>The 16th congress was indeed an historic meeting. Not only were the goals of openness and growth backed for the future but also a seamless change at the top of the party's leadership occurred. Those leaders who had been foremost in driving the opening of the Chinese economy to the world— President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng—retired from office, to be replaced by Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao and other distinguished members of the standing committee. I might say that Greg Sword, President of the ALP, also sent a message from the Australian Labor Party expressing the hope that the decisions of the 16th congress would result in a further improvement in the economic life, democratic rights, and social and cultural life of Chinese citizens.</para><para>I hope that the CPC will be able to send a delegation to the next ALP national conference and that Labor will be able to duplicate the approach of the Liberal Party. I am sure both Labor and Liberal understand that inviting the CPC into party-to-party talks does not represent an endorsement of all their policies. However, it does represent the commencement of a mature political dialogue between all our parties. Today in question time, Senator Vanstone boasted that her department is working with China's welfare agencies and is promoting Australian welfare and administration models to the Chinese. I have to say that, unfortunately, Senator Vanstone used the dorothy dixer from her backbench to lambaste Jenny Macklin and criticise the Labor Party for wanting to take her model further. </para><para>Tonight, I will ignore the uncharitable aspects of Senator Vanstone's outburst and concentrate on its positive features. She is right to take the course that she is taking. Australia is a leading services provider, and government services and the intellectual property invested in their provision are marketable goods that can positively help developing countries and economies in transition, like China's. The point Jenny Macklin made in a recent Beijing speech is a point that I am sure Senator Vanstone also endorses. Services exports, particularly tourism, education exports and the provision of social welfare services as an export, have a virtuous dimension that makes them even more meaningful than the win-win economic outcomes they deliver. The virtuous dimension is the people-to-people relations that they develop and foster, the cultural misunderstandings that are cleared up and the human and business networks that evolve.</para><para>It would seem that there is bipartisanship now between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party when it comes to party-to-party links with China. That is a step forward for both of us. It is something to celebrate. It shows that a mature relationship is emerging which enables us to actively explore how we can strengthen understanding, how we can manage our disagreements between the two nations and how some of those disagreements can be developed into positives. It has to be said that there are real disagreements. </para><para>As a Minister for Trade, I made human rights representations to my Chinese counterpart and argued a range of issues—including nuclear weapons testing—on which Australia held different views from China. That is what constructive engagement means. That is the approach I followed. Now it seems to have been raised to the level of a bipartisan concept. This enables Australia to relate to China in a way that advances the relationship and allows the points of difference, including how deep they are and how passionately we or the Chinese feel about them, to be honestly and positively pursued. With this in mind I have to say it was nonetheless disappointing when I read in the government's white paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Advancing the national interest</inline>, which was tabled three weeks ago, that the Howard government interprets part of its role in relation to China to be that of managing the complex relationship the US has with China. As Jenny Macklin said, this sounds like we are not content to be deputy sheriff on defence and security issues with Asia but on economics and other issues with China we want to be the United States assistant manager.  </para><para>The United States' relationship with Australia is, of course, a vital one. That does not mean that we surrender our own independence and subjugate our independent aspirations in the region by helping to manage the US goals. The idea that we may see things this way potentially offends both the United States' and Chinese sensibilities. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline>Certainly, a better way to see Australia's role is as being independent within the US alliance but nonetheless committed to it and to our regional relationships and able to be a bridge between both nations. Yet we should nonetheless be able to put our own independent views within the context of that relationship. </para><para>As part of the Australian delegation, I was last week able to engage in a formal dialogue between the ALP and the CPC in Beijing. For their part, the Chinese impressed us with their desire to have a peaceful, stable and economically healthy Asia-Pacific region. It is absolutely fundamental to the outlook of their economy that this is realised. China is growing at between seven per cent and eight per cent a year and is in transition from a centrally planned, welfare focused structure to a more open market economy. Domestic aggregate demand in the Chinese economy is strengthening but it still has not reached the level of creating self-sustaining economic growth. China needs global markets and export-led growth to fulfil its objectives, including its goal of lifting per capita income for the overwhelming majority of its population to above $US4,000 per annum. I have no doubt that they are sincere in their wish for stability. That is, after all, a precondition for economic growth.</para><para>The CPC also argued that the 16th congress had committed China to ongoing democratic reform. The nature of that reform is to continue to recognise other political organisations in the country, introduce a legal structure which enables rights to be pursued through the court and introduce democratic elections at village level. If these reforms are realised, they will represent a genuine shake-up of the system. The fact that they are proposed offered the opportunity to make the point about the stability democracy brings and the importance of establishing rights at law.</para><para>My own view is that, in a country like China with an economy growing so rapidly, pressures for democratic reform are often masked by the daily evidence of improving material fortunes in the lives of ordinary people. If China follows the normal growth path from developing country to economy-in-transition to developed country, then the massive lunge for growth that its economy is now going through will eventually plateau as it comes to first-world maturity. At that time, the push for democratic reform will be strongest. To make that observation is to comment on the phenomena of change rather than to comment on the desirability of democratic freedoms. For us, those democratic freedoms are immutable, but the importance of a dialogue between the ALP and the CPC, and indeed the dialogue between the Liberal Party and the CPC, is that we are in a position to try to influence the speed and depth of these sorts of changes in China.</para><para>Our discussions also covered Iraq and North Korea. In the present global gloom over looming military conflict and debate about weapons of mass destruction, it was essential for us to be clear about each other's point of view on these deeply important concerns. From the discussions, it is my understanding that China is committed to the UN process on Iraq. So is the Labor Party. China is no fan of Saddam Hussein. China does not support his tyrannical regime—nor, of course, do we—and China is opposed to the spread of weapons of mass destruction, as are all Australians. While China has the power of veto on the Security Council, the only conclusion I can draw from our talks is that no hard decision has been made as to how it might cast its vote under any number of hypothetical scenarios about the directions of the weapons inspections. China, I believe, will judge each circumstance on its merits and then decide what to do.</para><para>The Chinese position on North Korea is well known, and they did not depart from it in the discussions we held. I am not so sure that North Korea does not have or is not well on the way to acquiring a nuclear weapons capability and a delivery system, no matter how rudimentary it is, to deliver its warheads. There are many bizarre characteristics to the regime in Pyongyang. Not least is their withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency. I have to say, though, that in the case of China I believe it is true that their influence over Kim Jong Il is far less than we in the West may have originally believed. Nonetheless, I believe all of us have an obligation to try to do what we can in our region to bring about greater stability, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and to settle down the emerging conflicts that are now arising. </para><para>That said, I do not think the missile defence system that Australia has committed itself to in the defence white paper is a sensible direction for us to take. Disarmament is surely the most enduring protection against nuclear war. Opting for escalation is not a prudent choice when very little is being done to create the context to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.</para><para>My colleague the shadow minister for trade, Dr Craig Emerson, has made an eloquent argument for Australia to reinforce a fundamental commitment to multilateral trade negotiation. His concern that multiplying bilateral trade deals is sucking the energy out of the Doha round is a worry I share. Last year China and ASEAN announced they would pursue a free trade agreement. This month, Australia and the US face off across a negotiating table to try to settle an Australia-US free trade agreement. In trade, the greatest gains are made at a global level. If the world is turned into a patchwork quilt of preferential trade agreements then not only will industry be saddled with higher transactional costs and buried in administrative red tape as it endeavours to export to the world but trade patterns will be distorted and the true worth of Australia's economic efficiency will be undervalued.</para><para>China's accession to the WTO is sprinkled through every economic conversation you have in China. That accession creates a framework against which the further opening of the economy can be measured. Chinese interlocutors pressed us that their priority was multilateral trade negotiation. We welcome this. We also made the point that, since the Doha round is a development round, China should help the global effort led by the Cairns group to open markets in agriculture and, as well, in textiles in North America, Europe and Japan.</para><para>Open agricultural and textile markets will help Australia and developing countries in further economic growth. In particular, the least developed countries in the world, the LDCs, will then be able to sell their goods into sophisticated markets, and that is a far better option for them. They will be able to grow their own economies through trade rather than rely on foreign aid to help sustain their own growth. I believe those arguments were well understood by the Chinese.</para><para>For Australia, growth in developing countries, particularly in developing economies like China, is a plus. This is a concept that needs to be thought about and understood. Growth in those economies not only lifts millions of people out of poverty and gives them dignity in their lives, which is of course significant and important in its own right, but also enlarges world GNP and creates a new and bigger market for Australian goods and services. That creates better and more challenging and rewarding jobs in Australia while giving people of the world access to affluent living conditions and freedom from hunger, want and disease. Recently Paul Keating said that Australia must learn to walk with three legs and we must find alliances with East Asia, which includes China, the USA and South-East Asia, including Indonesia. I would cast my net even wider: Australia has to learn to walk in the global sphere and open trade and economic development links with all countries in the world. Only by doing that can our economy grow faster. But the emphasis in seeking those arrangements is on opening markets for developing countries so that those economies can grow too.</para><para>The key lesson I believe I learnt last week is that to the north of Australia is the world's most populous country. It is growing between seven and eight per cent and it creates huge market opportunities for Australia. Both major political parties in Australia are well attuned to those opportunities and wish to build a constructive working relationship. By doing so, we will not only be focused on the needs of this region but also be good neighbors with the countries that surround us and contribute to their wellbeing—as they will to ours. That is a positive direction for Australia and the region. It is one that we in the Labor Party are deeply committed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Paid Maternity Leave</title><page.no>9019</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>9019</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Other than in the United States, in a number of countries across the world women have had access to paid maternity leave for decades. In Australia, on the other hand, we are attempting to convince the government that women finally deserve this fundamental right. On 11 December 2002 the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, released her final paper on paid maternity leave. This 277-page document advocated a government-funded national paid maternity leave scheme. The document was entitled <inline font-style="italic">A time to value</inline> and it looked extensively at the history and purpose of paid maternity leave, the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies, economic security, workplace disadvantage, equality, the social benefits of paid maternity leave, the benefits to employers and to the economy, funding, coverage, eligibility, duration, social and cultural change, women's labour force participation rates and education. </para></talk.start><para>This report has made a valid attempt to look at all possible options, interactions and arguments surrounding paid maternity leave and the broad discrimination that women face in Australia on this issue. Yet, not surprisingly, so far the government has not responded to this report. Of course the government made every attempt to downplay the importance of this report by making vague statements in the immediate days prior to its release suggesting that Australian women do not see paid maternity leave as a big issue. It is difficult to see how the government could possibly be led to honestly believe this, given that over 250 submissions were made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by individuals, academics, community groups, employers and even the government's own departments. Even more surprising is the attitude of the government, given that the majority of these submissions supported some form of national paid maternity leave scheme. That is not to mention the wider public discussion, which has escalated exponentially in the last few years, particularly in the previous 12 months. For example, almost every person in Australia now knows that we are one of only two developed countries that do not support women with a national paid maternity leave scheme. This knowledge is a result of the very public and constructive debate that has occurred in this country.</para><para>Recently the government has attempted to sidetrack the media and validate its hopeless attempt to understand and give genuine consideration to the situation that women face today. Rather than take on board recommendations made by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner or take on board what she has had to say or look at the reality for many women and families in Australia, this government has decided that it is easier to pretend that there really is no issue about this matter and that women in Australia do not really want or in fact need paid maternity leave. The reality, though, is that this government is not comfortable delivering policy which benefits women in the workplace. Sure, there are women who decide to be full-time mothers and they too need adequate support but the point is that the majority of women in Australia are currently being denied a basic right, a right which most women around the world enjoy.</para><para>Unfortunately, women in the work force are not the concern of the Prime Minister because—and let us admit it—the Prime Minister would rather see the women of this country stay at home. This may explain why he has taken on board research conducted by Catherine Hakim and relied so heavily on various interpretations of her findings. Dr Hakim's theory of preference is applied to women and the choices that women make regarding work and family. Dr Hakim ultimately argues that women can be categorised into three groups: women who are career centred, women who are home or family centred and those who are trying to achieve a balance between the two. She has come to the conclusion, according to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 28 July 2002, that a `homecare allowance for full-time mothers would be attractive to a wider group of women than maternity leave rights'. Given this statement, the government has obviously run with this idea, making the frightening assumption that the wider community, women and the media will blindly accept it. </para><para>Unfortunately for the government, people are not as uncritical, gullible or unsuspecting as to believe every word that is blurted out in defence of the inaction of this government. Unfortunately for Dr Hakim, her statements have largely been simplified and hijacked by this government which has misrepresented her on a number of issues. Even though she has identified full-time mothers as an important consideration in her opinion, the UK sociologist also clearly recommends that policy makers should not choose between maternity leave rights and a home care style allowance. However, this government has conveniently chosen to ignore this and to pursue a limited interpretation for its own political and budgetary gain. This is not a well thought out long-term policy directive; it is simply the easy way out, a move this government is well known for. Rather than attempting to tell women what they want and implementing policy that unfairly favours some women over others without regard for basic rights, this government must provide adequate support and protection for all women. </para><para>As Dr Hakim argues in her latest book:</para><quote><para>... social policy and family policy need to be diversified to recognise, and support, all three lifestyle choices, instead of assuming that one policy will fit all.</para></quote><para>She also suggests that by far the largest group consists of adaptive women, who want to combine employment and family work. Perhaps the Prime Minister should look more closely at Dr Hakim's arguments, and not to mention other research on this issue. I am talking about other research done by Australian women and feminists. Anne Summers pointed out in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 12 August 2002 that the Prime Minister has been very selective in choosing to listen to a British feminist and her arguments rather than Australian feminists who have been arguing along similar lines, as well as along significantly different lines, for years. Summers has reflected on the reliance of this government on a single body of research. She says to the Prime Minister that if he is serious about this, then he will need to recognise that at present parents' choices are distorted by the ideological biases built into his government's family policy. She says that Howard's policy is `loaded against women who want to combine work and family'.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party, unlike this government, is committed to delivering to mothers and families in a range of situations. Of course, paid maternity leave will not on its own provide women with equal opportunity and support. However, a holistic approach, such as that which Labor is proposing, will benefit women in a number of ways. Paid maternity leave is an integral part of providing real options and real solutions for women in Australia. The International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women—I might add that this government has yet to ratify the optional protocol under that convention—as well as the European Union's directives recognise the basic and fundamental right to paid maternity leave. This is a right that most women in Australia have been denied for too long.</para><para>It is interesting to note that in most cases the Public Service is used to promote best practice in employment. The Public Service in Australia has had paid maternity leave since 1972, when it was introduced by the Whitlam government. However, now this government is telling us that paid maternity leave is not such a good idea or is not necessary. The government should remember that women still earn only around 80 per cent of men's average weekly wage; women are still left with inadequate superannuation funds due to the discontinuity of time spent in the work force, and women still struggle to be financially independent due, among other things, to increasing child care costs.</para><para>The fact is that this government does not take women seriously. Even Liberal Party women in this parliament have come forward and said publicly that it is time that the Prime Minister took them seriously and introduced paid maternity leave. In fact, in this very Senate earlier this year, Senator Troeth applauded the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's report on paid maternity leave, entitled <inline font-style="italic">A time to value</inline>. She agreed with the commissioner that it is time to introduce a comprehensive, national, government funded scheme. It is obvious that the Prime Minister is not even interested in listening to the women in his own party. </para><para>It is also interesting to note that the Prime Minister, in the<inline font-style="italic"> Weekend Australian</inline> just recently, admitted that he now understands that what a large number of women want is optimum opportunities for part-time work. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Despite this outstanding and welcome realisation, I understand that the Prime Minister has absolutely no intention of retracting the failed baby bonus scheme which punishes women for returning to work after the birth of a child and delivers more money to high-income earners rather than to low-income earners. The fact that this so-called benefit is cut off as soon as a woman returns to work—even part-time work—proves that this is certainly not what women need. The baby bonus does not deliver viable options to all women in Australia. It certainly does not provide optimum opportunities for women who are attempting to combine work and family, which Dr Hakim has identified as being as high as 60 per cent of women. The baby bonus is ill conceived, discriminatory and biased and should be abandoned. The $500 million that has been budgeted for this scheme could be, and should be, better spent on a national paid maternity leave scheme or on adequate child care in Australia.</para><para>In recognition of the upcoming International Women's Day on Saturday, I would like to stress the importance of women's rights, including the internationally recognised right to paid maternity leave. This is not an issue that is going to disappear. The government should stop trying to distract the public from the arguments and should take the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's report seriously. The Labor Party, on the other hand, has listened to Australian women, organisations, businesses, unions and departments. Labor has made a commitment to the introduction of a national paid maternity leave scheme that will allow women to combine work and family in whichever proportion they want or need. There is no reason why women with children or without children, single, married, in employment, not in employment, young or old cannot be provided for within a range of policies. Focusing on and ultimately discriminating against one group has serious social and economic implications. It is time that Australia caught up with the rest of the world. It is time to value the contribution that all women make to society in our many roles, and it is certainly time that Australian women had access to a national paid maternity leave scheme.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.15

senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	A response in any particular aircraft incident is a matter for the pilot-in-command and the aircraft operator. In this particular incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB)'s investigation found that the crew troubleshot the problem in accordance with BAe Service Information Leaflet 21-45 as noted in CASA Airworthiness Directive BAe 146/86 and were able to eliminate the fumes by switching off the number-2 air conditioning pack. The flight was able to continue safely using only the number-1 air conditioning pack, with no fumes evident. </para><para>(2)	BAe 146 Operational Notice OP 16 provides the procedures to be followed by the flight crew in the event of fumes in the cabin. Visible fumes can be identified while oxygen masks are worn and if they cease to be produced when one airconditioning pack is switched off, the source is identified. If fumes are not visible, masks should be worn by crew until the aircraft lands.</para><para>(3)	Flight crew are required to don oxygen masks if there is any indication that there are fumes from the air conditioning system, as required per BAe 146 Operational Notice OP16. If the source of the fumes can be eliminated operational procedures may permit the flight to be continued to the planned destination. Not all fumes incidents are similarly serious and only a very serious emergency would lead to the need for landing as soon as possible, particularly if not at an airport normally open to the aircraft type. In this particular incident, the pilot-in-command was responsible for determining the seriousness of the situation.</para><para>(4)	(a)	There were a total of 11 flights between the two reported incidents, four flights on 6 August 2001 and seven flights on 7 August 2001.</para><para>(b)	&amp; (c) The two incidents were reported on two separate report forms by two different pilots and therefore logged at the ATSB as two separate incidents. Initial ATSB analysis indicated that both of the fumes events were the result of a bearing seal fault in the number 3 engine. An in-depth category 4 investigation was carried out in response to the second event that occurred on 7 August 2001 but with reference to both events. The first event, on 6 August 2001, was therefore logged as a category 5 investigation, for statistical purposes. The cabin crews and flight crews of both flights were interviewed during the information gathering process.  </para><para>(5)	(a)	The inspection undertaken on 6 August 2001 was undertaken in accordance with CASA and British Aerospace Systems requirements. The reason the source of the fumes was not found during the first maintenance inspection could not be determined from the ATSB's investigation.</para><para>(b)	The initial maintenance inspection of the airconditioning system, engines and APU that revealed no signs of oil contamination or oil leaks, highlighted the difficulty faced by maintenance staff in trying to trace the cause of reported fumes events. The identification of the failed oil seal and the subsequent engine change resulted from the CASA airworthiness directive requiring the operator to follow up the event with corrective maintenance action.</para><para>(6)	The Government acknowledges that the issue of air safety and cabin air quality in the BAe 146 aircraft has received considerable attention, particularly following an incident in July 1997. In response to a recommendation made by the then Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) following its investigation into the incident in 1999, CASA undertook an extensive review of the certification of the BAe 146 aircraft and concluded that the aircraft continues to meet the design standards applicable to the aircraft. </para><para>It should be noted that an aircraft is certificated against standards which apply at that time of certification. For example, the BAe 146 was certificated in 1983 by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority against Joint Aviation Requirement 25 as existing at that time. Similarly the United States Federal Aviation Administration certificated the aircraft in 1983 against Federal Aviation Regulation 25.831 that existed at that date.</para><para>As a signatory to the Chicago Convention, CASA performs its functions in a manner consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ICAO Manual of Procedures for an Airworthiness Organisation Doc 9389-AN/919, Para 5.2.1 states: <inline font-style="italic">The airworthiness standards which were complied with are identified clearly in the Type Certificate/Approval and become the regulatory basis for the Certificate/Approval.

A breakdown of Army's skill categories cannot be provided for previous years, as data are not stored electronically but are held on some 430 files, approximately 40 per cent of which are archived.</para><para>2.	The `Target' is the number of officer positions for which there is no designated Corps. The `Actual Numbers' only include those few types of officers who do not have a designated Corps (ie. Officer Cadets, undergraduates, and officers of the rank of Colonel and above). Officers with designated Corps will also be filling these Non Corps positions and this explains why the `Actual Numbers' will exceed `Targets' for some Corps (eg. Royal Australian Infantry).</para><para>3.	Similar to Non Corps. The `Target' is the number of officer positions, which may be filled by an officer from any of the three Corps. `Actual Numbers' is zero as the officers filling these positions are from a specific Corps and this explains why the `Actual Numbers' will exceed `Targets' for these three specific Corps. </para><para>4.	Similar to Non Corps. This is an officer specialisation. Officers who fill these positions remain within their original Corps. Hence the `Actual Numbers' for Military Personnel is zero and the officers filling these positions will be reflected in the `Actual Numbers' for their Corps.</para><para>5.	Personnel filling the combined Corps RAAC/RAA/RA INF, RACT/RAAOC/RAEME and RAAMC/RAADC/RAANC are reflected in the specific Corps figures above.

To compliment the Inquiries and Applications data, the enlistment figures provided in Part (4) to Question on Notice No. 205 are the numbers of personnel who were enlisted/recruited into the Services by the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation. They are the same figures as those reported in the Defence Annual Reports in the table titled: “ADF - Permanent Force Recruiting Activity”. The numbers reported in the table titled: “ADF - Permanent Force Enlistments” in the Defence Annual Reports included personnel who re-enlist and transfer between the Services or categories of Service and are, therefore, higher than the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation numbers. (Please note that the table headings given above differ slightly between each annual report). (b) No discrepancy exists.</para><para>(4)	(a) Part (5) to Question on Notice 205 requested that separations from the Services for the period 1990 to date (31 January 2002) be reported on a gender basis. Separations details reported in the Defence annual reports are based on point-in-time (30 June 2002) personnel snapshots, and do not include gender details. To answer Question on Notice 205, personnel data had to be re-compiled from that in the Defence annual reports. It is not unusual to have hundreds of personnel transactions daily in the Defence workforce. These transactions are often applied retrospectively, and in some cases these transactions have an effect date that precedes the data entry date by days, weeks and sometimes, months. There is no mechanism to update the Defence annual reports in line with changes that occur after the cut-off date for a report has passed. No such limitation in gathering data to answer Questions on Notice exist. The response to Question on Notice 205 was compiled with a later and different dataset, and accordingly, overall separation numbers differed from those reported in the Defence annual reports. (b) As per (4) (a).</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Health Services</title><page.no>9048</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 842)</subtitle><id.no>842</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9048</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What is the total cost of the contract that has been, or will be, awarded to Mayne Health Services for provision of Australian Defence Force (ADF) health services in Victoria.</para><para>(2)	(a) What is the duration of the contract; and (b) when does it commence.</para><para>(3)	Can details be provided of the options for extension of the contract.</para><para>(4)	What are the key performance indicators for the contract.</para><para>(5)	In relation to the Minister's statement to the Senate on 21 October 2002 that in some areas current health services to ADF in Victoria will improve: what are those areas.</para><para>(6)	Does the Government require Mayne to employ some, or all, of the on-base medical staff for the ADF in Victoria on the contractual basis that the staff are subject to posting: (a) within Australia; and (b) overseas; if so, how many staff have such a contractual condition, in relation to both (a) and (b). </para><para>(7)	Does the contract with Mayne include any provision on the use of Reservists; if so, can details be provided on Mayne's obligation in relation to Reservists.</para><para>(8)	Can copies of the tender documents for the provision of health services in the Australian Capital Territory and southern New South Wales region be provided.</para><para>(9)	When will a decision be made on the outsourcing of health services in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales; if the timeframe is not known, can an estimate be provided.</para><para>(10)	What is the original baseline cost for the provision of on-base health services in Victoria from which the projected cost saving is calculated.</para><para>(11)	What has it cost the department to conduct the various reviews into the cost of health services in Victoria since 1997.</para><para>(12)	Are all Defence health services being market tested; if not, in which areas is no market testing occurring, and why.</para><para>(13)	Is any planning underway to outsource health services in areas other than Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and southern New South Wales.</para><para>(14)	Can the Minister confirm that non-ADF hospitals, that is, public or private hospitals, within Australia treat ADF personnel as privately insured patients, and that the Government pays the gap.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9049</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The estimated contract price quoted by Mayne Health current until 30 June 2003, but still subject to negotiation, is $24,564,624.</para><para>(2)	(a) and (b) A contract will commence on the Execution Date (the date of signing of a contract) and, subject to extension, termination or expiry in accordance with the terms of the contract, remain in force until the Expiration Date (five years from the Execution Date).</para><para>(3)	The Commonwealth has an option to extend the Performance Period by an additional period or periods of up to two years each up to a total of an additional four years.</para><para>(4)	Key Performance Indicators were specified in the Request for Tender for each of the health services to be provided and will be included in a contract.

In addition, rehabilitated bores are monitored after works are completed. Informal advice from State Program Managers is that rapid partial pressure recovery generally occurs in the months after works are completed, and there is a more muted general pressure recovery occurring in many observation bores. These observations are supported by modeling of the pressure response of the Basin to the works approved under the Initiative to date (see (4)).</para><para>A formal review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative is scheduled to commence early in 2003.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture - Advancing Australia Communication Program</title><page.no>9055</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 897)</subtitle><id.no>897</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9055</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 12 November 2002: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	Was the 18 month Agriculture - Advancing Australia (AAA) Communication Program intended to encourage greater participation in AAA programs; if so, did the program effectively fulfil this purpose; if not, what was its purpose.</para><para>(2)	(a) What are the results of the evaluation conducted at the conclusion of the communication campaign; (b) who conducted the evaluation; and (c) what was the total cost of the communication campaign.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9055</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes, encouragement of participation in Agriculture - Advancing Australia (AAA) programs was one of the objectives of the AAA communication campaign.

The results of the Reliability Qualification Test will be considered by the Department following the completion of the test and are subject to contractual review with ADI on 3 March 2003. If the Reliability Qualification Test vehicles have failed the Reliability Qualification Test, then the Department has the right, amongst other rights, to terminate the contract. A further trial of initial production vehicles provides another potential exit point some 18 months later, should vehicles fail to meet defined performance and reliability standards.

It remains consistent with the original target of “around 70 per cent”.</para><para>(21)	The reduction in number under the revised contract will reduce the number of contingency vehicles and the size of the repair pools. It will also reduce to a minimum the number needed to equip the two battalion groups, noting that there is always some flexibility in setting the mix and number of vehicles in a battalion group. Army has advised that with the reduced number of operational vehicles it can still meet the Government's requirement to equip two battalion groups - one for an operation and a second for rotation.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Capital Equipment Projects</title><page.no>9063</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 963)</subtitle><id.no>963</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9063</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 November 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Can a list be provided to show those capital equipment projects worth $10 million or more that are currently behind their original schedule; for example, where the delivery and/or acceptance dates are later than originally planned.</para><para>(2)	With respect to each project, can the following information be provided: (a) the original delivery date at the time the project was approved; (b) the original acceptance into service date; (c) the current expected delivery date; (d) the current expected acceptance into service date; (e) the reason or reasons for the delay; (f) whether the cost of the project has been increased over the life of the project and, if so, what the increase has been; (g) the reason or reasons for any increase in project cost; and (h) whether the department has incurred any other costs because of the delay to the project and, if so, the total of these additional costs. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9064</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Because of the work which would be involved in providing a consolidated response covering all capital equipment projects over $10m in value (that is, effectively all of Defence's major capital equipment projects), the response has been limited to Defence's current Top 20 projects (by forecast spending in 2002-03) listed in the 2002-03 Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements, where the now expected (or achieved) delivery date varies from the originally contracted delivery date.</para><para>(2)	With respect to each project, the following information is provided - refer to Table below:</para><para>(a)	Column 2 provides the date of project approval.

As indicated at the Senate Legislative Committee hearing on 21 November 2002, the acquisition of the Mod 7 weapon is planned but it is yet to be approved by the Government.

This is equivalent to an original cost estimate provision contained in the 1996 “Pink Book” ($358.7m), updated to December 2002 prices. There has been no cost “blowout”. </para><para>The heavyweight torpedoes expenditure program was reshaped in 2000. The Defence Capability Sub Committee decided not to fund the full project costs at that time because of uncertainties relating to the stockholding levels required, linkages with the submarine combat system, and determination of a preferred weapon. The Government approved $253m (December 2002 prices) for the physical integration and an initial weapons purchase. The balance of the additional warstocks of weapons was foreshadowed as part of the submarine continuous technology upgrade program.  </para><para>In 2002, with the signing of the Australia/United States Statement of Principles on Submarine Cooperation, and the direction by Government to sole source the replacement heavyweight torpedo from the United States Navy, the funding requirement was clarified and reconfirmed $475m in the December 2002 prices. </para><para>The scope and content of SEA 1439 Phase 5 continuous improvement program is still evolving and yet to be fully defined.

In December 2002, in the context of high level bilateral environment talks with Japan, Australia reiterated our commitment to the protection and welfare of all cetaceans.

In Tasmania the Forests Practices Act 1985 provides legislative protection for natural and heritage values affected by existing and future forest operations, on either private or public land. Tasmania's Resource Planning and Development Commission recently concluded its inquiry on progress with implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, in accordance with the 5-yearly review provisions of that agreement.

The Tasmanian Forests Practices Act 1985 provides legislative protection for natural and heritage values affected by existing and future forest operations, on either private or public land, including harvesting, reforestation, roading and quarrying activities.

The Commission accepts that this data is based on gross area approved for future harvesting or clearing for agriculture, and is therefore an overestimation of the extent of change.</para><para>	(b)	See response to 2 (a).</para><para>(5)	(a) and (b) There is no established Government mechanism in place for collecting data on the area of plantations established under managed investment schemes.</para><para>(6)	(a)	The Government has a strong commitment to maintaining Australia's native vegetation. Through the Regional Forests Agreements (RFAs) a balance has been found between preserving biodiversity for future generations and supporting the significant contribution that industry can make to the economy. It is not an aim of the Australian taxation system to encourage activities that are detrimental to the environment. Indeed Subdivision 40-G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 may allow an immediate tax deduction to be claimed for capital expenditure incurred in preventing or fighting land degradation, including soil conservation measures and operations which prevent or fight such things as salinity and the degradation of natural vegetation. </para><para>	(b)	The 13-month prepayment provision provides a timing advantage for investors in timber plantation managed investment schemes. Section 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 allows taxpayers to claim a deduction for those costs involved in gaining or producing their assessable income. This section means that investors can deduct some of the funds that they pay to establish a plantation. The prepayment rule provides that to the extent that investors' contributions are already considered deductible under Section 8-1, and where these contributions relate specifically to seasonally dependent agronomic operations undertaken in establishing the plantation, then investors can claim an immediate deduction for funds committed in one financial year that relate to operations undertaken in the following year. The prepayment rule does not provide any additional taxation deduction for these investors.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Standards</title><page.no>9168</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1073)</subtitle><id.no>1073</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9168</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 8 January 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In response to the answer to Question on Notice No. 816 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 19 November 2002, p. 6809) and the failure to answer part (b) of that question, and noting the Minister's assurance that the Australian Forest Standard (AFS) was “intentionally drafted” for compatibility with international standards: In what specific way is the AFS different (more strident or lax) than international standards?</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9168</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: </para></talk.start><quote><para>In a comparison of the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest certification scheme and the Pan European Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme, the AFS is compatible with the PEFC and there are only three AFS criteria that are different to FSC criteria, these are:</para><para>(1)	The AFS does not include a specific criterion equivalent to the FSC criterion that prohibits the use of genetically modified organisms. The reason for the difference is that Australia already has gene technology laws and all forest managers are required to comply with all existing governing legislation.</para><para>(2)	The AFS does not prescribe a `chain of custody' framework because it is a forest management standard, not a product management standard. AFS certified products will be supported by a separate `chain of custody' framework. The forest and wood products industry in Australia is considering what internationally recognised `chain of custody' framework they will use.</para><para>(3)	The AFS does not prescribe that a proportion of overall plantation forest (appropriate to scale and determined by region) shall be managed so as to restore the site to a natural forest cover. This is because in Australia the proportion of forest set aside as natural forest cover has already been prescribed for individual regions in Australia's Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) and by State/regional and local planning requirements.</para><para>In all other areas the AFS is considered compatible with the FSC. Two specific issues raised by ENGO representatives on the AFS Technical Reference Committee have also been addressed in the final AFS.  </para><para>These issues were:</para><para>(1)	Unlike the FSC the AFS does not have a set date by which certification will not be granted to the forest manager if conversion of natural forest to plantations is undertaken after this date.</para><para>The AFS states that the forest manager shall not undertake conversion except in exceptional circumstances, such as clearing required by law under powerlines, and also specifies that managers of plantations established after the date of the publication of the AFS will be required to demonstrate conformance with this requirement as part of the certification process.</para><para>(2)	Stakeholder consultation as part of the certification process. </para><para>A sub-committee of the Technical Reference Committee (TRC) was established to examine how public participation should be facilitated at the forest management plan level. The result was the drafting of separate AFS criterion, which combined requirements for the identification of stakeholders, public input to management planning and good neighbour considerations. Neither the FSC nor the PEFC have separate criterion that specifically addresses public participation. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science: Chief Scientist</title><page.no>9169</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1074)</subtitle><id.no>1074</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9169</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 8 January 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham: (a) what has been his total income from his appointment; (b) what fringe benefits have applied, and what is the value of these; (c) what is his annual wage; and (d) what costs have been paid for Dr Batterham's travel, to what destinations, and for what purpose has each of his paid journeys been made.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9169</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(a)	Total - $327,155 over three and a half years from 31 May 1999 to 15 January 2003.</para><para>(b)	Fringe benefits tax is payable in these circumstances:</para><para>Meals that have been paid for by the former Department of Industry, Science and Resources (ISR) and the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) where the average cost of the meal exceeds the meal allowance rates of the Senior Executive Service.</para><para>Meals that have been paid for by the department (ISR or DEST) where the meal included alcohol.</para><para>The Chief Scientist has incurred an amount of fringe benefits tax of under $250 during the three and a half years from 31 May 1999 to 15 January 2003.</para><para>(c)	The current annual fee for the Chief Scientist is $90,600, as set by the Remuneration Tribunal.</para><para>Please refer to the Remuneration Tribunal website for the current (http://www.remtribunal.gov.au/ home/ dets/det_2002_10.html) and past (http://www.remtribunal.gov.au/home/ archival_determin-ations.html) annual fees of the Chief Scientist.</para><para>(d)	The Chief Scientist's travel costs are reimbursed, in line with the Remuneration Tribunal determination, at Tier 1 level.

These include: </para><para>·	Extensive early publicity through media releases, speeches to industry conferences and information to industry associations, many individual businesses and Local Government Environmental Health officers. This focused on informing food businesses and the general public that changes to food standards had been adopted and would become mandatory after two years. </para><para>·	The establishment of an email and telephone industry advice line. Advice is provided free of charge and the line operates at local call rates in both Australia and New Zealand. The majority of calls and emails to the industry advice line, in the order of 100 inquiries per day, have been from small to medium food business.</para><para>·	The development and distribution of Fact Sheets and User Guides which respectively provide brief summaries of and comprehensive operational information on key standards in the Code.</para><para>·	The development of a free internet-based Nutrition Panel Calculator (NPC) to assist in the calculation of nutrient values required for labelling most packaged foods.</para><para>·	The development of a comprehensive training package on the Code for health officers in the States, Territories and New Zealand.</para><para>·	The delivery of a large number of seminars on the Code to industry, Local Government bodies and enforcement agencies in most jurisdictions.</para><para>·	In 2002, towards the end of the transition period for the Code, FSANZ communicated extensively with stakeholders to provide a further reminder about the new labelling requirements and the deadline for implementation of these changes. Communications were undertaken through media releases, the distribution of information circulars and brochures, and through presentations at key conferences, in particular, to industry associations. Letters were also sent to all Local Governments in Australia to seek the help of their Environmental Health officers who visit food businesses regularly, in reminding those businesses of their obligations and of the availability of guidance on how to comply.</para><para>(2)	The Code is enforced by the States and Territories under State and Territory Food Acts. Therefore, the Commonwealth is unable to provide the type of data requested. However, enforcement data would be available from the respective State and Territory Health Departments. Similarly, data for imported foods can be provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), which has responsibility for the enforcement of imported foods under the Imported Food Control Act 1992. </para><para>Based on qualitative data from an independent survey, FSANZ is aware that most manufacturers were prepared and complying with the requirements of the new Code well before the end of the transition period.</para><para>Whilst the new labelling requirements took effect on 20 December 2002, it should be noted that transitional `stock-in-trade' provisions also apply. Under these provisions, short shelf life foods (i.e. less than 12 months) that are manufactured and packaged under the old requirements prior to 20 December 2002 can be sold until 20 December 2003 and long shelf-life foods (i.e. greater than 12 months), until 20 December 2004. Given these `stock-in-trade' provisions, it may not be possible at this stage to obtain a true indication of the number of businesses that have failed to comply with the new mandatory nutrition labelling requirements.</para><para>(3)	Traditionally, the jurisdictions in the States and Territories have been the primary Government source of advice on regulations and interpretation of food standards. However, in recognition of the magnitude of the changes to food regulation embodied in the Code, FSANZ actively supported industry implementation through the two-year transition period to 20 December 2002, as outlined under (1) above. FSANZ will continue to provide advisory resources on a permanent basis on the FSANZ website, including Fact Sheets and User Guides, but assistance through the advice line will be phased back during 2003 as the demand for help is now falling.</para><para>(4)	FSANZ does not have any enforcement powers. Information on action taken for non-compliance with the new labelling requirements may be obtained from enforcement agencies in the States and Territories and, in the case of imported foods, from AQIS. The penalties which may apply when breaches of the Code occur will vary according to the specific State or Territory legislation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care in Rural and Remote Communities </title><page.no>9186</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1087)</subtitle><id.no>1087</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9186</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator Webber</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 17 January 2003:</para></talk.start><para>Given the considerable disadvantage faced by small rural and remote communities when taking up new aged-care bed licences, will the Government give consideration to: (a) allowing those community organisations to accumulate average Commonwealth nursing home benefit payments to be used as a capital source for the building of new facilities; (b) the establishment of a capital fund to provide low-interest loans to rural and remote communities for the purpose of building and operating community run residential facilities; (c) providing these communities with a Commonwealth guarantee to enable them to apply for commercial loans; and (d) allowing the co-location of these facilities with local hospitals to assist with establishment and running costs.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>9186</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(a)	The Government has established a Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care.
