This is the case even when the goods would otherwise, but for this exclusion, fall within the definition of `therapeutic goods' under the Act. </para><para>For example, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code defines a “formulated supplementary sports food”, otherwise known as a sports food, as “a food or mixture of foods specifically formulated to assist sports people in achieving specific nutritional or performance goals”. </para><para>The effect of this definition is to require that any complementary medicine, presented as assisting sports people in this way, be regulated as a food. </para><para>This means the product, which may be in tablet or capsule form, with dosage instructions and indications for use, is not subject to the usual pre-market assessment, or post-market regulatory surveillance that occurs for other therapeutic goods. </para><para>Additionally, the product cannot be represented as a medicine, or carry medicinal claims, as to do so would render it an illegal food.</para><para>The amendment to the definition of `therapeutic goods' will allow the use of a determination under Section 7 of the Act in the practical manner that the legislation and all stakeholders always intended. </para><para>Without the amendment, the confusion with the regulation around the food-medicine interface would escalate. This could, in the future, pose public health and safety risks to consumers resulting from individual complementary medicine products being inappropriately regulated as foods. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Advertising </inline></para><para>Another important aspect of this bill is to enable a transfer of the provisions for the pre-approval of therapeutic goods advertisements in the broadcast media from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to the therapeutic goods legislation.</para><para>Under the Broadcasting Services Act, approvals for advertisements of medicines intended for the broadcast media may be granted by the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing, or her delegates. </para><para>Review of the Secretary's decisions is undertaken by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. At present the Minister cannot delegate this function. </para><para>On the other hand, approvals for advertising of therapeutic goods intended for the print media, cinema and outdoors are given under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations by the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing, or by her delegates. </para><para>The function of reviewing any decision to approve, or not to approve, an advertisement for publication is conferred upon the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is able to delegate this function to officers of the Department.</para><para>When deciding whether to approve advertisements intended for publication in the print media, cinema and outdoors, the Secretary must be satisfied that the advertisement complies with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. </para><para>However, under the Broadcasting Services Act, there is no requirement that advertisements about medicines published through broadcast media comply with the Code.</para><para>The removal of provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act relating to the pre-approval of therapeutic goods advertising, will enable these functions to be transferred to the therapeutic goods legislation.  </para><para>This will create a level playing field for the provisions that apply to advertisements for therapeutic goods in all forms of media, as they will all be required to comply with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. </para><para>The amendments will also simplify the pre-approval and appeals processes. All pre-approvals made in relation to advertisements will be made by the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing, or her delegate, and all related appeals made will be undertaken by the Minister for Health and Ageing or her delegates. </para><para>This bill will also transfer the advertising offence provisions from the Therapeutic Goods Regulations to the Act. </para><para>Currently, some of the offences relating to advertising still remain in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, where the penalty for breaches of advertising requirements is set at 10 penalty units. Other comparable advertising offences have been included in the Act, where the penalty for breaches of advertising offences is 50-100 penalty units. </para><para>In order to ensure consistency of penalties applying for all breaches of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, and to render any prosecution for breaches of the Code more effective, all advertising offences that are included in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, are to be transferred to Chapter 5 of the Act, where other comparable advertising offences are located. </para><para>Based on recommendations from previous reviews of the therapeutic goods advertising provisions, a new requirement included in the bill is for advertisements published in the different media described as `specified media' to comply with the Code. This will ensure that the principles of the Code in its entirety will be enforceable in relation to advertisements published in all major forms of media.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other Amendments</inline></para><para>A further critical aspect of this bill is a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act to enable the medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to more effectively monitor compliance by sponsors and manufacturers with their statutory responsibilities and obligations. These measures will better enable the TGA to more rigorously address any potential deficiencies in therapeutic goods supplied to the public.</para><para>The amendments are timely in the wake of a succession of serious safety and quality breaches by a major Australian manufacturer of therapeutic goods which necessitated unprecedented regulatory action to protect the Australian public from faulty and dangerous medicines. This unfortunate matter highlighted the importance of ensuring that the legislative provisions are adequate to prevent or deter such breaches from happening again.</para><para>The proposed amendments clarify and strengthen the responsibilities and obligations of sponsors and manufacturers of therapeutic goods. These include better record keeping about the identity of all manufacturers involved with the manufacture of their products so this information may be readily obtained by the TGA. In reality, this is information sponsors and manufacturers should already have about the products they supply, and for which they have responsibility under the Therapeutic Goods Act, however the amendments will ensure it is readily available, accurate and accessible.</para><para>The amendments will also provide new methods for addressing manufacturing deficiencies found in therapeutic goods by strengthening reporting requirements on sponsors and manufacturers. Information that becomes known to a sponsor or manufacturer about adverse events in connection with the use of their therapeutic goods, or about any deficiencies relating to the goods, must be notified to the TGA. Notifying the regulator about these matters by sponsors and manufacturers is not an unreasonable requirement.</para><para>By providing additional grounds for the TGA to refuse to include goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or to withhold, suspend or cancel a manufacturing licence, the amendments will assist in reducing the risk of non-compliance with required standards for goods and in ensuring proper and accepted manufacturing standards are followed. Importantly, only “fit and proper persons” will now be able to hold manufacturing licences for therapeutic goods.</para><para>The bill also includes provisions to extend the circumstances in which deficient therapeutic goods may be recalled from the market, and when their sponsors or manufacturers will be required to notify the public about the grounds for recall. These measures will allow sub-standard or suspect products to be recalled without the need to cancel them from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. </para><para>Finally, the amendments create new offences related to the failure of a sponsor or manufacture to comply with manufacturing standards and for falsifying or destroying any document or record relating to, among other things, the manufacture, testing or evaluation of therapeutic goods. New offences are also proposed to provide additional disincentives for manufacturers who contemplate not complying with proper standards in the manufacture of therapeutic goods. These new penalty provisions are required in order to ensure that medicinal products continue to meet acceptable standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY LAW) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11177</page.no><id.no>R1717</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>11177</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.43 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11177</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11177</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill proposes amendments to a number of Acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of the Commonwealth civilian schemes and members of the Australian Defence Force schemes.</para><para>These superannuation arrangements are being amended as a consequence of changes to the Family Law Act 1975 and regulations under that Act in relation to the new arrangements for splitting of superannuation on marriage breakdown.

The benefit will either be paid as a pension or lump sum in such form and circumstances as the scheme rules permit. </para><para>The bill will also amend the relevant Acts or allow Ministerial Orders to be made to provide for a reduction in the benefit paid to or in respect of the member.  </para><para>To put in place the framework, amendments are proposed to seven Acts these being the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990.  </para><para>As the majority of the rules for the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme established under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 are included in Trust Deeds made under those Acts most of the proposed changes to those schemes will be made through amending Trust Deeds.</para><para>The bill proposes that the new superannuation arrangements will apply to superannuation agreements or Family Court orders received after the commencement of the relevant amendments to the legislation, as well as to those agreements or Family Court orders received before that time but after 28 December 2002 where no benefit has become payable to the member.

We have seen it in the media this morning, particularly in the comments reported of Senator Brandis—an outrageous misleading of this chamber and of the public in relation to the evidence. Both Senator Hill and Senator Brandis claimed in this debate that the expert psychiatrist had supported Dr Hollingworth's management plan—that Dr Slaughter had supported the plan that Dr Hollingworth had put in place. This is blatantly untrue. It is not the case. Senator Brandis's claim that it was the case and his going through the evidence to this point was clearly misleading. I am going to go through this in some detail because I want senators to conclude for themselves whether it was deliberately misleading. I have my own suspicions on that point but I would like each senator in this place to reach their own conclusions. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brandis in his contribution went to page 386 of the report. There is reported Dr Hollingworth's recollection of the advice he received from Dr Slaughter. Senator Brandis went to the final point there where Dr Slaughter, as recalled or reconstructed by Dr Hollingworth, advised against situations where Mr Elliot was put with young people. Senator Brandis then went on to page 388 where Dr Slaughter refers to his recollection of his advice to Dr Hollingworth. At paragraph 5.5, Dr Slaughter says that his recollection was that, whilst he did not feel he could comment one way or the other on whether Mr Elliot should be removed from the priesthood, he:</para><quote><para>... did feel that he should not have dealings with the public and especially with young people.</para></quote><para>The difference between the recollections of Dr Hollingworth and the expert psychiatrist Dr Slaughter is that Dr Slaughter was advising that this man should not be put with the public. There is no discussion there about supervision, as alleged by Senator Hill.</para><para>What was worse in the description of this case is that Senator Brandis then goes on to the 1993 letter from Dr Hollingworth to the respondent, where it makes this point clear. Senator Brandis referred to the section on page 390 of the report and went through the first four paragraphs, but what he did not go to was the next paragraph. When we read the next paragraph in the context of what Senator Brandis was trying to allege you can see the misrepresentation. The next paragraph says:</para><quote><para>This action differs from the advice given to me by Dr Slaughter ... </para></quote><para>It could not be more clear that the path Dr Hollingworth was taking differed from the advice given to him by Dr Slaughter. Not only could it not be more clear from the recollections of Dr Slaughter, but from Dr Hollingworth's own pen we know that the path he chose was different from the advice he received from Dr Slaughter. Why didn't Senator Brandis refer to this point when he made very strong and very strident allegations about how the opposition was handling this case? He sought to defend Dr Hollingworth in maintaining some of his reconstructions in relation to this case.</para><para>Senator Brandis went further. I agree with Senator Brandis in relation to case 5 when he says that it is clear that Dr Hollingworth sought to apply good faith. I do agree that Dr Hollingworth was acting in good faith—he was poorly informed and it was poorly managed but I do not see anything which says good faith was not in place. I think the next point that Dr Hollingworth was being nothing but honest and truthful is a bit more difficult to maintain. Dr Hollingworth today, with reconstructions of the circumstances to accommodate his behaviour, may believe the story. But this is one of our problems: we cannot have a Governor-General in whom we cannot place confidence that he will not reconstruct a story to other than the truth as he tries to come to terms with the circumstances of inappropriate management of situations in the past. This is what Dr Hollingworth continues to do today, when he still claims to the inquiry that he had an extensive plan in relation to Mr Elliot. We should take a closer look at that plan and see the multitude of errors. </para><para>Senator Brandis also says that Dr Hollingworth went through extensive consultation and established this management process. We now know that in that extensive consultation no-one else but Dr Hollingworth advised this type of management plan. It was against the expert psychiatrist's plan. Certainly other bishops did not demur from his plan, but other than his own opinion there is no evidence of advice that he should go down that path.</para><para>Further to that, Senator Brandis says that since this time, in relation to the Elliot case, `no further child abuse occurred'. Frankly, we do not know that. We know that Dr Hollingworth did not seek to test the perpetrator's claim that he was not interfering with any other boys but we do not know that this did not occur. Anyone who has a basic understanding of child sexual abuse knows that the research tells us that these people committing sexual offences on children are likely to have committed many more sexual offences than ever become officially known.</para><para>How Senator Brandis can get up and say that no further cases have occurred, I do not know. Sure, Mr Elliot is in jail for multiple cases of sodomy at an earlier point in time, but where this confidence comes from that other cases of sexual abuse did not occur at some later point is beyond me. There is nothing in the Elliot case that leads us, having regard to the feedback Dr Hollingworth or other bishops or Elliot's wife were receiving, to have that confidence. There is nothing. It is sad that Dr Hollingworth did not look at placements earlier than 1993 that Mr Elliot had been in. What later occurred and what Mr Elliot was then successfully charged with came to the surface. It should have come when these cases came before Dr Hollingworth at that point in time.</para><para>Senator Brandis also claimed that case No. 5 was the entire case, that the Elliot case was the entire case against Dr Hollingworth. In a sense he is seeking the same respect that Dr Hollingworth applied to Mr Elliot in claiming that it was an isolated incident or an isolated error of judgment. This is not the case either. I encourage senators to have a look at case No. 3. Case No. 3 is another example of the main problem here. In case No. 3 the respondent, a retired bishop, had permission to officiate in the Brisbane diocese, and this is what people were trying to stop. The complainant asked that it be taken from the respondent. Dr Hollingworth considered that request and, for reasons that appear further on in the Aspinall report, he declined to do so. </para><para>Whether that decision was correct is a matter upon which the chairman and Professor Briggs are unable to agree. The overview of the report said that on balance and notwithstanding the powerful arguments to the contrary, the chairman considered that in all the circumstances this was a reasonable exercise of Dr Hollingworth's discretion. Professor Briggs, on the other hand, considered that once Dr Hollingworth in his capacity as archbishop was apprised of the serious misconduct of the respondent he should, in order to demonstrate proper moral leadership, have withdrawn the permission. Professor Briggs considered that in the circumstances Dr Hollingworth's failure to do so was inappropriate. </para><para>Case No. 3 is another case where Dr Hollingworth—and, it appears, the Prime Minister and members of the government in this chamber—have not got the point. The point is that when it becomes clear that a perpetrator of child abuse has done this type of abuse, they should be withdrawn from public office. Dr Slaughter recommended that but Dr Hollingworth put in place his management plan. A request to withdraw permission was sought in case No. 3 but Dr Hollingworth allowed this respondent to officiate in the Brisbane diocese. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Still on the main game?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Senator Campbell asks whether we are still on the main game.

Senator Murray concluded his contribution with this comment: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>You cannot underestimate when dealing with these issues what the consequences are of letting a paedophile priest continue in practice.</para></quote><para>This is the message that the Prime Minister, Dr Hollingworth and many—not all—government senators have not understood. This is a message that I am sure Senator Murray understands, and I certainly do too.</para><para>Let us address some of those issues. If in identifying criminal behaviour the church does not report that behaviour to appropriate authorities, those involved may ultimately end up conspiring with that criminal behaviour. That conspiracy may not have been intentional originally. That conspiracy ultimately, though, will occur if you avoid reporting this type of criminal behaviour. This is the point of concern about the final letter in the Aspinall report that Dr Hollingworth wrote to the perpetrator, Mr Elliot. In that final letter, dated 1999, possibly less than 18 months before the Governor-General was appointed, Dr Hollingworth suggested to Mr Elliot that he keep a low profile, that he ensured that he remained off the register of practising priests in the Anglican Church. That sort of behaviour, viewed as it is clearly laid out in this report, shows the type of perhaps unintentional conspiracy that Dr Hollingworth ended up in because he did not report this criminal behaviour. He left himself in the situation where, for quite separate reasons, Mr Elliot's behaviour was identified and placed before the courts and he was put in jail. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11183</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This proposed resolution, unfortunately, is necessary. It is necessary for the Senate to pass this proposed resolution today because of the failure of the Governor-General to do the right thing and resign his office. It is necessary because of the failure of the Prime Minister to take action to seek or effect that resignation. It is necessary because of the failure of the Prime Minister in appointing Dr Hollingworth as Governor-General in the first place. It would not be necessary for us to spend this time today debating this issue if the Governor-General had done what the overwhelming majority of Australians believe he should do, and that is resign. Senator Ian Campbell, in interjecting a moment ago, referred to the `main game'. This is not a game. This is a serious issue. Indeed, this is one of the most serious issues facing the Australian people today—that is, the terrible history of child abuse that has gone on in this country, particularly in institutions such as the churches.</para></talk.start><para>Let us also remember that we are debating the fitness for holding the highest office in the land—an office which all Australians believe should be held by somebody whose past is unblemished and whose role as Governor-General is appropriate. This proposed resolution should be passed because it is clear and undisputed that Dr Hollingworth failed to appropriately deal with allegations of sexual abuse in the Anglican Church during his time prior to being appointed Governor-General. The findings of the inquiry conducted by the Anglican Church have been well canvassed in this debate. They are findings that have been accepted by Dr Hollingworth, though I note that claims are being made on his behalf that he may have been denied natural justice. I will come back to that in a moment. Certainly, it is indisputable that Dr Hollingworth allowed a self-confessed paedophile to continue in the ministry despite a history of sexual abuse. He allowed that to happen despite being informed of and investigating it himself. Dr Hollingworth now admits, following the inquiry's findings, that this was a serious error of judgment.</para><para>But it was more than a serious error of judgment. As the Anglican Church's inquiry found, the way in which Dr Hollingworth handled the case of John Elliot, in particular, was untenable. It also found that Dr Hollingworth's evidence and recollections were faulty; indeed, they were subject to some reconstruction. I will quote from the report; this has already been quoted in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but I believe that it is important to quote it once again. The report said:</para><quote><para>The Board finds that Dr Hollingworth's recollections are faulty, and that he has apparently reconstructed what he believed he was told, rather than recalled what in fact was said. Dr Hollingworth has made a statutory declaration that he believed at the relevant time the abuse was an isolated occurrence, and whilst the Board does not doubt he genuinely believes this to be so, the Board is satisfied that in August 1993 FG told him the details of the abuse and indicated that it consisted of more than one offence. There was nothing that could have entitled Dr. Hollingworth to believe otherwise. ... The Board considers that no Bishop acting reasonably could have reached the decision to continue a known paedophile in the ministry. There were no extenuating circumstances nor can the Board imagine any ... </para></quote><para>Those comments demonstrate that this was more than just a serious error of judgment. The evidence also reveals that Dr Hollingworth put the interests of the church and, indeed, the perpetrator ahead of those of the victim, the law and the wider community. In September 1995, a letter was written by the brother of FG, the victim, to Dr Hollingworth. On the following day, Dr Hollingworth wrote:</para><quote><para>At the end of the day I made the judgment that he is now getting close to retirement and the disruption and upset that would be caused to the whole parish as well as to him and his family would be in nobody's best interests.</para></quote><para>Clearly, having been made aware of this terrible abuse that had occurred, having been made aware that it was not an isolated incident but rather had been happening for a number of years, the response of the person charged with protecting the members of the church and the community—not just the ministers but indeed all of those who come within their care, especially children—was to take the view that this should be kept under wraps. Why? It was because it might upset the parish and it might cause disruption and upset to the perpetrator and his family. To come to such a conclusion demonstrates not just an error of judgment; it demonstrates in my view a total disregard for the interests of those the church seeks to represent and to protect.</para><para>I want to deal with some of the arguments that have been put by members of the government in defending or supporting Dr Hollingworth's remaining in the position, as well as some of those which have been argued publicly. The first one of those is the argument that this all happened before Dr Hollingworth was appointed as Governor-General and that he has done nothing since in his role as Governor-General that would warrant his resignation or dismissal. Frankly, I think that is a nonsense proposition because this issue does not just relate to what Dr Hollingworth has done in carrying out his responsibilities as Governor-General; it relates to his fitness to hold the office and it relates to his fitness to be appointed to the office. Nobody should be appointed to that office or be allowed to remain in office if serious blemishes have occurred on their character, their integrity and their responsibility either before their appointment or afterwards. Let us ask ourselves the question: if the decision were being made today by the Prime Minister to appoint a Governor-General, knowing what we know now—and indeed what was known to some extent at the time of the appointment—would Dr Hollingworth be appointed Governor-General today? I think not. Therein lies the real position.</para><para>Also, it is not true that nothing has happened since the appointment of Dr Hollingworth as Governor-General in terms of his carrying out of duties that would warrant his resignation or dismissal. It is not true. We are all aware of what was said by Dr Hollingworth in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>program when he took the opportunity to defend his role in these issues prior to his appointment. He said to the ABC, in referring to the case of a young girl who had alleged sexual abuse:</para><quote><para>... this was not sex abuse. There was no suggestion of rape or anything like that. Quite the contrary, my information is that it was, rather, the other way around.</para></quote><para>He was still seeking to shift the blame, after he was appointed Governor-General, from the perpetrator to the victim. Frankly, the reaction to that interview and that comment around the country was amazing. People were totally offended by that attitude, an attitude that was clearly one long held by Dr Hollingworth, and presumably at that point in time he had still not come to realise that he was wrong. It was clear that he was still failing to deal with this issue seriously and appropriately. </para><para>I think it is also important to note what Senator Hill said when he spoke in the chamber. He talked about Dr Hollingworth having made an error of judgment and having acknowledged that. He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>Why was Dr Hollingworth appointed to this job? It was not because he was an archbishop; it was because he had given a lifetime of service to the community, particularly to the poor.</para></quote><para>It has been argued that we should look to Dr Hollingworth's period of great service to the poor, particularly in his role with the Brotherhood of St Laurence, for many years prior to his appointment and that we should judge his fitness for office on that record rather than on the record relating to the cover-up of sexual abuse within the Anglican Church. I do not question Dr Hollingworth's service in regard to the Brotherhood of St Laurence and his raising of issues regarding poverty and social deprivation. But I think it actually reinforces the case that we make. Here is a person who should have understood better than most the impact of sexual abuse upon young children, because he had worked with the community for so long in a role where he would have clearly come to understand, probably better than most people in the community, the impact of such abuse. As I understand it, he was a trained social worker or experienced in social work. Clearly his record demonstrates that. That is why he should have understood and acted differently from the way he did. His record actually reinforces the point we make that he should not continue to hold this office.</para><para>It has also been argued that the inquiry by the Anglican Church was not a judicial inquiry and that therefore we cannot take the findings as seriously as we might take those of, say, a judicial inquiry or a royal commission. That has led to the argument about the denial of natural justice. Let us deal with that. Firstly, the reason there was no judicial inquiry was that the federal government refused to hold one. The head of the Anglican Church in Brisbane requested that the federal government establish either a royal commission or a judicial inquiry into these issues but they refused, so the Anglican Church conducted its own inquiry. Clearly, such an inquiry does not have the scope that a wider royal commission or judicial inquiry might have in relation to the rules of evidence, cross-examination and so on. So that argument does not hold up, because that request was rejected by the government.</para><para>Secondly, the argument that Dr Hollingworth was denied natural justice was advanced by Senator Brandis in particular, who tried to give us the benefit of his legal knowledge. Senator Brandis is not the only lawyer in this chamber—there are plenty of them. Those of us who understand the law, whether we practise in it, have been involved in it or not, understand that Senator Brandis's arguments were a furphy. Dr Hollingworth apparently now claims—or it is claimed on his behalf—that he has been denied natural justice, and it is said that he has a legal opinion. However, the legal opinion has not been released. Let us see it. Let us test it. It is clear from the inquiry that Dr Hollingworth had every opportunity to put his case. As I understand it, he was invited to appear but he declined; he put in a written statement. The inquiry took masses of evidence, as the inquiry says, from witnesses through written statements and other means. Importantly, Senator Brandis got it wrong when he said that Dr Hollingworth was never shown the final report before it was released. That is not true. Dr Hollingworth's solicitors were provided with a copy of the draft report before it was released.</para><para>It is also argued that this is a witch-hunt—this is allied to the argument about natural justice. Senator Brandis said that in his view it is like the trials in Salem in 1692. What a preposterous comparison. Firstly, the Salem trials, as we know, were based upon false evidence. Here the evidence is not false; here the evidence is clear and indisputable: the abuse occurred. In the famous Salem witch-hunt trials, people were convicted and executed because of false accusations—lies—and hysteria. It is a preposterous comparison. This is not an hysterical beat-up; this is a genuine response by the Australian community, the media and this parliament to an issue of vital importance. </para><para>If we are going to talk about natural justice, what about the natural justice that was denied to High Court judge Justice Kirby when Senator Heffernan stood up in this chamber and attacked his reputation based upon false evidence? No notice was given to Justice Kirby that that was about to happen—none at all. What about the natural justice that was denied to that young woman when Dr Hollingworth made his statement on <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> that I read out a moment ago—a statement made on public television, traducing her character and suggesting that she really was responsible for the abuse that occurred? There was no opportunity for her to defend herself.</para><para>I have recently read references to the need for forgiveness, and particularly that this is a trying time for Dr Hollingworth. I have no doubt that it is. But let us remember the words of Christ, as written in Matthew 18:6:</para><quote><para>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</para></quote><para>We are not suggesting that sort of fate for Dr Hollingworth. What should happen is that he resign as Governor-General.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11186</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand in support of the motion moved by Labor, and firmly believe that Dr Hollingworth must be removed from the office of Governor-General by the Prime Minister of Australia. Dr Hollingworth failed to deal with child sex abuse, he failed to protect the victims of child sex abuse and, in turn, chose to protect a known paedophile—this while he was in a position of great trust as Archbishop of Brisbane. Dr Hollingworth would never have accepted the appointment of Governor-General if he truly realised and regretted this serious failure to act. But, true to form, he displayed an `error of judgment' by agreeing to become head of state. Given that the Prime Minister refuses to take any meaningful stand on this issue, the Labor Party and the Senate can no longer wait for him to act. </para></talk.start><para>Dr Hollingworth should not simply step aside from the office of Governor-General; he must be removed completely. He must be removed on the basis of his `untenable' decision to do nothing when faced with a priest who had committed unspeakable crimes. The call to remove Dr Hollingworth is not in relation to the rape allegations. This is why the call by the Prime Minister asking Dr Hollingworth to step aside once the rape allegations were made public could be interpreted that he has effectively expressed a view on the Aspinall report and that he, the Prime Minister, is not concerned about the findings of that report. Labor has been saying that John Howard had missed the point, but what if it is worse than that? What if, in fact, the Prime Minister supports Dr Hollingworth in the face of his ill judgment as exposed in the Aspinall report?</para><para>The protection of children in our society must come before anything else. Our children must be placed above politics, and yet the Prime Minister continues to maintain that Dr Hollingworth is worthy of retaining the office of head of state. Australians consider child sex abuse to be the most serious of crimes. Australians demand that paedophiles be dealt with harshly and that the victims of such crimes receive justice and all possible support through the unimaginable emotional torment which ensues from such horrific crimes. The Prime Minister clearly does not have the prevention of child abuse high on his agenda. One would have thought that in Tuesday night's budget the government would at the very least have allocated some new money for the prevention of child abuse, but there was nothing. Given the attention that this issue is getting, and considering that the government has this week risen in the parliament and stood in this chamber to state the importance of the protection of children, I see nothing new in either funds or strategy to further protect Australian children from the horrors of child abuse. As a mother of three children, I cannot accept that more is not being done to protect children throughout this country. I know all parents care about this issue very deeply and reflect upon their own life experiences in their support for the strongest possible action to be taken against child abusers. </para><para>Australians refuse to simply turn a blind eye to child sex abuse and likewise will not accept that Dr Hollingworth's actions as Archbishop of Brisbane were a mere, and indeed forgivable, error of judgment. It is a disgrace that the Prime Minister will not acknowledge the seriousness of Dr Hollingworth's decision to consider the needs of the abuser before the needs of the abused and remove him from office. The decisions made by Dr Hollingworth are a serious indictment of his character and his ability to protect and honour the dignity of the office of Governor-General. The Prime Minister's failure to remove Dr Hollingworth from the revered position of head of state is also a serious indictment of Mr Howard's ability to conduct himself properly as Prime Minister of this country. The office of Governor-General should be a symbol of unity and strength for the nation. Because the Prime Minister makes the appointment to the office, he too shares the responsibility of maintaining the standard of the position.</para><para>I look to Dr Hollingworth's own words and his explanations of the choices and judgments he has made as being a good test and a measure of his ability to uphold the standards of the office of Governor-General. I think they tell us a lot. After all, on the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> Dr Hollingworth's wife said of him:</para><quote><para>Peter's a person who's really very hard on himself. He really tortures himself about what he should and shouldn't do ...</para></quote><para>Subsequently rationalising his lack of action on the complaints made to him of sexual abuse of students in an Anglican school, Dr Hollingworth said:</para><quote><para>Dealing with the issue of Toowoomba Prep and the terrible tragedies that occurred there, I think I'd say that I wasn't up to it, for several reasons.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>A few years later, I think I could have handled it better.</para></quote><para>In December 2001, the Anglican Church attempted to defend the inaction of the former archbishop by revealing that he had received legal advice urging him not to intervene in the school's abuse case and to make no public comment. Dr Hollingworth himself explained in relation to this:</para><quote><para>The deepest moral dilemma that as a Christian, as a Christian leader, I would want to do one thing. As the leader of an institution, I'm tied into a legal contract with an insurer that determined other things. You've got a moral dilemma here between saying, “Well, to hell with the insurance. We'll put all our energy behind the victim, and if they sue us, well, so be it, we'll pay. And if we're not insured, tough luck.” I mean, I can understand that argument, of course, and I have a lot of sympathy with it, but the other side of it that has to be put, is that if you've got three or four court cases that went against you, it'll close the school. </para></quote><para>As we now know, in this moral dilemma the archbishop chose to act on economic and legally prudent grounds rather than to show compassion to the child victims of abuse. Not only that, he chose to cover up the abuse for as long as he possibly could. He also chose, long after the abuse was admitted by the perpetrator and the church, to try to cast doubts on the veracity of the victims' evidence. He said on <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> in relation to this matter:</para><motion><para>That's deeply regrettable and I'm very sorry about it, and we'd have to say if that's what happened, it was wrong.</para></motion><para>I want to stress the phrase `if that's what happened'. That is a key phrase. Dr Hollingworth, at the point of saying that, knew of the cover-up, and he knew it long before he made that statement.</para><para>Concerning his support of a priest who had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl, Dr Hollingworth again resorted to blaming the child victim, saying:</para><quote><para>My belief is that this was not sex abuse. There was no suggestion of rape or anything like that. Quite the contrary, my information is that it was, rather, the other way around.</para></quote><para>Whilst the motion we are currently debating relates to the findings of the Aspinall report, and the rape allegations are separate and not raised as part of my argument for his removal, I cannot help but observe that Dr Hollingworth persists in making inappropriate comments and reflections about women and child victims. For example, in his recent statement concerning rape allegations, while carefully concentrated on his mindfulness of the integrity and dignity of his own office and position, he refers each time to `Annie' Jarmyn. Dr Hollingworth does not even afford her the dignity of her title, which is Mrs Jarmyn.</para><para>The problem with the Governor-General appears to be that he is so impressed with his own high status and his determination to defend himself that he forgets his duty of care to those who cannot act in their own defence. Did he think that high office offered some sort of shield against accountability? Did he think that high office somehow excused him from moral weakness? I think it is really interesting to reflect that the executive power of the Commonwealth vested in the Queen, which may be exercised by the Governor-General, includes the power to pardon offenders. It is an aspect of the prerogative of mercy. By convention, the prerogative is exercised by the Governor-General on advice from ministers or by ministers or other officials so authorised by the Governor-General. It crossed my mind to ask this question: is it conceivable that, should the Governor-General himself be found guilty of an offence, either formally or more informally—as I think he is being judged by the Australian people in relation to the Aspinall report—a friendly minister or official could assist him in being pardoned?</para><para>But I digress. The issue here is that the Governor-General's old-world and sexist attitudes are reminiscent of those countries or periods where the testimony of any woman or child is weighted as lesser than that of a man. Not only has he not defended, or sought justice for, victims of sexual abuse and child abuse but by his own actions and omissions and by his statements he has added immeasurably to their sufferings. He is not worthy to hold the office of Governor-General. He should not be collecting his salary. The Prime Minister of this country should be ashamed that he did not force Dr Hollingworth's resignation upon the release of the Aspinall report. So we find ourselves debating this motion which calls on the Prime Minister to take that action. I urge all senators to do what is morally right and support this motion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11189</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to provide my contribution to the debate on the motion that has been moved by us and some of the minor parties in the Senate in relation to the Governor-General. At the outset I have to say that sometimes in these positions you are honoured to be part of history and history making events, but the fact that the Senate has had to deal with this matter and is debating this issue is perhaps not one of the proudest moments we will all remember. In fact, I find it quite embarrassing. It is a shame that it has come to the stage where we feel compelled in this chamber to debate the actions and the position of Governor-General and to continue to raise awareness of the inappropriateness of not only the situation we find ourselves in but also the unfortunate situation of the person currently holding that position.</para></talk.start><para>As I look back at the work that Sir William Deane undertook in the role of Governor-General, I have to agree with one of my colleagues who made the comment yesterday that, during that time, that person actually value-added to the role in a way that exemplified the position in this country. There is a little bit of me that says that in some ways it was the way in which Sir William Deane undertook his responsibilities with such dignity and honour that made it very hard for us to push our point during the 1999 debate on the republic, because we had a person who was upholding the position of Governor-General so well.</para><para>I think this whole matter has refocused the agenda on the republic debate in which this country has been embroiled over the last decade or so. It is that aspect that I want to emphasise in my comments on the record today. We know that in 1999 monarchists campaigned hard and fast that there was no reason to become a republic. They campaigned on the slogan: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The reference to `if it ain't broke' meant the system, and particularly the system of appointing Australia's head of state to represent the Queen in this country. You would have to say that recent occurrences clearly illustrate that this system is broken—it is severely broken. Some might even say it has got to the point where it is shattered and that it certainly does need fixing and addressing.</para><para>This is not opportunistic nor is it contrived; it is simply a recognition of the fact that our current system is undemocratic, and recent events of the last few months have highlighted that it is in crisis. I would have to say that, thank goodness, the general public are becoming aware of the issues. They are becoming much more aware of how we appoint the Governor-General and, even more so, of how difficult it is to remove a person who is no longer appropriate as holder of that office. As Peter Costello recently stated:</para><quote><para>It's not a cabinet, it's not a parliamentary, it's a personal appointment. And similarly, the dismissal of a Governor-General is solely on the advice of the PM rendered to the Queen.</para></quote><para>The whole situation surrounding Dr Hollingworth has shown the complete inadequacy of a system in which only two people—the Prime Minister and the Queen—are empowered to appoint and, what is more, to remove Australia's Governor-General, without any parliamentary debate and without any public explanation or discussion—or scrutiny, for that matter. This system is foreign to this country; this system is closed to scrutiny, it lacks accountability and we have seen that it certainly lacks any form of transparency. It is inadequate and undemocratic and should be changed to avoid a recurrence of the current situation.</para><para>We know that criticism of the current Governor-General is widespread and includes criticism from those concerned with countering child abuse, the victims of child abuse and those supporting the separation of church and state. Republican opinion is neither more nor or less critical of Dr Hollingworth as an individual than is that of other Australians. The Republican Movement has to date, in the articles I have read, deliberately chosen not to rush into the debate due to its vested and obvious interest in replacing the Governor-General, who represents Australia's head of state, the Queen, with an Australian head of state. Given the republicans' particular interest in the position of Governor-General—it has been well known now for more than a decade—and the expansion of the debate to include the wider issue, it now does seem appropriate that the ARM make a contribution to this debate. </para><para>Republicans are more concerned about the system than the individuals within it. This current system is not good enough for a modern, independent and democratic country, such as Australia. The solution to a crisis in our constitutional arrangements should not be subject to the personal and political judgments of one person alone—the Prime Minister. We currently have a situation where the general public have voiced their concern and have said that the current person holding the position of Governor-General should be removed. However, only the Prime Minister has the power to do this, and he has stated that he has no intention of carrying out the wishes of the Australian people in this respect. So there is no other avenue to be taken.</para><para>Subsequently, the Governor-General, who was hand-picked by this Prime Minister and who was never the subject of parliamentary debate, now finds himself the subject of public attacks, accusations and protests. Such actions can do no less than severely damage the office of the Governor-General. The unfortunate circumstances surrounding the Governor-General have reduced the position of the Queen's representative to one that is subject to the personal and political imperatives of the Prime Minister. In the face of declining political and public confidence, the Governor-General is now completely reliant on the Prime Minister's support.</para><para>For the record, I want to correct some assumptions and assertions made by the government in this debate. In particular, yesterday Senator Eric Abetz made a contribution in his speech about the current rape allegations and the suppression order granted by the courts in relation to the victim. Of course, it is not unusual that victims making rape allegations are granted a suppression order—it is a normal course of action to protect the victim in every manner possible. It was alleged by this government that the suppression order was requested by the victim and that it was in fact the only suppression order around at the time. My understanding is that that is not correct and that there was in fact a second suppression order, requested by the Governor-General in collusion with the Prime Minister, which was also granted by the courts. So we have a Governor-General who is absolutely reliant on this Prime Minister to protect his position and to protect him personally. Unfortunately, I think we also have a Governor-General who, in trying to defend his current position in recent months, has clearly not understood the distinction between holding a position of power in this country and what that means when you speak publicly about an issue, and that each and every time you make a comment about that issue—in this case, child abuse and child sexual abuse—it has implications. Many of my colleagues have commented about the inappropriateness of his comments, but I personally believe it is unfortunate that Dr Hollingworth sees no connection between his comments, the office he holds and the severe impact his actions are having on those victims in the wider community. That is one of the very sad things about this whole affair. </para><para>The motion moved by Labor acknowledges the circumstances in which the Governor-General's suitability to his position has been seriously questioned. The government's failure to even respond to the evidence of sexual abuse of children in Australian institutions continues, despite this now becoming a major national issue once again. This government does not take the issue of sexual assault as seriously as it should. It is not taking any action to address the issue. In fact, even on Tuesday in question time in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister ruled out a royal commission. He cited the reason as being that he would rather spend the $8 million or $10 million a royal commission would cost on assisting children who are victims of abuse or sexual assault. And yet that very night this government handed down a budget that allocated only $4 million to preventing child abuse. That $4 million has remained a constant amount over many years without any increase and without any new initiatives in it.</para><para>There are too many cases, substantiated or not, of child sexual abuse in Australia. It is an ongoing problem that severely affects people for the duration of their lives, and probably for the duration of the lives of the people around them. The least the Australian government can do is accept that this is a significant problem and seriously consider the proposal of a royal commission. This Governor-General has been found by the Diocesan Board of Inquiry to have handled a situation involving child sexual abuse inappropriately. The public have also been dissatisfied with his reaction to and handling of allegations, and with the wider issue of sexual abuse in religious institutions. Dr Hollingworth's failure to respond appropriately to the abusers and their victims casts the initial doubt—and a valid doubt, I might add—on his ability to fulfil the office of Governor-General.</para><para>The motion also acknowledges the failure of the Australian Constitution to set out any criteria for the dismissal of a Governor-General, or a fair process by which this can be achieved. This is a clear indication, illustrated by the current situation, that this system is broken. And it needs a democratic solution. Before Australia again considers becoming a republic, there is an opportunity now to democratise the process of selecting a Governor-General in the future. Many have suggested that the federal government follow the lead of the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie. The Labor Premier has announced that the process employed to appoint Queensland's new Governor would involve the general public being asked to nominate people for him to consider, with the Premier's choice then being put to the Queensland parliament to debate. In the event that the current Governor-General either resigns or is asked to resign, perhaps that is a path that could be considered by this government in looking at his replacement. While Peter Beattie is a republican, I believe his reforms are of no consequence to that issue. The Premier is about putting in place a democratic process to appoint the Queen's representative of his state, and is reasoning that should be favourable to most people. It is certainly an improvement on the current system, where a single person gets to choose that representative without any scrutiny or accountability.</para><para>There is no reason to wait for a republic to change the system. The Queen is bound to follow the advice of the Prime Minister, and whether that advice is based on the Prime Minister's own decision or one reached by a more democratic process does not matter. Not only would the process be more democratic; the position of the head of state would be much stronger. That person would then be in a position which would or should enjoy the confidence of the Australian public. </para><para>We need to deal with the fact that under the current system there is a real chance that a similar situation may well occur again. Although the Governor-General has indicated that he may step aside, if he chooses not to resign and the Prime Minister continues to stand by him, there is no mechanism for this remedy. The office of the Governor-General will remain in the media and will continue to be severely damaged.</para><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 9 May this year, the current convenor of the Australian Republican Movement, Professor John Warhurst, had this to say:</para><quote><para>Such a system is plainly not good enough for a modern, independent and democratic country such as Australia. The solution to a crisis in our constitutional arrangements should not be subject to the personal and political judgments of the Prime Minister alone. The system for appointing and removing a Governor-General is undemocratic and inadequate. The system is broken and it is time to fix it.</para></quote><para>Let us hope that this government realises that this is an opportune time to do that, and that this is a time to actually listen to the voice of the people in this country and to elevate to the position of Governor-General a person who holds the respect of everybody in this country and who unites everybody in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11192</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset in this discussion I need to make it plain that the motion we are debating relates to the actions of Peter Hollingworth in his capacity as the Archbishop of Brisbane and more recently in his role as Governor-General. This motion in no way relates to the allegations raised last week. Those matters will be dealt with appropriately in the Victorian Supreme Court and they have no bearing on the substance of this motion. In that matter, Peter Hollingworth deserves what all Australians in a similar position would deserve, and that is the presumption of innocence.</para></talk.start><para>The motion we are debating today relates to the actions, and lack of action, of Peter Hollingworth during the 1990s when he was the Archbishop of the diocese of Brisbane, which have been reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Report of the board of inquiry into past handling of complaints of sexual abuse in the Anglican Church diocese of Brisbane</inline>. At this point, I commend Archbishop Aspinall on his handling of these issues in first setting up the inquiry, I think with the intent of finding some measure of justice that the victims of sexual abuse could receive. I also commend Mr Peter O'Callaghan QC and Professor Freda Briggs on their report. It is extensive and thorough and it contains tragic stories of abuse of an ongoing nature of families and children who will take many years to recover, if ever, from the hurt that has been perpetrated upon them. The report will assist in some way in the healing that those victims need to undertake.</para><para>I also take this opportunity to commend Peter Beattie on his handling of the request from Archbishop Aspinall for the tabling of the report. As we know, the same request was made of the Prime Minister, but it was the Premier of Queensland who showed his consideration for the church and, more importantly, for the victims of abuse and who allowed that report to be tabled. He encouraged people to read the report and I do too. It is not nice reading but, as I said, it will help those victims to recover.</para><para>Two matters in the report deal with Peter Hollingworth. Complaint No. 3 relates to a now retired bishop, Mr Donald Shearman, and his relationship over many years with a parishioner. Without going into the detail of the matter, the board identified that Peter Hollingworth should have found a way in which he could have conveyed his disapproval of the conduct of Mr Shearman to the complainant. Peter Hollingworth's behaviour read to me as being dismissive of the woman's legitimate concerns and hurt. He was protecting the interests of his colleague over the interests of the parishioner. In any analysis, he supported the powerful over the powerless. </para><para>Complaint No. 5 details the matters relating to John Elliot, formerly the bursar of an Anglican grammar school and later a priest. John Elliot is currently in jail for his criminal abuse of children. When Peter Hollingworth was advised of the abuse, by the parents of a child who was abused by Elliot, he took the view that Elliot could continue in the ministry with a set of extraordinary conditions. These conditions were that he avoided situations involving children and young people and that he be supervised by his wife. I find that the most astonishing thing in the report, that Peter Hollingworth could have told a minister and his wife that it was her job to ensure that this did not happen again. That is not an acceptable form of management of an abuser.</para><para>Peter Hollingworth told the board through his solicitors that his understanding was that the event was an isolated incident. There is no support from the board for this position. The board politely said that his recollections were faulty and that he had reconstructed rather than recalled what was told to him. The board took the view that he was aware that there was repeated and ongoing abuse and the board took the view that Peter Hollingworth knew that. That being said, an isolated criminal act remains just that—a criminal act. In my mind, it is no defence to suggest that only one event allows for a pardon of the crime. I do not understand why at this point Peter Hollingworth did not refer the matter to the police. He was aware of an abuse of a child. Why did he not take the action to refer the matter at that point to the police? He was in a position of power with knowledge of allegations and he did not act. This is more than an error of judgment; this is maladministration. This is an abrogation of responsibility. It was the protection of the church over the need for the protection of children. Once again it was the defence of the powerful over the defence of the powerless. The board rightly concluded that Peter Hollingworth's decision in this matter was untenable.</para><para>It is also untenable that a person who has acted in this way should hold the highest office in our country. What message does it send to the community if the person who holds that office has acted in that way: that a person who has not responded to a call from the families of children who were victims of sexual abuse should remain in a position of trust, leadership and respect? Australians expect that the person who holds the position of Governor-General should be above challenge, should be dignified and should be in a position to show leadership on all matters. </para><para>Peter Hollingworth through his actions, which have been laid out in the report, has left himself and, more importantly in my mind, the office of Governor-General open to criticism. It is not tenable to allow that criticism to continue. It is not tenable for Peter Hollingworth to remain in that position. What message is sent to the victims of the abuse detailed in the report when they know that the person whom they looked to for support, and who did not provide it, can continue in that position of trust without any reprimand and with no consequence? The Prime Minister's actions in defending the Governor-General confirm support for Peter Hollingworth's actions in the 1990s in Brisbane. Also, what does it say to those in the community who are victims of child sexual abuse but who have not had the courage to speak out—those whom we try to support and want to encourage? What does it say to those people when child support agencies ask them to speak out and yet the person who holds the highest office in the land has not responded to people in a similar position? </para><para>A sexually abused child goes through an incredibly traumatic experience with the secrecy and the silence that follows the abuse. This adds to the emotional trauma of the child. The greatest fear that victims of sexual abuse have is that, if they tell someone about what has happened to them, it will not to be taken seriously or the information that is provided to that trusted one will not be acted on. It takes a great deal of courage for victims to speak out. As a community we have a responsibility to encourage those victims of abuse to come forward and to feel secure that what they say will be treated with respect and that their allegations will be investigated. </para><para>The Prime Minister's action in not dismissing the Governor-General—implicitly condoning Peter Hollingworth's actions—directly discourages those abused children from speaking out because it reinforces their fear that they will not be believed. This raises the issue of why the Prime Minister left it until last Sunday to act to protect the office of the Governor-General. In my view, it was not as a result of the airing of the allegations of rape that have surfaced. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that he had been aware of these allegations for over six months. People will have to make up their own minds as to why it took the Prime Minister so long to react to the community outrage that Peter Hollingworth was not removed from the position of Governor-General.</para><para>The Labor Party has continued to raise these issues for over a year. People will ask why—and there have been lots of assertions from the other side of the chamber about why—we have continued to raise these concerns. The reason is twofold. Firstly, it is out of respect for the office of Governor-General. Even though most of us on this side are republicans, we acknowledge that the office of Governor-General needs to be a respected and a dignified position. Secondly, it is the need for a consistent message around the issues of child sexual abuse. If Peter Hollingworth does not stand down, it is incumbent upon the Prime Minister to remove him.</para><para>As Senator Crossin said earlier, this is not a debate about republicanism or whether Australia should remain a monarchy, but it does raise the need for scrutiny of the appointment of the Governor-General. I believe that the appointment should not be left to the Prime Minister alone. The appointment should not be a surprise. I commend Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, for starting the debate in his state. On 11 March 2003, at the appointment of the new Governor of Queensland, Ms Quentin Bryce AO, Peter Beattie took the opportunity to bring the appointment to the chamber for debate. In his speech on the motion relating to the appointment he said that what he was proposing to do was:</para><quote><para>... a tentative step to involve the people in the selection of the Governor ...</para></quote><para>He said:</para><quote><para>The first stage in this process is to place this appointment before the people's forum—that is, the parliament—so that elected members have the opportunity of giving the decision parliamentary recognition.</para></quote><para>In his words it is tentative. Yes, it is at the first stage, but it does provide an opportunity for there to be scrutiny of the appointments of governors-general and governors. Peter Beattie also said that in the future he would invite Queenslanders to recommend suitable individuals to become the Governor of Queensland. He said that he would seek the views of the community. He said:</para><quote><para>... but I hope that when the people want to nominate they will be able to indicate to the Premier of the day that they are interested in the position. </para></quote><para>This provides community involvement and participation in the appointment of a governor. Finally, I acknowledge that Peter Hollingworth will be suffering and I acknowledge that his wife is ill. But I ask this chamber to think first of the children who have been hurt through this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11195</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I only have brief comments to make on this issue of the Governor-General. It is an issue that I believe warrants all of us making a contribution because of the gravity of what we are discussing. It gives me a degree of pleasure to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. The Governor-General's role is outlined on his web site, which states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Possibly the most important role of the Governor-General, as the office has evolved over the years, is to encourage, articulate and represent those things that unite Australians as a nation.</para></quote><para>I think we need to reflect on the words `to encourage, articulate and represent those things that unite Australians as a nation'. During the past week and previously during Dr Hollingworth's term as Governor-General, we have witnessed controversy surrounding his handling of child sexual abuse claims, and now there are allegations of rape. That is an issue that I will not pursue beyond this point, because it is a matter that is before the courts and I do not think we are in a position to cast opinions or views on that.</para><para>The child sexual abuse claims are really serious issues that have created absolute tumult for Dr Hollingworth's position as Governor-General and, more importantly, the Australian public's perceptions of the role of Governor-General of Australia, as outlined on the Governor-General's web site, `to encourage, articulate and represent those things that unite Australians as a nation'. This Governor-General's past has unsettled this unity and his representation of this unity among Australians as a nation. It has touched all Australians because it revolves around abuse of children. It has brought into question in a very real way the role and the relevance of the office of Governor-General.</para><para>I am a republican and I am proud of that. I would have dearly loved to see a change at the last referendum, but it did not occur. That means we still have the office of Governor-General. As an Australian, I believe that I and all others should see that as a role of great importance. We should be able to respect that role in the right way but this Governor-General, aided I have to say by the Prime Minister, has brought that role of leading the Australian people into disrepute. Last year Dr Hollingworth's comments during the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Story</inline> television interview severely compromised his public standing, and much has been said about that during this debate. During that interview Dr Hollingworth was quoted as saying on the child abuse case:</para><quote><para>... this was not sex abuse. There was no suggestion of rape or anything like that. Quite the contrary, my information is that it was, rather, the other way around.</para></quote><para>As a Christian, I expect my priests, my bishops and my archbishops to be above reproach when it comes to their dealings with individual human beings. I believe that as a representative of his church Dr Hollingworth, rather than being a protector of the innocent, has been a protector of the guilty—as has been demonstrated widely during this debate and in the evidence before the Australian public—and that is offensive to those who seek to hold their pastoral leaders in high esteem.</para><para>It is clear that following <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Story</inline> being aired on television many in Australia believed that Dr Hollingworth was indeed defending child sexual abuse. I do not know if that was what he was trying to convey. I do not know if he did not articulate his position clearly. But what is abundantly clear is the perception that Australia has been left with, and the results of the Anglican Church's report—the Aspinall report, as it is referred to—have tended to confirm the perception of the Australian people as to what Dr Hollingworth was seen to be articulating. That has made his position as Governor-General, his position as head of state of the Australian people, completely untenable. </para><para>The Aspinall report found that Dr Hollingworth had acted unreasonably in his handling of a sexual abuse complaint when he was the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane. The head of the Anglican Church in Brisbane, their prime pastoral care person, had been found by his peers to unreasonably have handled sexual abuse complaints. It was said that Dr Hollingworth acted unreasonably and his recollections of the case were faulty. If a worker of any nature acts unreasonably or an employer acts unreasonably towards a worker, then the industrial commission would either terminate a person's employment or support the employer for that termination. The arbitrator in this situation has been the Prime Minister, and he has not taken reasonableness or unreasonableness into account. I do not believe that this is good for the future office of Governor-General.</para><para>Strangely, the Prime Minister has attacked the report, saying that Dr Hollingworth has disputed some of its findings and has received legal advice that it denied him natural justice. This is a time when the Prime Minister should have refrained from comment and given wise counsel to the Governor-General to take action to remove the unwarranted and unneeded attention from this high office. Dr Hollingworth himself has not made this complaint. On the contrary, he conceded that he had made an error of judgment as archbishop—an error of judgment. That error of judgment should have been the very trigger for the Governor-General to step aside or resign his position to save the office of Governor-General from falling to a low position in the perception of the Australian people and indeed the international community. </para><para>Dr Phillip Aspinall from the independent inquiry had admitted to encountering difficulties setting up an inquiry into the Brisbane diocese's handling of sexual abuse complaints in the past. He also stated a personal belief that a royal commission into these matters would provide the best outcome. Indeed, the motion before the Senate at the moment is asking for the Prime Minister to establish such a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Australia. It is my belief that that royal commission would indeed uncover the real gravity of the problem in Australia. I believe it goes far beyond church involvement, but it would take a royal commission to flush out the full extent of sexual abuse in this country. The proposal, of course, has been rejected by the Prime Minister. It is my belief that, if the Prime Minister last year had either urged the Governor-General to resign or advised the Queen to dismiss him, the harm that has now been done would not have had this detrimental effect on our highest office. Even as a republican I say that the Governor-General is head of state and deserves the ultimate respect of all Australians.</para><para>Also during the interview with <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline>, Dr Hollingworth described himself as a Christian and as a Christian leader. The real issue is that, as a man of the cloth, Dr Hollingworth should be exercising humility in order to preserve the reputation of the highest office in Australia. He should have been stepping aside—of course he has now—but he should have resigned his position for the sake of upholding and preserving the reputation of this high office. He should have shown humility. He should have shown a modest sense of one's own significance by taking action to relieve pressure on the office of Governor-General. It is the quality of being humble—to have a modest sense of one's own significance—that we need to take heed of. Not only as a man of the cloth but as an eminent Australian, Dr Hollingworth should show a modest sense of his own significance in the scheme of things when the abuse of children is at the heart of the matter and when the reputation of our highest office is suffering as a consequence. There could be no denying that the Governor-General would inwardly be suffering immense self-doubt and turmoil; it would be affecting his wife, who herself is not well. My prayers go to both of them that they can work through this but show humility and good grace. Sadly, we are not seeing humility being displayed but a display of arrogance by not only Dr Hollingworth but also the Prime Minister, who supports him. I quote B.J. Gupta: </para><quote><para>God, give me courage to do what I can, humility to admit what I can't, and wisdom to know the difference.</para></quote><para>There is a great deal of wisdom missing in this whole episode that has sadly brought into disrepute the person we should be referring to as Australia's No. 1 citizen. There is no humility being shown; there is an absolute lack of wisdom and there is not courage on the part of the Prime Minister or Dr Hollingworth, and that concerns me greatly.</para><para>What concerns me above all—and this is my closing point—is that it is not adults, who have the full facility to defend themselves mentally and physically against abuses, who have been abused in this case; it is children. Those in this chamber who are parents would know that we have great feeling to protect our children and protect those children that we come in contact with at all times. This is a case that goes to the very heart of our society—the protection of our young.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>11197</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this motion, which I do not support. If listeners wanted to understand the poverty of the thinking that has gone into this by the Labor Party they could do no better than read the speech that Senator Buckland has just delivered. Let me make a couple of points. It is not lacking in courage to defend your reputation. Any man, no matter how low or how powerful, is entitled to defend his good name. A person is clearly entitled to do that. The crocodile tears that you shed, Senator Buckland, for the Governor-General were, to me, an exercise in hypocrisy. The Labor Party has attempted through this motion and through various actions to continue not only to besmirch the office of the Governor-General but also to put enormous pressure on this person during a period which is personally a very difficult time for him. It is not arrogance to defend yourself. It is cowardly, I believe, to use this chamber, as it is so often used, to besmirch and traduce the reputation of an individual. </para></talk.start><para>I believe that one of the motivating forces behind this is an attempt by the Labor Party to divert public attention from their own massive internal divisions. This is a bitterly divided party. This is a party which is in desperate search of a leader that they hope will lead them out of the wilderness that they have propelled themselves into through their own incompetence and lack of ability to develop policies that can connect with the Australian people. This is in many ways a stunt which is poorly thought out by the Labor Party. The consequences have not been thought out carefully. If you go to this motion you find that the Labor Party itself is bitterly divided on whether there should be a royal commission into child sexual abuse. Premier Beattie is out there stomping the platform saying that there should be, and Premier Carr is out there saying that there should not be. State governments have the prime responsibility in the area of child protection. The divisions that have so racked the Labor Party can be seen even in this motion that they bring before us. </para><para>All of us deplore the crime of child sexual abuse. It is a repellent crime. The perpetrators of child sexual abuse should be severely punished and it is a very serious issue. It is an issue which I think the community for too many years has swept under the carpet and pretended did not exist. In recent years there has been a very important change in community culture regarding child sexual abuse. It is an issue which now is, quite appropriately I think, more freely discussed. On that basis one can always hope that continuing action will be taken in this area. But I do agree with my colleague Senator Alston when he stated that a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Australia is not necessary. An enormous amount of evidence indicating the nature and extent of the problem already exists. The real issue before us is to develop solutions to tackle this problem. The solution to controlling child sexual abuse does not lie in petty partisan politics, the type we have seen so often during this debate; it lies in governments taking real actions. In particular, one will look very closely at what state governments are doing in this area. My colleagues have outlined the sorts of programs that the federal government is doing. The state governments, I regret to say, too often talk about these issues, attempt to pass responsibility to others and are too loath to take action.</para><para>I want to make three or four points about the debate on the Governor-General. Firstly, I am appalled by the vicious nature of so many of the attacks on Dr Hollingworth. The Governor-General is entitled to a presumption of innocence. I thought that <inline font-style="italic">Time </inline>magazine summed up rather well the public debate that has so often surrounded this issue when it said:</para><quote><para>Millions of words, petitions, a crescendo of vile accusations. Decades of service to the poor and underprivileged submerged beneath the vulgar speculation of strangers. It is difficult to imagine what misery Australia's Governor-General has suffered in recent months ...</para></quote><para>Even a Governor-General can make mistakes. Governor-Generals do make mistakes. Dr Hollingworth has admitted serious error. But that does not, I believe, automatically lead to a Prime Minister withdrawing his commission. We see little compassion or charity in this debate, despite the fact that these words were used by the previous Labor speaker.</para><para>Secondly, I think it is worth while to look at the career and achievements of Dr Hollingworth. Over his career I believe he has made a very significant contribution to many of the most disadvantaged people in this country through his work at the Brotherhood of St Laurence. In all of this debate there is no recognition at all from Labor speakers of the contribution that Dr Hollingworth has made over so many years to highlight the issue of poverty in this country and to highlight the needs of the disadvantaged in this community. To traduce a reputation in the way in which it has been done by so many Labor speakers without the recognition of what this man has achieved is most unfortunate. It certainly lacks the charity that Senator Buckland urged the Senate to look at and to apply to Dr Hollingworth.</para><para>Dr Hollingworth, I might say, was never a particular friend of mine over the years. In some of his debates he was very critical of a group of people that he referred to as the `New Right'. Sometimes I was included in that group and, I might say, I was very pleased to be included in that group. I do not speak from a basis of being immune from these debates which Dr Hollingworth led. Nonetheless, Dr Hollingworth reflected his passion and concern for, and his commitment to, the disadvantaged in this country and I think that we should all be prepared to give credit for that work. </para><para>Thirdly, Dr Hollingworth and his family have had to endure some of the most vicious attacks on an individual over a sustained period of time that I have seen. Public life does produce this. But I think that if one surveyed the press and the electronic media over recent months—and, indeed, stretching even further back than that—one can see the sorts of press attacks that Dr Hollingworth and his family have had to endure. We are speaking about courage, Senator Buckland. Let me put it this way: in the face of these attacks I admire the courage of Dr Hollingworth, his wife Ann, and his children Deborah, Fiona and Sarah, for the courage they have shown in the face of what are some of the nastiest attacks that I have seen in public life. I would hope that, if Dr Hollingworth reads the transcript of this debate, he would see that I speak not only for myself but for many Australians who are equally appalled by what they have read. There has been a lack of charity, compassion and understanding shown for a man who has had to deal with difficult problems and who, himself, has admitted error. I am afraid that this whole debate in many ways reflects this continuing attack on an individual.</para><para>Fourthly—and this brings me to my final point—I think that when historians look back on this period they will look back with some amazement. They will note that Dr Hollingworth had done nothing wrong as Governor-General that could have led to his resignation or sacking. They will note a church report about a very serious issue but they will note that in the preparation of that report Dr Hollingworth was not given the chance to respond, that natural justice seemed to have been denied. They will note that, rather than giving Dr Hollingworth a chance to put his views, this report was tabled in parliament under the protection of parliament and that of course has led to a further series of attacks and to this motion today.</para><para>No-one in this chamber doubts the problems of sexual abuse. No-one doubts that these matters were not handled well in the past. No-one doubts that the community as a whole, and individuals, must do what they can to take action to deal with this serious issue. But that does not lead to a motion of the nature that we have before us in this chamber. It does not lead to the sorts of vicious attacks on Dr Hollingworth and his family—the sorts of attacks that the Labor Party is so good at. I will not be supporting the motion that the Labor Party has proposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11199</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I introduced this motion, I stated that it was unprecedented for the Senate to call for the removal of a Governor-General. Of course, it should never have come to this. There should be no need for this motion. Well before now, Dr Hollingworth should have resigned or had his commission withdrawn. We must be absolutely clear that the issue of the appointment and removal of a Governor-General is a matter for the Prime Minister and the executive government. It is the Prime Minister and the executive government that have to take responsibility in a crisis like this. The Senate should never have needed to debate the suitability of someone in such high office—an office that should be above controversy and reproach.</para></talk.start><para>But the facts speak for themselves, and they are starkly outlined in the motion before the Senate. It is untenable for Dr Hollingworth to remain as Governor-General of Australia. His actions as Archbishop of Brisbane and as Governor-General have brought the high office of Governor-General into disrepute. There is a way forward. It is time to deal with the injustices of the past. It is time for the Prime Minister to establish a royal commission into child sexual abuse. It is also time to protect the dignity of the office of Governor-General. The Governor-General should act; he should resign. If he does not, the Prime Minister has no alternative but to remove him. The Governor-General has to go. I urge the Senate to support this motion. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Murphy be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Faulkner be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Original question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—I would like to ensure that it is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that government senators voted `no' when the question on that motion was put.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator Harris</name></talker><para>—I would like it recorded that One Nation supports paragraph (a)(ii) of the motion moved by Senator Faulkner, relating to the Governor-General, but does not support the remainder of the motion.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11200</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note that the government did not even call for a division on a motion about which they allegedly hold such strong views.

The purpose of the bill is to address the consequences of the withdrawal of terrorism cover in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on September 11 2001. Soon after those shocking events, financial institutions and commercial property owners in Australia began making representations to the government and the opposition, saying that the market was failing to provide the cover they required. The banks warned that the provision of credit for major projects was in jeopardy. Such financing usually involves the taking of security over the property. Such financing needs to be addressed. The banks stated that, if that property were destroyed and there was no terrorism cover, they would experience substantial losses. Owners of commercial properties, including superannuation funds, also cautioned that they would suffer massive losses in the event of an attack. The lack of appropriate cover has also caused concern for the owners and operators of essential public infrastructure, such as power stations.</para></talk.start><para>The bill implements the legislative elements of the government's scheme to address these problems that was announced in October last year. The bill involves two substantive elements. Firstly, it establishes a mechanism to ensure that insurance companies provide terrorism cover in specified circumstances. Clause 8 of the bill overrides clauses in eligible insurance contracts which exclude liability arising from terrorist incidents which are declared by the Treasurer. Eligible insurance contracts are essentially contracts to provide insurance cover for loss or damage to building and other tangible property located in Australia. It also includes cover for losses arising from business interruption caused by property damage and cover for public liability that arises from being the owner or occupier of property. The definition of `eligible insurance contract' will be refined by regulation but is essentially intended to capture commercial property and privately owned infrastructure.</para><para>The second key element of the bill is that it establishes the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, the ARPC. Under the government's scheme, insurance companies will have the ability but not the obligation to reinsure their liability to provide cover for terrorism losses with the new ARPC. Many of the details governing the operation of this scheme will be set out in the direction that will be made by the Treasurer. The ARPC, under direction from the Treasurer, would set premiums payable by insurers for reinsurance contracts. The government has indicated that reinsurance premiums payable by insurers would vary between two per cent and 12 per cent of the underlying commercial property premium based on risk and location. CBD property will be subject to higher rates.</para><para>Premium income will be used to build the reinsurance pool to something in the order of $300 million. This element of the scheme is known as pre-funding. It is estimated premiums will need to be levied for three years to capitalise the pool. In the event of an incident, the insurance industry would be required to bear the first $10 million in losses, with a maximum exposure of $1 million per company or four per cent of the gross fire/industrial special risk premium before having recourse to the reinsurance pool. In the event that losses from an incident exceed the resources of the pool, up to $10 billion is available through a commercial loan and government indemnity. These amounts can be recovered through increased premiums after a terrorist attack. The scheme is expressed to be temporary and is subject to review every three years.</para><para>Labor was concerned about a number of elements of the government's scheme and therefore asked the Senate to refer the bill for inquiry by the Economics Legislation Committee. The committee heard evidence of widespread market failure. While no witness was able to provide an example of a project that had been delayed or abandoned as a result of a lack of terrorism cover, there was evidence that financial institutions and property owners are faced with uncomfortably large exposures. It is clear that there is the potential for losses that could have a devastating impact on investment, employment and economic growth. </para><para>There is currently some terrorism cover available in the marketplace. It is, however, very expensive and narrow in scope. In the case of one CBD building, the Australian Bankers Association reported that the inclusion of terrorism cover increased the premium by 450 per cent. Even then the policy only covered a third of the property's value. The Property Council described the cover that is available as `Clayton's cover'. It reported that exclusions meant that policyholders could not obtain cover for chemical or biological attacks and that policies typically covered only 25 per cent of asset value. Labor accepts that there has been market failure. The key issue for us and for several organisations that gave evidence to the committee inquiry is whether this scheme is the right solution to the problem.</para><para>It is important to note that the government did not start the process of developing this scheme with a blank sheet of paper. In May 2002 the Treasurer laid down conditions for government intervention. Most significantly, these included that any scheme must, firstly, maintain private sector involvement in the provision of terrorism cover and, secondly, allow for the re-emergence of a commercial market for terrorism cover. These considerations have fundamentally restricted the range of options that could have been considered in developing the scheme.</para><para>Unlike the government, Labor is not overly optimistic that a commercial market for terrorism cover will return. It is true that insurers did provide terrorism cover prior to September 11 2001. However, at that time terrorism risk was widely regarded as negligible in Australia. Indeed, it is likely that some insurers may not have explicitly priced for it, as the probability of an event and its impact was in fact too difficult to estimate. In their submission to the Senate Economics Committee, IAG, Australia's largest general insurer, argued:</para><quote><para>... the probability and severity of losses from a terrorism event/s are not calculable in advance and therefore unsuitable for insurance or, indeed, pre-funding ...</para></quote><para>The Insurance Council of Australia also agreed that the difficulty in pricing exposure meant that a commercial market for terrorism cover was in fact unlikely to re-emerge. Labor believes that such considerations do lend support to a post-funded model where a levy would be imposed on insurance premiums after a terrorist event. A post-funded scheme does have a number of attractions. Firstly, the community, which is already suffering under the weight of high premiums following the collapse of HIH and the current hard insurance market, does not incur any cost if, as we all hope, there is not a terrorist incident in this country. Secondly, it also avoids the administrative costs of establishing a pre-funded scheme for both the insurance industry and the Commonwealth. Thirdly, in the event that an incident occurs, the amount of money that needs to be allocated is certain and ascertainable.</para><para>Submissions from the Insurance Australia Group and the Western Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet both endorsed a post-funded model. A post-funded model is already employed or proposed in a number of similar contexts. For example, under superannuation legislation a levy may be imposed on superannuation funds where a fund suffers substantial losses as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. Support for post-funding can also be found in the report of the HIH royal commission. Commissioner Owen recommended the establishment of a policyholder protection scheme in the event of insurance company failure. His Honour stated that funding for this scheme should be provided through a post-event levy on all licensed insurers. This is a recommendation that the Treasurer has in fact already endorsed. Why should a different model be pursued for terrorism cover? </para><para>Supporters of the government's scheme argue that it provides business with greater certainty and ensures that funds can quickly be paid out in the event of a terrorist incident. It is clear, however, that after nearly 20 months of uncertainty a major factor for the banks and commercial property owners is a desire to see a solution in place as soon as possible. They know that the government has done very little work on a post-funded scheme and that the rejection of this bill would involve a lengthy delay in the development of a new proposal. Labor understands their frustration with the slow pace at which the government has moved on this issue. Labor is extremely disappointed that the government did not explore a post-funded option more fully. Nevertheless, given the exposure being faced by entities that need terrorism cover, Labor is reluctantly prepared to support the government's scheme in order to bring certainty to the business community. However, I would like to make it clear that, in government, Labor will review the operation of the scheme and give detailed consideration to putting in place a post-funded model.</para><para>I will now turn to the issues which underpin the amendments that I will shortly move to the bill in the committee stage. A particular concern that Labor has with the pre-funding element of the government's scheme is the cost that policyholders will be forced to bear. While the Treasurer will give directions to set reinsurance premiums, the bill contains no mechanism to control the premiums that insurers will charge policyholders. Insurers indicated that they intend to charge premiums in excess of the cost of reinsurance in order to recover `administrative and other costs'. </para><para>The government has no idea what premiums policyholders will be charged following the introduction of compulsory terrorism cover. Its initial explanatory memorandum was quite misleading on the subject, suggesting that policyholders would be charged no more than the cost of reinsurance for the insurance. Submissions by Royal and Sun Alliance and the Insurance Council to the economics committee make it clear that this will not be the case. On behalf of the opposition, I intend to move amendments to ensure that the ACCC has a role in preventing insurance companies from exploiting the fact that terrorism insurance is compulsory to boost their profits at the expense of policyholders. In seeking some protection for policyholders against price exploitation we are doing no more than upholding a commitment the government made in its explanatory memorandum. In that document the government pledged:</para><quote><para>... to explore possible acceptable cost recovery arrangements for insurers in regard to reinsurance premiums charged by the Scheme.</para></quote><para>Treasury officers informed the committee that no such work had been undertaken. Instead of doing what it promised, the government wants policyholders to have faith in competitive forces to act as a brake on premiums. Labor does not share this government's faith in the operation of competition in the insurance industry. We believe that there is a real danger that companies will use the fact that policyholders will be required to take out terrorism cover to dramatically increase premiums. </para><para>Labor notes that in the recent Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 the government included a provision which requires insurers to offer medical indemnity premiums that are `reasonable'. If it is good enough for doctors to have this protection, Labor believes that it ought to be available to hundreds of thousands of small businesses who will be required to pay for terrorism cover. Recent experience leads us to be sceptical of the competitiveness of the industry. We are, for example, yet to see the benefits of competition in action in relation to public liability. Despite a range of tort law reforms being enacted by state and territory governments, public liability premiums continue to rise, as do insurance company profits. We are yet to see any of the promised savings being passed on to consumers.</para><para>The recent experience in the United States does not provide any basis for optimism  either. Following the introduction of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 2002, which requires companies to offer terrorism cover backed by government indemnity, it has been reported that some premiums have risen by over 100 per cent. Many people would suggest that the United States is a more competitive insurance market than Australia.</para><para>Labor is also not persuaded by the argument made by the majority committee report that the `appropriate cost-recovery arrangements' can be considered under the arrangements for the review of the scheme. We do not believe that policyholders should be required to wait three years in order to gain protection against potential rip-offs. </para><para>Another issue that was raised during the inquiry concerned the requirement of compulsion. The Council of Small Business Organisations and the Association of Risk and Insurance Managers of Australasia said that their membership strongly opposed the fact that policyholders are required to take out cover. They argued that it effectively required those at low risk or those who were prepared to accept the risk to subsidise those who wanted terrorism cover. In our view the pre-funded scheme requires compulsion to operate effectively. Labor will seek to address the concerns of small business by empowering the ACCC to prevent price exploitation in relation to terrorism cover.</para><para>Clause 41 of the bill provides that the minister is to review the need for the operation of the scheme every three years. Labor is concerned that the bill does not presently contain any requirement that the report resulting from the review be tabled in the parliament or otherwise made publicly available. I foreshadow that in the committee stage I will move amendments to the bill to ensure that reviews of the scheme are subject to public scrutiny.</para><para>In conclusion, Labor accepts that the withdrawal of terrorism cover constitutes a market failure which could have a substantial adverse impact on the Australian economy. There is clearly a need for government intervention in this case. Labor does have concerns about the government's scheme and believes that the option of a pure post-funded model should have been more rigorously explored before this. Nevertheless, in the interests of giving business certainty, the opposition will support the bill, with appropriate amendments to protect policyholders from price exploitation. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>11204</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to comment on the passage of the <inline ref="R1725">Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003</inline> as it now stands, following the amendments that were passed in the House of Representatives on 27 March. The bill was originally introduced in the House on 12 December last year and was passed with amendments on 27 March of this year. On 19 March, however, the Senate referred the bill to the Economics Legislation Committee, whose report was tabled during the current sitting period. It would appear that the government has decided to respond to some of the concerns that have been raised following the bill's introduction. While the amendments go some way to addressing the inadequacies of the bill—in particular, the desires of the insurance industry—it is still somewhat disappointing that the bill lacks more detail. I understand that the particulars of the scheme are to be left to the regulations. However, I want to record my concern and the concern of the Australian Democrats about what seems to be an increasing trend to leave the details of such important legislation to the regulations. </para></talk.start><para>The explanatory memorandum provides details about three options available to the government in running the scheme and accumulating the pool of funds. In particular, and without stating for certain its adoption, it highlights the benefits of option 3—that is, `Universal participation through compulsory provision of insurance and optional reinsurance with the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation', which is yet to be established. The bill would establish a scheme whereby the government provides insurance cover against terrorism. The bill deems all eligible insurance contracts to include terrorism risk cover, effectively rendering inoperative exclusion clauses for terrorism cover. Eligible insurance contracts are those that provide insurance cover for the loss of, or damage to, eligible property located in Australia.</para><para>The bill also establishes a statutory authority, to be known as the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, which will provide reinsurance cover to insurers for losses arising from a declared terrorist incident. It is intended that insurers seeking reinsurance will retain part of the risk. The retention, as set by the Treasurer, will be $1 million per insurer per annum and $10 million across the industry per event. Through the compulsory nature of the levy imposed, it is estimated that the reinsurance pool will total some $300 million. Since terrorism insurance cover will be deemed to exist in the contract, this would prompt insurers to increase premiums. As the inquiry highlighted, that has been a major criticism of the bill and is of great concern, especially to members of the small business community. The reason is that the insurance company would then be compelled to take out reinsurance with ARPC to fund the added risk that they are assuming. While the level of reinsurance to be paid by the insurance industry is capped, the charges payable by insurance increases are not. I note that the ALP are going to move a set of amendments to deal with that issue. I will come to that shortly.</para><para>I think we need to keep in mind the whole question of why and how this bill came about. In my view, the introduction of the bill and the impending scheme are essentially to correct market failure in the area of terrorism insurance arising from the events of September 11, 2001. Since that time, the availability of insurance cover for terrorism has been virtually non-existent. It is thought that this might lead to less financing and investment in the Australian property sector, primarily in commercial property, and of course it would have wider economic impacts.</para><para>According to the Australian Bankers Association, there is a risk that financiers will be unprepared to provide finance to some large projects or large-scale infrastructure if terrorism cover is withdrawn and the new assets are exposed to an uninsurable risk. Not only this, but also large financial and other losses are a threat where projects go ahead without this type of insurance. As a result of these risks, countries such as France, Germany and the United States have also implemented similar schemes to the one contained in this bill. </para><para>In his second reading speech, the Treasurer claims that the scheme will be wound down when terrorism insurance becomes available in the insurance market in the general sense. Accordingly, reviews of the scheme must be conducted and a report prepared every two to three years as provided in part 4 of the bill. This begs the question: if the scheme is designed to be a temporary measure, what will become of the funds at the end of the scheme if a terrorist event is never declared? Three hundred million dollars is not an insignificant figure.</para><para>There has been criticism of the bill by some who will be captured by it and who view their risk of terrorist attack to be quite low. As the inquiry has highlighted, many in the small business community, especially those who are located in areas outside what might be seen as high-risk areas, feel that they will be subsidising the cost of insurance for damage from a terrorist attack for those in the higher-risk areas. Providing insurance is about taking a gamble; for the insurance industry, this gamble pays off enormously. And, while all of us are continually pumping money into the industry so that they assume our risks, if we do not make a claim we will never see those funds again.</para><para>I am sure that many here are aware, either personally or professionally, of the instances where getting a claim paid from an insurance company has been a completely draining process. While it is desirable for this government scheme to ensure legitimate claims are paid, governments are not corporations and, if no claims are made, I think that those in the community who have been affected by this scheme would expect that the funds be put to good use. I also hope the term `declared terrorist event' is not used by the government as a tool to reject otherwise legitimate claims.</para><para>Only premiums for reinsurance will be set by the body to be known as the ARPC, while the premiums set by the insurers will not be under ARPC control. Given the uncertainty of premium increases for affected contract holders, it makes it even more important that some good come of these funds if no claim is made. And there is no doubt that all who are present here today would be hoping and praying that this is the case and that we do not experience a terrorist event during the life of this scheme, or at any time, for that matter.</para><para>In the event that there are no declared terrorist events, a pool of funds valued at $300 million would be well spent if earmarked towards such things as the maintenance and improvement of heritage listed buildings; funding improvements to public buildings which house public galleries, museums and places of interest; funding to establish sites to be used to house a variety of worthwhile research projects; and investment in projects aimed at designing buildings that are more efficient and environmentally sound. At the very least, these funds could be used to increase practical security measures for our most vulnerable and to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks on public buildings.</para><para>As the Treasurer himself has acknowledged, this bill does not contain much detail about how the scheme will operate. While the Treasurer claims that much of the detail lies in the regulations so as to keep the scheme flexible, another interpretation is that the scheme itself lacks transparency. In relation to uncapped premiums, it is thought that the reinsurance paid by the insurance industry into the pool would vary, depending on the level of risk. Supposedly, between two and 12 per cent will be added to the premium price. As I mentioned earlier, some concern has been raised that insurance companies will engage in profiteering with the introduction of the scheme, given that the premiums that can be charged to policyholders will be uncapped. In light of this, the government must ensure that the ACCC is empowered to adequately monitor premiums to alleviate these concerns. I note the opposition's amendments on this matter and flag the Australian Democrats' support for those provisions. However, on the whole, the Australian Democrats support the passage of the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003 and we await the regulations that are to come forward, wherein we expect the government to keep to the spirit of the explanatory memorandum when working out the detail of the scheme. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11207</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make a brief contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1725">Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003</inline> and to outline a number of concerns that I have with it. Whilst I accept that it is the view of the opposition that this bill should be supported—and we have had a very strong case put to us about why that is the case—I would like to give it qualified support. I see some real problems with the overall concept of it. The first problem I see—being from Western Australia—is that we are now looking at having a framework that makes insurance for dealing with terrorism liability compulsory across the board, when it could be an added impost to the cost of the operation of key assets within the WA community that have already negotiated their own arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>As I outlined to witnesses during the committee process, one of the key places in Western Australia that is identified as a potential target for terrorism is not the CBD of Perth, it is not any of the multistorey buildings on St. George's Terrace; it is the township of Karratha and the infrastructure that goes with the oil and gas industry that is based in that town. For those of you who know anything about the operations of the oil and gas industry, the need for terrorism insurance or coverage for exposure to a terrorism type risk is something that that industry has taken into account for many a long year, particularly when you look at the key players in the oil and gas field, most of whom are multinational companies and therefore have exposure in the Middle East and elsewhere. We all know that terrorism has been a potential risk for a very long time for anyone operating in the Middle East.</para><para>When I outlined some of my concerns that this would be an added impost to businesses that already have their own arrangements, I was assured by some of the witnesses during the committee inquiry that, if the businesses have their own insurance, this will not be extra insurance cover they are forced to take out. My concern is that, within their internal costing processes, these businesses could have priced in to their operations the replacement cost for any exposed facilities rather than taken out commercial insurance—so it is part of their internal operations and there is no actual insurance. This could actually be an increased cost to their operations. It is an increased cost, I might say, at a time of potential decrease in oil prices. For the government to impose an extra cost component on the operations of those businesses when it is a highly volatile market anyway—we are constantly told about the oversupply of refinery capacity throughout the world—I think is a real concern for the future of that industry.</para><para>Another concern I have about the way the government has brought about this scheme is the cross-subsidisation that there will be because of this flat charge for all entities. Again, it goes to the compulsory nature of it. Because the property council and large property owners in CBDs have said they feel the need for the government to come up with a scheme because of the market failure—and I have absolutely no doubt about the market failure argument—this is going to be imposed across the board on small businesses and on everyone operating. If you operate a small business, say, in a place like Mukinbudin in Western Australia, you have to take out terrorism insurance whether you like it or not. It beggars belief that a small business operating in Mukinbudin could ever be at risk of any form of terrorism attack. It is a concern to me to have this added impost on small businesses, again brought to us by the government, without those small businesses actually having any discretion in deciding whether it is necessary or not. </para><para>My third concern with this proposal is that we seem to have come up with just one model to address this market failure. As I have said before, I accept there has indeed been market failure. I remain to be convinced, given the nature of the reinsurance industry worldwide at the moment, that the market will ever recover to the level it needs to. Therefore, I accept that, if we are to have some kind of insurance coverage like this, it does need government intervention. In their haste—business and other commercial entities have been given an assurance about a start-up date—it seems to me that the government has only considered one possible model for the way this insurance coverage could be constructed. That has become what is known as a pre-event funded model where there is a levy right across the sector no matter what. In other cases and in other industries where there has been the need for market intervention for risk or what have you, there has been consideration given to a post-event funded model where, once the cost of the event to be covered by the insurance claim is established, the levy goes out throughout the sector. It is a model used in superannuation and in other areas.</para><para>It seems that in our haste to meet the 1 July start-up date, there has not been sufficient work done on looking at the different models of operation and what would be most successful in meeting the needs of our community. I think a post-event funded model is a much more attractive alternative. Obviously, with that goes some form of compulsion, but there is only compulsion after an event, and that compulsion is to address the cost of repairing the damage of that event. There are no up-front costs for an event that may never ever happen. In our haste to meet the deadline, I am really concerned that there has not been a wide enough examination of the different options. In fact, post-event funded models have actually been recommended by the HIH royal commission, which is a well-known royal commission in this place. It has also been strongly supported by some of the state governments.</para><para>Having placed on the record my concerns about what I think are the shortcomings of this legislation, I am happy to offer qualified support for this legislation. I accept that there has been market failure, and I accept that there are sectors of the business community that have identified a real need for immediate coverage for their own operational security and for their sector of the business community to prosper. I accept that. But I believe there need to be further safeguards placed within the legislation to try and address some of the concerns I have outlined. If we are going to have an added cost impost, particularly on small business or the like, it is incredibly important that we have sufficient pricing and competition controls within it to ensure that this impost is not just the subject of profiteering by different insurance companies now that they would have the capacity for government intervention and government subsidy. As that is a real concern, I am very happy to urge the support of Senator Conroy's move to devise a role for the ACCC to ensure that this is a robust scheme, that there is no profiteering by insurance companies and that, in fact, there is adequate protection for the small business sector. I think that is incredibly important. </para><para>I agree with Senator Ridgeway about the importance for all concerned to see the regulations attached to this legislation as soon as possible. That was a recommendation in the report of the inquiry into this legislation. It is also important that the government be required to table the reports that review the operation of the scheme so we can be sure that this is not a cost deterrent to the operation of the business sector in our community, that it is the best model and that it is operating efficiently. That would allow us the scope to review whether we should change the operations of terrorism insurance. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11209</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is very keen to finish this bill before a quarter to one, so I will address during the committee stage the substantive points raised by honourable senators.

As I mentioned in the second reading debate, it is a matter that should be addressed. Acknowledgement in a second reading speech that insurers should not engage in price exploitation is not enough of a commitment. It requires, in our view, an amendment to the current bill to ensure that price exploitation in relation to the supply of terrorism insurance is avoided.</para><para>The amendment is based on the existing part VB of the Trade Practices Act, which was introduced by the government to prevent consumers being ripped off in the transition to the GST. Given that it is a mechanism that the government is familiar with and that it was designed to prevent consumers from being ripped off in the transition to a new tax—as it then was—in this instance it will serve a like purpose in protecting consumers' interests from those of insurers. It will also keep insurers honest.</para><para>Proposed section 75AZAB creates the offence of price exploitation in relation to terrorism insurance. Price exploitation occurs where the price of supply of terrorism cover is unreasonably high with respect to the suppliers' costs, supply and demand conditions and any other relevant matter. The maximum penalty for a breach of these provisions will be $10 million. The commission will also have the ability to seek injunctions stopping price exploitation, and it is hoped that fines of this magnitude will not be required. To assist insurance companies to comply with their obligations, the ACCC will issue guidelines about when the price of terrorism cover is unreasonably high. These guidelines may be taken into account by the court in assessing whether an insurance company has engaged in price exploitation. To further assist in compliance, the ACCC may issue a notice to a company indicating that the commission considers that it has engaged in price exploitation. Such a notice will be prima facie evidence of a contravention. Those provisions are, of course, not unfamiliar to the government.</para><para>Proposed section 75AZAF gives the ACCC explicit powers to monitor the impact of the introduction of compulsory terrorism cover. The amendments give the ACCC explicit information gathering powers in order to achieve this objective. The ACCC is required under these amendments to prepare written reports on the exercise of its powers under this new part and, of course, these reports must be tabled in parliament. The amendments are comprehensive but, as I have indicated, the government should be familiar with the format and the type of issue that they seek to combat. The provision of part VBA on price exploitation in relation to terrorism insurance is comprehensive. However, the government should be familiar with the provisions themselves—they deal with what we say the government has only been able to promise, not deliver, in relation to the Terrorism Insurance Bill. This amendment will provide a mechanism to allow the ACCC the appropriate powers to ensure that consumers in the industry will not be ripped off. I urge the Senate to support these amendments in order to protect policyholders. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11215</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very reluctant to enter the debate from a different trajectory but I just want to ask the government if it has a definition of `ecoterrorism'. That is quite important, as we have had the Deputy Premier of Tasmania using the word, for example, to refer to a multimillion dollar act of destruction of logging equipment in Tasmania in the last 12 months with implications that environmentalists might be involved—and they were not—and there is a lot of conjecture about internecine fighting amongst logging corporations for tenders to carry out logging activities and difficulties with insurance. The word comes from the definition of `terrorism' and my concern is that, whereas it is currently a word that is widely used, it may be in the interests of some parties to define such activities where there is insurance applying as terrorism and to utilise the provisions of this legislation to seek recompense.</para></talk.start><para>To me the term `ecoterrorism' means creating a destructive impact on the environment, but that is not how it is used by the logging industry in Tasmania, for example, and other entities. There are large amounts of money involved, and I would be interested to know where the government's definition of `terrorism' excludes, for example, acts of vandalism—by loggers to other loggers' equipment or by unknown persons to loggers' equipment. Is there an exclusion in this legislation for that sort of touted terrorism, an exclusion which I have not seen appropriately used in any recent time?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>11215</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised that under the definitions in this bill it would be up to the Treasurer to declare an act a terrorist act.

There is obviously a political debate going on in relation to this. In the current debate about terrorism I would probably share Senator Bob Brown's view, even though I have not discussed it with him, that the word `terrorism' is being used too flippantly in our community. I think some people, in the debate on the war, were accusing the US government of being terrorists. I think that, when you have organisations like al-Qaeda doing what they did on September 11 and destroying the lives of 3,000 people—including 600 Muslims, as I was reminded by President Clinton when I met with him in New York a few weeks ago; I think people from 113 countries around the world were killed on the morning of September 11—and when so many people were killed on October 12 in Bali by people that Senator Brown and I—all of us—could agree are terrorists, it is absurd to then apply that term to people who might, probably illegally, damage equipment of any company. It reduces the important potency of the word `terrorist'. So I think it is probably a silly thing for a political leader—and I will call the Deputy Premier of Tasmania a leader because he is in a leadership position—to associate that word, which should have a potent force in people's minds, with that sort of activity, which I do not think Senator Brown or I would condone: neither of us would condone illegal acts of vandalism. So I would share his view on the use of that term but I would like, if Senator Brown would agree to this course of action, to give him a letter, which I am happy to share with everyone, on how the definition in this bill would work in practice. I think he would be comforted by the fact that the term he has repeated on behalf of the Deputy Premier of Tasmania would not come into this sort of legislation, which is obviously designed to fix a serious problem in the community of Australia—that some people with buildings just cannot get insurance cover because of the risk of serious terrorist acts such as occurred in Bali and in the financial district of New York nearly two years ago. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I should respond to Senator Ludwig's points. The government will not support the measures. I think the opposition is very well intentioned. The opposition senators on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee noted what had happened to insurance premiums in the United States when their government brought in a scheme. It is important that the Senate know that that scheme is very different from what we are proposing. We are effectively proposing a reinsurance scheme, through the establishment of the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, which is linked to a percentage of the underlying property insurance premium. It differs from the United States scheme in that they made it mandatory for insurers to cover the terrorist risk. The reason we have had problems with terrorism insurance is that insurers have withdrawn from the market because they cannot price the risk, and I think all of us can understand why that is. If we could price that risk it would be a sad world in many respects because you would know pretty accurately what the risk of a terrorist attack was. Luckily, we are not quite sure of that. We know there are high risks in some places and lower risks in others but it is still very hard to judge. In America the price of insurance has reflected the fact that the insurance companies have to price that risk. What we are doing here is effectively taking the pricing of that risk out of the premium, with the ARPC effectively covering that portion of the risk in the insurance.</para><para>The ARPC, the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, will charge insurers two, four or 12 per cent of the existing underlying property insurance premium, depending on the location of the property. Insurers can then simply pass this cost on to the policyholder. Why this is different from the American situation is that, as I have mentioned, the American government just told insurance companies that they have to cover the risk; we are effectively saying to the insurance companies that they do not. In Australia, because the ARPC percentage premium will be linked to the underlying insurance premium and the policyholder will have to pay it, there will be an effective price tension. If an insurer seeks to put their premiums up, that will be reflected not only in the underlying premium but also in the premium that ARPC charges. So the overall price will go up and the policyholder—say, in a property trust which owns a major capital city building—will of course have the choice of moving to a different insurance firm and getting the best price they can. I know from personal experience that that market is one that has significant competition in it. It does not have as much as we would like, but we think that as a result of this act that competition will return to the levels that applied prior to the terrorism act in New York and later in Bali. </para><para>The opposition's amendment would in fact have a perverse effect in that it does carry significant costs—it is not a cost-free exercise—and not only to the government. Whether he referred to it specifically or by inference, Senator Ludwig alluded to what we did with the introduction of the new tax system where the government put in place, I think is fair to say, a similar regime. It was a very expensive exercise and, from the government's point of view, it cost many tens of millions of dollars. Of course there was a cost burden on the community as well and ultimately, because there is no such thing as a free lunch, the customer pays—the policyholder pays and their customers pay.</para><para>The scheme proposed by the opposition does involve costs to the government, therefore to the taxpayer, and also to the policyholders because it will impose significant additional burdens on the insurance sector. We do believe in this situation that the costs outweigh the benefits. We believe that there is significant competition here and that this is therefore contrary to the policy intention of the government, and that is the reason we will not be supporting the amendment.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11217</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12.42 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11217</page.no><id.no>R1728</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11217</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11217</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is not a controversial bill. In 2002, the Commonwealth parliament passed counter-terrorism laws to create a range of offences relating to terrorist activities and to the financing of terrorist groups. The Commonwealth does not have any express powers over matters like terrorism or general criminal laws. Instead, it relies on a raft of indirect constitutional powers to enact the counter-terrorism laws such as the defence and external affairs powers. There are concerns that those powers may not provide a comprehensive base for the legislation. I can provide an example of this. The Attorney-General has stated that he is concerned that there may be gaps in the law when:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... terrorist activity was entirely state-based and did not have any Commonwealth element in it or foreign element in it ...</para></quote><para>The leaders summit in Canberra on 5 April 2002 agreed that state constitutional references would be sought to support federal terrorism offences of national application.

However, now the offences will operate on a more secure legal basis following the referrals from the states. I do not expect that this will be a controversial bill. It is certainly a bill which has the support of the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11218</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to again record the Australian Democrats opposition to the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. The bill re-enacts the various terrorism offences introduced last year as part of the government's package and suite of antiterrorism legislation. The purpose of this re-enactment is to provide for the referral of state powers to the Commonwealth to deal with these offences. In the absence of such a referral, this legislation would rely on a mixed bag of Commonwealth powers, and there is some concern that potential loopholes in these powers may prevent the Commonwealth from responding to a terrorist attack in some circumstances. For this reason, the summit of Commonwealth, state and territory leaders, convened on 5 April 2002, agreed to work towards a national referral of state powers on specific antiterrorism legislation. The majority of Australian states have now passed legislation to bring this referral into effect. If any state does not enact referral legislation, the Commonwealth will continue to rely on its constitutional heads of power when acting within that state. In the territories, the Commonwealth will rely on the territories power in section 122 of the Constitution and outside of Australia it will rely on its external affairs power.</para></talk.start><para>We Democrats note that the states have referred to the Commonwealth both the text of this legislation and the power to amend it. We are pleased to see that such amendments can be made only with the agreement of a majority of states and territories, including at least four of the states. We Democrats also note that the bill will enable the concurrent operation of state laws relating to terrorist offences provided there is no direct inconsistency. We welcome the provision which prevents a situation of double jeopardy arising under these arrangements.</para><para>The Democrats opposed the introduction of the terrorism offences when this chamber considered the package of antiterrorism legislation last year. The original suite of bills was draconian in the extreme and represented, I believe, an ambit claim on the part of the government. The bills were, of course, substantially amended during their passage through this chamber and, as a result, radical improvements were made. However, even after these improvements, the Democrats were unable to support the bills. Our fundamental concern was related to the definition of a terrorist act and the Attorney-General's proscription power. The Democrats believe that the definition of a terrorist act was too broad and could potentially capture forms of political activism that were far removed from terrorism despite the exemption for lawful advocacy. </para><para>With respect to the proscription power, the Democrats argued strongly that criminal behaviour should be punished but belief or association should not. We took the view that a more appropriate way to deal with this issue would be through prosecuting on the basis of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. We Democrats did, however, welcome the new requirement for the organisation to be identified by the Security Council in a decision relating to terrorism. The requirement placed some limitation on what would otherwise have been an arbitrary and a potentially very dangerous power.  </para><para>We take the opportunity this time to record our deep concern at the Attorney-General's recent announcement in the media that he intends to seek amendments to the Criminal Code which would remove this requirement, effectively reverting to the government's original model. This announcement confirmed the Democrats' concerns that once these new powers were introduced the government could potentially increase their scope. This was a possibility that greatly influenced our decision to oppose the original bills. Time and time again the government has sought to assure us that it will exercise these powers responsibly and will not abuse them or misapply them. Here we are a year later and the government is already signalling its intention to shed some of the safeguards that secured the passage of this legislation in the first place. I want to put clearly on the record now that, if legislation is introduced to remove the requirement for a Security Council listing in relation to terrorist organisations, we Democrats will oppose it.</para><para>On the issue of the referral of state powers, Democrats in state parliaments have voted against referral legislation. The reason for this opposition is best summarised by my South Australian colleague the Hon. Ian Gilfillan, who said:</para><quote><para>In addressing the bill we must answer two questions: first, is the issue of fighting terrorism properly dealt with at a national level; and, secondly, do we have confidence in the commonwealth to deal appropriately with the challenges that terrorism presents? The first question is easily dealt with. Terrorism as we face it today is an international issue and, hence, the commonwealth is the most appropriate body to address the matter. The second question is more problematic. It is difficult, when the measures that are employed in an attempt to combat terrorism erode those values of our society that we are trying to defend against terrorists. </para></quote><para>Having considered the substance of the Commonwealth legislation, he then lacked the confidence in the Commonwealth to deal with the threat of terrorism appropriately. Right from the beginning we Democrats have opposed the offences contained in this bill. We believe that they represent a fundamentally flawed and disproportionate response to the threat of terrorism. We have voted against them at a federal level and we have voted against them at a state level. Again today we express our opposition to these measures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>11219</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank the Labor Party for its consideration of and support for the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>.

The enactment of this bill will ensure comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences enacted last year. I would like to take this opportunity to mention once again that last year's attacks in Bali have strengthened the government's resolve to complete this exercise as soon as possible. The Commonwealth appreciates the states' efforts in responding to the national need and referring the power necessary to support the enactment of the bill. The bill is part of the counter-terrorism package that delivers on the government's commitment to protect Australians against terrorism.

The Minister for Health and Ageing would appreciate the significance of this because there are amendments standing in Senator Harradine's name. I have made attempts to contact Senator Harradine's office and I was concerned that his office, and perhaps the senator himself, were not informed of this.

I am not in a position to ask Senator Harradine whether he is intending to proceed with his proposed amendments to the bill—maybe the minister might have some advice on that. The initial understanding was that the legislation would most likely be treated as noncontroversial legislation. The opposition position has been well known to the government. It was outlined in the other place yesterday when the bill was debated there that the opposition fully supports the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>We support the legislation but we note that it has been sitting on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for quite some time. Indeed, the bill that we are debating now, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, originated as the <inline ref="R1588">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline>. It was introduced on 27 June last year and it has languished for all of that time. It has now been brought back into the parliament with amendments by the government essentially in response to a crisis that has just recently occurred with the Pan Pharmaceuticals matter. Everyone is aware that a major recall has occurred—I would venture to say the biggest single recall of pharmaceutical products, and probably of any products, in the history of this country. </para><para>When I picked up a newspaper a couple of weeks ago and opened it up, I saw three full pages of an advertisement by the Therapeutic Goods Administration listing all the various drugs and products that were the subject of the recall. The advertisement was not in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily T</inline><inline font-style="italic">elegraph</inline> either; it was in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, the larger broadsheets. Not only did the advertisement take up at least three pages but also it indicated that there were probably still more products that may need to be recalled because the TGA did not have a complete list of those products on the shelves of pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets which might be affected by what had occurred with Pan Pharmaceuticals.</para><para>We are now in a serious situation, and it has become very clear by the minister having to move a procedural motion to deal urgently with the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 in response to this crisis. The particular details of the legislation have been well outlined in the debate in the other place and in the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. I do not need to go through those. We welcome the changes that have been proposed as a means to provide greater clarity and certainty for the industry, consumers and regulators. The bill amends the definition of `therapeutic goods'. It also rationalises various processes regarding preapproval and makes a range of changes to the penalty regime applying in respect of advertising offences under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I do not wish to take the time of the Senate at this point because our position is very clearly on the record—that is, we support the legislation.</para><para>I turn to Senator Harradine's proposed amendments. I questioned earlier, before Senator Harradine came into the chamber, whether or not those proposed amendments are still going to be proceeded with. No doubt Senator Harradine will inform us shortly. Our position is that the Labor Party, firstly, supports the bill. Secondly, the party does not support the amendments moved by Senator Harradine.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—I haven't moved anything yet.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—The amendments which you intend to move—I apologise, Senator Harradine. I am using the opportunity, while on my feet in the second reading debate, to deal with your proposed amendments as well. There are reasons why the Labor Party does not agree to those amendments: one, they raise practical problems; two, while we are sympathetic to the intent of the amendments—namely, to give consumers information on whether the products they are considering purchasing have been developed with the use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells—we believe at this point that compliance with them would be extremely hard or impossible in some cases. We understand—and again the minister can confirm this—that the government is prepared to give an undertaking to oblige the TGA to report back within a month on options to address the issues raised in Senator Harradine's amendments relating to consumer and reporting concerns. These are concerns which the Labor Party shares and we look forward to receiving the government's options and proposals in that regard. The position of the Labor opposition is that we do not support the amendments. However, we also wish to indicate that we will allow our members a conscience vote on the amendments proposed by Senator Harradine. With that, I conclude my remarks.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>11222</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate Democrat support for the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003.

We do have some concerns, which we have raised with the minister. We understand the urgency of this legislation, given the amendments which deal with the Pan Pharmaceuticals issue, but we would like to have seen some reassurances from the government about the question of how appropriate it is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing to indicate who is a fit and proper person. We seek assurances from the government that, in the implementation of this act, that question will be given some consideration. We are also surprised that this bill is coming on right now.

This is an extremely important issue. We recognise the seriousness of the situation we are in at the moment with Pan Pharmaceuticals, the need to address that quickly and the need to make changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act. But given the seriousness of this legislation and the impact on the broad sector of the complementary health care industry—an industry that has been growing rapidly in Australia—we need to have the opportunity to discuss the changes and the amendments that the government has put forward. We received these amendments yesterday afternoon and are expected to be in a position to finalise decisions at this stage. We understand that other senators in this chamber were offered briefings on this issue as long ago as last week. No such briefings or opportunity to discuss these issues were made available to the Australian Greens.

There had been negotiations over certain amendments I put forward. The reason the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 is before us today is the failure of drug companies to uphold standards we all expect and rely upon. I support the tougher stand and the tougher regulatory system for therapeutic goods. I agree with the ministers that we must protect public health and safety in relation to all therapeutic goods.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a question that these types of complementary medicines are indeed less harmful than some of the prescription medicines that are around the place—but that is an aside. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Ms Worth, who said:</para><quote><para>`It is imperative the community is able to have confidence that information available from all sources is valid, trustworthy and not misleading ...'</para></quote><para>Under the proposed changes, drug companies will be forced to reveal on packaging exactly who made the product and where the ingredients came from. That is why I have drawn up amendments that also go to the importance of the consumer's right to know—a right significantly threatened by the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis we have witnessed these past few weeks. I am sure everyone in this chamber believes that this is a right that must be protected and upheld at all costs—that consumers must know what is in the drugs they take or are considering taking. </para><para>The amendments that I distributed cover a specific pharmaceutical category so far not covered by any consumer right to know legislation or regulations, and about which there is great community concern. They would ensure that information was available with pharmaceutical products and in advertising for pharmaceutical products so that consumers could determine whether the pharmaceuticals were tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. Consumers could then make a fully informed choice as to whether or not they wished to use the pharmaceutical product. This is consistent with the TGA's interest:</para><quote><para>The TGA is interested in fostering a consumer-focused approach to the labelling of consumer medicines in Australia.</para></quote><para>Consumers have a right to know whether pharmaceuticals they are considering using were tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. The only way for individuals to protect themselves from inadvertently using a product with which they have an ethical problem is for manufacturers to disclose, in a way that is accessible to all potential consumers, what was involved in making that product.</para><para>Those who conscientiously oppose destructive research on embryos want to be able to easily identify drug products created using this research through the introduction of a system of clear product identification. Many people consider some practices so deeply wrong that it would be devastating to them to discover they were consuming products involving those practices and contributing to the resultant financial benefit to the manufacturer as well as to the product's continued production. For example, in a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the <inline ref="R1608">Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, Diabetics for Ethical Treatment argued:</para><quote><para>It is unethical, and an insult to the integrity of persons with diabetes, to pursue research into therapies which involve harming or destroying human beings, including human embryos.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>We firmly believe that an attack on the dignity and well-being of any group of human beings is an attack on human dignity itself. It is a profound insult to people with disabilities and illnesses, including diabetics, to presume that we are willing to accept therapies developed at the cost of other human lives.</para></quote><para>We should remember that consumers who are not concerned about the use of human embryos can still use products made in this way if they want. This amendment in no way restricts anyone's ability to purchase a pharmaceutical product under the normal requirements. What it does do is enhance the rights of consumers who have ethical objections to using products that involved the destruction of human embryos—no more, no less.</para><para>Last year the parliament was given a conscience vote on the issue of embryo research. Consumers deserve the right to exercise their consciences too. They deserve the right to full information so that they can make an informed choice. Individual consumers are certainly not in a position to know what has been involved in the production of drugs and have limited capacity to find out—particularly if manufacturers refuse to disclose this information.</para><para>Currently there are no known pharmaceutical products which contain ingredients derived from embryos or embryonic stem cells. But the Research Involving Human Embryos Act passed last year allows embryos or embryonic stem cells to be used in the testing, creation or manufacturing of products. It is important to enact a consumer information provision for the protection of consumers before products come onto the market, if that is at all possible. </para><para>The amendments that I have been foreshadowing are different to those I moved in December last year, though they of course have similar provisions. I want to indicate that, during the debate on the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Human Embryos Bill 2002</inline>, the minister said that people do not have to use those drugs if they do not want to. But that is the whole point. We will have that discussion. I know, Minister, that you understand that and were concerned that I was raising this in the wrong area last time. I think Senator Evans made the point that he was not against what I was seeking to do but that it was not appropriate to the legislation we were debating at the time and should be dealt with on the basis of an amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act. Obviously, that is what I have done on this particular occasion by taking the first opportunity to do this.</para><para>I invite honourable senators to consider—whether they agree or not with research on human embryos—that this is a matter of consumer choice. Surely it is as simple as that. There are whole lot of other areas where information is required by governments in respect of products. For example, in the case of genetically modified foods the manufacturers have certain requirements. And I think Dr Kemp mentioned ethanol—that people should know what is going into the fuel tanks of motor cars. But this is not about fuel tanks. If consumers have the right to know what goes into their fuel tanks, they surely have the right to know what is going into their bodies. That is what I thought the Therapeutic Goods Administration were all about. We will soon see whether they are about that.</para><para>This measure has been discussed around the traps on the basis of material that has been provided to honourable senators. I put it to honourable senators that this is clearly a consumers' rights amendment and it will be up to the parliament to deal with it on that basis. I understand that the minister will be making a statement on this. I support the measure thus far, though there are concerns. I am aware that concerns have been expressed by the alternative medicine producers and I would like to hear the minister's response to those concerns.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>11224</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want first of all to thank the Senate for agreeing to discuss the <inline ref="R1476">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> at this time.

It has meant that we have needed to proceed more swiftly than might otherwise have been the case. I appreciate honourable senators' cooperation in this matter.</para></talk.start><para>The bill enables a greater clarity, consistency and transparency of decision making relating to the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods and the food-medicine interface. The amendment for the definition of `therapeutic goods' in subsection 3(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act will enable the Therapeutic Goods Administration to continue to regulate goods that are presented for therapeutic use but are subject to a food standard as a therapeutic good. This will provide the necessary clarity and certainty for consumers, the industry and regulators in relation to some goods at the food-medicine interface. </para><para>The changes to the two advertising provisions in the therapeutic goods legislation are divided into two categories. The first relates to the remaining advertising offences included in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations that are to be removed and inserted into part 5(1) of the act. By transferring the offences from the regulations to the act, the regulators are ensuring that a level playing field is created by having consistency in penalties imposed for breaches of the advertising offences. The second category relating to the advertising provisions concerns the removal of advertising provisions from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and inserting similar provisions into the therapeutic goods legislation. This will ensure consistency in the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods. </para><para>The changes included in the government amendments are intended to secure stronger protection of public health and safety in relation to all therapeutic goods, and they represent a balanced response by this government to the Pan Pharmaceuticals incident. The changes will clarify and tighten the responsibilities placed on sponsors and manufacturers of therapeutic goods to ensure that the products they make or supply measure up to appropriate internationally recognised quality and safety standards. The amendments will also equip the TGA with greater powers to take appropriate and timely action to remove substandard or suspect products from the marketplace.</para><para>The amendments will enable every manufacturer involved in the manufacture of each batch of a therapeutic good to be identifiable so that this information can be readily obtained by the TGA. Sponsors and manufacturers will be required to report to the TGA problems they become aware of about the products they manufacture or supply, including information about any adverse effects resulting from the use of their products, and information about other deficiencies found in their product. The government amendments to the bill will also extend the circumstances in which goods that fail to meet standards may be recalled from the market, and when their sponsors or manufacturers will be required to notify the public about the grounds for recall.</para><para>Greater incentives for companies to comply with standards designed to ensure the safety, quality and effectiveness of therapeutic goods have been added. New offences include an offence for falsifying or destroying any document or record relating to the manufacture, testing or evaluation of therapeutic goods. Furthermore, the level of penalties for a range of existing offences will be increased by these amendments. In addition, the government amendments indicate that the person obtaining a licence needs to be a fit and proper person. There has been consultation with all sectors of the medicines industry and they are generally supportive of the measures. The two industry associations that represent the complementary medicines industry—the Australian Self-Medication Industry and the Complementary Healthcare Council of Australia—have indicated their support for the measures.</para><para>With regard to the issue that Senator Harradine has raised, I know of his commitment and concerns. The fact that we have asked for this to be considered later does not diminish my regard for his concern about this issue. I appreciate his agreeing to not put his amendments so that we can deal with the other issue, which is particularly urgent. But that does not decrease in any way my commitment to address the issues he has raised in those amendments. In relation to the proposals to amend the Therapeutic Goods Act, I acknowledge not only Senator Harradine's concern, but also that some consumers might have concerns about knowing whether pharmaceutical products contain human embryonic materials or have been tested on them. The government has referred the proposed amendment to the TGA for urgent consideration and advice. I have asked the TGA to report to me within a month. I will table the TGA's report in the Senate and include an analysis of the regulatory options available to meet Senator Harradine's proposal. I appreciate his cooperation in this issue. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>—I remind honourable senators that, under a sessional order agreed to on 20 June 2002, after the second reading of this bill I shall call the minister to move the third reading, unless any senator requires that the bill be considered in the Committee of the Whole.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11226</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>11226</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wonder whether the minister can respond to my comments about a fit and proper person being one who is judged by the secretary to be so?

Yes, there is a small saving. You mentioned that you calculate that to be a loss of some $300. I note that you think that $300 is an important amount of money and, of course, you are right. The tax cut will give about $300 to struggling families earning between $21,000 and $25,000. I thank you for your confirmation that $300 is an important amount for struggling families and for your confirmation, through that, that the tax cuts are of value, unlike the remarks that Mr Swan has been making that a modest tax cut—just a start, as the Treasurer describes it—is too little and not enough.

Having paid off $63 billion in government debt is again almost beyond comprehension. When you think that the lot opposite ran budget deficits for five consecutive years and never even thought about the consequences, the fact that we have been able to save ourselves $5 billion in interest payments shows what they were doing with the money they took out of taxpayers' pockets. They were using it to pay the interest bill, while we have been using it for very important necessities and to tackle some of these endemic problems that Labor never even got around to thinking about. There have been 1.2 million jobs created—pretty much 50 per cent of those as full-time jobs. Interest rates are at the lowest levels in 30 years, resulting in nearly a $4,000 per year saving on a $100,000 home mortgage. These are the things that people relate to. They understand how important they are.</para><para>So, rather than going on and racking up budget deficits year after year, not bothering to retire any debt and seeing our credit rating twice downgraded, the Labor Party should at least come to terms with their appalling track record. Mortgage rates were 17 per cent. Small business rates were 20 per cent. Unemployment was 10.9 per cent. It sounds like a horror movie. As I say, the real concern that I think Australians have is that we are looking at `just say no'. The fact is that Labor has at least started on the apology process, because I saw this morning in the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline>—which we all read avidly—that at least Mr Crean is apologising for Mr Beazley's performance as a chronic underachiever.

Here we have a senator asking a question in terms of clawing back, taking from people, money to which they are entitled.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, when people have an overpayment, they have received more money than another family in the same circumstances. The family tax benefit is designed to ensure that, if a family in one set of circumstances gets X amount of money, a family in the same circumstances will also get X amount of money. We make no apology for designing a system that ensures that families are treated equally, that at the end of the year when you do your reconciliation, if you have had more than your fair share—more than your entitlement—then you will have to pay it back, generally by treating it as a down payment on next year's entitlement. I do not describe that as a clawback. I describe that as treating families equally and, where they have had more than another family in the same circumstances, saying to them, `I'm sorry; that's not fair. You have had more than another family in the same circumstances. You'll have to pay it back.' I do not see a correlation between that and the amount of the tax cuts at all, and I simply highlight to you, as I think the point you have made is the same as the previous senator made, that a tax cut of $300 to families earning between $21,000 and $25,000 is a substantial amount of money.</para><para>I do not know about other senators, but I would not throw 5c away. I would stop to pick up 20c or 50c or a $1 coin on the pavement. Here is what I do not think will happen: I do not think taxpayers are going to send a cheque back at the end of the year, saying: `I'm sorry; I think your tax cut wasn't big enough. We're going to give it back.' I do not think that is going to happen. Do you know why? It is because I think struggling families will welcome an extra $300 at the end of the year in their pockets—something they would never get out of the Labor Party. It is something they know they would not get because, when Labor pass their l-a-w law tax cuts, they undo them when they get re-elected.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11232</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The tax cut means that everybody on a certain income in the same circumstances gets that tax cut, just as with the family tax benefit everybody on the same income with the same number of kids in the same age group—because it does vary according to the age of your children—will get the same amount. In relation to what you referred to as a clawback, as I said, I simply make the point that you are treating an $800 overpayment, a $500 overpayment or a $20 overpayment as money to which that family is entitled—and therein lies your mistake. You are saying that a family who has had an overpayment is entitled to keep it and be treated differently from all other families in the same circumstances. Because they have had an overpayment, you presumably say, `Let them keep it.' We do not say that. We say that families in the same circumstances should be treated equally, and if they have had an overpayment then it will be paid back, usually, as I say, by down payment on next year's entitlement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>11233</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Yesterday in the chamber and on radio the point was made that small amounts of money on a weekly basis accumulate to large amounts of money and real savings for families over a longer period of time. The ALP, of course, have sought to say that the tax cut granted was too small. That is in fact what Mr Swan, the spokesperson for this area, says: the tax cut is too small. The tax cut given to battlers costs the budget $10.7 billion over four years. Again, Mr Swan cannot go from the one-on-one basis per week up to the cost to the budget. That is why they got into so much mess last time. That is why they could not keep the books together. It is a $10.7 billion cost. Today, of course, Mr Swan says that this amount is too small. He only says that, we know, because he wants to attack us. If we look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record we can find what Mr Swan really believes about $4 a week. On 6 March 2001 he said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget.</para></quote><para>So what Mr Swan really thinks is that a tax cut of $4 a week means a hell of a lot. In fact, in 2001 he criticised the government for not having a clue `what a dollar a week or $2 a week or $4 a week means to someone who is battling'. We do understand, and that is why we have given them the tax cut. Now it seems he does not understand, just as he did not understand then. But we do know that a few dollars a week are important to many families, because he told us the same thing the year before. Here is what he said the year before:</para><quote><para>A few dollars here or a few dollars there is the difference between a meal on the table, a decent meal, whether the rego is paid on time, whether the rates bill gets paid on time.</para></quote><para>There is the old saying that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but, as it turns out, $5 will buy you a sandwich and a milkshake—a free lunch, if you like—although the smart people who get a tax cut will put the money away. </para><para>I want to return to the point that I was making yesterday about a small amount of money on a weekly basis—a modest amount of money—adding up to a large amount of money. Someone on $21,000, as I said, will save about $300 a year. If that person uses this money to offset their mortgage of $153,000 with one of big banks—if that person pays just that $4 a week more—it will save the family $12,000 over the life of the loan and allow them to pay back the loan a year and a half earlier than they otherwise would have. So the prudent people will not be rushing out and buying a milkshake and a sandwich; they will be reducing their mortgage quite substantially over a long period of time. There is support for this view, Senator Payne, that $300 is quite a bit of money. I am sure you understand that. There are three people who support this, and I will refer to each of them.

The states were withdrawing money from the public hospitals. They reduced the number of beds by 3,000 over the life of the last agreement. Our aged care places have gone up by 23,000 during that period of time. They reduced spending on public hospitals. </para><para>It would do Senator Hutchins and senators on the other side a great deal of good and it would help their constituents if they went go back to their states and said, `You should keep and continue to grow your funding to public hospitals and not withdraw it, as has been the case.' In an attempt to keep the states honest, what we have said to them is: `We will give you a 17 per cent real increase—just over 29 per cent nominally—over and above inflation if you are prepared to match that growth. Put it on the table and tell us what you are going to spend for the next five years, which you are requiring us to do. It is only fair, if you require us to say what we are going to spend for the next five years, that you tell us what you are going to spend for the next five years and increase the growth by the same amount—nothing more, nothing less. But you cannot get away with the Commonwealth putting more in and you pulling money out, spending it elsewhere and saying that it is all the Commonwealth's fault.' </para><para>At the same time that we are bearing an incredible growth in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of almost 10 per cent a year—in one year it was 20 per cent and in another 14—and in other areas of health, the states are withdrawing their spending on public hospitals. The public need to be reminded that, while the Commonwealth makes a contribution to public hospitals, the states are also required to make a contribution, but the states run the public hospitals. It is their responsibility to fund them properly. If I were a state health minister I would be thinking that the agreements that we have put forward are a very good idea because they make the treasurers commit to a level of growth that they have not been committing to before. They also give the public hospital system in the states the opportunity to plan and to know what their budgets are going to be. I need to confirm this, but I was advised by member of a board that a hospital in my state does not have its budget for this financial year. When they rang and asked the CEO: `How do I run the hospital?' they said, `Just spend what you spent last year and we will let you know later.' How can you run a public hospital system like that? It is about time the states got organised and did the right thing. I would love a supplementary question, because I will add some more to that.

I do not know what the honourable senator is talking about when he talks about the PBS when Australians are now becoming more aware of the costs. In a significant number of cases now, though not all, but by, I think, 1 August all scripts will have the price of the medication on them, so Australians will come to understand even more that the most commonly prescribed medication in this country costs $80 per person per script per month. Those people who have paid $3.70 until they have had 50 scripts, and then do not pay anything for their scripts, get the most commonly prescribed medication that costs $80.</para></talk.start><para>We have just put one on the PBS that costs $6,600 per month per person. Not all that many people have it, but for those that do it is very important. Those who are on a health care card pay $3.70 and those not on a health care card pay $23.10. With the money that will come in the tax cuts, people will be more able to purchase those medications which are enormously subsidised. In fact, for every dollar a person pays for a medication, the federal government—the taxpayer—subsidises it to an additional $5. Every dollar means an additional $5 that is contributed by the government—by the taxpayer. Basically, the taxpayer pays $5 for every dollar that a person spends on medication.</para><para>The tax cut of $300 will easily cover a significant number of scripts. Once people reach 52 scripts if they are on a health care card, and 31 scripts if they are not, they receive their medication at a new rate: those on a concession card, for nothing; those not on a concession card, for $3.70. It is the most generous system in the world. If the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats would come to their senses and understand that people realise they need to make a contribution to that medication and if they pass the legislation that would enable us to increase it by $1, we would be able to ensure that we have a system that is sustainable into the future. </para><para>As we tell people about the PBS and advise them about the generous benefits that all of us get from the PBS when we have prescription drugs, people will understand that the people on the other side have been fiscally irresponsible in not accepting that it is unfair that in five years time or so, when the chickens come home to roost and we are looking at $7 billion for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, people will have to make a larger contribution. I have gone through this in detail, particularly with Senator Allison. People with young families now are paying a smaller proportion of their benefits on PBS, whereas in four or five years time, the next group of people who come through with small children aged two to five—a time when you use the most medication in your life, other than at the other end of your life when you are older—will be paying a significantly higher proportion of their income on the PBS.

Things are not free; there are always more demands on the system than governments can afford to meet. We take the view that there is a fundamental unfairness in the fact that 70 per cent of students do not go to university and that the overwhelming bulk of them are taxpayers and are therefore effectively required to cross-subsidise those who are, in all probability, going to earn a lot more money in their lifetimes than those who did not go to university. We think that is very unfair. I am sure that is why the Labor Party took the view that it was only reasonable to expect people to make a contribution to their education.</para></talk.start><para>To be paying about a quarter of the total cost still means the Commonwealth is up for very substantial sums of money. Of course, we are putting another $1.5 billion into the system over the next four years and $10 billion over the next 10 years. These are very substantial and ongoing increases in real terms from the Commonwealth. The notion that, somehow, it should all be free just ignores the very importance of price signals for many people. On what basis do you decide? If anything is available and you do not have to pay for it, you regard it as free. You do not understand that the taxpayer is actually having to pay very substantial sums of money.</para><para>The universities do not think that is a sensible system. Why do you think they have been asking us for flexibility? It is in order to increase their fees in certain areas to allow a sensible market response. We have put caps on those. We have limited the ability of fees to increase, just as we have put limits on the amount that HECS payments can increase. But unless you go down that path—unless you are committed to excellence, as we are and as the vice-chancellors are—you end up with a recipe for mediocrity. I think you should read some of the articles in today's press if you want to get a sensible assessment of it rather than just an ideological one. For example, the chairman of the Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Schreuder, says of the four principles they have committed to, `Australia should be ranked in the top five nations for higher education excellence'. He says there should be `at least one world-class research centre in each significant academic field' and that higher education services should be one of the top three value adding Australian exports. And he says more than `60 per cent of Australians should be completing higher education' over their lifetimes.

You have been around for a long time; you have not gone anywhere. This is your chance. Just ask a question. The fact is that for the first time we are allowing full fee paying students to actually take out a significant loan—up to $50,000. That will not break the bank, because they will make their own judgments about whether or not it makes sense for them to go to university. As we know, many families will scrimp and save to send their children to high-quality education institutions. Students themselves can make those choices about which universities they go to and which courses they value. The universities will have to be very conscious of not simply catering for people who have substantial sums of money and who are prepared to buy their way into courses irrespective of quality. If you are really interested in outcomes, Senator Nettle, you will be interested in a system that frees it up, that removes the dead hand of bureaucracy and that does not have all those workplace relations schemes that put premiums on grades rather than performance, and you will make sure students get a much better opportunity in the future than they are getting now. </para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11240</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I have a supplementary question.

Forty-eight hours after the budget, it is an orphan. You have already had the Treasurer stand up and say, `We know this one's not much cop, but there will be more tax cuts next year.' It has taken less than 48 hours for them to roll over and acknowledge that Senator Vanstone was dead right. We have had Senator Alston stand in this chamber today and mislead the Australian public. He talked about giving back all of the bracket creep. Let me quote Mr Peter McDonald of the Taxpayers Association of Australia. He has said that the latest tax cuts would be eroded again as soon as inflation pushed wages higher. Until then, he said, `any claim bracket creep has been paid back is a lie'. It is `a lie'—that is from Peter McDonald from the Taxpayers Association of Australia. He says that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, was forced to lift the tax rate thresholds because of the coalition's 1996 election promises. He says: </para><quote><para>When Mr Costello introduced the New Tax System, he said the average Australian would never pay more than 30 cents in the dollar in tax.</para></quote><para>What have we got? The big claim that 80 per cent of Australians would be in that 30 cents in the dollar category. What has happened? On the Treasurer's own admission, it is down to 75 per cent now and it is going lower. That is what the Treasurer knows, that is what Senator Minchin acknowledged yesterday and that is what Senator Alston is trying to cover up.</para><para>This is a budget that is designed to try and distract the Australian public, by waving a measly $4 in front of them, from what the government are trying to do with Medicare and education. They are describing them as reforms. These changes that are being put forward by the government represent John Howard's ideological obsession with transferring the cost of health and education from the government to families. The government's Medicare package will destroy Medicare and put an end to bulk-billing for families. Under the changes, doctors will be allowed to bulk-bill concession card holders, but they will be given the green light to impose a copayment for everyone else and charge what they like. That is the hidden agenda; that is what is really going on here. Two out of every three Australians who do not have a concession card can say goodbye to bulk-billing. That is what is going on here; that is what the government are trying to distract you from. These changes mean just one thing: Australian families will pay more for a visit to the doctor. The $4 a week tax cut will be swallowed over a year by just five visits to a doctor who does not bulk-bill—just five visits.</para><para>Australians will also pay more for their children's education. Families will face a difficult choice—pay more in HECS or take out loans to pay for their children's education. Families face up to a $32 per week increase in HECS debt or up to $125 a week in loan repayments. Australians already owe more than they earn. Household debt to household income has risen to 130 per cent under this government as families struggle to make ends meet. Higher loan repayments will add to the debt burden on Australian families. The government wants to slug these same Australian families an extra $5.50 each every time they buy essential medicines. These same families will on average get $400 less in family benefits this financial year due to the government's benefit clawback—one of those other little horrors this government keeps trying to hide. These higher costs for families, imposed by any one of these changes, will far outweigh benefits from the tax cuts, even before they were described as the milkshake and sandwich tax cuts.</para><para>This budget is also remarkable for the supposed reform priorities that have been ignored. The Treasurer previously has said, `Superannuation needs to be reformed.' Yet, after eight budgets, he has done nothing about it. Back in 2000 he said that the system was too complicated—too many rules, too many different taxation regimes. Three years later, there is no reform package. The government has also offered talk instead of reform in the area of water. Just recently, Mr Howard claimed there are few more important issues to our nation than water reform. What was in the budget? Nothing on water reform. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>11247</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find that the hypocrisy coming from the Labor Party this week is nothing short of breathtaking. The Labor Party have been saying that they want this government to provide tax cuts. I can understand that because when in government they never gave any. What they dished out budget after budget was an increase in the hidden taxes. The wholesale sales tax continued to go up and up and people did not know about it. It is interesting to think that the Australian Labor Party—the party that professes to be the friends of the battlers, could not care less about the battlers getting some money back. It is interesting because battlers generally battle to pay the bills. The Australian Labor Party does not believe it is important to give a battler $300 a year to pay for whatever they might want to pay for. Whether, as Senator Vanstone said, $300 a year might pay off the average mortgage a year and a half earlier at a saving of around $12,500, whether $300 a year might pay for a few months of electricity, whether $300 a year might pay for the insurance on their motor vehicle or whether $300 a year might pay for their home contents insurance, the Australian Labor Party do not care. They prefer to see them go without, and they prefer to have a Labor government that just continues to tax, tax, tax, tax. They know that they continue to tax. It is interesting because, as Senator Vanstone said in question time today, Mr Swan—one of the lesser lights in the Labor Party in the other House—said in March last year:</para></talk.start><quote><para>If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget.</para></quote><para>Isn't that interesting that Mr Swan from the Labor Party said that last year.

They are never ever going to be happy. They keep on saying, `We want tax cuts. We want tax cuts.' They get tax cuts and they do not like them.</para><para>Seven years into opposition and the Labor Party do not have one single, solitary policy. If they did, we would be able to compare this budget with their tax policy. We would be able to compare this budget with their health policy. We would be able to compare this budget with their education policy, with their defence policy and the list goes on and on. Seven years into opposition and there is not one single policy with which this budget, brought down last Tuesday, can be compared with that of Her Majesty's opposition. I think that is pretty disgraceful, but it just goes to show what a brain drain there has been in the Labor Party since the likes of Barry Jones left. No wonder there are people who are contesting the leadership all over the place. There are more contestants for the leadership than people who know what they are doing over in the Labor Party. This is just remarkable—seven years into opposition and we cannot look at a Labor Party policy. Yet all they can do is come in here and complain about the battlers being given a tax cut—complain about nine million Australians being given a tax cut. That is pretty appalling. They should be applauding a tax cut for nine million Australians, instead of whingeing, whining, carping and criticising, which is all they do—oppose, oppose, oppose.<inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>11248</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are not complaining about a tax cut for nine million Australians; we are complaining about the duplicity of the government in taking with one hand and giving with the other so that Australians are worse off.

The sums are easy to work out. The budget papers say that wages over the next 12 months will rise by four per cent. A worker on $40,000 a year—and here is the example that proves the lie to what has just been said by the Liberal Party in this chamber—facing a wage hike of four per cent over the next 12 months will pay $480 more in tax and the tax give-back by this government will be $208.

It will not be for the average Australian. University costs have been hiked. The only other thing on the budget screen which is not the positive bounce that the government wants is that Australians see through the fraud of destroying Medicare under the so-called reforms that the government has proposed on health. Medicare is an Australian icon. Medicare offers universal health protection. This government wants to remove that as a right of ordinary Australians. We see through that and so do the voters. That is the reason why this budget has got the thumbs down.</para><para>Under this budget, bracket creep—the increase of wages due to inflation pushing workers into higher tax brackets—means that higher taxation continues and the clawback by this government of wage and salary earners' dollars into the tax pool is greater. Under this budget, the cost of health and visiting the doctor will be greater, quite apart from wrecking Medicare. Under this budget, university education will become more expensive. There is nothing in this budget for the millions and millions of Australians who do not go to university but who go to technical colleges and aspire to be tradespeople or to acquire a technical skill. There is nothing in this budget at all for them. Further, there are cuts to expenditure on research and development. This country was once proudly a clever country. This country now is destroying its intellectual capital by reducing funding for research and development, removing that clever country tag, dumbing down R&amp;D in this nation, sending our scientists offshore and making sure that we are not building a pool of intellectual and smart capital for the future and for our development.</para><para>This budget will see pharmaceutical costs rise. The worrying thing is not just that in this budget pharmaceutical costs will eat into the household budget, where families increasingly under health treatment require better and more expensive drugs, but that what this government is negotiating with the United States in their free trade agreement is nothing short of the destruction of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme per se. That means that the prices of pharmaceuticals will rise to the market level that the multinational pharmaceutical companies wish to charge rather than to an affordable level under the PBS. Under this budget there are cuts to the family tax benefits as well. </para><para>In regional Australia the mining industry is in uproar because there are higher costs for diesel fuel for mining companies and explorers.

I congratulate Senator Kay Patterson for the work that she is doing to make the PBS more sustainable. We want a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At the moment the concession card holders pay only $3.70 and the general patient pays $23.10, or no more than that. As Senator Patterson has said—and it is on the public record—the cost to the taxpayer on average is $80 per prescription. That is why I am absolutely thrilled that from 1 August the full cost, the real cost, will be on the packet and on the bottle along with the government subsidy—or, putting it another way, the taxpayer subsidy. That is why we are looking for a sustainable PBS. Each month costs are going up by $50 million, an enormous amount of money, and it is blowing out to nearly $5 billion each year. We are saying that we want a modest increase in copayments, and these are being blocked in the Senate by the opposition parties.</para><para>In Tasmania, for example, we use 9.4 prescriptions per year per head of population compared to the national average of 7.9. Last year 4.43 million prescriptions were bought in Tasmania, costing $135 million. But the users paid only $20.3 million of the cost and taxpayers had to pick up the remaining $114.3 million. For every dollar that the consumer put in, the taxpayer came up with $5. As a wealthy nation we need to be caring and generous but we also need to be responsible with taxpayers' funds. That is exactly what we have done in this budget.

If you look at the statement on science and innovation put out by Minister Nelson and Minister McGauran, for instance, table 2 indicates that the total expenditure increase for the major Commonwealth research agencies is $69 million. This is in a budget of $1.372 billion. Sixty-nine million dollars does not even cover the cost of inflation. If we were to examine the total Commonwealth support as a percentage of GDP, we see that in 1996 it was 0.76 per cent of GDP and, according to this government statement, it is now 0.68 per cent. That is a decline in research investment by this government as a percentage of GDP.</para></talk.start><para>Not content with that, the government also now wants to move on our internationally renowned public research agencies such as the CSIRO. It has decided to establish a task force to examine `greater integration' between public research agencies like CSIRO and the universities. This is a fait accompli. We now know that Dr Nelson has pre-empted this task force review by announcing the merger of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville with James Cook University. On top of that, we find out that Minister McGauran has made it very clear that Mr Don McGauchie will head up this new review—Mr Don McGauchie of the National Farmers Federation fame. Mr Don McGauchie of the waterside workers dispute fame—of Patrick fame. Mr Don McGauchie has a long history of involvement with this government, and I think his views on these issues are quite clear. As I say, this is a fait accompli. An agenda has been established by the cabinet to establish a rationale for the integration of our research agencies and our universities to establish alternative funding models for the CSIRO and to force the amalgamation of various units of the CSIRO with sections of universities at a regional level. We know the reason for this. We know that there is a real danger that the CSIRO will be smashed in this process. </para><para>This is the price of the so-called reforms, but it is not the only price. We see in the university sector that there are devices being pursued by this government which will divide this society into clear winners and clear losers. We see there are obvious winners and losers in the policies that the government has been pursuing until this point. If you look at the statistics, the four top universities, the four big ones, already account for over half the annual operating surplus of the sector as a whole. The other 34 universities make do with the rest. If you look at research expenditure alone, the same four universities account for 40 per cent of all the research funds. The top eight universities get nearly 75 per cent of all the research grants handed out by the Australian Research Council. The 30 or so also-rans have to share 25 per cent of these funds amongst themselves. If you look at the top eight universities in this country, they have 35 per cent of all the enrolments and 50 per cent of the revenue and almost 75 per cent of the cash and investments. This is a government that says there is no diversity. There is huge diversity. There is diversity between the winners and the losers. The 13 regional universities will have to share 25 per cent of the enrolments but they receive 20 per cent of the total revenue and 13 per cent of the operating results. They have only 11 per cent of cash and investment. These same 13 regional universities have over one-third of the whole sector's debt, and these are the ones that are now being told that they have to opt out of research.  </para><para>We see here a policy where competition has gone mad. It is quite clear that the government wishes to establish a whole new regime of contestability of funding for universities and research agencies. That is what the establishment of these reviews, mapping exercises and various other inquiries are about. I say that those decisions have already been made. The inquiries are being established to justify those decisions. The government says that the dead hand of bureaucracy will be removed from the universities. We are noticing, though, that new contracts will be imposed on the universities, which go to the issues of staffing, industrial relations, control of students, control of research and control of teaching. This is the most interventionist government we have ever seen with regard to universities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX: TOBACCO ADVERTISING</title><title>HEALTH: IMMUNISATION</title><title>DEFENCE: PROPERTY</title><title>TRANSPORT: BASSLINK</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>11251</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Returns to Order</title><page.no>11251</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11251</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a short statement in response to a Senate order to produce documents.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—The first statement is on behalf of Senator the Hon.

The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's October 2002 report requested by Senator Allison is the draft eighth edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Immunisation Handbook </inline>that was released for public consultation in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. I table a copy of the draft handbook. It should be noted that this version of the handbook has been modified in light of the comments received during the public consultation process and following the National Health and Medical Research Council's independent review of the handbook. The draft handbook has been revised in accordance with the review comments and was reviewed by the Health Advisory Committee in May. The handbook is scheduled for presentation to the council in June for endorsement and subsequent release. In response to the second part of Senator Allison's notice of motion, there is no National Health and Medical Research Council report on the new Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's recommended vaccines of March 2003.</para><para>The third statement relates to an order following a motion moved by Senator Allison and supported by the Senate on 14 May. It related to expressions of interest in Defence land for sale at Point Nepean. I wish to inform the Senate that the government is unable to respond to the order at this stage. Documents relating to the order are still being examined. I am advised that the government will respond to the order as soon as possible.</para><para>Finally, I will now make a statement on behalf of Senator Minchin, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Once again, it is in response to an order from Senator Allison which was agreed to on 14 May, relating to the Basslink project. I inform the Senate that the government is not able to respond to the order at the moment. The documents relating to that order are still being examined and I am advised that the government will respond. However, that will not take place today. On behalf of Senator Minchin, I undertake that that will take place as soon as possible.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11252</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>11252</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>11252</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (3.35 p.m.)—I present two government responses to committee reports as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>.

I regret the delay in responding to the Report.</para><para>The recommendations made by the Committee were that:</para><para>1.	in cases involving a claim against the Commonwealth, the Attorney-General review arrangements relating to the provision of advice on funding under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (the Act) in order to ensure that any perception of a conflict of interest on the part of the Commonwealth does not arise; and</para><para>2.	based on the evidence presented during the inquiry, an independent inquiry into the Commonwealth's actions in relation to <inline font-style="italic">Ryker (Faulkner) v the Commonwealth and Flint</inline> is not justified.</para><para>The Government welcomes and accepts the second recommendation that a further inquiry is not justified.</para><para>In relation to the first recommendation, I am satisfied that the existing arrangements continue to be appropriate.</para><para>Those arrangements operate in this way:</para><para>·	In practice, the powers to approve funding are delegated to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, and the Assistant Secretary and the Director, Legal and Practice Support Section, of the Secretariat Branch of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA). </para><para>·	The delegates make decisions on applications for funding in accordance with guidelines approved by the Attorney-General. A summary of those guidelines is published in the Annual Report on the operation of the Act.</para><para>·	The delegates are bound by the APS Code of Conduct set out in the Public Service Act 1999. That Code requires, amongst other things, that they behave honestly and with integrity in the course of their employment.</para><para>·	Decisions made under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act are subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</para><para>·	In cases where the delegate requires an opinion from counsel on some aspect of a particular application, the delegate will ordinarily have access to counsel retained by solicitors acting for the trustee in bankruptcy. Even in those cases run by the Official Trustee, counsel usually are private practitioners, not officers of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS). Thus the delegate ordinarily has independent legal advice available to him or her and decides whether to authorise funding on the basis of the material presented by the trustee.</para><para>·	In rare cases, the delegate may seek legal advice from an officer from the AGS on the merits of the trustee's proposed action. In those circumstances, there could be a perception of a conflict of interest if the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency is a defendant to the proposed action, and the AGS was already acting for the defendant. In that case the AGS would decline to give advice to the delegate.</para><para>·	In this context the Solicitor-General's role is quite separate from that of the AGS. As noted by the Committee, one of the functions of the Solicitor-General under the Law Officers Act 1964 is to give his opinion on questions of law referred by the Attorney-General. The Solicitor-General is not only entitled, but is bound, to act in accordance with relevant legislation. This is the situation whether or not some person has a perception, however misconceived, that a `conflict of interest' is involved. Indeed, the Solicitor-General is a primary source of independent, expert and objective legal advice to the Attorney-General.</para><para>The Prime Minister has agreed that this letter should be treated as the Government's response to the Committee's report and, if the Committee wishes, that it be tabled.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>DARYL WILLIAMS</para><para>————— </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Reference Committee on</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Commonwealth Environment Powers</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">May 1999</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to Recommendations</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Commonwealth should not hesitate to creatively employ the wide powers it possesses in order to protect and conserve the environment and should vigorously defend its power when challenged.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth has employed, as appropriate, the powers available to it under the Constitution to institute the most fundamental reform of Australian environment legislation since the first Commonwealth environment legislation in the early 1970s.

This Bill will introduce amendments that will improve the workability of the levy collection process that plays such a central role to providing of financial assistance to superannuation funds that have suffered loss due to fraudulent conduct or theft.</para><para>In particular these reforms will significantly decrease the levy burden on large funds, whilst only placing a small increase on small funds.</para><para>Since June 2002, the Government has made nearly 380 determinations under the financial assistance provisions of Part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, to grant financial assistance to funds that have suffered loss. As a result, the Government has paid out over $20 million. The Government has maintained at all times, whilst granting financial assistance, that financial assistance provided would be recouped by the Commonwealth through a levy on the industry made in accordance with the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993 (the Levy Act).</para><para>As a result of this experience, the Government has identified a number of inefficiencies in the current framework for the collection of levies to fund the financial assistance.</para><para>Firstly, the Levy Act currently requires that separate levies must be collected for each grant of financial assistance—that is a separate levy for nearly 380 grants. This is clearly inefficient for both the party responsible for collection of the levies, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and for the trustees of funds who must make arrangements to pay 380 separate levies.</para><para>Secondly, the current levy amount imposed on a fund is a proportion of a fund's assets, in line with the determined applicable levy rate. However, the Levy Act does not allow for the specification of either a ceiling or floor on the total imposed on superannuation funds.</para><para>The recent circumstances have identified that large-scale collection of levies to recoup financial assistance is impractical. 380 separate levies would place a large compliance burden on all superannuation funds. The lack of ability to set a floor or ceiling for each levy would exacerbate the problem, as it would generate a large number of very small levy amounts (less than 20 cents in aggregate) from some funds and very large amounts (over $400,000 in aggregate) from other funds.</para><para>All but one of the grants of financial assistance have been to funds that held less than approximately $1.5 million in assets. Approximately 81 per cent of regulated funds have assets of $1.5 million or less. Ability to set a floor and a ceiling on levy amounts imposed would more equitably share the burden of financial assistance, particularly given that currently the levy burden would fall most heavily on larger public offer funds, even though recent events have suggested funds with less than $1.5 million present a greater regulatory burden for APRA.</para><para>To address these inefficiencies, this Bill introduces a provision to amend the Levy Act to allow for the specifying of a minimum and maximum levy payable in respect of any levies imposed.</para><para>This will not only ensure that a reasonable limit is imposed on the maximum levy amount payable, but additionally ensures that all superannuation funds, with the exception of self managed superannuation funds, contribute appropriately to the funding of financial assistance. It is imperative that all regulated superannuation funds contribute to financial assistance. </para><para>It also introduces a provision to enable aggregate amounts of financial assistance to be collected in one levy, rather than individually. Imposing only one levy to collect the aggregate of all financial assistance granted in a particular financial year will ensure that the levy process is simplistic and would reduce compliance costs for all superannuation funds, rather than subjecting superannuation funds to levies to deal with 380 individual levies.</para><para>The Government is proposing to make regulations pursuant to the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993 to recoup financial assistance prior to the end of the financial year. I call on all Members to ensure that the levy can take into account these changes and reduce the administrative and cost burden, which would eventuate under the current provisions.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of these bills be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>11261</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>11261</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11261</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—This statement is made on behalf of the Minister for Science and it addresses the order arising from Senator Lyn Allison's motion and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja's notice of motion.

This is about the government's decision to establish a shortlist of sites for an intermediate waste dump for nuclear material. This is a decision that the government has now postponed for over a year. We are being told that the government cannot, in response to this order, provide a list of sites because it is `ministerial advice'. In effect, that is the proposition we have been told—that this is advice to the minister and therefore we are not entitled to see it.</para><para>It has been a year since this government postponed this decision. I think we are entitled to know what action the government intends to take about the storage of about 500 cubic metres of very dangerous materials. We on this side of the chamber take the view that there ought to be a national store and we have maintained that position throughout this debate, but we will not be able to argue a case logically and coherently within the community if we do not know what the government is intending to do and, in particular, what sites it is proposing for the establishment of this store. What is really critical here is that the national regulator who deals with the nuclear industry, Dr Loy, who heads up ARPANSA, has made it perfectly clear that the licence to operate the new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights will not be given when that project is concluded, presumably in about two years time, unless there is a clear and unequivocal coherent national strategy for the disposal of nuclear waste.</para><para>The government has committed $500 million of capital to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. It is the major source of the nuclear waste that is the subject of this return to order. The government is endangering that project by its failure to respond to the clear advice to the regulator and the nuclear industry in this country. The government has known for a very long period of time what its obligations are, and yet it delays and delays and delays—in just identifying a shortlist. A whole series of other processes have to go on for the establishment of a site after that shortlist is revealed. Frankly, it is just not good enough for the government to say that it will not tell the parliament what that shortlist consists of. It is just not appropriate to argue that this is a matter of ministerial advice. </para><para>We are looking here at a matter of political expediency, where it is not interested in taking this parliament into its confidence in dealing with a difficult public policy issue. Government secrecy on matters like this does not help public debate. We know how hard it is going to be in terms of the arguments to and fro on the issue of the storage of nuclear waste. We have said all along what our commitment is in terms of a national store. We believe there should be national facilities. This is a Commonwealth responsibility. You cannot leave this sort of stuff lying around in sheds as we have at the moment. You cannot have nuclear waste being treated in the contemptuous manner in which this government is treating it.</para><para>A shipment of materials was supposed to have gone to France last year. If I recall rightly, $11 million was allocated for that project for reprocessing of spent fuel rods. The shipment was not sent, because it appears there were serious `operational reasons', as they call them, for that not happening. We now have a problem where the Argentinean government is clearly having difficulty in getting the contractual arrangements in place and the constitutional changes required to actually allow for reprocessing in that country. The government is running out of options when it comes to the issue of nuclear waste. It must establish its proposed shortlist for sites for this facility. It will not do to try to come in here and suggest to us that, because it is ministerial advice, we are not entitled to have a look at it. That excuse has been well worn. You have had over 12 months to do something about this, and you continue to fail. I am totally dissatisfied with the government's response to this return to order.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11262</page.no><id.no>S186</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11262</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 3 December 1998, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>11262</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have back here this afternoon the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]</inline>, which was first brought before this chamber in 1998. At the outset, I thank all involved, including Senator Ian Campbell, opposition members, the Democrats and the Independents for facilitating the bill being brought before the Senate this afternoon. There is a general hope that the bill will be read a third time. Because it is a Constitution amendment bill, I flag the need for a rollcall under the provisions of the Constitution and our standing orders at the end of this debate. Senators might be aware that, if we have a third reading vote, there will be a rollcall of senators because, under the provisions of the Constitution, an absolute majority is required for a Constitution amendment bill to proceed at that stage.</para></talk.start><para>As every election approaches, 1½ million teachers, posties and other public servants who might like to stand for parliament have to decide whether it is worth resigning their jobs in order to do so. Australian citizens who are also citizens of another country—that is, they have dual citizenship—have to go to great lengths to repudiate that second citizenship if they want to nominate for election here. Section 44 of the Constitution is the problem. It stops anyone who holds `an office of profit under the Crown' or who is a citizen of another country—that is, they hold dual citizenship—from nominating for this parliament. That dual citizen component prevents another five million or so Australians from standing for parliament.  </para><para>There is a question mark about pensioners who arguably may be said have an office of profit under the Crown—that includes disability pensioners, old age pensioners and, indeed, unemployment benefit recipients and recipients of other benefits—as to whether they would be able to stand. There are between five and seven million Australians who, under the current constitutional provision, cannot stand for their own parliament. That is because the Constitution was written in the 1890s—and we are now in the first decade of the 21st century—and things have moved a great deal since then.</para><para>Section 44 deprives the federal parliament of a huge pool of talented potential politicians. At every recent election it has caused trouble and expense as someone unwittingly falls foul of the Constitution. Everyone agrees that section 44 should be changed. All parties supported a Greens motion in the Senate to that effect in October 1996 and called on the then government to bring forward a proposal for constitutional amendment. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, reporting on the 1996 election, recommended:</para><motion><para>that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election—</para></motion><para>which would have been 1998—</para><quote><para>a referendum be held on a) applying the `office of profit' disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination—</para></quote><para>so it would not catch people up with nomination—</para><quote><para>and b) deleting section 44(i) on `foreign allegiance' and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.</para></quote><para>That was recommendation 39. Then the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined in detail sections 44(i) and 44(iv) of the Constitution and recommended that a referendum be held to amend them. The government's response to those recommendations has been supportive. It states:</para><quote><para>Subject to the qualifications outlined below, the government would support amendments of subsections 44(i) and (iv) of the Constitution to overcome the shortcomings identified by the Committee.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>... it accepts that constitutional and legislative action is the only realistic way in which to overcome these shortcomings. </para></quote><para>That quotation is from the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which was titled <inline font-style="italic">Aspects of section 44 of the Constitution</inline>.</para><para>However, no bill for a referendum has been forthcoming. It is now on the record that on 3 December 1998, when I first brought this bill before the Senate, there was a debate in private members' time but no conclusion was reached as a result of that debate. I have now brought the bill forward. We greatly hope that because this is such an important matter—and I have no doubt that it will have the support of the Australian populace at large—we ought to put it to the people so that the referendum can be held so that the millions of Australian citizens effectively get their full citizenship. It is an extraordinarily important component of an egalitarian country that no-one should be deprived of the ability to stand for his or her parliament and to represent her or his people. This bill is the simplest possible way of amending the Constitution to fix the problem. No-one disputes that.  </para><para>I am grateful to the opposition and to Mr McClelland in the House of Representatives and his staff for suggesting a minor amendment which I have circulated and which is in line with the aforesaid committee's recommendation to government back in 1996 and which simplifies the bill before the chamber this afternoon.

This bill was last debated in the Senate in December 1998. Senator Brown is to be commended for raising it. As we did on the earlier occasion, the opposition will again be supporting this bill as a constructive step forward in the campaign to reform section 44 of the Constitution. The bill would amend section 44 in two main ways. First, it would amend subsection (i) to allow an Australian citizen with dual citizenship to stand for, and be elected to, parliament. The current prohibition on a person who is `under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power' would be repealed. Since the bill was last debated, the High Court determined in 1999 that Heather Hill could not be elected to the Senate because she was a `citizen of a foreign power'. In that case, the foreign power was the United Kingdom.</para></talk.start><para>Today, more than four million Australians hold dual citizenship, which is up from about three million in 1986. It has long been possible for Australians to acquire dual citizenship in a number of ways. It can happen without their knowledge, such as when another country's laws automatically confer citizenship upon them. Last year, after many decades of community debate, this parliament passed laws which provided for the first time that an adult Australian citizen will not lose their Australian citizenship if they take action to acquire the citizenship of another country. Australians now recognise that dual citizenship is a way of life. They would expect the Constitution not to impose arbitrary restrictions on their capacity to participate in Australian democratic institutions. Senator Brown's amendment recognises this fact. However, Australians would also insist that all members of this parliament have a clear and undivided loyalty to the Australian nation. In Labor's view, it is essential that any change to section 44(i) be accompanied by safeguards to prevent divided loyalties. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended in 1997 that parliament enact legislation determining the grounds for the disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. That or a similar recommendation must be implemented as part of any reform of section 44.</para><para>The second amendment proposed by the bill would disqualify holders of judicial office, and other public offices declared by the parliament, from standing or being elected to parliament. This would replace the current disqualification in section 44 of a person who `holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth'. That part of section 44 is intended to ensure that the members of parliament do not hold an office that is incompatible with their legislative responsibilities to the parliament and the Australian people. However, the language of the subsection has produced nothing but uncertainty, particularly in areas of the public sector. Senator Brown's amendment is broadly consistent with the 1997 recommendations of the House of Representatives committee, although it would, in the opposition's view, make more sense to repeal the final paragraph of section 44 altogether than to make the limited amendment to that paragraph proposed by the bill. </para><para>A recent instance—no doubt fresh in Senator Brown's mind—in which section 44(iv) attracted comment was the election of Mr Michael Organ as the member for Cunningham in October last year. On 19 December, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> carried an article entitled `Employment cloud over Green MP' which speculated that Mr Organ, who continued to be employed as an archivist by the University of Wollongong after he nominated and was elected, might be disqualified from parliament because he held `an office of profit under the Crown'. In that article, constitutional lawyers discussed inconclusively the extent to which universities are controlled by the executive of government. I make no observation about Mr Organ's circumstances, but there can be no doubt that the current federal government has sought to exercise an unprecedented degree of control over the internal affairs of universities, in particular over the employment conditions of their research and teaching staff.</para><para>In this week's budget we saw the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, copy his predecessor, Dr Kemp, and tie university funding to workplace reform—a euphemism used by this government for kicking unions out of the workplace, pushing employees onto individual contracts and restricting their right to bargain collectively over their conditions of employment. Even the Federal Court was moved to observe in April last year that Dr Kemp's policy `may fairly be regarded as having little to do with the proper functioning of universities in this country and rather more to do with the government's industrial relations agenda'. Sadly, the words of a wise judge were not enough to prick the dormant Labor conscience of the ambitious Dr Nelson. It is reasonable to suggest that as long as this government continues to try to control the employment relationship between universities and their staff, a constitutional cloud will hang over any university employee who seeks election to this parliament. We can hardly call ourselves the clever country if our Constitution forces clever Australians to avoid the risk of standing for election if it means quitting their jobs. The government's meddling in our universities simply adds to the weight of the argument for the reform of this particular section.</para><para>I should stress that the opposition strongly believes that, before these proposals are put to a referendum, further consideration should be given to the precise wording of the amendments and also to what other constitutional reforms are appropriate to go to a referendum at the same time. A referendum demands a large public investment of time and attention, not to mention money. It is an opportunity that should not be squandered on just one issue; if we were going to use a referendum, then it should also include those issues that require constitutional reform.</para><para>Once again, it is a matter of regret that this bill is being sponsored by a private member rather than by the government. History demonstrates that referenda stand little chance of success unless they are supported by all parties and the government assumes a role of responsibility and leadership on the issue. Perhaps it is the pervasive influence of the Prime Minister in the coalition parties, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, since the referendum on the republic, the government has been asleep in a hammock on constitutional reform. The opportunity to debate these issues once again in the Senate is welcome. </para><para>While Senator Brown is currently leading the push to reform section 44, proposals to amend section 44 have had a long history in our constitutional debates. As far back as the constitutional conventions of the 1890s and during the first Electoral Act debate in 1902, aspects of section 44 and the electoral laws relating to it were the subject of extremely vigorous debate. Section 44 has been the subject of Senate reports in 1981 and in 1988, and the final report of the Constitutional Commission recommended a number of changes to section 44 itself, including making Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for office, major reform to the office of profit provisions, and a wide range of other reforms such as making unsoundness of mind a ground for disqualification and removing the bankruptcy provisions as included in section 44(iii). The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, in their post-election reports, regularly remark on section 44. In 1994 the committee remarked:</para><quote><para>The most effective means of removing the uncertainty over the office of profit disqualification would be to remove section 44(iv) of the Constitution.</para></quote><para>It is a grave matter that I am sure the senators from the coalition are interested in. In 1996 section 44 reached national prominence following the court case that led to the removal of Miss Jackie Kelly. Following the subsequent by-election, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution initiated by Senator Brown which stated:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a) notes:</para><para>(i) the High Court ruling of 11 September 1996 that the 1996 federal election result in the House of Representatives seat of Lindsay was invalid, and</para><para>(iii) that section 44 of the Constitution impedes many Australian citizens from standing for Parliament, including citizens holding dual citizenship, public servants and certain others who may be holding an office of profit under the Crown; and</para><para>(b) calls on the Federal Government to respond with a proposal for amendment.</para></motion><para>The report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters following the 1996 election recommended:</para><motion><para>that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election, a referendum be held on a) applying the “office of profit” disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination, and b) deleting section 44(i) on “foreign allegiance” and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.</para></motion><para>In July 1997 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs investigated aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, making similar recommendations.</para><para>Section 44 clearly has had both a colourful and long career in this house and in the other place as well. Clearly, there is still a lack of necessary willingness by the government to do anything about it. Senator Brown's bill, which is the subject of today's motion, proposes changes to section 44 of the Constitution which describes disqualifications from holding federal parliamentary office. It is time that this government took note and used it rather than allowing this debate to be had again. This debate was also held in 1998. I did not have the opportunity to participate in it then but I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in it now. It is an important section that does need amendment. It is a significant issue that should be addressed and one that this government has had ample time and opportunity to address, but it has failed to act. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11267</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to congratulate Senator Brown for raising these very important constitutional issues. The issues that are raised by Senator Brown in the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]</inline> reflect some of the constitutional and historical tensions that still have not been played out in this nation, in particular the growth of the influence of the state and government on the lives of citizens. Also, and perhaps even more importantly, there is the influence on those people who can be elected to federal parliament—it affects the pool of people who are eligible for federal parliament. So these are important issues, and it is a very important thing that Senator Brown has done. Certainly these issues are worthy of debate in the Australian Senate.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the qualifications or, indeed, the disqualification of members of parliament, particularly subsections 44(i) and 44(iv), have their shortcomings. There is no doubt about that all. Much has changed, as my friend Senator Ludwig said, since the 1890s, and our constitutional founders could not have been expected to understand the rise of citizenship rights and the influence of government on the lives of every Australian. In essence, this bill seeks to clarify the position in relation to dual citizenship under section 44(i) of the Constitution and those who hold offices of profit under the Crown in relation to section 44(iv) of the Constitution.</para><para>Let me commence with section 44(i). Even though it may be in archaic language, I think the principle still holds true. Section 44(i) is based on the principle that members of parliament must have a clear and undivided loyalty to the Australian community. It attempts to avoid both actual and perceived conflicts of interest that may flow from any allegiance or loyalty owed to another nation-state. It does embody the particular considerations that prevailed at the end of the 19th century in Australia. At the time our Constitution was drawn up in the late 1890s, there was no concept of Australian citizenship; we were simply British subjects and aliens. Despite the different social and political context of the late 1890s, the policy on which section 44(i) was based remains valid—that is, that parliamentarians must not be subject to undue external influence that could prejudice the performance of their duties on behalf of members of the Australian public.</para><para>A person having allegiance to a foreign power could be unduly influenced by that power. That, again, is the principle behind section 44(i). As Senator Ludwig said in his eloquent address, section 44(i) has been interpreted on several occasions by the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. The court has held that the election of a person who was not an Australian citizen at any material time during the election is void. Of course, we will remember the case of Senator Wood in 1998. Odgers throws some light on the critical legal question here. At page 154, Odgers states:</para><quote><para>Paragraph (i.) of section 44, relating to adherence to a foreign power, has been construed by the Court—</para></quote><para>that is, the High Court—</para><quote><para>as relating only to a person who has formally or informally acknowledged allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power and who has not revoked that acknowledgement. In relation to persons who have dual nationality—</para></quote><para>that is a big issue in this country; we will get to that— </para><quote><para>the question is to be determined by whether the person has taken reasonable steps to renounce a foreign nationality, and what amounts to the taking of reasonable steps depends on the circumstances of a particular case.</para></quote><para>We all remember the cases of Sykes v. Cleary and, of course, the would-be senator Heather Hill, elected at the 1998 federal election.</para><para>That is what the court has said. Senator Brown is right: there are real problems with section 44(i). Why? It is because section 44(i) does not make clear what actions or omissions will result in disqualification in circumstances involving dual citizenship. What is the test? It is open, it is vague and it is uncertain. Reasonable steps at least must be taken to avoid foreign associations of the kind covered by that subsection. However, the reasonableness of any particular course will depend on the circumstances of the case and cannot always be predicted in advance. Before I go on, I will relate this to an aspiring politician. People are uncertain when they run for political office as to whether they will in fact qualify. Because of that uncertainty and the number of people holding dual citizenship in this country, the pool of people that can run for political office is smaller and diluted. That is a problem for our democracy. The issue of dual citizenship and the way a prospective member of parliament deals with that issue will be very important. Moreover, the country of dual citizenship might also be very important. Some countries make it impossible or virtually impossible to renounce citizenship. It is often unclear to prospective members of parliament what they need to do.</para><para>This is particularly important given this parliament's recent passage of legislation that in effect encourages dual citizenship. In that context, this is a big issue. Allow me to be specific. For example, what do the words in section 44(i) `under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power' mean? I will give a clear example: my brother served in the French Foreign Legion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—What was he running away from?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>—Probably from me, Senator Murray. Is my brother's service in the French Foreign Legion a direct form of allegiance to a foreign power? Perhaps it was. Perhaps it is clear that when he was serving it was a form of allegiance. I understand that. When my brother left the French Foreign Legion, did he have any residual allegiances to another nation-state? That is the question. Is there, in effect, a retired list for the French Foreign Legion? If there is, what did his oath of allegiance mean, and what did his contract of employment say? My point is that it is unclear.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Once you are a member of the legion, you can become entitled to become a French citizen.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>—I take Senator Kemp's interjection because it is a good one. My brother's entry to the French Foreign Legion gave him, in effect, residual rights to become a French citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union. Does that mean he was under an acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power? You can see the point, Mr Acting Deputy President. It would be uncertain and therefore difficult if my brother wanted to join me here in federal parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, what do the words `entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power' mean? Even if someone has renounced their citizenship of a particular country—for example, of the United Kingdom or the United States—in many cases residual rights might remain. What happens if you have a right to a British pension or a United States pension or a pension from the French Foreign Legion? Is that a residual right? Under the words of the Constitution, is that a `right or privilege of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power'? I do not know the answer to that and that is why it is a very interesting question. </para><para>Importantly, what about Australian citizens who are not dual citizens but, because of the laws of other nations, may have a right to apply for dual citizenship which would ordinarily exclude them under section 44(i) of the Constitution? For example, many millions of Australians have a right to apply for British citizenship because they have a parent who is a British subject, or they may be able to apply for Irish citizenship. As I stand here now I wonder whether I might even qualify for Irish citizenship. But you see the point, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, and it is a serious point. Is that a right and a privilege of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power? Is that a residual right? I am just asking the question and I think it is a fair question. No doubt some of my republican friends sitting on the other side of the chamber do not like the word `subject' and would prefer `citizen' but I think that is perhaps one of the less important aspects of the debate so I will not enter that debate.</para><para>I will move on now to the second part of Senator Brown's bill, which relates to section 44(iv) and which embodies the principles that the executive and the legislature should be separated and that the executive should not be in a position to unduly influence the legislature. Who would ever believe that the executive tries to unduly influence the legislature? Who would ever think that the executive tries to unduly influence parliament? What an outrageous thing. </para><para>Section 44(iv) also seeks to prevent citizens from simultaneously holding two offices which could lead to a conflict of duties. Again, section 44(iv) has a very respectable constitutional history. In the 18th century, the British parliament was concerned that the Crown would use its powers of patronage to suborn members of the House of Commons and thereby undermine the independence of the House of Commons. That principle is fair enough. We may not agree with the language, and the fact that problems have been raised is right, but the principle is fair.</para><para>Section 44(iv) is intended to prevent the gaining of control of the legislature if a large number of members of parliament, of office holders, appointed by the executive had a disproportionate control over members of parliament. That is the problem. In a sense, we do not want members of parliament under the patronage of the executive, given jobs by the executive, and therefore subject to undue influence of the executive. That is a fair principle.</para><para>As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs stated in its report of July 1997:</para><quote><para>The provision is concerned with the ability of the parliament to hold the executive to account and therefore it is necessary to ensure that enough members of parliament are free from the influence of the Crown to achieve this.</para></quote><para>All honourable senators would agree with this principle.</para><para>The second principle fundamental to section 44(iv) is that some offices are incompatible with membership of the parliament. The House of Representatives committee report of July 1997 stated that incompatibility can arise in two ways: the first was a risk of conflict of duties involved in attempting to satisfy the demand of both offices and the second was that some offices, for example judicial offices, are considered to be so sensitive that if the holders of such offices became embroiled in political controversy the offices themselves may be damaged. </para><para>Section 44(iv) is highly problematic. I want to tell a little story about how it operated in my case. I was a full-time academic in Queensland working for a university. I remember that the question was raised, `Brett, do you hold an office of profit under the Crown?' The principle here is this: it was perhaps okay in my case because the particularities of my preselection and order on the Senate ticket meant I was very likely to be elected. However, let us say I had a slim chance or a fifty-fifty chance; I would have had to resign from a tenured position at university to run for parliament. Even then you might say that that is fine. However, I could not get legal advice one way or another as to whether a tenured academic at a university holds an office of profit under the Crown. The advice I was given was absolutely equivocal. I sought advice from law firms and friends who were barristers and no-one could tell me with certainty whether or not I held an office of profit under the Crown. In my particular case, I resigned and was fairly confident of being elected given the particularities of my case. However, if I had been running for a marginal seat, I could not have resigned. You cannot just leave a tenured position, whether in the Public Service, at a university or whatever, and run for a seat, lose and then try to get back in. That would not be very easy.</para><para>The point is—and, again, I have to emphasise it—that section 44(iv) reduces the pool of people eligible to run for parliament. That is problem. In a sense, it inhibits our democracy and makes it much more difficult to attract people from the public sector and more broadly, and that is the problem with it. I have plenty of other points to make about section 44(iv), but I want to conclude with perhaps some problems with the process—not with the principles you have raised, Senator Brown, because I have to say that I largely agree with you. </para><para>There are, of course, problems with a referendum. All of us know—we are all politicians here—the problems with referendums. We know we have to have bipartisan support otherwise it simply will not get through. Even with bipartisan support, it still might not get through. I think we all accept that. Not only are section 44(i) and section 44(iv) highly problematic; so is section 44(v). Again, it is very difficult to know exactly what it means. </para><para>In short, the matters of principle raised by Senator Brown are valid. I think, however, that when the Constitution was first drafted the principles were correct. But somewhere in the last 100 years the state has become much bigger. The corporate state developed by our friends in the Labor Party—where you have big unions, big government and big business all intertwined like some sort of large octopus—makes it impossible to have the classic liberal distinction between public and private. That is why `office of profit under the Crown' these days is nearly a meaningless expression. There are contracts with government. There are people who work in universities, schools and elsewhere. And the fact is that they should be able to run for public office or, at least, there should be some device that enables them to come back to their former jobs in any case. </para><para>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Senator Brown for raising these issues. I think they are valid. But I do think that the issue of constitutional change is broader than this; there are problems indeed in implementing these changes. I thank Senator Brown for raising these issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11270</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]</inline>—and even I cannot invent an acronym for that long title. This bill has three elements that intend to alter the application of section 44 of the Constitution with regard to the disqualification provisions affecting those who stand for public office. I must say before I get into the body of my remarks that I thought Senator Mason's analysis was both apposite and entertaining.  </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the bill would delete the prohibition enshrined in section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution that a person could not seek election to the parliament if that person were a citizen of another country or owed an allegiance of some kind to another nation. The bill proposes to replace this with a simple requirement that all candidates for political office be Australian citizens—an eminently sensible view. Most senators know that section 44(i) of the Constitution has long provoked litigation—the leading case is still Sykes v. Cleary No. 2 of 1992. </para><para>The section was drawn up at a time when there was no concept of Australian citizenship, when Australian residents were either British subjects or aliens. I have always liked the word `aliens'—it has that out of world approach. I once came across the bureaucratic use of the word. A friend of mine was born in South Africa, resided in southern Rhodesia, as it was at the time, and had taken up citizenship there. He came to the notice of the South African government, who thought him undesirable. So they took away his South African citizenship based on birth, then proclaimed him an alien and deported him, which I always thought was a very cunning ploy. Anyway, he survived the tale.</para><para>Back to the section: it was designed to ensure that the parliament was devoid of aliens, as so defined at that time. The Democrats accept, however, that the sentiment of that section—that only Australians should be eligible to stand as representatives for the federal parliament—is a valid and a continuing one. That is not to say that section 44(i) of the Constitution as it currently stands is the most appropriate and adapted to achieving that end; rather it contains notions such as `any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power'. </para><para>Again, as an aside, I had cause to ask the Clerk for his opinion on the oath that we all swear to the Queen of England, who is also the Queen of Australia. As usual his advice was intriguing, but his conclusion was that we were not breaching the Constitution. These concepts are obviously subject to disparate and perhaps dangerous interpretation by judges. Is it to be the case that some future member will lose their seat because while in office they have been made an honorary citizen of another country, purely as part of the diplomatic process? Then there was the case of the Foreign Legion, which I must say was interesting. Such a result would, of course, be an absurdity.</para><para>Further, in the context of the current debate over the eventual move to a republic, such reference to a foreign power does bring the oath that each member and senator takes upon assuming his or her seat into apparent contradiction with the existing constitutional provision. Senators will recall that the oath requires members to swear that they will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and her successors according to law. On a strict reading you would think that that was an unequivocal declaration of `allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power', as prohibited by section 44(i). </para><para>As it currently stands, section 44(i) is wholly unsuited to achieving its aims for the reasons I have outlined above and for those that other speakers have outlined. Like many sections of our Constitution, it has lost its workability a century after its drafting. The proposed replacement in the bill for this section—that the qualification simply be that a person must be an Australian citizen—is sound. However, we should take account of the valuable work that has been done in this area by various parliamentary bodies in assessing whether the present bill is sufficient.  </para><para>In July 1997, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs produced a report recommending that section 44(i) be replaced by a provision requiring that all candidates be Australian citizens. It went further to suggest that the new provision empower the parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members in relation to foreign allegiance—that is, the committee acknowledged that there are some situations, such as where a Prime Minister holds dual citizenship, that may cause concern to the Australian people. A provision leaving the door open to parliament to put in place some better expressed requirements with respect to dual citizenship would seem a sensible recommendation.</para><para>I further note that the Constitutional Commission in its final report in 1988 recommended that subsection 44(i) be deleted and that Australian citizenship instead be the requirement for candidacy, with the parliament being empowered to make laws as to residency requirements. Going further back, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1981 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The constitutional qualifications of Members of Parliament </inline>recommended that Australian citizenship be the constitutional qualification for parliamentary membership, with questions of the various grades of foreign allegiance being relegated to the legislative sphere. I think that, too, is an eminently sensible view.</para><para>It is therefore clear to us, especially in view of the multicultural nature of Australian society and especially in view of the recent changes to citizenship and dual citizenship—which all parties welcomed—that contemporary standards demand that Australian citizenship be the sole requirement for being chosen for parliament under a new subsection 44(i), with a residual legislative power being given to the parliament to deal with unique cases that may arise from time to time.</para><para>The second element of the bill deals with the office of profit under the Crown—that is the issue of subsection 44(iv). Again, this section featured in the Sykes v. Cleary litigation. The bill proposes to delete subsection 44(iv) and substitute a requirement that only judicial officers must resign their positions prior to election, as well as empowering the parliament to legislate for other specified offices to be vacated. Quite frankly, I have long believed that the office of profit under the Crown provision is more offensive than the Australian citizenship provision, simply because it excludes so many people.</para><para>Subsection 44(iv) has its origins in the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 in the United Kingdom. Its purpose there was essentially to do with the separation of powers, the idea being to prevent undue control of the House of Commons by members employed by the Crown. Obviously, times have changed, even though the ancient struggle between the executive and the parliament continues to this day. Whilst this provision may have been appropriate 300 years ago, the growth of the machinery of government has meant that its contemporary effect is to prevent the many hundreds of thousands of citizens employed over the years in the public sector from standing for election without resigning their office and therefore without any real justification. My own party and my own state of Western Australia at the 1998 election is an example: there were 14 lower house seats there, yet seven potential Democrat candidates were unable to stand due to their unwillingness to resign from their public sector positions. There are of course now 15 seats. </para><para>The Australian Democrats have a long history of trying to rectify this part of the Constitution; in fact, it is a 23-year history. In February 1980—23 years ago—former Democrat senator Colin Mason moved a motion in this chamber which resulted in the inquiry I referred to earlier by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs into the government's order that public servants resign before nomination for election. We have sought to alter section 44(iv) four times through the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualifications of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1985, the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualifications of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1989, the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualification of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1992 and the Constitutional Alteration (Electors' Initiative, Fixed Term Parliaments and Qualification of Members) Bill 2000. We have also covered the issue extensively in both our 1996 and 1998 federal election minority reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. None of our very practical bills have yet been allowed to go to the vote or to be debated to the stage where they could go to the other house. I am hopeful that at least this bill will make it that far. I am even more hopeful—perhaps it is a vain hope—that the government might consider dealing with it on its merits.</para><para>I further note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997 recommended that subsection 44(iv) be deleted and replaced by provisions preventing judicial officers from nominating without resigning their posts and other provisions empowering the parliament to specify other offices which would be declared vacant should the office holder be elected to parliament. Subsection 2(2) of the bill in its current form will not achieve this. While some offices, such as those of a judicial nature, must be resigned prior to candidacy, no provision is made for other offices to be declared vacant upon a candidate being successfully elected. It would be absurd, of course, if public servants could retain their positions after having been elected to parliament. It is essential that a mechanism be put in place declaring vacant certain specified offices upon their holders being elected.</para><para>The third element of the bill seeks to delete entirely the last subsection of section 44. I am pleased that this section has been amended to be aligned with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997. It must be noted though that the changes proposed in this bill incorporate only a selection of the recommendations made in that report. In my opinion—and our opinion—it would be ideal if the bill incorporated all or most of the committee's recommendations.</para><para>These issues under section 44 have been debated for decades. I think there is general consensus among all political parties and probably among all the Independents that this situation needs to be rectified. The government should take a position of leadership and deal with this issue in time for the next federal election. At some time and in some place, governments of the day need to attend to this one and I really cannot see the Australian people resisting these sorts of changes. Maybe I am ignorant of the likely arguments to be thrown up opposing it, but I cannot see that this sort of change would be that difficult these days. In conclusion, I indicate that the Democrats will support the bill and the Labor amendments to the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11274</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Achieving constitutional change in Australia is particularly difficult as it requires not only a majority vote but a majority of states to vote in favour of it. It is fairly clear to me that it is very easy to distort any proposal for constitutional change. It is very easy to run scare tactics. It is very easy to demonise any prospective change.</para></talk.start><para>My first involvement in support of a constitutional change was only as a very minor functionary in 1967 when the then coalition government proposed two constitutional amendments. The first was on recognising Aboriginals as properly constituted Australian citizens, and that romped in. The second was to break the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives. We had got into a situation where it was quite obvious that the House of Representatives would benefit from enlargement, but a lot of people did not want to see the Senate enlarged at the same time. This was as a result of the 1957 inquiry which a lot of notable liberal jurists and also Gough Whitlam were on. In effect, I watched that campaign being destroyed by the DLP, who had a very simple message: don't vote for more politicians. It appealed to all the lowest, basest instincts that they could muster. And they won. A small political party was able to knock over what was a very rational political change. The lesson we have learnt is that it is exceptionally hard to get constitutional change through in Australia, no matter how logical your case is.</para><para>What has really evolved in the last 25 years? The only chance of constitutional change is if a coalition of the Liberal and National parties in government puts that change forward and is supported by the Labor Party. It never happens in reverse because we find that the opportunists opposite always oppose any Labor proposal for constitutional change, no matter what it is. They think that is what their job is because they are in opposition. They do not think in broad national terms.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Oh!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—`Oh!', says the minister at the table. In 1974 you opposed a certain constitutional change. You then put up a similar change in 1977 to be supported, and when we put it up in 1988 you opposed it. Well I remember that debate here because Senator Chaney took a full hour to try to explain why they had double-flipped so often. When I got up and pointed that out to the chamber I got a very vicious message from the switch here from Fred Chaney's mother, criticising me for pointing out these double standards. So I remember the debate exceptionally well. But that is the reality of constitutional change: unless it is proposed by a conservative government and supported by Labor it has no chance whatsoever of going through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Should this piece of legislation moved by Senator Brown come to pass, the reality is that we are not going to have a referendum costing $50 million to resolve problems of section 44 of the Constitution. It is just not going to happen and, if we did, it would get defeated. It would get defeated because the public would say, `Why are you spending $50 million and dragging us out on a Saturday afternoon on these technical matters?' I am afraid that that is the reality of it. But, at some stage in the future, when a government puts a package of reasonable constitutional amendments—not ones that do not attract a massive partisanship—and attaches a further referendum on this subject it may well go through. Therefore, these debates today and debates in the future around these issues are quite essential.</para><para>But I suspect that what will happen with this legislation is that it may well pass today. It will go to over to the House of Representatives and—guess what!—it will never be heard of again. But that is more a condemnation of the undemocratic nature of the other house these days—that is not a partisan comment; it has been made as irrelevant by the Labor Party when in government as it has by the Liberal-National parties. It is not a parliamentary chamber anymore. It is just a show trial; it is just a place where executive dominates and there is no independence of thought whatsoever. I think we are a bit better than that. I do not want to put too big a gloss on the Senate—let us not get too Senate chauvinistic in these things—but at least you get a little more in this chamber. </para><para>These matters have been looked at over the years. They were best looked at by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported back in 1981. In fact, it was the first Senate report I ever read, because I arrived here in July 1981 when it was tabled. People like Senator Durack and Senator Gareth Evans and others—it was a very high-powered committee—wrote quite a brilliant report. Interestingly enough, they wrote it themselves. These days, we do not often see a Senate report written by senators. It is usually drafted by the committee and amended and polished by senators, but this one was virtually written word for word by the senators themselves. It did deal with this vexatious question of office of profit. This has plagued this parliament in its interpretation for many years.</para><para>We are not allowed, of course, to criticise High Court judgments, so let me congratulate the High Court on the unique cleverness it has had in interpreting this particular section of the Constitution! It takes a great mind to come up with such an obtuse interpretation of these particular matters as they have over the years. You have to be particularly devious to interpret section 44 in the way that they have. Of course, the first big test case, to my knowledge, was the Webster case in 1975. This was when Senator Webster basically outed himself, I think, and said that a company he was involved in had contracts with the Commonwealth. This was referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, constituted in the High Court.</para><para>There are some remarkable aspects of that case. Firstly, Chief Justice Garfield Barwick monopolised the whole proceedings. Instead of having a sitting of two or three judges, he did the whole case himself—he allocated it to himself. So you have a former Liberal Attorney-General judging a National Party member—I would have thought that that would have worried the National Party more than anything else! Nevertheless, he did it all by himself and came up with one of the most convoluted and disgraceful judgments that has ever been handed down in the High Court. It is one which we should take no account of in terms of precedence. Nevertheless, he found that Senator Webster had not breached the office of profit under the Crown provision. Looking back in modern day terms, I think I might also make the judgment that Senator Webster had not breached the office of profit section. But I would not ever do so on the bases that Justice Barwick proffered in his judgment, which were highly technical and, in fact, probably wrong at law and a total misrepresentation and misinterpretation of the intention of the founding fathers as revealed in the convention debates.</para><para>One of the next cases we had was that of Mr Phil Cleary. He won the seat of Wills in a by-election and, some months after, was challenged—I think it was by Sykes, but I am not sure; I think it was by a losing candidate that got about one per cent of the vote—and deemed to hold an office of profit. He had basically not taught in a secondary school for years; he was on leave. Yet the High Court said, `No, you are disqualified from office because you still held an office of profit under the Crown.' The main intention of this office of profit thing was not whether he could influence events but whether a government could have a hold over him. So he was dismissed, but it did not interrupt his political career for a particularly long time, because an election was coming up in 1983. </para><para>Then we had the classic case of Senator Ferris. Senator Ferris was elected to this place in March 1996, I think, and was due to take her place here on 1 July 1996. She was then employed under the members of staff act as a ministerial adviser to Senator Minchin and had not only a salary but a travel allowance and a number of other emoluments associated with that office. A very perceptive person in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services Division picked this up and had to warn the minister that Senator Ferris had probably breached section 44 of the Constitution.</para><para>These matters came to my attention and were raised in this parliament. I do not think any particular blame should be placed on Senator Ferris, who probably was inexperienced in these matters. How the government and Senator Minchin managed to miss these matters remains a mystery to me today, because it shows a degree of ineptness not normally associated with that minister. Nevertheless, he was in a position to have known better. The end result of all that was that this chamber eventually had to determine at some stage to refer this to the High Court. But, generous souls that we are, we did suggest a solution—indeed I did it from sitting about here—that Senator Ferris should resign and be reappointed under a casual vacancy. That all occurred and the net result was that the taxpayers got back about $25,000 of salary and business class travel expenses from Senator Ferris, and got a couple of months free work from her. This should not have been necessary. There is no doubt that Senator Ferris—Senator-designate Ferris, at the time—was not being employed to influence her in the future. It was so she could have a job until she took her seat here. </para><para>It is very unfair to say to someone, `You do not have a living.' I do not know about others, but I was elected in November or October 1980, when I was a schoolteacher, and I had to spent eight months finding other employment because I could not go back and teach at school as it would be an office of profit under the Crown. Doug McClelland, who was a shorthand court reporter in New South Wales—I think Senator Forshaw might know this—went and sold ice-creams for six months, I think, to support himself and his family before he took his place in this chamber. Then we had the Ferris matter, and there was absolutely no intention there of suborning a future senator by an office of profit. Then we had Miss Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay, who I think took leave from her Air Force job rather than resign. Again, it was a clear case of not intending to pervert the Constitution or anything else. She was disqualified from her seat. </para><para>Finally, we have a case before us again outed by the senator concerned—this time Senator Scullion. He was involved in a degree of commercial activity with his boat with a number of government agencies—the quarantine service, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That case still has not been resolved. The government has been stonewalling immensely in the last few months. The Labor Party attitude to this is: we do not think Senator Scullion was in any way trying to profit from his position. We know that it was stupidity and not malice that brought about his current position. We do not have any stake in seeing him leave this place, because another grubby dalek would just come from the CLP to replace him—probably far worse, far less generous and far less avuncular than we know Senator Scullion is—so why should we do it? The only reason we would like to see it resolved is that, if we do not resolve it, some day a private citizen could take the case and that could be far more expensive to Senator Scullion than if we resolve it ourselves. I know the government have had other priorities and I do not particularly blame them, but we are still waiting, months later, to get a response to the last piece of correspondence we did on this issue. </para><para>None of those cases are Labor Party members—I feel pleased about that. But, certainly, over the years, there have obviously been some people who have been luckier—who have, in fact, offended the office of profit provision and have not been caught. I do not know of any personally, but I am sure it would have happened. One area that is still not particularly clear to us is municipal councillors, aldermen and whatever. There have been candidates for federal elections, both unsuccessful and successful, that have stayed on local councils. Is that an office of profit? They have never been taken to the High Court on it, but we would like that to be resolved. If Senator Brown's resolution is carried, we can resolve it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Eddie Ward was one.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—I think there are probably lots of later examples of people who have been on local councils, too. We, of course—Senator Kemp and I—have much better taste than to run for local government, because we are statesmen!</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second area that is covered here is allegiance to a foreign power. I must say that the way the High Court has interpreted this particular matter irritates me a lot more than the first one. I would have thought that, if you are an Australian citizen and you are willing to take the oath in this chamber of loyalty to Australia, you should be able to serve here. But that is not taken in that way and it is not the way the Constitution is interpreted.</para><para>The first person to offend on this—or the first case I had something to do with—was Senator Robert Woods. He was elected as a Nuclear Disarmament Party member and it was discovered that he was not an Australian citizen. This chamber had to do the appropriate thing and refer it to the High Court. The test I put on him that day was, `If the English cricket side comes out, do you barrack for them or for Australia?' He said he would barrack for Australia. I said, `That's good enough for me—I think you're an Australian and you should be here.' Nevertheless, the matter was sent off to the High Court and, in fact, he lost his Senate position. He did say to me at the time, `It doesn't matter if that happens; my replacement'—that is, Senator Irina Dunn—`will resign and I will be appointed under a casual vacancy.' That suspended my belief in human nature. But, I must say, five minutes after the court case, Irina Dunn rang me, as the relevant minister, to ask where she could set up her office. I thought, `My faith in human nature is restored.' That was the last we saw of Robert Woods.</para><para>The other person who offended on this was, of course, Heather Hill, who was elected in Queensland. She fell foul of it, but she should have been warned—we had had the Woods case and both the Liberal and Labor parties spent a lot of time making sure that all of their candidates were properly qualified. The way to do that is to make sure not only that you have Australian citizenship but, if you are regarded as having dual citizenship, whether you have sought it or not, you renounce it. You can renounce it at the local high commission or embassy, pay your necessary fee and then the High Court will say, `You've taken all the necessary steps.' But not Heather Hill—they were too busy campaigning on wedge issues to worry about these minor difficulties. The old One Nation does not worry about public funding and how that is spent or about keeping records on political donations. That is for the major political parties to worry about. They are too important—they would not even bother to examine the Electoral Act. They paid the price. Again, it was suggested at that time that the No. 2 on the ticket, Senator Harris, who now graces this chamber, would resign in favour of Senator Heather Hill. Two out of two—he is still here. That is not surprising at all. </para><para>I must say that I do not like the concept of dual citizenship on any occasion. I know the modern trend is that you should allow dual citizenship. It is anathema to me that you would vote in more than one country in an election. I do not believe in it. I also believe that it causes enormous problems. If you are taken by a terrorist group overseas and you are a dual citizen, which country represents you? Which country goes to try and free you? You just do not know. And it is just to go through an airport line a bit quicker. I think it shows a bit of a lack of commitment to a particular country to want to be a dual citizen. I understand that, in some circumstances, it is imposed upon you. Some countries never let you, in their terms, `relinquish citizenship'. But I do think it is particularly difficult in these cases.</para><para>Senator Brown's constitutional amendment will clear these two areas up. I have looked at it carefully—I am not sure that it solves everything and that I agree with every technical term. But, then again, that is why we have the Attorney-General's Department—to polish up these or other outside things. I think, on the whole, Senator Brown has done a pretty good job with his legislation. I think the only chance of it ever going through will be with a package of other legislative matters.</para><para>I can say this with some certainty: of all those that have fallen foul of section 44, none was in fact guilty; it was always a technical breach. None was in a position in which they owed actual allegiance to another country; none was in a position where they could have been suborned on economic grounds—and that is absolutely clear. We have moved on a long way since 1901. What was an office of profit and a problem then has completely metamorphosed into other matters today. To clean up that aspect of the Constitution would be most welcome. It would also save political parties a lot of time in checking. But of course it is an advantage that the major political parties have: both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have been able to check all their candidates. Minor parties find that a lot more difficult. We used to use Senator Cooney as our watchdog to make sure all our candidates were clean. No doubt whoever is given the task next time will know they are on the way out of here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>11278</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in the 2003 debate on the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002].</inline> We all know that this bill has been before the Senate previously and the key issue, a review of section 44 of the Constitution, has been subject to a great deal of debate and consideration on many occasions. One commentator on constitutional law has stated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The disqualifications under sections 44 and 45 [of the Constitution] are of little practical importance, are riddled with difficulty and do not warrant extended discussion.</para></quote><para>As a new senator and a previous Commonwealth public servant, I agree with the description concerning difficulty but, as this debate reflects, it is important and the discussion is warranted. Section 44 of the Constitution provides that persons who fail to meet set criteria for election are incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of either house of Commonwealth parliament. Section 44(i)—which I am not going to cover—provides for the disqualification of persons with a foreign citizenship or who have various other allegiances to a foreign power. Section 44(iv) disqualifies those who hold any office of profit under the Crown—an interesting term—or any pension payable under the pleasure of the Crown—another interesting term. Section 44(iv) has been determined to apply to Commonwealth and state public sector workers who wish to nominate for parliament. I am particularly interested in the impact on Public Service workers and the potential disincentive for people in this industry to consider nominating for election in our democracy. There are just more hoops to jump through. </para><para>As an ex-public servant, when I was involved in the interesting and educative process of selection as a candidate I sought advice, just as Senator Mason described earlier, from the Australian Electoral Commission and people in the ALP about qualification. I was familiar with selection criteria and I was fairly comfortable about the concept of meeting requirements for any position—that was my Public Service background. I was fortunate in my search because there was strong search and knowledge of the system and, as a result of the Sykes v. Cleary case, there was a definition of the status for state public servants, the impact of leave without pay and what it really means, and the critical importance in any process in this case of the actual date of nomination. The message that I received from a range of sources was, `Get advice and get it right, because the alternative could be embarrassment, loss and, very possibly, unemployment.' Why is it so damned difficult and why is the impact on public servants so exceptional?</para><para>The Constitution is not an easy read and, with respect to a number of comrades who are constitutional lawyers, the language reflects a different environment and requires considerable help in interpretation. The volume of constitutional scholarship reinforces these difficulties. Our Constitution must be a vibrant document and, while making changes to the referendum process is not an easy path to take, nevertheless changes must and can be made. Simply because a situation was real and critical to effective government in 1902 does not mean that effective arguments for amendment to reflect real changes cannot be made at any time with support.</para><para>This does not mean that key principles should be dismissed; rather that current operations and needs can be reflected in a Constitution with the support of Australian voters. The principle of exclusion for persons who hold any office of profit under the Crown is based on the need for the absolute independence of government. Any member of parliament must be free from undue influence in doing their job. If your employment is somehow dependent on the Crown—and in 2003 I would interpret that as being our executive government—there could well be a conflict or seen to be a conflict.</para><para>There is also the need to maintain the principle of ministerial responsibility. Public servants who implement decisions on public policy and for whom the relevant minister is ultimately responsible cannot themselves be members of parliament. As the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee stated in 1997:</para><quote><para>Ministerial responsibility requires that the minister should be accountable to the parliament for the actions of public servants within his or her department. It would be inappropriate if those same public servants were members of parliament.</para></quote><para>That committee, among other groups who have reviewed that section of the Constitution over the years, agreed that the policy base for subsection 44(iv) remains sound but the operation of the provision must change. There must not be or be seen to be any double-dipping, nor should there be any perception of divided loyalty or possible confusion or division of activity. </para><para>There is no argument about the issues of conflict for any person elected to parliament. However, when must the public servant lose the `payment of the Crown'? This provision causes real stress for potential candidates and requires a strong personal commitment on their part. Over the years, processes at the federal and state levels for a possible return to the public service for those unsuccessful at an election have been put in place. A Commonwealth public servant has the right to be re-engaged in the service, and so do people across the other states. But, in all cases, public sector workers who desire to nominate for parliament must resign from the service. In the current Public Service, as positions have been reduced and career options limited, particularly in regional areas, this remains a truly significant issue.</para><para>While the case of Sykes v. Cleary has clarified the situation for some public sector workers—as described by Senator Ludwig—there remains real confusion regarding the status of workers in local government, universities, statutory authorities and the ever-changing environment of public-private partnerships. The test of office of profit under the Crown seems to be dependent on the establishment of a relevant case. Perhaps we need some more appropriate electoral martyrs from various forms of public employment to determine our future operations. Senator Brown stated that everyone agrees that there needs to be a change—the problem seems to be exactly what change. Certainly, it has been agreed that a change must be made to the Constitution itself through a referendum. The challenges of this process have been described by other senators in this debate today, in particular Senator Ray, and in previous debates on this issue.</para><para>Again we seem to be in violent agreement but at a loss over the next step. Maybe there is no perfect form of words, but we need to work it out as a duly elected parliament to ensure that the large numbers of people who are now either confused or ill-informed about their rights to stand for parliament are given the opportunity to be involved in our system. I commend Senator Brown's legislation, and I hope that this time there will be more than rhetoric and there can be some effective action.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11280</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I commend Senator Moore for that excellent contribution to this important debate on the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]</inline>. Before Senator Moore's contribution, Senator Robert Ray spoke. I am a mite more optimistic than Senator Ray about the prospect for the bill, if it were to pass through this place and the House of Representatives and get into the public domain. One of the things that might assist it, of course, is the recognition that there are some five million voters out there who cannot stand for parliament. It might very much tip the scales when they recognise that supporting this amendment would give them a right that they as citizens have but in the main do not know is taken away by section 44 of the Constitution, either because they hold dual citizenship or because they hold a so-called office of profit under the Crown simply through being on a pension or being in the Public Service.</para></talk.start><para>I note that both Senator Ludwig and Senator Mason referred to the possible difficulty of people who work in universities being caught by section 44. However, I can put their minds at rest. In the particular case of Michael Organ, who is the member for Cunningham in the House of Representatives, I know that story was in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. Maybe today's debate has given me some bead on the source of information going to a whole range of media before it finally got published in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. It was a speculative story that there was something untoward in Michael Organ's holding of the office. There is not. Senator Mason had difficulty getting an opinion about that, but let me refer to the opinion of the very learned and esteemed John Basten QC, from Sydney, which, at the end, says: </para><quote><para>... there are sound reasons of principle not to extend the concept of an office under the Crown beyond those who form part of the broad structure of Executive government by which the affairs of the State are administered. The University of Wollongong does not fall within that classification.</para><para>15.	There is authority to support the conclusion reached above, although it arose in a different context. In <inline font-style="italic">Clark v University of Melbourne (No. 2)</inline><inline font-style="italic">18</inline> the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered whether the University Council could make a regulation imposing a fee on students, without specific statutory authority in that respect. The principle sought to be applied to the University was that no tax could be imposed for the use of the Crown without such authority. The Full Court unanimously held, in response to that argument—</para></quote><para>and it is cited as No. 19—</para><quote><para>'There appears to be no reason for identifying the University with the Crown, or as a governmental agency of any kind ...'</para><para>Although the conclusion was not the subject of detailed reasons, it accords with the approach and conclusion set out above.</para></quote><para>Mr Basten concluded:</para><quote><para>16.	For these reasons—</para></quote><para>and he had earlier reasons in his argument—</para><quote><para>I do not think that a member of the staff of the University of Wollongong is the holder of an office of profit under the Crown. Accordingly, Mr Organ is not disqualified by operation of s.44(iv) of the Constitution.</para></quote><para>I think Senator Ludwig referred to Michael Organ as a former University of Wollongong activist. He was actually an archivist. There is some difference between those two things, although I think that both are in some ways trying to make sure that the future is the better through their activities.</para><para>While we have not got from Senator Mason an indication of where the government's vote will lie on this matter, previously—in 1998—Senator Ellison said that the government did not support the legislation, remarkably enough, but he did say:</para><quote><para>I can advise the Senate that the government is currently considering these issues and developing amendment proposals.</para></quote><para>Here we are five years later and neither I nor the public have seen any sign of those amendments. There are none on the public record. But there was a commitment from the government five years ago—and I think the government is in the box seat in these matters. It is not good enough for the government not to have come forward with the legislation that I am bringing forward and to have expanded it, if necessary, to meet the recommendations of various parliamentary committees going back to 1981, as Senator Ray has just told us, ensuring that we do have a living and vibrant constitution of the sort that Senator Moore was talking about. That needs a multipartisan approach. We have it in this chamber. We have it with the government, because the government supports the recommendations of the committees upon which this legislation is built. I would find it extraordinary if the government were not to support this legislation. In fact, it would simply be doing a backflip on a commitment it made in 1998 and previous to that in response to the joint committee and other committees that recommended just these amendments. It is extraordinarily important legislation. I am looking forward to the Senate supporting the second reading so that we can make the minor amendments in committee I have foreshadowed and move on to a final vote. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11282</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11282</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (lines 14 to 18), omit subclause (3), substitute:</para><para>	(3)	The constitution is altered by omitting the following words from section 44:</para><para>		“But sub-section (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen's Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the Queen's navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth.”.</para><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 2 (lines 6 to 13), subclauses (1) and (2), omit “paragraph” (wherever occurring), substitute “subsection” (wherever occurring).</para></quote><para>I have before the committee two amendments to the <inline ref="S186">Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]</inline>.

Both of the amendments clarify the proposal that Senator Brown has brought before the parliament today. In addition, it is also worth while perhaps not so much correcting the record but putting on the record what I think was the context in which Mr Organ was raised. It was not so much to have a debate about him—that was not an issue that I wanted to go to—but merely to highlight the way Dr Nelson addresses the education system in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The problem is the constitutional debates the lawyers get into when they look at disqualifications in relation to that particular clause under the Constitution. It is not easy for laypersons to find their way through it. That should not be the case for people who want to run for elected positions in this place or in the other place. It should be clear and unambiguous. The government could play—but have not played—a constructive role in that. In fact, the government have not been helpful in pursuing the debate, in the broad. They have certainly allowed the debate to come on today, and I am sure Senator Brown has thanked them for that. But when you look at the number of committees in the past that have considered section 44, you see that the government have not taken any of their recommendations seriously. They have not been able to put them into action. They have had an opportunity to use a referendum to have a broader look at section 44 and have not done so.</para><para>We, the opposition, have said that if there are amendments such as this they should not go up alone. As we have said, a referendum is an expensive outing. Senator Brown brought an opportunity to this parliament for the issues to be dealt with more broadly. Should the government decide in the future that this is necessary and be moved to adopt Senator Brown's position then that whole area should be looked at more holistically as well. It would be better if a referendum were used in a more holistic sense rather than just on one particular issue. I think it would be not only logical but more readily acceptable to the Australian public if the issue were dealt with, reviewed and looked at broadly. </para><para>It is especially interesting to look at the Liberals' experience with this particular section, which deals with office of profit under the Crown. As we have heard today, Senator Ferris had a difficulty with the section in 1996 when she was a Liberal Senate candidate. And, as I mentioned, Liberal member Miss Jackie Kelly in 1996—1996 was obviously an interesting year—similarly had a problem with the issue of office of profit under the Crown. At the time I was elected in 1998, One Nation Senate candidate Mrs Heather Hill had a problem with another part of the debate, the dual citizenship issue.</para><para>You can see that this problem is not going to go away in the short term. It is a matter that seems to crop up quite regularly. It even goes back to as early as—as I think we heard—the case of Nuclear Disarmament Party Senate candidate Mr Robert Wood in 1987. That was a citizenship issue. Then in 1992 there was the more talked about case of Mr Phil Cleary. This has been happening since 1987—through the eighties and the nineties. Now we are in 2003, and I suspect there will be other cases unless this section is fixed.</para><para>The government's contribution to this debate has been disappointing and short, in the sense of not progressing the matter further. They do have the ability to look at this in a more holistic way, as I have said, but have chosen not to. The matter has been left for the opposition to debate. The amendments proposed by Senator Brown will, I think, make the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002] clearer. In fact, they will make it into quite a short bill and quite a simple one to understand, although it is one with great import.</para><para>This matter was also raised following the 1997 recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Although the bill does not pick up all of the recommendations—and that is a matter that perhaps should be looked at more broadly—it does, in any event, reflect the spirit of the 1997 recommendations. These matters were also substantively debated by Senator Faulkner, Senator Robert Ray and Senator Cooney during debate on the bill back in 1998. The position that the opposition has taken is that we support both the amendments and the substantive bill. It is recommended that the government should also support reform, as they so often say they do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11283</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have just one question: should a narrowly focused but extremely important amendment to the Constitution, such as this one, be put forward in a referendum, or should we wait for an omnibus bill that is a massive repair to the Constitution and an upgrading to go ahead? I am not in that second camp. Changes to the Constitution should be pure and simple, so that the public can understand them and so that, if there is going to be a debate, the arguments are readily available to the voters and they can make up their minds. We had four amendments at the end of the eighties where innocuous and important proposals—with previous multipartisan support—such as having local government recognised in the Constitution, went down. The fault there—besides the opposition of the time changing tack and becoming opponents—was that there were four questions instead of one question. </para></talk.start><para> It is a mistake to say that the cost is prohibitive. This is a major change to the Constitution. It is an extraordinarily important improvement. It has multipartisan support. No matter how the vote goes in the Senate today, the argument against it will be technical and not on the merits of the need for change, because that has been agreed to already. It should be going to the people at the next election as a referendum question.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>11284</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been listening closely to Senator Brown's contribution and still I am not persuaded by the force of his argument. The problem I have is that when you look at the proposals to be put to a referendum you see that they require in total further public consideration to be given to the precise wording of the amendment to section 44. It is not only that. I think you also have to take into consideration the fact that, before any proposed amendments to section 44 are put to the Australian people, public consideration should be given to which other constitutional reforms ought also to be put at a referendum at that time. I understand the point Senator Brown makes is that referenda are very difficult in this country, unless you get bipartisan support. But if you have bipartisan support on an issue, I do not think it is that much of a hurdle to ask the Australian public to understand that there are a number of distinct issues in relation to section 44 or other relevant reform proposals that could be included in referenda and the Australian public would be able to deal with those. </para></talk.start><para>The issue is important. We only really differentiate on the process or the mechanics of it. I think we agree in total that the section should not be a difficulty that obscures rather than enlightens the ability of people to sit in a seat either in the House of Representatives or here in the Senate. It should not prevent people who might be perceived to be caught by these provisions from participating in our democracy. In the end, the germane issue is the participatory part of it. In some instances, people have to resign—for instance, if they are a public servant. People have families and lives and all sorts of things that they have to fund. If you are proposing to nominate for the Senate, the way the elections are structured, you may be a senator-elect for a period of time; in my case it was for nine months or so. If you were a public servant or had an executive job perhaps—and I do not want to get into that constitutional argument, so we will assume that it is one of those jobs that might be struck down—you would have to look at how to support yourself or your family through the election period until such time as you could take up your seat.</para><para>I think that the government has failed to assist in recognising some of those difficulties. If it had so assisted, it would have helped the process a lot more and allowed us to work through them and would have informed us as to how the process would work. If the government were bona fide and wanted a referendum, it could review section 44 and ensure that the broader issues about section 44 were put forward in a referendum. Then the public—with bipartisan support—could look at the issues and discern a way forward.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>11284</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the things that we can achieve in this kind of process is to come to an agreement about how best to take this issue to the Australian public—and Senator Ludwig has begun that discussion. I agree with Senator Brown that it is important that the opportunity for the question to go to the public be taken as quickly as possible and that we do not linger too long. I also agree with Senator Ray that there is no way you can take it by itself, because people object to having that degree of money spent on what they see as frivolous technical aspects. However, once again speaking from my perspective as someone who was in the public sector, it would be really damaging to this process if this particular referendum question went forward and was defeated. That would be yet another attack on public sector workers and a form of betrayal of the quality of their employment. It is way too easy to knock public sector workers, and we all know the processes. It is probably only politicians who share the same degree of animosity from the community—and at times from the media—as public sector workers. </para></talk.start><para>But should there be agreement—and I am still hopeful that there can be; maybe that is because I am a new senator—it must be across all parties. There is no way that there can even be a lingering element of dispute on this, because it can be picked up and run with so viciously in knocking off a referendum question. However, if a process is to be put to the popular vote, it must be presented in such a way that the real guts of the issue are maintained. It must not be portrayed as a mere technicality or, worse, as was mentioned in one of the previous constitutional reviews, as yet another way to advantage people who are distant and different from the community. If it is seen as a way to advantage public servants and politicians and make their road easier, it is guaranteed to fail. </para><para>That would be the worst result, because we all know that the longer the argument that you cannot win a referendum is retained in our community—the longer people think it is impossible to put something up and frame it in such a way that Australian voters will support it—and the more often referendum questions are defeated, the more entrenched that argument will be. So, if this particular question, which Senator Brown has championed now on a couple of occasions in the Senate, were to go down, that would reinforce that general negativity—the view that constitutional change is too hard, we cannot do it and there is some kind of conspiracy against it; the kind of educated difficulties that we heard from Senator Ray—and would further feed that frenzy that we cannot do anything at all. </para><para>As someone who is very involved in and concerned with educating the community about our processes, I do not want to see any discussion or concern about the Constitution being further marginalised. I would hope that this form of process would be exactly the stimulating process that would get people engaged in the debate. As long as people can self-select and self-distance from their own system of government, we will not be able to engage people in seeing that politics is not only something valuable, something worthy and something that can be difficult but also something that all of us have the right and perhaps the opportunity to achieve. I would hope that, through this process and through the kind of contribution that Senator Ludwig is putting forward to try to progress the process—and it would be useful to hear something from the government as well—we would be able to proceed. As I said in my earlier statement, we have had the talk; now it would be nice if we had some action.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11285</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will not be supporting the amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11285</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (5.32 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That standing order 110 be suspended to enable the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No.2) 2002 to be passed without a roll call. </para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Senator BROWN (Tasmania) (5.32 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time. </para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Jacinta (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Collins)</inline>—I remind senators that section 128 of the Constitution requires that the proposed law be passed by an absolute majority.

That is the test any government budget should meet. Australian families are under growing pressure. They are working longer hours and paying record taxes. The last thing Australian families need is to pay more for vital services like health and education. But that is what Tuesday's budget was all about. A civilised society demands health care based on medical need and education for all based on ability. We believe that health and education are not just about providing services to individuals. They are public goods, for all Australians. We must invest in these vital services. But under the Howard government we are heading in the opposite direction. Instead of improving life for families, this budget is making things worse. It is giving Australian families a miserly $4 tax cut, while destroying Medicare and charging them more for education. The Howard government failed the test on Tuesday night. It is time for something new.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight we want to announce a new deal for Australia and Australian families.</para><para>·	 A new deal to save Medicare and bulk-billing.</para><para>·	 A pledge to keep higher education affordable and accessible.</para><para>·	A plan to save the Murray River from a slow, tragic death.</para><para>·	A retirement tax cut for every Australian.</para><para>·	A new deal to protect the savings of Australians.</para><para>·	An end to public subsidies of executive golden handshakes.</para><para>·	A better deal for small business.</para><para>·	And a better way to protect Australia and our children.</para><para>Most of all we want to give Australians a sense of hope that Australia can remain a fair and decent country that provides opportunities for all.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Saving Medicare and bulk-billing</inline></para><para>We believe that every Australian must have the right to access a doctor who bulk-bills and they must have the right to attend a well-funded public hospital without charge. I will not say for free, because it is not free. Australians know that. They have already paid for Medicare through their Medicare levy and their taxes. They have earned it. They should not have to pay again when they visit a doctor. Quality health care must only ever be available on the basis of medical need. It should never be rationed according to ability to pay. It should not be a two-tiered system. It should not be a second-rate system. Look at the United States. Forty-five million people do not have any health cover. They live in fear of serious illness. It destroys family finances, sometimes for generations. That is not the sort of health system I want for Australia.</para><para>Mr President, there is a profound difference between the Labor Party and our opponents. We are the builders. They are the wreckers. Labor built Medibank under Gough Whitlam and then Medicare under Bob Hawke because we believe everyone should have access to affordable health care. The Liberals have never believed in affordable health care. They want you to pay more. That is why they wrecked Medibank and that is why the Prime Minister is wrecking Medicare now. That is why tonight we are announcing that a Labor government will act to save Medicare and bulk-billing. We will not allow Medicare to be replaced by an Americanised, privatised system where instead of your Medicare card, doctors ask for your credit card and refuse to treat you unless you pay up-front. Saving Medicare starts with restoring your patient rebate. </para><para>So tonight I am announcing a Crean Labor government will lift the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live, or how much they earn. We will lift your patient rebate immediately upon coming to office to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee, and then take it to 100 per cent—an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. This is not just for concession card holders. It is for everyone. As we know, access to bulk-billing is declining faster in some parts of Australia than in others. To remedy this, under Labor, doctors who meet bulk-billing targets will receive additional incentive payments. Doctors in metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 80 per cent of services will receive an additional $7,500 a year. Doctors in outer metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 75 per cent of services will receive an additional $15,000. And doctors in rural and regional areas who bulk-bill 70 per cent of services will receive an additional $22,500. This is the equivalent of increasing your patient rebate by as much as $6.30 for a doctor in a metropolitan area, $7.80 in an outer metropolitan area and $9.60 for a doctor in a rural area. This is a significant down payment towards restoring bulk-billing and saving Medicare. Without bulk-billing there is no Medicare. Our objective is to get bulk-billing to a national average target of 80 per cent. It will not happen overnight, but tonight's measures represent a significant down payment. Labor will also increase the number of doctors in rural areas and make more nurses available to doctors who meet Labor's bulk-billing targets. These measures will help take the pressure off our public hospitals because that is where people go if they cannot find a bulk-billing doctor. And Labor will also provide additional funds to ensure that veterans with gold and white repatriation health cards continue to have the access to the bulk-billing they deserve.</para><para>There is another important aspect of Medicare that Labor will protect—affordable access to pharmaceuticals. Labor will not support the Howard government's 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines. Last year when I announced Labor's response to this price hike I announced a raft of proposals that will cut the overall cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme but which will not impose charges on you. Medicare is not only the most equitable health system we can have but also the most efficient. Medicare is prudent economics. It is the envy of the world. Why would you want to destroy it? Especially when we know we can afford to save it. Budgets are about values, priorities and choices. Labor's priority has been clear—save Medicare. Labor's plan to save Medicare is responsible and fully funded. In the budget two days ago the Treasurer announced a further $300 million in tax cuts for multinational businesses. Now you know where cuts to your family's health services are going. To help pay for Labor's new deal to save Medicare, I will redirect some of the government's business tax changes from Tuesday night. I will also redirect the savings from scrapping the destructive changes to Medicare that were in the budget. This is not a tax and spend proposal. It is a cut and fix proposal. And it is a question of priorities. Corporate tax cuts do not have the same priority as saving Medicare for Australian families. Let us be clear about this. We have a very different view of Australian society to that of our opponents, and I will be happy to have an argument about these priorities anywhere, any time. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal for lifelong learning</inline></para><para>Education is a bridge to the future. It does not just give individuals opportunity, it advances and strengthens us as a society. It should not be treated as a tradeable commodity. </para><para>The world is changing so rapidly that our children will be working in jobs that have not been imagined yet and will have to update their skills throughout their lives, not just when they are young. This bridge to the future has many paths leading to it. We must invest in putting down those paths and we must not put up financial barriers. Our goal must be the creation of a world-leading system of lifelong learning. It must start with the early years—the crucial years for developing our learning skills. Too many of our children are slipping through the net because they are not getting the help they need. Opportunities are being lost because not enough money is being invested in our schools. While we encourage everyone to get a year-12 qualification, we do not provide enough apprenticeships or enough places at university or TAFE for them. Our vice chancellors advise us that 20,000 qualified young Australians are turned away every year. The cost to them and our country is enormous. Finding those places must be our objective. And we must have a new agreement with the states to create more TAFE places. We also need to give adults more assistance in upgrading their skills throughout their working lives. We must destroy the blight on our society of middle-age long-term unemployment. That is why my new deal for Australian families is a comprehensive plan for lifelong learning—a bridge to the future for all of us. Just as we have done with Medicare tonight, we will outline in the coming months our plans to build a better education system for all Australians. As a result of the changes outlined in Tuesday's budget, students and their families will be forced into massive debt to obtain a university degree. Fees will increase by up to 30 per cent, leaving students with HECS debts of up to $40,000 or more. Many more degrees will cost over $100,000. And students paying those fees will be hit with a six per cent interest charge. </para><para>Mr President, how can we expect our young people to ever be able to buy a home and start a family with debts like these? In the interest of keeping student and family debt down, we will support lifting the HECS threshold to $30,000, but will not support the unfair elements of this government's unfair university package. Tonight we make this pledge to Australian families: we will not allow this government to slug you and your children with a 30 per cent increase in your university fees. We will not allow this government to saddle you and your children with $800 million of new debt. And we will not allow the wealthy to jump the queue and take the university places that rightly belong to the hardest-working and the most able young Australians. The Treasurer said last night that Labor's refusal to pass these measures means we are blocking his big, bold reforms. Charging students tens of thousands of dollars for a degree is not a big, bold reform, Treasurer. Opening up our universities to all Australians—like the Whitlam and Hawke governments did—is a big, bold reform. And we will do it again. The Liberals only ever see education as a cost and something they can slug you for. Labor knows—as every parent knows—that education is the greatest investment we can make in our shared future. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Water</inline></para><para>Our shared future must involve a commitment to save our natural environment. We all love Australia's rugged environment. As a keen bushwalker, I have seen first-hand how beautiful, but also how fragile, our country is. I recently visited the mouth of the Murray River in South Australia. What I saw distressed me. It also angered me. It will do the same for all Australians who see it. The once mighty river's mouth has all but closed. It has shrunk to the length of a cricket pitch. The water is only knee-deep. Barely a trickle flows to the sea. In some places it is flowing backwards!</para><para>The Murray is dying. Native fish are facing extinction, exotic species are choking the river and salinity is spreading. If we do not restore the health of the Murray, there will no longer be a river system capable of supporting our farmers into the future. This is a great national challenge and it will require a significant long-term investment. My new deal for Australia will save the Murray. I announce tonight that Labor will restore enough environmental flows to keep the mouth of the Murray open and to restore the health of the river. We will stop large-scale and indiscriminate land clearing to prevent salinity. And we will ratify the Kyoto protocol to prevent more severe droughts in the future. Restoring the flows of our rivers will take serious levels of investment. A Labor government will therefore create the Murray-Darling Riverbank—a special new government corporation to secure long-term funding for much needed investment in Australia's water resources. We will make an initial capital injection of $150 million as the first down payment to save our rivers and attract matching funds from the states and the private sector. Riverbank will invest in innovative projects that will set a new direction for water use in Australia, will help farmers achieve on-farm efficiency improvements and encourage increased water reuse and recycling. It will finance projects in its own right and participate in joint ventures with state and territory governments and the private sector. This will greatly increase the funds available for this urgent national priority. Just as Bob Hawke saved the Franklin River 20 years ago, Labor's pledge is to save the Murray River—the lifeblood of our nation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Tax and the budget</inline></para><para>[My father] was fond of quoting the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, who famously said, `When you pay taxes you buy civilisation.' If you ask me what a civilised society means today, my answer is this: a country where anyone, regardless of where they live or how much they earn, can get the same standard of medical care when they get sick; a country where education is available on the basis of ability, not your ability to pay; and a country that protects its natural environment for future generations to enjoy. That is the sort of civilised society I want Australia to be. This is the vision that should have been Tuesday night's budget. Sadly, it was not. We all know why. This government thinks that by giving you $4 a week you will not notice its real agenda—you pay more. You pay more to see a doctor. You pay more for an education. And you go further and further into debt. It is John Howard's message to all Australians: `Sorry about Medicare, sorry about your kids' education, sorry about your credit card debt, but here's four dollars instead.' The highest taxing government in our history has given you the smallest tax cut in our history. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer think that Australians earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year are so affluent that you only need another $4 a week. But while they give with one hand they slug you with the other—up to $50 to go to the doctor; $32 per week in extra HECS debt; and $125 per week to pay for your new student loan. </para><para>Australians have earned the tax cut in the budget. Labor will pass it on, but Australians deserve more from this government. Four dollars on its own, set against the massive cost increases for health and education outlined in this budget, is miserly and a sleight of hand. A Crean Labor government will return bracket creep through both tax cuts and better services. Tonight I am demonstrating how a combination of those things can make a family better off.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal on superannuation</inline></para><para>A key test of your values, choices and priorities is whether you believe in rewarding the many or the few. Tuesday night's budget contains another tax cut—one Peter Costello was too embarrassed to talk about: his superannuation tax cut for the top few per cent of income earners. Especially at a time when superannuation returns are going backwards, Australians need a retirement tax cut to reward the many, not the few. Labor will redirect Peter Costello's unfair superannuation tax cut to pay for a superannuation tax cut for all Australians, cutting your superannuation contribution tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. This means thousands of dollars more for your retirement. Labor has always been the party for pensioners, but we are the party for superannuants as well. Only Labor extended superannuation to all; only Labor will improve it for all.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal to protect your savings</inline></para><para>But, Mr President, there is no use investing in superannuation if your savings are not safe. More than 50 per cent of Australians now directly own shares and 90 per cent of Australian workers have an interest in the share market through their superannuation. The retirement savings of the whole nation depend on a well-regulated corporate sector. In the last two years there have been a number of huge corporate collapses, including Ansett, HIH and One.Tel. When this happens, the executives in charge invariably refuse to take responsibility for what they have done. We have all heard of overpaid executives awarding themselves massive bonuses and golden handshakes just as their companies go belly-up. But, rather than punish them, the Howard government rewards these executives with a 30 per cent tax subsidy paid with your taxes. Why should a family struggling to cope with financial pressures caused by bracket creep, the GST, bank charges and other hidden taxes have to foot the bill for golden handshakes as well—handshakes they do not get when they are retrenched. Enough is enough.</para><para>Labor will double current penalties when executives break corporate law. We will force top executives to further disclose their pay packages in full, including their share options. We will strengthen Australian shareholders' rights by giving them a vote on these packages when they are unfair and unreasonable. And tonight I announce that Labor will stop your taxes being used to subsidise by 30 per cent the million dollar golden handshakes being given to some executives. This means that under Labor all redundancy payments over the value of $1 million will no longer be eligible business deductions for companies. Labor values Medicare, not corporate greed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal for small business</inline></para><para>Mr President, there were two words missing from the Treasurer's budget speech on Tuesday night—`small business'. While the budget may not allow us to cut taxes for small business, only Labor will cut their paperwork. Peter Costello is spending $150 million of your money to employ 1,230 new tax officials to make your BAS nightmare even worse. Labor will cut that red tape. Under Labor's plan, small business owners will only have to make one simple calculation for each BAS statement based on a percentage of your turnover. The time-consuming and complicated reconciliation process will be eliminated. By substantially reducing your BAS compliance costs, Labor will put more money back into your pocket and give many of Australia's small businesses more time to spend on their business or with their families. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting our national security</inline></para><para>Mr President, the government's budget contains many worthwhile initiatives to make our nation safer. But more needs to be done. Labor will coordinate our security in Australia through a new department of homeland security. Labor will ensure our intelligence agencies talk to each other through an office of national security, headed by a national security adviser. Labor will establish a coastguard—a maritime cop on the beat, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to stop drug runners and gun-runners and people smugglers. And Labor will establish community safety zones to work with your local community to help fight crime. Labor will protect your security, and our national security.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting our children</inline></para><para>Recent events highlight the need to protect our children. Something positive must come out of those events. Labor will establish a national commissioner for children, who will develop a national code for the protection of children and oversee checks on people who work with children to ensure that potential child sex abusers do not get access to them. Under Labor's government, all organisations in receipt of Commonwealth funds will have to comply with this code and these checks. We must resolve, as a nation, to ensure that allegations of child sexual abuse are never ignored in the future and that the truth is never again swept under the carpet. Labor will give parents more confidence that their children are safe.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Tuesday night's budget failed Australian families. We have the smallest tax cut from the highest taxing government in our history. We have more debt for our students and their families. And we have the destruction of Medicare.</para><para>Mr President, we face serious challenges in rebuilding Medicare, improving access to affordable education and repairing our environment. These must be our nation's long-term national priorities. They cannot be solved overnight. But governments can make a difference. Tonight I have laid out Labor's new deal in each of these areas—significant steps towards our long-term goals. Budgets are about choices. Now the choice is yours. Tonight Labor is offering an alternative—to make education affordable and accessible to all, based on ability; to save the Murray River from its tragic death; to help you save for the future and to make your savings more secure; and to make Australians more secure and better protect our children. Tonight we have a new deal to save Medicare, not destroy it. That is what Labor wants for Australia and that is what Labor will fight for—a new deal for Australians and Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11293</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I respond to the government's federal budget proposals for 2003-04. I say `proposals' because budgets are always works in progress. It has already been indicated that the Democrats and Labor will not support the health and higher education proposals as they stand. Under no circumstances will the Democrats support higher fees for Australian undergraduate students or allow this government to attack the fundamentals of Medicare. The fact is that budgets have rarely been passed in the version they were originally presented in. Yesterday, we heard the Treasurer on ABC radio saying: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... back in the old days, budgets used to be enacted by the Senate. That was the theory of democratic government.</para></quote><para>That statement is completely untrue and farcical. I ask Mr Costello: when were these supposed good old days? 1975? The only political party that has ever blocked supply is the Liberal Party, currently in government. The only political party that has used the budget to bring down a democratically elected government is the Liberal Party. How dare this Liberal government accuse the Senate of obstructionism! The government will not be successful in using the threat of an early election or false public rhetoric to bully the Democrats into passing any retrograde, ideologically driven legislation. One of the founding principles of the Democrats in 1977 was that we would not block supply. We would not do what the Liberal Party did—hold the government to ransom or hold the country to ransom. That is the only occasion of a Senate not doing its job properly. Since we were formed, the Democrats have held to our vow not to block supply, and we will not blackmail the government or hold the budget or the country to ransom.</para><para>The Democrats will do what we have always done for more than a quarter of a century: examine the budget proposals in detail with an aim to make them as fair and environmentally responsible as possible. The reality is—and Mr Costello knows it—the vast bulk of this budget is going to pass through this Senate untouched. But there is still plenty of room for improving the contents of the budget. It is clear that the big battlegrounds in the Senate will be on the health and education packages. The Democrats record on Medicare and on HECS and student fees are clear, longstanding and consistent. Under my leadership, the Democrats will continue our approach of sticking to our party's policies, promises and principles. Changes to the health and education packages will not affect the economic underpinnings of this budget. Any suggestion that, by examining these crucial packages, the Senate is somehow holding the surplus to ransom or is intent on gutting the budget is just false.</para><para>The government has whinged continually over the last 12 months about not getting some of their proposals through from last year's budget to make medicines dearer and life more difficult for those on disability support. The fact is that the stopping of those measures by the Democrats only cost the government a quarter of a billion dollars. And yet they could still afford nearly a billion dollars for a war and still have a $4 billion surplus on top of that at the end of 2002-03. All that talk of the disability support pension changes and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes being absolutely necessary for the budget bottom line simply was not true. I believe the Democrats' stance on those issues has been vindicated by this year's budget figures. As we know, this government is often loose with the truth whenever it is convenient, and its silly statements about the Senate and the budget are just another example.</para><para>I note in papers such as the <inline font-style="italic">Australian and the </inline><inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> that the education minister, Brendan Nelson, is saying, effectively, that he is taking an all or nothing approach with this package. If he is seriously saying that he will not negotiate any change, then the higher education package is dead. If Dr Nelson pursues an all or nothing approach, he will get nothing. The sooner they give up the ridiculous rhetoric, the sooner the Senate will be able to do its job of finding better solutions, as the Democrats have successfully done in so many areas in the past—in recent times on welfare reform measures, on business tax, on the sugar industry package, on environment laws, on antipiracy protection, on health care cards for foster children and many other measures. </para><para>That brings us to this year's budget. There are some good measures in this budget, many of which have already been publicly acknowledged by the Democrats and many other colleagues through various statements and media releases. As the federal budget figures show, the Australian economy—and let us not forget that the economy is not this disembodied thing out in the ether—is in effect Australian workers, businesses, industries and communities. Those Australians have produced an Australian economy that has some good economic fundamentals. The economy has continued to grow despite a weaker global economy, and we continue to enjoy—at least by Australian standards—relatively low interest rates and low inflation. However, a few economic indicators are not enough to measure quality of life or to guarantee sustainable environmental practices, individual freedoms or community cohesion. This budget has forecast a surplus for next financial year of $2.2 billion. Despite $2.4 billion in tax cuts in the next financial year, the government will in that same year still collect $4 billion more in individual taxation than it did this year.</para><para>Some of the other factors that contributed to the surplus must be noted. The Treasurer received a special dividend as part of his budget of almost $1 billion, paid by Telstra just last month. Of course, if Telstra had not been half sold by the coalition and Independent senators, the dividend would have been $2 billion—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Eggleston</name></talker><para>—That was the Democrats!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—It was not the Democrats, thank you. Correct the record, please, Senator. I welcome the government's announcement that it will not be selling Telstra in this term, clearly because it has finally recognised that the Democrats will continue to ensure that Telstra cannot be sold. Mr Costello also received a funding injection from the Iraq war. The temporary spike in oil prices caused by the conflict in Iraq and the build-up to it increased revenue from resource and petrol taxes by about $400 million—a down payment on the war paid for by individual Australians at the petrol pump. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But despite having a relatively strong economy and a record tax intake, the government is not delivering to Australians the standards of health, education services and income support measures that they deserve and that they need. In the area of housing it must be recognised that Australia's growth and budget surplus have in part been created by the housing price boom and increased debt. This cannot continue forever. We need to ensure the housing boom has a soft landing and we need to recognise that there is a social cost to the boom. The March quarter Housing Industry Association report showed that housing affordability has dropped by a huge 16.6 per cent over the past year. Small income tax cuts are not going to compensate for the growing cost of the fundamental need for housing.</para><para>In the area of unemployment we see the continuation of a level of over six per cent and no new initiatives in this budget to promote job creation. Eight years of Peter Costello as Treasurer have failed to break the back of unemployment. It is worth noting, as set out in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on budget day, the performance ratings of the major treasurers since 1950. Peter Costello was second last in performance on employment growth—second last. Guess who was last? John Howard. Youth unemployment is at 22 per cent, and advertised vacancies are at their lowest level in nine years. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—It is Mr Howard or the Prime Minister, Senator Bartlett.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I shall note that. Crucially, only eight per cent of the new jobs created in the last two years are full time; the rest—a massive 92 per cent—are part time. But there are no initiatives to promote job creation. One of the disappointments in the lead-up to this budget is that the government dismissed options that would reduce the high effective tax rates, sometimes up to 87 per cent, for people moving from welfare to work.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The best measure in the welfare area in the budget—about the only positive measure in the welfare area—is in fact the Democrats' achievement, which will put $50 million back into the pockets of the unemployed through reduced penalties. The Democrats' successful negotiations on welfare reform also ensured that unemployed people at least will have working credits that were initially taken away by this government restored to them—working credits of up to $1,000 a year. This goes a small way to increasing incentives for people to get off social security. However, more measures are needed to reduce the poverty trap still faced by thousands of Australians. If Mr Costello really wants to reduce unemployment this should be his priority. The budget predicts that the government will save $378 million over the four years by more targeting of people on benefits, but it fails to allocate a cent of those savings back into helping Australia's 600,000 unemployed find jobs.</para><para>With regard to the income tax cuts, undoubtedly the public will welcome some income tax relief. But those individual savings will clearly be swamped by increased costs in education, health and housing. The tax measures will increase the gap between high- and low-income earners. The Democrats' preference is for an equal tax cut for all Australians, and we outlined alternative tax options in the week prior to the budget. For example, the option of increasing the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $7,500 would give a $255 tax saving to all taxpayers equally. Maintaining the increase to the low-income tax offset would also provide added assistance for those who earn under $30,000 a year. Under the government's plan, those on $20,000 or less receive just $85 a year in tax cuts while those on $62,500 receive $573. Under the Democrats' proposal, everyone would receive at least $240, with slightly more for those earning under $30,000—fairer tax cuts for all, not just the rich.

role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate. In short, the same amount of money on tax cuts could have been spent in a far fairer way. One of the advantages of the Democrats' proposals is that it is more likely that the additional money given to lower income earners would be spent and reinvested directly into the Australian economy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We should remember also that the well off have already had their tax cuts. Capital gains tax was halved just a few years ago with ALP support, against the Democrats' opposition, despite the fact that it clearly mainly benefited those wealthy Australians with investment portfolios and share portfolios. Of course, the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance, costing the taxpayer over $2 billion a year, favours higher income earners as well. The government has also decided against acting on the advice of its own Ralph review on taxation to crack down on trust tax avoidance, despite the fact that taxing trusts as companies would earn $450 million a year. That is breaking the promise that was given to the Labor Party to enable those capital gains tax cuts to get Labor support. So the use of trusts to avoid tax continues, while the massive tax cuts to high-income earners through capital gains tax changes are also continuing.</para><para>On top of these tax benefits that help higher income earners we still have fringe benefits tax rules that encourage salary packaging for motor vehicles and encourage car use. This tax concession is bad for the environment and bad for government revenue, costing $900 million a year, but the government allows it to continue. The budget's industry measures will favour large corporations at the expense of small business. The government has ignored its commitment to the manufacturing sector to remove the tariff concession system. Leaving this in place will affect small and medium sized businesses.</para><para>The budget also contains some international tax proposals which need further scrutiny. The Democrats will examine these carefully when the legislation does appear, to ensure that the tax paid by corporations operating internationally is fair and there is no return to the days when clever international tax planning allowed multinationals to avoid their Australian tax responsibilities. So we will send this legislation to a committee to see if the proposed tax changes improve the simplicity and efficiency of the Australian tax system. But the Democrats do recognise the benefits if Australian businesses are more easily able to invest overseas. If the legislation simply eliminates double taxation and simplifies tax compliance, the Democrats' attitude will generally be supportive. The Democrats will also revise and reintroduce our <inline ref="S259">Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 [2002]</inline> to regulate the activities of Australian companies in the areas of human rights, the environment and labour.</para><para>Of course, the Democrats are here not just to analyse government policy but also to provide and promote viable alternatives. Last week the Democrats' alternative budget proposals contained our equal tax cut initiative and other revenue measures that would allow us as a nation to invest in freedom, the future and a fair go for all Australians. Disappointingly, the government's budget is marked by missed opportunities, misdirected priorities and a continuation of social insecurity. The bottom line is that, if this budget were passed as it is, Australians would have to pay more to go to the doctor and to go to university. The Democrats are not going to let that happen. The Democrats have always taken a responsible approach to budgets, but we will oppose measures that impact harshly on everyday Australians. The higher education and health proposals would clearly dramatically increase inequality not just of wealth but of opportunity in Australia.</para><para>One of the other big problems with this budget is what is missing, and obviously the Senate does not have the legislative ability to remedy those flaws beyond public pressure and ongoing debate to get action. As I have said, there is nothing in this budget about job creation and, apart from the Democrat-negotiated cuts in fines to the unemployed, the only initiative regarding the unemployed is punitive. The government has clearly given up on its own welfare reform agenda, something that it said a few years ago was absolutely essential. The government has given up on decent levels of overseas aid and on adequate funding for the ABC. It is persisting with the poorly targeted baby bonus yet has failed once again to help families with paid maternity leave. As usual, the only substantial environmental initiatives tend to be ones that the Democrats negotiated, this time in the areas of the Great Barrier Reef, the Sydney Harbour foreshores and Sustainable Cities.</para><para>There is little for Indigenous Australians, for women or for important industries like tourism, or science and research. There is little in the budget to offer comfort to people with disabilities or to their families and carers. Amazingly, in this year with so much talk and chest-beating about supporting our troops—which continued again today—our veterans have been forgotten. The government could not even find a simple $50 million for basic measures such as improving the treatment of veterans' disability compensation payments or increasing the funeral allowance up to a reasonable level. But it has managed to scrape together billions of dollars to improve interoperability, which is a code word for `more easily able to participate in more wars with the USA'. The government has the money. Why not spend it on health, education and our natural environment? Why not invest in a fairer system, more freedom for Australians and a more hopeful future? </para><para>The proposed higher education package is not equitable or sustainable, and there is no way the Democrats will change our longstanding position and support measures to increase the financial burden on university students. You just have to look at our record on HECS to see that the Democrats were the only ones back in the 1980s who opposed the reintroduction of student fees by the Labor government, and the Democrats have opposed all the increases to student fees which have been passed by Labor and by coalition governments since that time. This higher education proposal is a comprehensive plan to destroy HECS by 2008 and replace it with something even worse—interest-bearing loans for increasing numbers of students. The cost-shifting to students is exacerbated by the government's harsh means test of parental income for student income support which means only a tiny minority of teenage students at university can get access to payments such as youth allowance.</para><para>The prospect of significantly higher debt levels and increasing financial reliance on parents is a major disincentive for a huge number of students from low- and middle-income Australia to undertake study at university. Yes, there is some new money for universities, but this is heavily back-ended, put off into the future and still does not come close to replacing the huge amounts of money pulled out of universities by this governments since 1996. In addition, the Democrats totally reject any attempt by the government to blackmail universities into implementing its draconian industrial relations agenda as a condition for accessing new money. Tragically, schools have also been largely ignored in this budget. There is nothing on offer to begin to bridge the growing gap between the resources available to students in the public and private sectors. The government's SES funding model has been responsible for huge increases in private school funding.</para><para>Research and science have also fared badly in the budget. The CSIRO received a paltry $20 million for its new flagship initiative, but that lasts for just one year, whilst it faces a review that threatens to dismantle this once great research institution.</para><para>The health package of measures is all about the government trying to get out of Medicare. This government is supporting private health insurance instead of supporting and retaining Medicare. Medicare needs commitment to the principles of free hospital care, affordable pharmaceuticals and universal public access to GPs. The Democrats are very pleased that the Senate today supported our proposal to establish a Senate committee inquiry into Medicare to examine a better way to reform the health system. The government has pressed ahead with a destructive budget that would erode the foundations of Medicare, despite its plans to limit bulk-billing and expand private health insurance being decisively rejected by most health and policy experts.</para><para>It is worth emphasising the Democrats' record over many years on Medicare, because again that record is clear and consistent. As far back as 1979, our health policy called for emphasis on prevention, health education, healthier lifestyles and a cooperative national health scheme. Once Medicare was introduced by the Labor government in the 1980s, the Democrats pledged that Medicare would not be dismantled whilst ever we held the balance of power in the Senate. The public can be assured that retaining the Democrats in the balance of power will continue to ensure the protection of Medicare, just as it has for the last 20 years. We note Labor's announcements tonight on Medicare. At first glance they appear to go some way to address some of the short-term problems, but they will not address some of the long-term structural difficulties. We will certainly examine them in greater detail before the Senate committee inquiry. </para><para>This budget in the area of environment revealed cutbacks in crucial environment programs, including a decrease in promised expenditure under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Department of the Environment and Heritage has suffered cuts, including to staff, as have other Commonwealth environment agencies, including the Greenhouse Office and the Director of National Parks. The few high points in the environment budget were Democrat negotiated measures: at least $8 million in new money directed towards improving water quality into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; $29 million more to protect some valuable parts of the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, foreshores that would not be protected if it were not for the Democrats; $40 million going on improving our urban environment in areas such as air, water and fuel quality. The Democrats are also proud of the achievements with our long-term work on national fuel and emission standards and the extension of the environmental friendly Photovoltaic Rebate Scheme.</para><para>The new Sustainable Cities program, developed through negotiations with the Democrats and announced by the government, will enhance the Commonwealth's role in the management of toxic substances, water and waste and will substantially improve air quality and liveability in our cities. There is a whole range of measures in that package. They are not massive funding measures, but they are good ideas that have a significant, positive impact—and good ideas are not always expensive.</para><para>Attention must be drawn to the Prime Minister's broken commitment that he made to Australian families at the last election to make balancing work and family life a key priority of his third term. The inclusion of paid maternity leave in the budget would have been a very good start. The Democrats, along with the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, have clearly demonstrated that a national, government funded, paid maternity scheme is affordable and both economically and socially desirable. A Democrat private member's bill is before the Senate that would provide this without increasing cost to business. The Democrats have led debate on this issue, as has been acknowledged by Ms Goward herself.</para><para>There have been ongoing cuts to funding for women's services in crucial areas such as domestic violence. Funding for two important initiatives—the Partnerships against Domestic Violence strategy and the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault program—are winding down; again, flying in the face of this government's protestations that it cares about child sexual assault and abuse. This budget should have had money for a royal commission to clean up that tragic stain on our nation.</para><para>The government's increasing disregard for human rights is also reflected in its funding for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which, despite a minimal increase, is still 40 per cent less than when the coalition came to power. Of course this is consistent with the government's aim to undermine the independence of HREOC through legislation currently before the Senate. This year's budget contains little to improve Australians' access to justice. With only a very small increase to legal aid funding, more Australians will be denied legal representation in the courts. This is a false economy. More Australians are being forced to represent themselves and the result is that litigation is taking longer and costing more.</para><para>In immigration the government has not hesitated to continue to budget enormous amounts of money on detention and detection, turning away asylum seekers at sea and endangering lives. There is the continual wastage of defence funds and misuse of defence personnel, with another $18 million being put towards more Tampa and `children overboard' debacles following on the $41 million that has already been thrown overboard in the last few years. Temporary protection visas—that leftover One Nation policy—have had enormous impacts, not just on genuine refugees but on charities and non-government organisations. If we abolished temporary protection visas there would be significant savings on reprocessing of claims, court challenges, forced deportations and voluntary reintegration. Yet the cost in terms of giving refugees access to adequate support services would only be $26 million. </para><para>As I have noted, there was very little in the budget for our troops of yesterday or of today. The government has ignored the longstanding recommendations of both the RSL and the independent Clarke review of veterans' entitlements. There has been a bit of extra money for monuments and public relations—an extra $1 million for memorials and over $1½ million to help the Governor-General's office give awards. It seems to me to just provide a chance for coalition politicians to stand next to people who really have achieved something. On the eve of troops returning from Iraq, the best the government could do was announce that a draft of the new Military Compensation Scheme would be released shortly, seven years after it was promised.</para><para>The government is wrong when it claims that the cost of the Iraq war can be given as a figure in this year's budget. The cost of any war is not known until the last veteran dies. The defence budget confirms the government's priorities and plans of moving more towards acting with the United States in going to war against other countries. This funding does not assist in defending Australia or ensuring a stable region. Australia's commitment to overseas aid remains pathetic—less than half the level recommended by the United Nations—and leaves us lagging well behind the vast majority of OECD countries. So much for this government's professed interests in global security and stability!</para><para>This budget has missed the bus in relation to tourism, which is our fourth biggest industry nationally—one of the largest employers in regional Australia—and is now dealing with the cumulative effects of terrorism, the Ansett collapse, the war in Iraq and now the SARS virus. This year alone has seen a dramatic downturn in the inbound tourism market, which could result in losses of up to $2 billion. The Democrats have welcomed continued support for regional air services, but we remain concerned that the Ansett levy stays in place.</para><para>Regional Australia will continue to be denied access to the full range of ABC radio networks—nothing for the millions of Australians who cannot get Triple J or Classic FM, NewsRadio and parliamentary broadcasts. I am sure there would be millions of people in regional Australia listening tonight to the Democrats' response if they had that opportunity. The ABC cannot continue to offer digital multichannelling options without additional funding. Given the ABC's multichannelling has been one of the main incentives for people buying digital televisions, this could easily destroy one of the government's key broadcasting initiatives.</para><para>In the area of visual arts, the Democrats welcome the announcement in last night's budget of dedicated funding for the visual arts and crafts sector but say it falls well short of the recommended additional funding in the recent Myer report which resulted from the inquiry into contemporary visual arts and crafts. However, this extra funding is an important first step in the process of broader arts reform that will deliver real outcomes for Australia's artists. </para><para>In this year's Indigenous affairs budget the Democrats have welcomed some initiatives. We have been consistently asking for yearly reporting into Indigenous disadvantage, but there is still a major lack of involvement of Indigenous people. The costs of transitional arrangements for ATSIC and ATSIS have not been spelled out. The delivery of services and programs to Indigenous people must not be affected by this bureaucratic reshuffling. With the extra places in the CDEP Work for the Dole program, once again we see Indigenous people expected to deliver services to their own communities at cut price—services which the government would normally fund to the wider community.</para><para>In this budget, as with all budgets, there is a lot more to it than just balancing the books. Budgets express the priorities and plans, even the aspirations, of a nation into the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, admitted just last month that our country is not as egalitarian as it used to be and the gap between rich and poor in this country has widened and continues to widen. The Democrats will do all we can in the Senate and the general community to reverse that growing inequality and to protect our future as well as the environment. The Democrats' record in the Senate shows that we do not support changes that will widen inequality in Australia. We will maintain that fundamental approach in examining every single measure of this budget.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11302</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate Senator Bartlett on that speech on behalf of the Democrats. I also congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, on his contribution tonight, which stands in great and beneficial contrast to that of the government. Treasurer Costello's eighth budget, which the Greens hope will be his last, is the half-pack-of-cigarettes budget. His $4 tax cut is all the vision his budget has. Mr Costello's budget is strong on economic rationality, but weak on heart and vision.</para></talk.start><para>The Greens' vision is much bigger. We remind the electorate that there is another way. Governmental priorities can and should be refocused on the things that really matter to ordinary Australians. In the Senate, we will attempt to redirect the Treasurer's $2.4 billion tax cut to the health of our community, the education of the nation, the care of the environment that sustains us and our ability to live safely as peaceful citizens of our region and the wider world.</para><para>The Greens' vision is for free education at all levels, including higher education, and the abolition of HECS, instead of the government's attempts to Americanise our university system—that would be at a cost of less than $1.7 billion per annum. It is for the use of $6 billion a year estimated by the government's own scientific advisers to repair the environment instead of losing it to the most recent corporate tax cuts, which reduce the rate from 36 per cent when this government came to office to the current 30 per cent. It is for money for the ABC instead of the $270 million corporate tax cut for the multinationals, which we opposed at the outset and which, I understand, the opposition may have followed suit in opposing tonight.</para><para>The Greens' vision is for the diversion of $2.3 billion private health insurance rebate to public hospitals, doctors and health promotion and the extension of Medicare to dentistry and mental health services, instead of the government's attempt to dismantle Medicare. It is for giving an extra $3 billion a year, now given to the logging, mining, road transport industries and fuel subsidies in the GST deal, to environmental repair and protection instead. It is for increasing the overseas aid budget by $515 million as a first step toward meeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, instead of the paltry one-quarter of a per cent we give now. It is for a parental leave scheme of 18 weeks, funded up to the average weekly earnings. </para><para>After 20 years, the emperor's new clothes of economic rationalism have worn very thin for most Australians, the majority of whom are losers in this so-called new economy. After decades of this formulaic approach, the credibility of the good news of economic management is in tatters, as many Australians struggle with the bad news experience of a growing divide between rich and poor and a deep sense of insecurity.</para><para>It is not just those at the bottom of the economic ladder who are no longer buying the budget night self-congratulation of governments. Those on middle incomes—the majority of Australians—are beginning to doubt the wisdom of the economic rationalist approach altogether. The recent publication of Clive Hamilton's <inline font-style="italic">Growth Fetish</inline>, Michael Pusey's <inline font-style="italic">The Experience o</inline><inline font-style="italic">f Middle Australia</inline> and, indeed, Fred Argy's <inline font-style="italic">Where to f</inline><inline font-style="italic">rom Here?</inline> provide timely documentation of this groundswell of dissatisfaction. The Greens have long recognised the kinds of trends that led Pusey to say:</para><quote><para>The ugly reality of economic reform has taught middle Australia that the level playing field is a moral fiction. In the food chain of the new capitalism they see egoistic and predatory corporate moguls ... at the top and themselves at the bottom.</para></quote><para>Pusey reports that middle Australia feels that the benefits of growth have gone to the rich and to big business. This feeling is not due to an inability to understand or an envy for those better off. It is demonstrably true. These matters are demonstrably true. For example, the government's budget this week offers personal income tax cuts of around $4 a week for middle income earners; yet since 1998 business tax rates have fallen from 49 per cent to 30 per cent, as CEOs reap multimillion dollar packages. The proportion of this country's income that goes to our wage and salary earners has fallen by seven per cent in the last 25 years. And, most disturbingly, our political leaders now seem to have accepted that this country will permanently have six per cent of people without a job, many of them living in the same households—in the same families—trapped on the wrong side of the great economic divide. Commenting on this groundswell of unrest, Alex Millmow, an economist from Charles Sturt University, notes:</para><motion><para>That stock of altruism—something Adam Smith felt kept capitalism from degenerating into a dog-eat-dog society—is fast wearing down.</para></motion><para>Robert Manne, from La Trobe University, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last week, echoed that concern. He said:</para><quote><para>What many people seem to yearn for is a world in which they are treated not as consumers or as dispensable cogs in an indifferent machine but as citizens and as human beings.</para></quote><para>Even the Prime Minister appears to have sniffed the winds of change, saying:</para><quote><para>There are still far too many people in Australia who are not getting a share of the bounty of this country, through no fault of their own, to which they are entitled.</para></quote><para>But it is hard to see any evidence in this budget that the Prime Minister has taken this concern at all seriously. The Greens say that resolute action is needed to treat the wounds inflicted by economic rationalism, action that we Greens see as both desirable and—note this—affordable.</para><para>One of the primary responsibilities of government is to redistribute power and wealth, to benefit the least powerful and the least wealthy. In large measure, this is achieved through investment in public goods, like a strong public health care system, a robust accessible education sector and a social security system that provides adequate support for all of those in need. However, the Howard government prefers to give tax cuts to high-income earners, like last year's proposed reductions in the superannuation surcharge, the corporate tax cuts I have spoken about and the tax cuts announced for multinationals in this budget—all that while it imposes a regressive flat tax, the GST. </para><para>The Howard government prefers to impose a punitive breaching regime on people unable to earn income, fining them $1 billion since 1996. It is stealing money from people who struggle to meet their basic living expenses when it should be working to abolish poverty by providing an adequate social safety net and active job creation policies. </para><para>The Howard government prefers to run down the public health system by robbing it of $2.3 billion every year to subsidise private health insurance and claim it is offering choice—even though this is not the choice of the Australian people. Redirecting this money would go a long way towards restoring bulk-billing of medical services, reducing waiting lists for elective surgery in our public hospitals and extending Medicare to areas of need, like dental and medical health services.</para><para>We can also afford a national paid parental leave scheme for new parents who want to stay in the work force. The Australian Greens have developed a model that provides 18 weeks of leave, paid up to the average wage, which could be largely funded from redirecting the poorly directed baby bonus and savings on family tax payments. We can afford this right now.</para><para>As the ACTU reminded us all last week, most of the jobs created during the 1990s paid less than $26,000 a year, and indeed half of them less than $15,500 a year. This stands in stark contrast to the total earnings of the top five per cent of income earners of $62 billion a year which, put together, is more than the nation spends on all its social security and family payments. Clearly we are seeing an exacerbation of the divide that is opening up between rich and poor Australians out of the formulaic, economic rationalist direction of governments over the last 20 years. What we Greens are presenting, and will continue to present, is an option that will close that gap and end that increasing poverty, particularly on the wrong side of the gap, which is built into this year's budget.</para><para>On education, the Greens see the guarantee of universal access to a quality public education system as a core responsibility of government. From preschool to university and TAFE, investing in the education of our society makes sense economically and socially. The deregulation of fees is perhaps the most significant change announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night. It is a change that sets our universities firmly on a course back to an era of elitism where a good degree was available only to those who could afford it. Introducing a financial selection criterion has no place in the Australian university environment. This, together with the expansion of full fee-paying places for domestic students, is a hammer blow to the egalitarian idea of a comprehensive university system. It will ultimately degrade academic standards and the reputations of our universities.</para><para>Aggressively competitive research funding will stratify the sector to the disadvantage of regional and newer universities. These institutions will then be pressurised further by competition from private outfits now able to access government research dollars in what is a creeping privatisation of the tertiary sector, and it will be underwritten by public money.</para><para>It is, of course, the students and their parents who will bear the cost changes. Many will decide that it is simply not worth it. The loss of human capital from such short-sighted penny pinching is hard to quantify, but for every bright student who turns their back on the chance of a higher education—and currently universities are turning away 20,000 such students every year—as a result of these reforms that is a loss to Australia's future as well as a loss to them. Meanwhile, the long-suffering academic staff, whose morale is already battered from year after year of underfunding and competitive pressure, are losing their right to bargain collectively in this government package. This measure is pure union bashing. It is an example of government coming between worker and employer, uninvited and unwanted, to make political mischief. </para><para>The Greens reject this restructure and look to commit significant ongoing funds directly from government to achieve the world-class education system that Australia deserves. The Greens will oppose these measures that stratify education and health to give the advantage to the rich and the disadvantage to the poor. We will oppose those measures here in this Senate. We challenge the government, and the opposition for that matter, to explain why we cannot afford the $1.7 billion per annum that it would cost to totally abolish HECS and return to free tertiary education, the right of all Australians. In our view, we can, and we would, do that. It would be a far better investment than most of the $6.8 billion given annually to the corporations through corporate welfare.</para><para>On the environment, one of the great disasters of the Howard government has been the handling of this nation's, and indeed the planet's, ecosystems. This budget continues the serial cuts to the environment through underspending year after year. This is financial dishonesty. Every year you see the budget allocations put there, and every year you see that the previous budget allocations were underspent. That is at ministerial direction; that is government policy.</para><para>It is a financial dishonesty from Messrs Howard and Costello which is masked by regular changes to the format of the budget statements—designed to confuse and obscure. That of course runs right through the budget presentation each year. However, what is clear is that spending on climate change has been slashed by over half a billion dollars through systematic underspending. Less than half of the nearly $1 billion which the government regularly boasts of having committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions will have been spent by the due date of June next year.</para><para>Another $11.6 billion has been added to the government's Rio Tinto energy policy for a so-called `cooperative research centre for carbon dioxide sequestration'—that is, promoting the burning of coal over other options. Since this largesse appears nowhere except in the environment statement, it could indeed be a stuff-up. But if it is not, it is not a financial mistake; it is an environmental one—another hand-out to the coal industry, which is our nation's worst polluter. Fuel taxes are being actively used by this government to promote greenhouse gas emissions, with the loss of automatic indexation of fuel excise but now its application to LPG.</para><para>The Prime Minister's own national action plan on salinity this year has been slashed from the planned $150 million to much less than half, at $62 million. The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council costed the repair bill for fixing our natural systems at about $6 billion annually, or $60 billion over 10 years. If we do not do the repair now, that bill will get much greater in the future.</para><para>The Greens have a big-ticket vision of what the Commonwealth could do for the environment. We would pour the necessary water back into the Murray now. And I congratulate Mr Crean and the opposition for tackling the issue of repair, reinvigoration and refreshment of the Murray-Darling system—something totally left out of the account from Mr Costello and Mr Howard just two nights ago. </para><para>We would use Commonwealth power to stop broadscale land clearing now. And I note Mr Crean has indicated, while not stating explicitly, the same. We would ratify Kyoto now. And I note that Labor is also promising that. We would move to increase Australia's mandatory renewable energy target to 10 per cent from the current two per cent.</para><para>But some of the most important decisions this government could make on the environment would have negligible or positive impacts on the budget bottom line. For example, protecting Tasmania's forests now—the grandest, tallest, greatest hardwood forests in the world—would protect their biodiversity. It would protect their water. It would protect the soil and safeguard—note this—the biggest carbon banks, the biggest hedges against global warming, in the Southern Hemisphere.</para><para>Stopping the tax breaks for plantation investors would save money for the government and stop most of the clear-felling of native forests in Tasmania and elsewhere. Without those tax breaks, the costs would not be there. They effectively subsidise the environmental degradation. Introducing vigorous measures to save energy by making buildings, appliances and industrial processes more efficient would be the most cost-effective climate change action the government could take. It would invigorate ecotechnology in this country. It would get behind small business and innovative brain power, which this country has an enormous repository of—and get it going. It would create the jobs and make Australia a powerhouse for environmental technology—not just for our nation but for our region, and indeed the whole world.</para><para>Talking of the whole world brings me to the subject of aid. At the heart of the Greens' opposition to the war on Iraq was the knowledge that ultimately peace and security can only be achieved through addressing global injustice. While the Howard government was at the forefront of the war on Iraq—a global leader on the issue, albeit at the behest of President Bush—the opposite is true when it comes to helping to address worldwide poverty and inequality. Why are we not a global leader in promoting the alleviation of poverty and human misery? Instead, this Costello budget has seen overseas aid, our cheque to humanity, slashed again. Australia's overseas aid has slipped to a paltry one-quarter of one per cent of GDP, when the accepted target is 0.7 per cent. It is one third of what it should be. Simply to start the government on the path to meet the global millennium development goals to which it signed up through the United Nations would require $515 million in this year's budget. This is what the Greens would deliver as a very small first step. Instead, the government has a budget allocation of almost $750 million for the war on Iraq.</para><para>For this government to lecture anyone on fiscal responsibility is laughable when we consider the haemorrhaging of public funds currently going to finance the ill-conceived pork barrels and corporate welfare that the government has funded.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It's cheaper than East Timor.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—The member opposite says that the ill-conceived pork barrels in corporate welfare are cheaper than East Timor. I do not think it is a good analogy.

We had here today members of the government benches arguing that $40 million or $50 million would be too much to allow Australians to decide at referendum whether five million adult Australians should not have the right to stand for parliament—a right denied by a slip-up in the Constitution under section 44. They voted it down on that argument. The government cannot get $40 million or $50 million to give people the option of changing an unintended but really regressive part of the Constitution, but it can find $60 million for this union-chasing Cole royal commission.</para><para>Hundreds of millions of dollars went to the so-called Pacific solution of diverting asylum seekers to the prison camps on Nauru and elsewhere.

Company tax rates, however, have fallen 19 per cent in the last 15 years, while the GST and a still terribly low tax-free threshold and bracket creep see the lowest paid facing an intolerably high tax burden. Australians also have a sense of fair play which is offended by the completely unequal treatment of people on unemployment benefits or disability pensions compared with corporate welfare cheats. Thousands of people have lost their savings or income in the collapse of companies like HIH and One.Tel and the corporate vandalism of mutual companies like AMP and the NRMA. However, to recover billions for the community from these corporate shonks, the government has only allocated an extra $11 million per annum to regulatory bodies. Compare that with the fact that, to recover $25 million a year—not billions but $25 million—from people on disability pensions, the government has allocated an extra $5 million a year for compliance. That is punitive on the poor and ridiculously easy on the rich. It is a total warping of the priorities and responsibilities of government.</para><para>The government should not be relied upon to provide all the answers or deliver the kind of happiness that Clive Hamilton talks about as being so lacking for large swathes of the population. But government does have a crucial role in maintaining an environment in which these goals are realistic for all Australians.

In putting this alternative vision, I am enormously pleased and feel empowered by having with me in this parliament Senator Nettle and Michael Organ, the honourable member for Cunningham in the House of Representatives. As we grow, we put to the people of Australia a vision with real alternatives; compared with the economic rationalism which, unfortunately, infests and is ineradicable from both the government and the opposition of the day. Australians are waking up to the fact that the government has lost sight of its basic priorities and the things we as Australians pay it to fairly achieve.  </para><para>The rise of the Greens and our alternative proposals for a fairer Australia, with a more secure future based in humanitarian and ecological strategy, gives many Australians a real option in what are pretty daunting times.

The Greens do this in the interests of all Australia's people, through this wonderful democracy of ours, for Australia's land, its culture and our future.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Boswell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>11308</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Order!

He was much taller and more well built than I had expected. While he was in his 80s, he walked with a surety and steadfastness born of having to watch every step. He certainly matched the legend. Come to think of it, he was a much larger figure in every way than the entertainers who fill today's tabloids and assault our senses. Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest, one of the great explorers and adventurers of last century, had come to launch his autobiography in Brisbane. Let me put it very simply: he captivated his audience. But of course, I am biased, for I have admired him since I was a child, although not, it must be admitted, without a touch of envy. </para></talk.start><para>We admire heroes because they show us what we are capable of. They stand for us and represent our capacity to prevail. They defend us against our own tendency to be sucked down into despair, depression or perhaps even boredom. They raise our hopes and our spirits, they open up new frontiers, even if only within our imagination, and they inspire us. This is particularly so of Sir Edmund Hillary. Mind you, he would likely disagree. At his own insistence, he is no hero. He, too, suffered from doubt. He frequently had a fear of dying. He fell down crevasses, barely escaped avalanches and often suffered severe altitude sickness. He claims no secrets to overcoming fear or failure; only that none of us should be afraid of a long climb to reach our dreams, nor should we let fear of failure stop us from taking that first step. Sir Edmund simply says that he was an enthusiastic climber, was highly motivated and had a deep desire to achieve.</para><para>With the 1953 British expedition to Everest, he happened to be in the right place at the right time. The Swiss had nearly reached the summit the year before and then, just days prior to Hillary's and Tenzing's successful ascent, two colleagues had just failed to reach the top of Mount Everest. Mount Everest's mercurial challenges, its `roar of a thousand tigers', had saved her summit for Hillary and Tenzing. Later, Sir Edmund was to engage in many other adventures, including reaching the South Pole with a New Zealand expeditionary party in 1958 as part of the Commonwealth trans-Antarctic expedition led by Sir Vivian Fuchs. I well remember as a teenager watching a documentary on television in the late 1970s about Sir Edmund and a team aboard jet boats attempting to trace the Ganges River from the coast to its source in the Himalayas. In a life full of adventure, honours, writing, fundraising and lecturing, he has achieved so very much. But it is with Everest that Hillary will forever be joined. His assent with Tenzing Norgay on 29 May 1953, 50 years ago this month, will always rank as one of the greatest examples of human endurance, skill and courage. </para><para>Yet despite all the fame and glory that Sir Edmund attracted for this magnificent achievement, it is not why I am addressing the Senate tonight. No, others can better talk about mountaineering and adventuring than I can. I admire Sir Edmund Hillary because even if, as he modestly says, he was just lucky to catch the right time, the expedition, the climbers and the weather to scale Mount Everest, he has done so very much for our world since that first ascent 50 years ago. I admire him because he has purchased so much with serendipity's bequest. With his fame he has bought not riches for himself but a better life for the people of the Himalayas. In the past 40 years, since he established the Himalayan Trust, Sir Edmund has raised funds and helped build 27 schools—`schools,' Sir Edmund says, `among the clouds'—two hospitals and 13 village health clinics for the Sherpa people, as well as many bridges, mountain airfields and freshwater pipelines. It is for his work for the trust and for the people of Nepal that Sir Edmund Hillary truly becomes a great figure. He used nature's gifts of energy, courage and motivation and God's gift of timing to give back to the people of Nepal. It is this contribution to society, this great civic achievement, that is to me the essence of the man and his claim to a special place in our collective admiration. This is his true heroism.</para><para>Life has not always been easy for Sir Edmund. The loss of his wife and daughter in a tragic accident in the Himalayas was a blow that he says he still feels guilty about. As those in politics know, even those who climb the highest can never insure against sorrow. But, just as he taught us all to believe in challenges that are so great that they will stretch us and then stretch us some more, so he himself never shirked from living his own advice. Sir Edmund Hillary recently wrote:</para><quote><para>I have had much good fortune, a fair amount of success and a share of sorrow too ... Achievements are important and I have revelled in a good number of adventures, but far more worthwhile are the tasks I have been able to carry out for my friends in the Himalayas. They too have been great challenges in a different way—building mountain airfields and schools, hospitals and clinics, and renewing remote Buddhist monasteries. These are the projects that I will always remember.</para></quote><para>We cannot all climb Mount Everest. Thank goodness for that, you might say. It is certainly good for Mount Everest. But we should all be thankful for people like Sir Edmund Hillary who show us what we ordinary people of `modest abilities', as he says, are all capable of with just a `goodly share of imagination and plenty of energy', and that we do not have to be famous adventurers and great explorers to strive to climb our own Everests and seek a view from the summit or at least a peek from the Hillary Step.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Sugar Industry</title><page.no>11309</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>11309</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about the sugar industry. The Senate has heard on many occasions over the past few months about the economic and social crisis in the sugar industry. The collapse in world sugar prices has caused a crisis in the industry of monumental proportions. Sugar producers have had negative incomes in many cases. Whole communities have been on the edge of social and economic catastrophe. The federal and Queensland governments have been very slow to react to this crisis, and when help arrived it was in a form that was of little benefit to many producers on the ground. Funding was provided for exiting the industry, but little was provided for those who wished to stay. Money was provided for regional industry initiatives but there was nothing to ease the immediate financial crisis in sugar communities. Since last year the world sugar price has recovered a little, but no-one expects full price recovery any time soon. So the crisis continues. </para></talk.start><para>The Queensland government has adopted an extraordinary response to this crisis. At a time when the industry is facing financial upheaval, the Queensland government last month introduced laws into the parliament to exacerbate the crisis. It has produced a radical deregulation process that will dramatically reduce the bargaining power of cane farmers at a time when the price being paid to cane farmers is so low. This is particularly surprising, because the leader of the Queensland government, Premier Peter Beattie, has been one of the most trenchant critics of national competition policy. Yet this same Peter Beattie's government has commissioned one of the most virulent, economic rationalist think tanks in the country—the Centre for International Economics—to advise it what to do about the sugar industry.</para><para>Not surprisingly, the CIE recommended radical industry deregulation. More surprisingly, the Beattie government has endorsed their recommendations. This is despite the analysis by prominent Queensland economists like Professor Ted Kolsen, Professor Rod Jensen and Dr Mark McGovern. Dr McGovern noted that the reform proposals focused solely on productivity, ignoring important challenges of industry development and cooperation. A broader analysis, he said, would include the current decline and volatility of income from sugar, implications for investment and a climate of uncertainty arising from the reform proposals. Professor Kolsen describes the report as a valiant effort but concludes, `So far there is no clear set of changes which will ensure the industry will do better. Hopeful assumptions will not do.' The Boston Consulting Group report to the Canegrowers organisation states:</para><quote><para>Given the nature of these industry constraints, simple deregulation is unlikely to ensure that industry is able to exploit these opportunities. Even if deregulation were effective in removing constraints on industry performance, it is likely to result in a significant redistribution of industry returns from growers to millers.</para></quote><para>Even the Queensland parliament's own Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has criticised the legislation, arguing in a report earlier this week that the financial penalties for illegal trading are too high, that there are inappropriate reversals of the onus of proof and that the transitional arrangements are problematic.</para><para>On 31 January this year I wrote to Premier Beattie regarding my concerns about the CIE report, which in a nutshell are that the CIE is an ideologically driven think tank that represents the pro-competition policy end of the spectrum and would be expected to support blanket deregulation of the industry; that dairy deregulation was supposed to have benefited everyone but resulted in higher costs of milk for consumers, lower returns for farmers and a decline in milk sales—why would we expect to see the same thing happen to sugar?—and that the CIE fails to make a convincing case for the reforms that it advocates. I urge the Queensland government to adopt a cautious approach to the deregulation of sugar and to ensure that any reforms should clearly be in Queensland's best interests, having regard to the full economic, social and environmental costs.</para><para>What disappoints me has been the Queensland government's inflexibility in dealing with this legislation. The two cane growers organisations—the Cane Farmers Association and Canegrowers—were briefed but not consulted on the terms of the legislation, and only days before it was introduced. The very valid criticisms of the CIE report, by Kolsen, Jensen and McGovern, and by CS First Boston, have been ignored without proper analysis. But, amazingly, it has not just been the economic experts and the cane growers who were not properly consulted; the Queensland government failed to consult the federal government, which is providing $120 million of the $150 million in financial assistance.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—Exactly right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—Exactly right, Senator Boswell. This concerns me, and I expect the federal government not to let this slight pass by.

The Democrats negotiated a reform package that delivered better environmental outcomes. The Democrats expect the government to honour its agreements to us and we expect it to insist that agreements made with it by the states are also honoured. The 25 September memorandum of understanding between the federal and Queensland governments could not have been more clear. It states that, while the governments recognise that regulation is a state matter, both governments share an interest in it. It states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para> The Governments agree that the following areas appear to impede increased competitiveness and efficiency, and are detrimental to cultural change and innovation:</para></quote><para>·	the cane production area system;</para><para>·	the statutory bargaining system; and</para><para>·	the compulsory acquisition of raw sugar for marketing and selling within the domestic market.</para><quote><para>10.

National Party Leader John Anderson and Agriculture Minister Truss have been strident in saying that they were not consulted and that Queensland is, as a result, in breach of the agreement. Mr Anderson last week said:</para><quote><para>We've always said reforms are needed ... </para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>I'm not convinced that the legislation has it 100 per cent right in that regard.

But the laws have not been withdrawn. Why? Because the Commonwealth has not made the request. I am calling on the Commonwealth to make that call and to insist that these laws be withdrawn for further consideration. The mad ideological assumptions underpinning the Queensland reforms in the CIE report need to be properly scrutinised. At the very least, the Queensland government needs to be forced to consult cane growers properly, listen to their concerns and make the appropriate adjustments to the harshest aspects of the scheme.</para><para>The Canegrowers organisation, for example, has pointed out that contracts have already been let for the next growing season which do not take into account these laws. It is staggering that the Queensland government has not even properly been advised on current industry arrangements and procedures before introducing its legislation. As I have said, I expect the agreements to be honoured. The Democrats supported the federal government's sugar package because we expected then to abide by their agreements and to see their agreements honoured. Buck-passing and point-scoring off the Queensland government by federal ministers is not good enough. Mr Anderson should get on the phone and ask Mr Beattie to withdraw his legislation and consult more widely on it.  </para><para>The sugar industry in Queensland is in pain and crisis, and deregulation pursuant to an ideologically driven economic rationalist agenda can only make that crisis worse. In the interests of the long-term viability of the sugar industry, I urge the federal minister for agriculture to put aside the politics of state-federal negotiations and critically analyse this state's legislation. The sugar industry and the Queensland and Australian economies cannot afford to fall victim to the vagaries of ideology or petty politics. What we need is a sustainable plan for the future of this industry that is built on sound social, economic and environmental considerations.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Gunns Ltd</title><page.no>11312</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11312</page.no><name role="metadata">Colbeck, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator COLBECK</name><name.id>00AOL</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me no pleasure to rise this evening to talk of the disgraceful attempts by a member of this place to discredit Australian and Tasmanian businesses and destroy and shut down a Tasmanian industry.

Since November 2002, Australia, through AFS Ltd, has been represented on the PEFC Council, which includes 26 member countries. The PEFC is the Pan-European Forest Certification scheme. It is the largest forest certification umbrella organisation in the world and had 46.5 million hectares of forest under certification worldwide at the end of January 2003.

No. Did Senator Brown tell the Japanese companies that 68 per cent of Tasmanian old-growth forest is protected in formal reserves? No. Did Senator Brown tell the Japanese companies that Tasmania has a forest practices system in place outside the reserve areas with proscriptions in place to protect fauna and flora which results in 86 per cent of the state's public old-growth forests being protected either in formal reserves or through these proscriptions? No. Did Senator Brown tell the Japanese companies that around 95 per cent of the high quality wilderness areas are also protected in reserves? Of course not. Did Senator Brown tell the Japanese that FSC certification does not exist in Australia? Of course not. Quite frankly, the use of misinformation to undermine Australian firms, including Tasmanian firms, and Australian jobs, including Tasmanian jobs, is indefensible.

Let me start by saying that in different roles to my present role I have been critical in the past of federal budgets in terms of this territory, including federal budgets of the coalition government. So I believe I am able to distinguish between a good budget for the ACT and a bad one. The budget that was brought down on Tuesday of this week is a very good budget for the ACT. It is a budget which creates jobs, a budget which strengthens the ACT's health and education systems, a budget which provides for important benefits to our city that has been badly affected by natural disaster in the last six months and a budget which will allow the ACT government as the party responsible for basic services in this city to build the quality of those services in the future. I appreciate that many things get said around budget time which are best described as hyperbole. At the moment there is much of that occurring in this place. I include particularly in that description a media release from Senator Kate Lundy in which she says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Howard government budget last night stripped Canberra of jobs and funding.</para></quote><para>She then goes on to list a number of agencies and departments where funding has been cut and, as a result, jobs have been lost—according to Senator Lundy, at least. I concede that this budget does contain some job losses. There are certain areas where funding has been reduced and where, as a result, some jobs in particular areas will be lost. But to imagine that any government of any description in any part of Australia can take a government service provision and make changes to the way in which that service is provided without seeing some job losses occur in some areas and some job gains occur in others is simply ridiculous. Indeed, in this year's budget the federal government has provided for some job reductions but, most particularly, it has provided for job increases.</para><para>The total picture from this year's budget for the ACT is extremely positive. Unlike Senator Lundy, I have done the homework on the job gains provided for in the federal Public Service in this budget. Those gains include 1,230 jobs in the Australian Taxation Office; 383 jobs in the Department of Family and Community Services; 251 new jobs in the Australian Federal Police; 68 jobs in ASIO; 84 jobs in the Department of Health and Ageing; 49 jobs in the Department of Finance and Administration; 100 jobs in Immigration; 23 at the Australian Trade Commission; 30 in ATSIC; 10 in the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources; 55 in Communications; 198 in the Department of Education, Science and Training; 25 in ANSTO; one in ANTA; 26 in Agriculture; and 98 in ASIC. That leads to a grand figure in job creation of 2,631 jobs.</para><para>Senator Lundy drew attention to 614 jobs that she can count as disappearing—good luck to her. But anybody would need to do only a small amount of calculation to realise that that adds up to a net gain to Public Service numbers of well over 2,000 jobs. Of the 2,000 jobs created in this budget, a substantial proportion of those are in the Australian Capital Territory. By all means get out there and get stuck into the budget and find its flaws and look for the weaknesses, but do not make things up. To suggest that this budget strips Canberra of jobs and funding is simply not true. Although, of course, some of those jobs are outside the ACT, in comparing apples with apples you have to assume that a substantial number of the job gains, and there are many more of them, will be in the ACT, just as some of those job losses will be in the ACT. </para><para>On top of that net job creation position in this budget, we see many other benefits of direct value to the Australian Capital Territory community. We see tax cuts. It is clear that residents of the ACT, on average, enjoy higher levels of income and, therefore, pay higher levels of tax on average than other Australians. The result of that, of course, is that higher tax cuts could be expected by ACT residents. The federal government has provided for $113 million to promote education in overseas markets and to do other things. It may be surprising to members of this place to know that the ACT has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, levels of overseas student numbers in the country. It is surprising because we have a large number of tertiary institutions in this city—four universities alone. We have a high degree of international presence, with embassies and high commissions. It is hard to understand why there should be such small numbers of overseas students. It follows that spending $113 million or so on promoting education overseas must be of substantial benefit to the ACT community because of its present low level of overseas students.</para><para>Similarly, to spend so much money on defence across the board must be of substantial benefit to the ACT. Quite apart from the projects for capital spending in defence in the ACT, including at places such as HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Harman</inline>, there is of course the very important project in the Defence portfolio, Headquarters Australian Theatre. Although built in New South Wales just outside the border of the ACT, its economic benefits in a range of areas, including public and private sector employment, will be very substantial indeed for the ACT.</para><para>I look forward to seeing the half a billion or so dollars spent on ACT hospitals that this budget foreshadowed, if the ACT government picks up the opportunity which this presents. Over the next five years, I look forward to a 17 per cent increase in funding on other health matters in the ACT under the Australian health care agreements, if the ACT government picks up that opportunity. The ACT stands to benefit very substantially from those arrangements because we in this territory have among the lowest rates, if not the lowest rate, of bulk-billing in the country.

However, the 697 members of the Army Individual Emergency Force, who were transferred to the Active Reserve as detailed in the Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002, have been given until 31 March 2003 to make an election to either remain in the Active Reserve or transfer to the Standby Reserve. </para><para>(3)	No. Reservists were transferred to the new categories of service with their extant training commitments and conditions of service. All Reservists are subject to the call out obligations under the Defence Act 1903.</para><para>(a)	The changes have standardised Reserve categories across the three Services. All Services now have a Standby Reserve. The changes also provide for introduction of the new high readiness categories of Reserve service. The new categories will provide the Chiefs of Service with greater flexibility regarding Reserve availability and employment.</para><para>(b)	When the new high readiness categories are raised, Reservists within those categories are planned to have different training commitments and conditions of service to other Reservists. These are under development.</para><para>(4)	The Standby Reserve has no annual training commitment. Each Active Reserve has a minimum annual training commitment determined by the Service Chief (Navy - 20 days; Army - 14 days, except for specialists - 7 days; Air Force - 32 days). The Air Force Specialist Reserve has a minimum annual training commitment of 7 days. All Reservists are liable for call out under section 50D of the Defence Act 1903, which allows for the Governor-General to call out all or part of the Reserves for circumstances ranging from war or warlike operations, peacekeeping or peace enforcement activities, assistance to other Government authorities and agencies, to civil aid, humanitarian assistance, civil emergency or disaster relief. After call out, under section 50E of the Defence Act 1903 a member of the Reserves must render the period of continuous full time service that is directed; this period of service may be indefinite or limited in duration.</para><para>(5)	The Chiefs of Service will be required under the Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002 to establish a Standby Reserve and allow them to establish other Reserve categories as required to meet capability directives and requirements. The Navy is developing a policy for the development and utilisation of High Readiness and Specialist Reserves, with an expected completion date of December 2003. The Chief of Army has indicated an intention to establish a High Readiness Reserve that will better enable some Reservists to commit to contingencies at very short notice. The Air Force has not yet made a decision to raise High Readiness categories. An Air Force study to determine Wartime Establishment will identify Reserve capability requirements and the need for High Readiness Reserves.</para><para>(6)	Each Service is evaluating the need for the establishment of each category and final decisions on the form of each Reserve component are yet to be made. </para><para>(7)	(a)	The Standby Reserve provides a pool of trained personnel with experience and skills able to fill capability gaps in the Permanent Force, Active Reserve or Specialist Reserve and to provide rotational and surge capacities. It can also be used to meet particular skill or capability needs on operations or in support activities.</para><para>(b)	There are no Defence capabilities that are only provided by Standby Reservists. Depending on the skill sets and experience of the members of the Standby Reserve, any Defence capability may be bolstered by the use of Standby Reservists.</para><para>(8)	(a)	An individual Standby Reservist's capabilities are measured in terms of the skills he or she holds that are available for employment by the ADF. Generally this assessment reflects the member's skill levels at the time of entry to the Standby Reserve, whether the member is able to maintain those skills through Reserve service or civil employment, and the length of time since the member transferred to the Standby Reserve. </para><para>(b)	Generally, re-assessment is not required unless consideration is being given to the employment of the Standby Reservist, such as on voluntary Defence service. The same considerations would apply in the event of a call-out of the Reserves. </para><para>(9)	A Standby Reservist has no annual training commitment and is not paid unless he or she undertakes a period of Defence service. For part-time service undertaken utilising Reserve training salaries, the Standby Reservist is paid standard Reserve rates of pay. For any period of full-time service, the Standby Reservist is paid Permanent Force rates of pay.</para><para>(10)	Yes.</para><para>(11)	Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002 allow appointment or enlistment to the Standby Reserve by an Australian who has never been a member of the ADF. However, as a matter of policy, the Chiefs of Service require that a person initially be appointed or enlisted in the respective Active Reserve to undergo recruit training. After successful completion of initial Reserve training requirements, the person may then transfer to the Standby Reserve.</para><para>(12)	No. As detailed in Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002, the new category of service for each member was determined by that member's existing category of service at that time the Regulations commenced.</para><para>(13)	(a) and (b) No. Since the commencement of the Regulations, members have been able to apply for transfer between categories.

It is conducted by the Marriage Celebrants Section of the Attorney-General's Department. The process only applies to those marriage celebrants authorised by the Commonwealth. Complaints involving marriage celebrants from recognised denominations are the responsibility of State and Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages.</para><para>In order for a matter to be regarded as a complaint in relation to a marriage celebrant the Department must receive correspondence in writing. The matter complained of must also relate to a marriage celebrant's role in solemnizing marriages. </para><para>The complainant must give written permission for a copy of the complaint to be forwarded to the marriage celebrant. The complaint is then forwarded to the celebrant and he or she is asked to respond in writing, usually within 21 days. The complaint and the celebrant's response are then considered by the Department in the light of the marriage celebrant's roles and responsibilities under the Marriage Act 1961 (the Act) and the Marriage Regulations 1963. A written response from the Department is then provided to both the celebrant and the complainant. In extreme circumstances a recommendation can be made to the Attorney-General's delegate to revoke the authorisation of the marriage celebrant.</para><para>As a result of amendments to the Marriage Act 1961 contained in the Marriage Amendment Act 2002, section 37K of the Act now provides that a new complaints mechanism to deal with complaints against marriage celebrants will be established. The new mechanism is currently being developed in consultation with marriage celebrant associations, and will be more open and accountable. </para><para>(2)	(a) Departmental records indicate that 19 complaints were lodged in 2000-01 and (b) 17 complaints were lodged in 2001-02. </para><para>(3)	 In 2000-01 15 complaints proceeded because the complaint was in writing, related to a marriage celebrant's performance of his or her duties as a marriage celebrant, and permission was received to forward the complaint to the marriage celebrant for response. In the case of five of those complaints the Department concluded that the complaint was not justified. One complaint was referred to a State Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages for appropriate action.
