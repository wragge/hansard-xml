                            rise to make a personal explanation. Last night, in answer to an interjection by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline>
                            MacDonald, I made some references to the Causeway district of Canberra. In its issue this morning the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>
                            was good enough to point out that, obviously, I had confused Causeway with Molonglo. My remarks were correct and justified as applied to the Molonglo settlement, but the position in relation to Causeway if different. As the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>
                            mentioned this morning, the houses at Causeway were built for workers at the time that Canberra was in the making. They are not of the standard which I regard as satisfactory for homes for workers. Some which were in a bad condition or in an unhealthy situation have been destroyed. As part of its post-war housing plans, the Government proposes to provide better homes for workers, and some of them will be made available to Causeway residents. I take this opportunity to say that some of the most public-spirited citizens of the National Capital live in the Causeway district.I am grateful to them for making the best of the conditions which exist there; 1 know that many of the homes at Causeway are a credit to their occupants. I have thought it right to make this personal explanation, and I hope that it will be found satisfactory to all who may be interested.

I remind the honorable senator that many men impressed in the service of the Allied Works Council have also spent considerable periods, in some cases aslong as five years, at isolated outposts. </para>

Immediately they become surplus Army equipment they are handed over to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Recently, I made available to that body about 1,000 vehicles in Western Australia and a similar number in New South Wales. As difficulty has been experienced in disposing of these vehicles through the normal trade channels, in Western Australia they are now being disposed of by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission according to a system of priorities. Everything possible is being done to dispose of these vehicles as they become surplus. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to address a question to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> concerning the operations of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms. The annual report of the Auditor-General, as published in the press to-day, contains a statement to the effect that the Profit and Loss Account for the year 1943-44 was submitted for audit but owing to an unsatisfactory feature of a serious character disclosed by the examination, a certificate of the correctness of the account had not been given. I was wondering whether, before a wrong impression got abroad, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would obtain information as to what exactly the Auditor-General refers and whether the position is so serious as is implied in the Auditor-General##'##s report. </para>

                        <para>- The Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms are under the control of the Joint House Committee. The  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> control the staff. Occasionally, reports are made as to the conduct of the refreshment rooms.Some time ago a statement was made that there had been a diminution in gross profits. Action was taken, and certain controls were put into effect as the result of which the gross profits have again reached a satisfactory level. The phrasing of the passage in the Auditor-General##'##s Report referred to by the honorable senator is rather unfortunate, and because of that fact <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I have been in consultation on the matter. We have decided to make public a detailed statement at a very early date. It may be that we shall call together the Joint House Committee which is comprised of members of both chambers so that a full and complete statement can be made to the public. The comment in the Auditor-General##'##s Report gives rise to all kinds of infer- ences, and, of course, as in all matters appertaining to Parliament, some individuals are always prepared to put the most unfavorable interpretation on such remarks. I shall not discuss the matter further at this juncture, because it is one, not only for me but also for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Joint House Committee. How- ever, I assure honorable senators that the incident referred to is such as occurs in many business establishments, particularly when there is a diminution of profits. The fullest information will be given to the Senate, and when it is made available I do not think that the position will appear to be so bad as cer- tain people have inferred from the Auditor-General##'##s Report. </para>

If so will the Minister consider the early reduction of the coupon rating for essential garments such as overcoats, pyjamas and other ranges of men##'##s, women##'##s and children##'##s warm underwear so that wardrobes might be replenished during the present winter? Further, has the Minister seen the statement made in Melbourne that unless the coupon values for woollens were revised downwards during the next few months, nearly every manufacturer would have to close his premises because piles of made-up garments were unsold because of woollens having the same coupon rating as worsted goods? If so. would he take action along the lines suggested ? </para>

                                <para>- Recently, the coupon rating was reduced on knitting wools, and I understand that there has been a great demand for such wools as the result of that reduction. However, we are now confronted with a new problem. The supply of home knitting needles is now short, and arrangements will have to be made to import supplies from either the United States of America or the United Kingdom as early as possible. I shall consider the suggestion made by the honorable senator. </para>

                                <para>- I am not aware that special issues of beer and tobacco were refused in respect of the conferences mentioned by the honorable senator. Any application that is beyond the scope of the Liquor Control Order is referred to me, and ordinarily in respect of a conference I give the matter favorable consideration. I had no knowledge of the conference of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia held at Cairns, and no application was made to me with respect to that conference. Had such an application been made, I would have arranged for a special issue to those delegates as I did with respect to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions conference in Sydney. Such special issues are amply justified, because when from 300 to 400 delegates visit a city or town they have no avenues, as strangers, to obtain ordinary supplies of tobacco or a glass of ale, and if they did they would be drawing upon the ordinary supplies which should be reserved for the permanent residents. That was the reason for the action I took with respect to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions conference. Incidentally, I have been hotly criticized for that action, but I have no apology to make in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that 23 mines are not working on the northern coal-fields to-day. The stoppages have resulted because of the action of Judge Cantor in giving what may be regarded as an open verdict on a matter which has been in dispute for some weeks. Instead of giving a decision one way or the other he returned, in effect, an open decision. An agreement had been reached by the management of the Millfield Colliery and the officers concerned that the question of the re-employment of a. deputy should br left to a decision by Judge Cantor. Because the judge did not give a decision on the matter one way or the other the miners have refused to return to work. A conference of the parties has been arranged to take place, at 11 a.m. tomorrow, and I anticipate that if the dispute is not settled to-day it will bo settled as a result of that conference. </para>

                            <para>Due to the inevitable results of the war there is an acute shortage of telephone switching equipment, outdoor plant and telephone instruments, particularly in the metropolitan areas. Switchboards and many telephones have already been withdrawn from large hotels and other business establishments not directly associated with the national war effort. Without conducting a survey of the circumstances in each private home or business organization, which could not be undertaken with tie present depleted staff, it would not be practicable for the Postal Department to determine whether the telephone facilities already installed are in excess of reasonable requirements. Moreover, it is felt that the Post Office would not be justified in withdrawing facilities unless there were no other means available to meet vital national needs. </para>

                            <para>The majority of the outstanding applications for telephone facilities have been deferred because of the shortage of switching equipment in automatic telephone exchanges or the lack of accommodation in underground cables serving particular areas, and the withdrawal of extension telephones from hotels and private residences would not alleviate the position in this regard to any appreciable extent. Consistent with the obligation to give preference to the armed forces and essential organizations, the telephone materials becoming available are being used to the best possible advantage, and it is hoped that as a result of the cessation nf hostilities in Europe deliveries will be at an accelerated rate. </para>

The honorable senator is no doubt aware that a joint committee of senators and members of the House of Representatives was appointed by the Government to inquire into and report upon the general question of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act and the amendments, if any, which the committee recommended as desirable in the light of the conditions caused by the present war. In the report of that committee presented on the 28th January, 1943, the following paragraph appears: ##"##98. The Committee heard evidence on many matters by representatives of the Federal bodies of returned soldiers##'## organizations. The representatives expressed their approval of the Act as a satisfactory instrument for the conveyance of the wishes of Parliament, and were satisfied that it was being administered sympathetically. They were definitely opposed to any change in the present form of Administration, i.e., by a Commission. The Committee concurs in the views expressed by the representatives.##"## As is only to be expected, complaints are received from time to time, mainly arising from disappointed appellants, but, as honorable senators know, adequate machinery exists for handling such cases, and independent appeal tribunals, consisting of returned soldiers of both wars, including nominees of returned soldier organizations, are operating throughout the Commonwealth both in respect of entitlement and assessment appeals. </para>

                    <para>. - Despite the rather over-enthusiastic speech of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> last night, the Opposition is entirely in earnest in seeking to improve this bill. It is our desire that its provisions shall be defined clearly so that there will not he any loopholes. We are not interested in what the Government has in mind in drafting this measure; we are concerned only with what is provided in the bill, and how it will be interpreted. In this clause, various terms used in the bill are defined, but there is one flagrant omission, namely, a definition of the words ##"## cessation of hostilities##"##. This is an important matter, because the seven-year period of preference provided for later in the bill will start from the ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"##. Unless the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> is prepared to insert in this clause a definition of these words, I propose to move - </para>

                    <para>That, after the definition of ##"## Australia ##"##. the following definition be inserted : - ##"## ##'## Cessation of hostilities ##'## means the signing of Peace Treaties with both Germany and Japan or two years after the order to cease fire in the Japanese war, whichever is the earlier ##"##. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I am not wedded to the exact wording of that amendment, but the bill should contain some definition of those words. It has been suggested that ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"## may mean, the signing of the peace treaties with Germany and Japan, and that that might not take place until four years, five years, or six years- hence. After the last war, the peace treaty was not signed until four years after the cessation of hostilities, and on this occasion we have two wars to consider. Another suggestion is that the Government may determine the cessation of hostilities by proclamation, but that will not be satisfactory from the point of view of this measure. The Government ought to be more definite. As there is no satisfactory definition, it should accept my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>.- The date of commencement of this bill will be a matter for the Government to decide. The meaning of the term ##"## cessation of hostilities##"## is a contentious matter, and legal luminaries would probably express many different views on the point. Parliament should decide when the bill will commence to operate in the light of future events. If the Government should not give effect to the legislation in the way desired by the Parliament, the Parliament, would have the remedy in its own hands. </para>

                    <para>. - I oppose the amendment. It appears to be designed with a view to extending the period of preference from seven years to nine years. The meaning of the words ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"## plainly depends on a question of fact. If there should be any difficulty in defining the term on facts as they appear, one application to the court would clarify the position. The meaning of the term is clear. When hostilities ended in Europe, the Allies agreed that a public announcement should be made, at a particular minute on a particular day. That was the time of the cessation of hostilities. The fact that isolated parties might have continued to engage in hostilities without the sanction of their governments would not prevent anybody, whether a legal or judicial authority or a layman, from understanding that hostilities had ceased when the announcement wa3 made. Frankly, I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is really concerned with extending the period of preference beyond the proposed limit of seven years. </para>

Anybody with a clear mind should realize that a definition of the term ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"## is absolutely necessary. It seems that the Government in this chamber has adopted the attitude taken  by  the Government in the House of Representatives, namely, that it will not permit any alteration of the bill. L have no desire to extend the period of preference from seven years to nine years. The amendment would nothave that effect, in any case. I want to have a clear definition of the phrase under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna##'##s</inline> idea that somebody might apply to the High Court for a definition surprises me. Who will make the application? </para>

The only people likely to apply for a ruling are returned soldiers, and an application would be an expensive and troublesome business. Why should they be put to such expense and delay? If the Government considers that the period of two years after the order to cease fire in the Japanese war, as mentioned in the amendment, is too long, I would be agreeable to a period of one year. Surely, the Government must have in mind some meaning of the term. If not,  it  has nothing in its mind at all, and that  is  what I suspect. I  am  astounded that  it  should refuse  my  amendment merely because  it did  not think  of  inserting a definition  on  its own account. </para>

There is no reason to believe that the war against Japan will be ended in a different way. from the war against Germany. . A few guerrilla forces may continue hostilities, but that will not affect the issue. In every war in history, hostilities have ceased officially at a specified time. I see no point in the amendment. If the honorable senator could show that there was a possibility of hostilities continuing after the official declaration, I could understand it. However, the amendment is as plain as the trunk of an elephant that ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"## means the signing of peace treaties with both Germany and Japan or two years after the order to cease fire in the Japanese war, whichever is the earlier. The honorable senator completely misrepresented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> who said that the meaning of the term was so plain that any man, whether legally trained or not, could understand it. </para>

On the 28th October, 1919, Act No. 26 of that year was assented to. In that measure provision was made for determining the date of the termination of the last war. Section 2 of the act reads -  (1.) The Governor-General may, by proclamation, declare what date shall be deemed to be the date of the termination of the present war. (2.) The date declared by the Governor-General in pursuance of this section shall be as nearly as may be the date of the exchange * or deposit of ratifications of the treaty or treaties of peace. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has merely accentuated my opinion that the amendment should be accepted. He has told us that an act of Parliament was required in 1919 in order to lay down clearly when the last war ended, and that measure provided that it ended at the signing of the Peace Treaty. Everybody knows that, although the war was over in 1918, the Peace Treaty was not signed until 1923 or 1924. In view of all the trouble in Europe, a long time will probably be ##'##taken in. arriving at a settlement. I deliberately included in my amendment a reference to the war with Japan, so that when the ##"## cease fire##"## is sounded, a couple of years will be allowed in which to sign the peace treaties. If the treaties were not signed within that period - and it is likely that they will not be - the amendment would enable the date of the cessation of hostilities to be fixed earlier than the date of the peace treaties. Therefore, instead of trying to extend the period before the declared date of the cessation of hostilities, my amendment would restrict the period and make that date as early as possible. In the circumstances the objection of the Government to define what the words mean passes my understanding. The view of the average layman is similar to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who believes that when the shooting stops hostilities will have ceased, but according to the legal interpretation that is not so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> believes that hostilities cease when the shooting stops, let him move in that direction. </para>

                    <para>. - There are two points which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has not made clear. No peace treaty may ever be signed with either Japan or Germany, in which case there would never be a declaration in accordance with the terms of the amendment. The other point which is not clear is, ##"## Who is to give the cease-fire order?##"##. Will it be General MacArthur, the Commander of the Japanese Forces or the Commander-in-Chief of  the Allied Armies? We cannot tell from the amendment when the order to ##"## cease fire ##"## will be given or who will give it. The amendment is a mere trick to make the people believe that the provision is definite, whereas it will he indefinite for a time. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> cannot have considered my amendment. He has some extraordinary idea that it provides that the cessation of hostilities shall not .be announced until the Japanese have declared ##"##cease fire##"##. But the commander who gives that order will be found in the victorious army, If the honorable senator thinks that the Japanese will be victorious that is not my opinion. That is not the opinion of the people of Australia. If that is likely to happen the Government has grossly deceived the Parliament and the country, because we believe that we are beating the Japanese in this war. The order to cease fire will be given by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies. I have moved my amendment in order to clarify the position, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> would make confusion worse confounded. I shall press my amendment to a division. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> wishes to insert a simple definition of ##"## the cessation of hostilities##"##. In the last war, the cease fire was sounded on the 11th November, 1918, but it was only an armistice, as the Allied Armies were ready to continue the fight at a moment##'##s notice. Terms of surrender were offered to the Germans, which, if accepted by them, would result in the ##"##cease fire##"## order being observed. In the operations against the Turks the ##"##cease fire##"## was sounded in October, 1918. The peace treaties were of different kinds. That signed with Germany was the Treaty of Versailles. There was a separate treaty with Turkey and another with Austria. The terms of the amendment are simple. It sets out what ##"## the cessation of hostilities ##"## means. If there is delay in the signing of the peace treaty in Europe, the date of the cessation of hostilities will ,be when the ##"## cease fire ##"## is sounded in the war against Japan. That announcement will come from the general officer commanding the whole of the Allied Forces, most probably General MacArthur, who will order a ##"##cease fire ##"## when the Japanese have absolutely submitted to the inevitable. When that will happen nobody can tell. </para>

That was clone to enable both sides to bury their dead. What I have in mind is an order from the commander of the victorious forces when the enemy has submitted to the will of the victors. It will be a pity if the Government refuses to accept this definition. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Sampson</inline> has made the position more confused. He has told us that the order ##"## cease fire ##"## is sometimes given when a temporary armistice has been arranged, but he also said that he had in mind an order to ##"## cease fire ##"##, given by the commander of the victorious forces when the enemy had submitted to the will of the victors. I do not think that any Commander-in-Chief would give that order without first consulting the governments of the United Nations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> wants us to put in the bill something which cannot be determined beforehand, and to give to it a definite meaning. Hostilities will cease when, after consultation with the governments of the United Nations, the Commander-in-Chief gives the order to ##"## cease fire ##"##. But it is impossible to determine beforehand when that time will come. The inclusion of ##"## cease fire ##"## in place of ##"## cessation of hostilities ##"## would, in my opinion, make the position more ambiguous. The time will come when, acting on advice given to them by the Commander-in-Chief, the governments of the United Nations will determine that a certain situation exists, as was the case in Europe, when General Eisenhower, after consultation with the governments concerned, determined that the time had arrived to declare that hostilities against Germany had ceased. The Minister would be wise not to accept the amendment. </para>

They (the Opposition) know perfectly well that the debate does not hinge on the question as to whether ex-servicemen should be given preference in employment or not. The real questions are, what preference, how much preference, and how can such preference be administered effectively in the interests of the men and women who have fought in this war  . . If they want to make a catalogue of the fighting men and women of this war they will have to include . . . every man and woman in the community. </para>

                <para>The Minister for the Interior said, first, that the Government believes in preference to fighting men; and, then he said that the term ##"##fighting men##"## includes every man and woman in Australia. In that case, where does preference to the fighting man come in? If everybody is to be given preference, no one will receive preference. This measure, therefore, is a waste of paper. </para>

                        <para>- Because I am trying to improve it; and because we wish to let the people know the real meaning of the measure. If the Government intends that every person shall come within the bill, where is the preference to returned soldiers? The people believe that this bill is intended to provide preference to the ex-service personnel; but it does not. And the Minister for the Interior made that admission last night, although I do not believe that he intended to do so. If this definition means anything at all it moans that the Government can extend the benefits of the measure to any person. If the Government, desires to include the Salvation Army, and other kindred bodies which have been doing splendid work at the front helping the fighting forces - and we agree that they should be embraced in the measure - why does not the Government specifically define such bodies instead of making the measure a ##"## free-for-all ##"## affair, embracing every one and any one, with the result that no one will receive any real benefit under it? What is##'## the objection of the Government to naming these organizations in the measure? Why does it refuse to set out its objectives in plain English? I am at a loss <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> understand the Government##'##s attitude in this respect. The Minister does not for one moment say that the definition does not mean what I say itmeans. He simply says, ##"##I cannot accept the amendment ##"##. That is the be-all and end-all of it so far as the Government is concerned. No logical argument will change the measure. The Government, having taken the advice of its pet advisers, has finally made up its mind on the matter. The Germans who blew down the dykes in Holland did not have to make a very big hole in order to flood the country. We are now pointing out a hole in the measure, and ask the Government to stop that hole; because if it does not do so our ex-service personnel, who have saved Australia, will be left begging for any benefits which the bill is supposed to provide. But the attitude of the Government is, ##"##The bill! The bill! And no alteration of the bill. You can talk as long as you like ##"##. I do not care whether the Government adopts that attitude or not. It is responsible for the bill; .but I want the people to know that we see the weaknesses and sophistries of the measure, and that under the guise of preference to fighting men of this war, the Government is offering something to them that is absolutely worthless, because it is giving preference on the basis of some silly idea that everybody is going to be equal and get a job. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has stated that those words are relevant only to two heads of the bill, namely, the reinstatement provisions and the apprenticeship provisions. I support him in that respect. Altogether, there are sixteen different aspects of rehabilitation  set out in the measure. Reinstatement and apprenticeship are only two, and they are dependent upon ##"##war service##"##. There are ten other provisions, the benefits of which are available solely to discharged members of the forces; and ##"## member of the Forces ##"## is denned separately. The remaining four provisions are available equally to discharged servicemen and to all other personnel. If there is any doubt about ##"##war service ##"## in relation to the reinstatement privileges and apprenticeship privileges, I refer honorable senators to sub-clause 1, clause 12, which reads - </para>

                <para>They are the only two benefits which, under this measure, depend; for their incidence upon war service. Without exactly qualifying that statement, I should also observe that clause 32, which deals with preference, speaks of service ##"## in relation to the war ##"##. That is quite a different matter##'## from the ##"## war service ##"## specifically defined here; and when we come to clause 32 that  difference  can be clearly  explained.  Paragraph / of the definition of ##"##war service ##"##, the definition with which we are now dealing, has no application whatever to preference. Persons who may have rendered service in relation to the war are dealt with in an entirely different category. Paragraph / applies to members of the organizations whose names have been set out in the amendment, and who have .been accredited to, and accepted by, the defence forces. As a matter  of  fact a National Security Regulation already makes that very provision. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> in pointing out the desirability of giving the right of reinstatement to those women who have sacrificed their careers to do a very excellent job in the Australian Women##'##s Land Army. Quite a long while ago, I made representations to the Minister on that subject, and his reply was that he would give consideration to the matter. I believe that there is not anybody in this chamber who would seek to deny those women, and members of other worthy organizations, the right to reinstatement in the positions which they held before they took up work ##"## in relation to the war ##"##. It has been stated that the words ##"## in relation to any of the provisions of this Act##"## extend the scope of the definition to all kinds of matters apart from the two I have mentioned. I do not share that view. The clause states -  ##"## war service ##"## means - in relation to any of the provisions of this Act . . . </para>
                <para class="block">That means exactly what it says - that wherever the term ##"## war service ##"## appears in this legislation, it shall include ##"## the continuous full-time service of any persons as a member of an organization or part thereof which is declared by proclamation to be an organization in relation to which those provisions apply##"##. The main purpose of my comment on this amendment is to make quite clear the fact that the term ##"## war service ##"## does not play anything like a major part in indicating what persons shall be entitled to the benefits of this legislation. If honorable senators bear that fact clearly in mind, a great deal of discussion, and perhaps later confusion, may be avoided.- </para>

                    <para>. - Acceptance of the amendment would prevent the Government from providing for the reinstatement of many men and women who have rendered good service in this war, and who are eligible to benefit under this measure as at present drafted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> seeks to eliminate the vital words ##"## an organization or part thereof ##"##. That would mean for instance that members of the Merchant Navy who have played a very important part in the war would not be eligible for these benefits. The same thing would apply to civil airline pilots who have flown unarmed and unprotected aircraft into operational areas, sharing the risks of Air Force pilots. Also provision could not be made for members of the Civil Constructional Corps who have been working in the islands to the north of this country, possibly under fire. Surely, honorable senators opposite will not argue that all members of the Young Women##'##s Christian Association should be included in this measure in preference to Merchant Navy seamen, or civil airline pilots or members of the Civil Constructional Corps. If this amendment is carried it will deprive the Government of the right to declare by proclamation any member of these organizations to be eligible for the benfits of this measure. </para>

It affects the setting up of preference boards, and committees of all kinds, on which one member has had war service. All that the Government has to do if it wishes to appoint a particular person to a board or committee is to declare an organization to be an organizazaztion ##"## in relation to which those provisions apply##"##. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has endeavoured to pursuade the committee that the definition of ##"## war service ##"## concerns only clauses 12 and 27. If he examines the bill more closely, he will realize that he is wrong. If there are other organizations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> wishes to include in the definition, let him name them. If he can advance a legitimate case in support of their inclusion, we shall not have any abjection to embodying them in the clause. This is a legislature; we are supposed to pass legislation which is intelligible to the community.. To provide that the Government shall have power to declare any person eligible for the benefits of this measure destroys the basic principle of the bill. </para>

I agree with the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia, the Legion of Ex-Servicemen of Australia, and the Fathers##'## Association, that, if the committees had a majority of ex-servicemen in their membership they would give, satisfaction and engender confidence. </para>

The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> who will administer the provisions of this clause, has given an assurance that, where practicable, ex-servicemen will be appointed to these committees, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

The amendment should be made; there is no reason why it should not be acceptable to the Government. There is a great deal of lip-service to ex-servicemen, but, when it comes to giving them preference, there is generally a lot of quibbling. The title of this bill ought to be the ##"## Abolition of Preference Bill  1945##"##.  I support the amendment. </para>

I seek to extend the period of one month stipulated in the clause to three months. After serving for four or five years in the armed forces, a man may not wish to return to an indoor job immediately, and he may seek some other form of employment before communicating with his prewar employer. If the amendment be agreed to, a man in such circumstances will have a fair chance to decide whether he prefers a new job to his pre-war job.As the clause stands, if he extends the period of one month by even a day. and then decides that he wants to return to his old job, he will not be able to do so. A period of three months would give him a fair chance to make up his mind. </para>

The Government would be wise to insert the word ##"##honorable##"## before the word ##"## termination ##"##. Many members of the forces have been guilty of conduct which disentitles them to the benefits of the bill. The records of discharged servicemen are not available to em ployers, and the Government should not foist upon them discharged members of the forces who; because of their records, may be unsuitable for employment.I understand that if a serviceman had been absent without leave for six months, that fact would not be shown on his discharge card. It is well known to everybody that some members of the forces have been guilty of unworthy conduct, and I fail to see why they should be placed on the same footing as men who have received an honorable discharge. </para>

Any honorable senator could express bright ideas about the phraseology of various clauses. The term ##"## honorable discharge ##"## is not relevant to reinstatement, as sometimes an honorable discharge is withheld for reasons that should not preclude reinstatement.

                    <para>. -  The Minister is very abrupt in his treatment of honorable senators. If he considers that the period mentioned in the clause will be extended by a reinstatement committee, that is a strong reason why an amendment on the lines suggested  should be accepted. If the Minister believes that three months will be allowed to enable the soldier to readjust himself to civil life I see no reason why provision to that effect should not be made in the bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but it would be unreasonable to expect an ex-serviceman to be worrying about a job within a week or two of his discharge. The ordinary industrialist Ls granted, a fortnight##'##s annual leave, and surely a man who has been in the fighting services for five or six years, and has probably had no leave at all in his home town, is entitled to three months to enable him to make up his mind as to what be intends to do.. That period would enable him to readjust himself to civil life, but we should be imposing a hardship upon him to require him to determine his course of action within a month. He will have to apply to some tribunal, but he may know nothing about such bodies. If he is not acquainted with legal procedure, he may require someone to represent him before the tribunal, and tell him about the various forms which he will have to fill in, and so on. These things will take time. A man who has been in the forces for five or six years will want more than a month to cast off the effects of devastating warfare. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not so much concerned about an extension of time being granted to  a  returned serviceman as to the period in which, ho must have his name registered and recorded with the employer. After his return from war service a man may visit relatives in a. distant State, and while away from home he may easily overlook the necessity to register for employment within a given period. If given a period of three months he would have a chance to attend to his registration and then if ho so desired he could apply for an extension under clauses 13 and 21. When this legislation has been placed on the statute-book, I hope that the Government will prepare a booklet for the guidance of men on their return from war service, so that they may know what they will have to do to comply with its provisions. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause as it stands is satisfactory. We must remember that a considerable period may elapse after the cessation of hostilities before a man will be discharged. He will have to be brought back from an operational area to his own State and that will take considerable lime. During that period he can make up his mind as to what he will do after discharge, and then he will have another month in which to make  lu3  application. Should he not desire to return to his former employment, he could withdraw his application subsequently. The various arms of the services have their official journals, and between the time that the ##"##Cease fire##"## is sounded and a man##'##s discharge, these journals could publish information for his guidance. The booklet issued by the Repatriation Department has proved valuable, and I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand##'##s</inline> suggestion that advice to servicemen should be made available in booklet form. Should a man want to have a holiday after his##"## discharge, he could appear before a tribunal and apply for an extension of time. That should not cause any difficulty. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that that is putting preference the wrong way round. In this case, preference is being given entirely to the man who has the longer service with the employer. Let us suppose that immediately upon the outbreak of war ##"## A ##"## joins up with the Australian Imperial Force in 1939 and serves right through the war, and then applies for his old job; whilst ##"##B##"##, who was not so patriotically minded, or for other reasons, stayed in the service of the same employer until such time as he was called up for service in the Militia. Although ##"##A##"## may have had three or four years##'## more service in the forces than ##"## B ##"##, who remained in his employment until he was pulled out by the man-power authorities, ##"## B ##"## is given preference because he joined the firm, say, three months before ##"## A ##"##. The principle of preference should be applied in this clause as it is applied in respect of other provisions, that is, the employer should be entitled to take into consideration length of military service and the theatres of war in which applicants have served. I ask that the clause be amended to provide that a man with the longer military service and service overseas should be given preference over the man who is now to be given preference merely because he has been longer in the employ of a particular employer. </para>

                    <para>.- The first point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> relates to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which deals with annual leave for recreation. This point was also raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan in his second-reading speech. The object of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is to preserve the right of an employee to any portion of annual leave which may have been due to him prior to enlistment but which could not be taken by him before he commenced##'## his war service. The explanation of the clause generally is that it preserves the rights of persons on war service to annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and superannuation or pension which might otherwise be lost through a break in the continuity of employment.For example, where an employee who is entitled to annual leave at the end of twelve months##'## service with an employer, commences his war service after nine months##'## employment, he will become eligible for annual leave upon completing three months##'## service with the employer after his reinstatement. However, the period of war service is not reckoned as part of the period of employment; if it were, the employer would have to pay the member while he was on war service. </para>

It seems to me that six months is too short a term in which to enable men who have been reinstated to settle down properly in their employment. If a man has been away on active service for three, four or five years, he may not be able to regain his former skill in six months. I understand that the Government##'##s objective is to abolish an employer##'##s right to ##"## hire and fire ##"## ; but under this clause it gives the right to the employer to dismiss an employee. Certainly, the ex-serviceman has the opportunity to obtain redress by appealing to a tribunal, but he must pay the cost of that appeal. It would be far better to provide a period of twelve months in order to give the ex-serviceman a fair chance to reestablish himself. The purpose of the bill is to rehabilitate ex-servicemen in permanent employment. That being so, the Minister should agree to this amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister has not given any reason for refusing to accept the amendment. He simply said that the provision had been considered. He did not say why the Government decided upon the period of :1X months. The criticism by honorable senators opposite of the repatriation legislation passed after the war of  1914-18,  was that it did not give ex-servicemen fair preference, that they were dismissed on the flimsiest pretexts, or were not given a job because of the loophole provided by the condition ##"## other things being equal ##"##. Now, when the Government which they support has the opportunity to rectify those conditions under this measure, they support a clause by which they invite the employer to sack  a  man who is not  100  per cent, efficient. That is the effect of the clause. If, at the end of a period of six months, an employer knows that a more suitable man is available, he may dismiss the ex-serviceman. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot understand why honorable senators opposite should oppose this amendment. As the clause stands, a returned soldier who resumes his former employment after a period of service overseas, will have only six months in which to measure up to the requirements of his job. If he fails  to  do so within that time, he may be dismissed. That is not giving a returned soldier a reasonable opportunity to reestablish himself. I am sure that honorable senators opposite could reasonably support this amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- In the opinion of the Government, six months is a reasonable period for this purpose. This clause is designed to prevent employers defeating the object of the regulations, and is necessary to provide against a very obvious means of evasion, that is to say, a technical reinstatement followed by a subsequent dismissal. In effect, the provision means that an employer cannot dismiss a reinstated person or vary his employment to the employee##'##s detriment, unless he has reasonable cause for so doing. Should an employer dismiss a reinstated employee or vary the conditions of his employment contrary to this measure within six months after reinstatement the onus of proof in any action will rest upon the employer to show that he had just cause for the dismissal of an employee or a variation of the conditions of his employment. I consider that six months is a reasonable period. </para>

                <para>The object of this amendment is to ensure that at least the  chairman  of the Reinstatement Committee and the direct representative of ex-servicemen shall be men who have had war service.

One hopes of course that the representatives of the employers  also will be men who have had war service, but in my opinion it is imperative that the  chairman  and the direct representative of the ex-servicemen should both be men who understand the needs of the returned soldiers.

Does it mean that the returned soldiers will have the right to nominate their representative, or does it mean that the Government will be at liberty to select whoever it wishes - and not necessarily a returned man - to represent ex-servicemen? As the clause is drafted, not one member of a Reinstatement Committee need be a returned soldier. I am sure that the Government does not intend that that should be the case, and I suggest to the Minister that the matter be re-examined. If the Government has in mind that the representative of the ex-servicemen should be nominated by it, that should be specifically stated in the clause. I point out that the clause will have to be interpreted, not only by this Administration, but also by succeeding governments. </para>

I remember that when this subject was before the Senate some years ago, and the Labour party was in opposition, I asked the then Government would action be taken to appoint a Reinstatement Committee and a preference board. I pointed out that preference was not worth anything unless it was backed by some tribunal with power, to ensure that, it was enforced. This measure provides for the appointment of these bodies. Do not honorable senators opposite believe that persons who have rendered war service will select a returned soldier as their representative on the Reinstatement Committee? </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing in the bill to prevent them. Exservicemen will need only to exercise a little common sense. The clause provides that one member of the committee shall be the representative of persons who have rendered war service, one member shall represent the employers, and one shall represent the employees. That means##'## that virtually there will be two representatives of the employees and one of the employers. What more do honorable senators opposite want? If ex-servicemen do their job properly, there will be at least one returned soldier on the committee representing the employees. </para>

                    <para>.- Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> has not read the clause thoroughly. There is no provision in it for the appointment by ex-servicemen of their representative on the Reinstatement Committee. If the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> is prepared to say now that the representative on that committee of persons who have rendered war service will be selected by the returned soldiers themselves, the approach of the Opposition to the clause will be different. As drafted, the clause is completely at variance with the practice adopted under our repatriation legislation which permits ex-servicemen to select one commissioner for repatriation, and to select their own nominees for the various tribunals constituted under that legislation. In this measure all appointments are left in the hands of the Minister. ##"##When an amendment was moved in the House of Representatives by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> in an endeavour to ensure to organized returned soldiers an opportunity to select their representative on the Reinstatement Committee, it was rejected. Why should the principle of this legislation be different from that of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act? Throughout this measure appointments to committees, boards, ##&amp;##c, are left in the hands of the Minister, and no opportunity is given to the ##"## Diggers ##"## themselves to appoint their representatives. </para>

                    <para>. -  Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner##'##s</inline> contention be correct, there is nothing wrong with the sub-clause. It is conceivable that a man, who for some reason has been unable to render war service, may be a brilliant representative of the interests of ex-servicemen. For instance, he may have been prevented from serving by disease, or the loss of a limb, but such a disability would not prevent him from being a capable advocate of the rights of ex-servicemen. Alderman Marks, of Sydney, for example, has done more for the Australian Red Cross Society, probably than ony other two or three men, as anybody who knows anything about that organization will agree. It would be in the interests of ex-servicemen to have the right to select an able, man from outside their ranks to act as their representative. Naturally, they will want to nominate a worthy champion of their cause, whether he be an ex-serviceman or not. If the Opposition##'##s proposals were agreed to, such men would be excluded from the right to act on behalf of ex-servicemen. From time to time, the Labour movement has had in its ranks great champions who have never done manual labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Windeyer, K.O., is a very capable man who has never seen war service, but his sons have been decorated for gallantry in action. He would be a worthy representative of ex-servicemen, and his ability would be of great assistance in determining legal problems that must inevitably arise. The Opposition seeks to preclude </para>

                        <para>- No. We wish ex-servicemen to be represented by men who have actually seen combat service. The term ##"## war service ##"## has many interpretations. The Government may make it applicable to almost anybody. For instance, employees of the Allied Works Council could be said to have had war service. The Government can easily prove its sincerity by amending the clause to ensure that ex-servicemen shall be represented on the committee* by men who have had combat service. As the clause stands, the panels can be selected by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is terribly confused. He is so confused that he almost confuses me. Evidently, he has not studied the bill. Of course, it was not necessary for him to do so, because he knew that the Leader of the Senate would be in charge of the bill and would only have to say, ##"##I will nol accept the amendment ##"## in order to receive the support of his cohorts. All I want to ensure is that ex-servicemen are appointed to the committees. As the clause stands, these reinstatement committees need not have a single ex-serviceman amongst their members. If that happened-, there would be an outcry from ex-servicemen and the people generally. This provision is in line with the rest of the bill, which extends its benefits to almost every section of the community. The Government is disregarding the interests of the men who deserve the greatest rewards. What is the  mattei  with the Leader of the Senate? This is not the time to say, ##"##We must pas? the bill as it stands; there must be no amendments ##"##. His supporters are putting him m an invidious position. If  he would be reasonable and1 agree to the Opposition##'##s proposals, honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber would not be able to ##"## cruel his pit-cn as they are doing. </para>

                    <para>. - Another matter obtrudes in the consideration of sub-clause 10, which provides that the members of Reinstatement Committees shall be paid remuneration and allowances at such rates, if any, as the Minister determines. I am prepared to concede that the words ##"## if any ##"## imply that there may be no payment, hut I gather that the Reinstatement Committees will have strenuous duties to perform and it is certain, I should say, that remuneration will be provided. Under the preference provisions of the bill, the Commonwealth and all of its instrumentalities are bound to give preference in remunerative employment. If the Reinstatement Committees are to be paid for  their  services, the Commonwealth is bound under the preference provisions to  give preference to ex-servicemen, and the net result will be that all of the members of the committees will in fact be ex-members of the forces. That makes clear the policy of the Government in relation to preference. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that, if the amendment were accepted, it would negative the right of returned soldiers to nominate anybody who is not an ex-serviceman. I also agree with the technical submission of members of the Opposition, who say that there is not an explicit right to nominate ex-servicemen. Following what the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">((Senator Fraser)</inline> has said, there should be some order in determining how the representative of ex-servicemen is to be selected. Only a responsible Minister can lay down the rules of procedure that will be necessary to ensure that representatives are properly chosen in accordance with democratic principles. So the bill provides in sub-clause 7 that panels of persons shall be selected, not by the Minister, but in such manner as the Minister determines. Obviously, when the Minister is to select an ex-serviceman, an employer and an employee, he will go to the organisations which represent the three separate classes. The procedure which be will establish will enable each of those three classes to elect its representative, whether he be an ex-serviceman or not. For the reasons I have given we are wasting time if these men are to be- paid. If the Minister would say something on that point, we should know that the Government is bound to give preference to ex-servicemen, and that the committees will be wholly composed of ex-servicemen. </para>

                        <para>- I give an assurance that the panels will be advertised for, and applications will be invited from, the organizations of ex-servicemen.. Sub-clause 2 provides that each reinstatement committee shall consist of a chairman, one member to represent personswho have rendered war service, and one##'## member to represent employers. What does that provision mean unless it signifies that the practice now in operation, will be followed? No government would be stupid enough to select men without war service to arbitrate on matters concerning ex-servicemen. The practice which has been observed in respect of representation since the last war will befollowed by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -  Thisclause takes away from ex-servicemen something which they have enjoyed iu. the past, because war service means something different under this bill from what it has meant previously. Under the bill, any organization may be declared a warservice organization by the GovernmentIt could declare anybody to have performed war service, although he may have done no fighting at all. Why not amend the bill to ensure that he will be* a representative of active servicemen? The sailors, soldiers, and airmen might be out-voted by munitions workers andi others who will be brought under thislegislation. That power is given in paragraph / of the definition of ##"##war service ##"## in clause 4. It would be simple toput into this clause a provision which, would ensure that one of these representatives shall be a man who has rendered active war service. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKennais</inline> right, as I believe he is, and if members of the reinstatement committee are to be paid, it would appear that all the members of the committees must have had war service of some kind. That would mean that the four of them, including the  chairman,  would come under the provisions of this legislation in regard to war service. The clause is not in accordance with the usual practice- in regard to legislation. </para>

                    <para>.- I believe that the present position has  been caused by the disunity among returned servicemen. The position is as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> Roosevelt laid down years ago, when he was asked if he believed in trade unionism. He said ##"## Yes, because if the officials are dishonest, I can help to clear them out; and if the policy of the organization is not correct, I can help to make it correct##"##. By forming different organizations throughout the country, returned servicemen are doing themselves a disservice. If they would band together in one solid organization, and say to the Government that they are united and want this or that done, their representations would be given more consideration. So long as they remain disunited, I cannot see any way out. The Minister has explained that the only way is to leave it open to make the best possible selection from the returned soldiers##'## organizations. If the returned servicemen would stick to one organization and make it a worthwhile body, this clause would not be necessary. </para>

                <para class="block">My remarks in relation to this clause apply also to clause 23, which proposes to repeal certain sections of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. I am opposed to the repeal of section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, and sections 83 and 104 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, because in those provisions the preference to servicemen is complete and absolute, and is not subject to qualifications or limitations. In the existing legislation, ex-servicemen have something of value. Under the preference provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, about 21,000 ex-servicemen have been rehabilitated over a period of 25 years. Of that number 9,256 have applied themselves assiduously to study and have gained promotion and permanent status. Many of them now occupy important positions. Section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act extends the scope of preference beyond the Commonwealth Public Service, although it is still confined to positions within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government. If those sections be repealed, we shall have only a worthless preference which is subject to a time limit. That means that the fighting serviceman will have to scramble for a job in competition with home-front workers. In the definition of ##"##employer##"##, the Crown is an employer equally with civil employers. Should the constitutionality of clause 24 be challenged in the High Court, and judgment be given in favour of a State or States which may appeal against the repeal of their legislation providing for preference, the Commonwealth will have no legislation to give any form of preference inCommonwealth employment. The wisest course is to retain the sections which this clause proposes to repeal. It has been argued that there cannot be two preference laws operating at the same time, but why should that not be so? Should the bill now before us become law, it will supersede those sections, in the event of any. conflict between them. The Minister has said that the bill is bound up with the Government##'##s policy of full employment and that the interests of the ex-serviceman are interlocked with those of the civilian. In other words, both the soldier and the civilian are to sink or swim with the Government##'##s full employment policy. Instead of the real substance which these sections provide, the serviceman is. now offered the shadow of an economic paradise which has not yet gone beyond the blue-print stage.. I urge honorable senators opposite to vote according to their conscience and if they do these sections of the existing legislation which grant a measure of preference to servicemen will remain on the statute-book. </para>

                    would be a great pity if that provision were repealed. Honorable senators will recall that, recently, ex-Senator Digger Dunn, who graced this chamber for some years, contested, an appointment to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and relied on section 117 of the Australian ##'##Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act. It is true that he did not win his case, because of a technicality, but, I suggest, that if .the section referred to be repealed, servicemen, generally, will lose something which has been of great value to them..

                    <para>, - The amendment cannot be accepted, because it is essential that only one law shall operate to provide preference. The law on this subject must be clear and definite, and so the preference provisions of other acts must be repealed. Otherwise servicemen will be confused. Since provisions governing preference should be clear and beyond dispute, and, as it is obviously desirable that preference should be uniform throughout Australia and contained in one act, the Commonwealth intends that there shall be one law only in operation throughout Australia providing for preference in the employment of members of the forces and persons who have rendered service in relation to the war which may entitle them to preference. The main case for Commonwealth legislation on preference is to assure uniformity in preference for those serving Australia. Consequently, the division, apart from making express provision for preference, also repeals previous Commonwealth legislation relating to preference, and provides that State and Commonwealth laws providing for preference in employment will be inoperative while The division is in force. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has not explained that this clause seeks to take away something from servicemen that they already have; it does not propose to give something to them. Moreover, what it will take from them will be taken indefinitely. Reference to clause 33 shows that sections 24 to 32 inclusive of this act . shall cease to operate seven years after the cessation of hostilities. But the repeal of the existing legislation for which clause 22 provides will be for all time, so that any benefit that the serviceraa.iL is now entitled to under those provisions will be lost. In other words, a privilege that servicemen have enjoyed for 25 years, and which has been of great value to then  i,  is to be wiped out. It would be satisfactory if the Minister would say that after seven years, clause 22 would cease to operate. It is significant that clause 33 does not refer to clauses 22 and 23. If section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act and sections 11 and 83 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act be repealed, they will cease to operate until re-enacted, because clauses 22 and 23 will not be repealed at the end. of the period of seven years. Thus we shall take away indefinitely the rights and privileges which have been enjoyed by ex-servicemen for the last 25 years. The Government says that it is substituting something for those rights, but, at best, it is only substituting an alleged preference for seven years. I ask the Government to provide for the repeal of clauses 22 and 23 at the end of that period. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, the honorable senator is counting on all of them being dead. It is in a provision of this kind that the Government really shows its hand. It is holding up to the returned man a mere shadow, whilst, at the same time, depriving him of the substance of the existing legislation. This measure will also supersede all State laws with respect to the rehabilitation of ex-service personnel. On the plea that it is essential to have only one measure  dealing with this subject in operation, the Government calmly deprives ex-service personnel of the valuable privileges they have enjoyed for so many years. Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act ex-servicemen have been given preference of employment in good positions in the Commonwealth Public Service, and many of those men have risen to the top of the Public Service ladder. I know that some honorable senators opposite agree with the view I am putting; but I also know that they will not say so. </para>

I draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> to the fact that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> who was in charge of the measure in the House of Representatives omitted to point out that opinion differs among constitutional lawyers as to whether the Commonwealth has power to give general preference. T also recall that supporters of the Government##'##s proposals at the recent referendum gave that as one of the reasons for the referendum. They said that grave doubt existed among constitutional lawyers as to whether the Commonwealth Government had power to give general preference to ex-service personnel. Until that doubt is resolved clearly in favour of the Commonwealth, it will be most unwise to repeal the existing legislation under which preference is given to ex-service personnel in the Commonwealth Public Service, because the repeal of section 83 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act means that those who have enjoyed the privileges of that act since 1922 will he without preference should Commonwealth legislation providing for preference prove to be unconstitutional. </para>

                        <para>- I urge the Government to realize the seriousness of this provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> when moving his amendment, did so in a reasonable manner. He was not aggressive in any way; and I have already shown that under this clause the privileges which ex-servicemen have enjoyed for the last 25 years will be repealed permanently upon the expiration of the  seven-year period. The Government seek.##'## to take away  those  privileges under the guise of giving to the ex-serviceman  what  one might describe as. a short-term loan. I cannot imagine that any government would calmly take away such rights and privileges from ex-service personnel without offering something worth while in their place. Yet, the Government pose, as the friend of the returned man. I have never heard of anything more ridiculous. One can imagine the view which the ex-service man and woman and their friends and relatives  Will  take of this provision. ITo honorable senator opposite has denied the facts given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> in support of his amendment. He has pointed out that under the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act over 17,000 ex-servicemen have benefited under the preference provision by securing employment in the Postmaster-General##'##? </para>

                    <para>. -  The remarks made by honorable senators opposite on the clause can be classified under three headings. They say, first, that this legislation should operate simultaneously with the existing legislation. That, of course, would bp impossible. We could not have one measure providing preference for ex-service personnel in the Commonwealth Public Service, and, at the same time, implement this measure, which covers not merely fighting personnel, as the existing legislation does, but also all ex-service personnel in all categories. We are forced to do that on this occasion because this war is a total war. Regardless of the merits of either measure, it would bo impossible to operate both of them at the same time. Secondly, I point out to honorable senators opposite that seven years after this war finishes ex-servicemen of the war of 1914-18 now in the Commonwealth Public Service will be, on an average, at least 62 years of age. And I understand that under the Commonwealth Public Service Act no applicant can be appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service at that age. The third point was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> who said that should the Postal Department, for instance, experience a slack period and be obliged to put off some ex-servicemen, who are employed temporarily, they could not be re-engaged if this clause bo retained. That is not so. This measure covers not only ex-service personnel who saw active service, but also many others, and because of the fact that they pre viously held those positions they would be entitled to preference in respect of re-engagement. Therefore, I see no reason for the amendment. No honorable senator opposite has answered the objection explained by the Leader of the Senate that it is impossible to operate this measure and existing legislation simultaneously. Assuming that, on the average, men who served in the last war were 22 years of age when they enlisted, and that this war continues for another two years, those ex-servicemen will be at least 62 years of age at the end of the period of seven years .provided in this measure. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is merely holding up a straw and knocking it down. I hope that the Government will not accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Thai; is a poor argument. The preference provisions of this measure are largely for returned soldiers of the present war. Returned soldiers of the last war have enjoyed preference benefits for 25 years. On this occasion,- however, ex-servicemen will be deprived of these privileges at the end of seven years. I contend that ex-servicemen of this war should at least enjoy the same benefits as were extended toreturned soldiers of the war of 1914-18. Honorable senators opposite are alwaysclaiming that returned soldiers of the last war were treated very badly. That has been the gospel of discontent on which they have lived. The fact is however that 17,000 of these men were temporary employees of the Postmaster-General##'##s Department alone. I want returned soldiers of this war to have similar opportunities for employment. Ti##"##  is unfortunate for the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> that some of his supporters frequently place the wrong interpretation upon his remarks and force him into a position which he does not relish. I believe that he would have agreed with almost everything that I have said to-day, had he been permitted to have his own way. I am not fighting for anything that is unreasonable. My view is that whatever modicum of preference this measure envisages, should be available to members of our fighting forces without limitation. If that is too much to ask, then I leave the responsibility with the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - There is one point that has been overlooked. Section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, to which this clause relates, became operative for the first time in 1943 when this Government did not have a majority in this chamber. Despite assurances given by the Government that if the Senate did not insist upon the inclusion of this provision, a preference measure of the kind which we are now considering would be brought down at some later stage, the Senate insisted on the insertion in our repatriation legislation of what is known now as section 117. I advert to that point, because it has been said that section 117 has been of inestimable benefit to returned soldiers for very many years. I repeat that section 117 has operated only since 1943, and I should imagine, has affected very few returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Public Service preference provisions are dealt with in another clause which we have not yet reached, and no doubt the discussion which has taken place on this clause, will save time when the other clause comes before the committee. I wish also to controvert the statement that this Government is taking something substantial away from returned soldiers and is not putting anything in its place. Again, I remind honorable senators opposite that during their long term of office they did not seek to extend the principle of preference to returned soldiers to private enterprise. This Government is now extending that principle over the whole field of industry. When honorable senators opposite speak of the great benefits conferred upon returned soldiers by the preference clauses of earlier legislation, I point out that that preference was available only in a narrow field. Of course, it was of benefit to those who were able to participate in it; but I emphasize that the benefits of those provisions were insignificant compared with the advantages which ex-servicemen will now enjoy. I repeat what I said in my second-reading speech, namely, that this is not the final word on the matter. The passing of this measure merely disposes of the problem for seven years. At the end of that time, the government of the day, which may not be a Labour government, will be able <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> examine the situation in the light of the circumstances that are then apparent. The problem will have narrowed down considerably, and whatever government is in power will have to determine whether preference as a principle shall be abandoned completely, retained in some form under Commonwealth legislation, or left entirely to the State legislatures. Even if the Commonwealth vacates the field entirely at the end of the seven-year period, the question of preference will not be disposed of finally. The States may take it up, although quite frankly I believe that it is a national problem, and that it will be the duty of this Parliament, at the end of the seven-year period, to review the operation of the preference provisions of this legislation and decide whether the principle of preference is to be discarded or retained in some modified form. </para>

                    <para>. - I submit that repatriation as it should be understood is quite distinct from preference. When section 117 was inserted in the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, I pointed out that it was practically meaningless. The concluding words of. sub-section 1 of that section are ##"##who are competent for the work required ##"##. If that means anything at all, it means that in the case of an appointment to the Postal Department the Postmaster-General, or those acting in his name, would be the judges of whether or not a returned soldier were  competent to do a job. If in the opinion of an officer representing the Postmaster-General##'##s Department, or of a contractor acting for the department, a returned soldier was not competent to do a job, they would not be under any obligation to employ him. Therefore, that section of the act is so much ##"## eye-wash ##"## designed to mislead the returned soldiers. There is no provision in. the act for an appeal. If, for example, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator leckie</inline> were a returned soldier, which he is not, and was an applicant for a position, if be felt that he was being treated unjustly, or that an employer was discriminating unfairly against him, he could not appeal to any other authority. All the power to say whether or not a returned soldier shall be employed is vested in the employer. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Under that section of the act, the employer is a law unto himself. He can say that he does not like the colour of the returned soldier##'##s eyes, or that the man is likely to cause trouble, and that will be sufficient ground for the employer to say, ##"##You are incompetent. Therefore, under section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, I am under no obligation to employ you ##"##. The Government is doing the proper thing ^ by repealing that section and including an appropriate provision in this bill. It is not taking anything away from the ex-serviceman, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> contended, because the ex-serviceman never had anything under that section. It is hypocrisy, eyewash, and word-spinning to assert that something is being taken away and that nothing is being put in its place. Preference means nothing to returned soldiers if they do not, in fact, get preference in employment. If a number of returned soldiers apply for one job, the one who is selected receives preference and the others do not. There are limitations in section 1.17 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act which make it practically meaningless.  Lt  is one of those word structures which are used##'##, effectively I regret to say, to mislead men who are entitled to a much better deal than they have received in the past. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The _ Postmaster-General then waxed indignant about the new section, and the Senate generally was very upset because the Opposition party held a majority in this chamber and compelled the Government to do the right thing, which was something new in its experience. The House of Representatives, realizing that right was on our side, agreed to the amendment which we forced through the Senate. I fear that the Postmaster-General has not forgotten that battle and is pleased, now that the Government has a majority in this chamber, to reverse the previous decision. The Government has done this merely to punish us for something that we did in 1943, but, in fact,  Lt  will penalize all ex-servicemen. </para>

The honorable senator does not mind imputing discreditable motives to the Opposition, but when the Opposition gets some of its own hack he squeals like a stuck pig. The unfortunate thing is that honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber are not revenging themselves on us, but are making ex-servicemen suffer. I well recall the impassioned speeches made 0n this subject in 1943 by the present Postmaster-General. Hp did not want to give anything to the returned soldiers. </para>

One honorable senator has suggested that we did not go far enough in that section and that we should have included private enterprise in the provisions for preference to ex-servicemen.

                        <para>- Yes. That is why the Government held a referendum. Unfortunately, it included the preference proposal with thirteen or fourteen racialist schemes, and, naturally, the proposals were rejected by the people. Had the Government presented the preference plan separately, it would have received the full approval of the electors. By failing to do this, the Government showed that it was not so sincere as it claims to be. Had it taken the right course, the power which it sought in relation to preference would now ##'##be in its hands. </para>

                    <para>. -  I direct attention to the outstanding fact that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> has made any attempt to disprove my statement that section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act does not compel employers to engage returned soldiers but leaves the decision to the employers. The words in that section speak for themselves. The. term ##"##who are competent for the work required ##"##  i3  a qualifying phrase which allows the employer to decide whether preference shall be given, and which deprives the ex-serviceman of any rights at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> very conveniently ignored those words. This section of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, in common with laws passed by the State Parliaments, contains the proviso that, ##"## all things being equal, returned soldiers shall receive preference ##"##. What is meant by ##"## all things being equal ##"## ? Those words are included for the purpose of misleading ex-servicemen. Honorable senators opposite support section 117 of the act (because it gives to employers, who need not be ex-servicemen, the right to decide whether ex-servicemen shall have preference. They have all the rights and ex-servicemen have no rights at all. In spite of all this honorable senators oppo  site  say in indignant terms that the Government is taking  away  from the ex-servicemen something which, in fact, they have never possessed. A returned soldier  has  no rights under that section. Provided that he is competent he will receive preference in any case. Let us assume  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is an employer. I imagine him employing the man who, in his judgment, is the most competent applicant for appointment. Why would ho do that? Simply because that man would .be the most profitable employee from an employer##'##s point of  view.  The honorable senator would not employ him because he liked him, but because he offered the prospect of providing more profit from his labour than an incompetent man. All  the  sentimental sob-stuff in which  the  Opposition indulges means nothingThe  ex-serviceman  will not get the  deal to  which  he  is entitled unless it be guaranteed to him in the bill. If  the  welfare of ex-servicemen is left to  the  employers after this war, as after  the last war,  they will be forced either to  work  for a dole or starve. </para>

                    <para>.- First the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> stated that the preference provision in the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act means nothing at all, and then he said that because it meant nothing we were taking something away from ex-servicemen. Had hesaid that it did mean something, no doubt he would have thumped the table with both hands. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> has pointed out, this bill perpetuates a provision which the Minister condemned with the full strength of his voice. The position of the returned soldier will be much worse under this clause than it was under the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act. If the existing preference provision is worth nothing at all, why is he so anxious to have it repealed ? I could understand him saying that it is of great benefit to ex-servicemen and therefore should be repealed; but, when he says that it is of no benefit to them, and therefore we should repeal it, I cannot understand his logic. This clause would have been passed some time ago had the Postmaster-General not made a stone-walling speech. Section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act should be retained, or provision should be made for it to be re-enacted at the expiration of seven years after the cessation of hostilities. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie has asked why the Government wishes to repeal section 117 of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act.</inline> I  object to any honorable senator trying to mislead ex-servicemen, as members of the Opposition have always done since the last war. What is to be done in the interests of ex-servicemen should be stated in the bill in plain language, without qualifying ##"##ifs##"## or ##"##buts##"##. Under the bill they will have rights which are not provided by section 117. If an ex-serviceman has reason to believe that he has been unjustly discriminated against, or that his employer has been influenced by bias or prejudice, or has tried to make more profit out of one man than another, he has the right to appeal to a magistrate; but under section 117 he has no rights at all. All the rights under that section are those of the employers. There are two reasons why that section should be repealed. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister who has just resumed his seat has submitted an amazing proposition. As an employer, I should certainly engage the best men I could get. It is difficult to understand the Minister##'##s mentality. Ex-servicemen regard section 117 as of some value. When the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act was under consideration they wanted the preference provision badly, and we were told at the time that they were being given something which was of value. They still think that that section should be retained. </para>
