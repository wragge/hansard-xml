                <para>Senator Herbert Hays referred to deliveries of Bismarck potatoes in Tasmania. I am now in a position to furnish a reply to the honorable senator. Whilst the Government can understand the natural desire of growers to receive payment for potatoes grown under contract with the Australian Potato Committee at the earliest possible moment, the action of the Australian Potato Committee is reasonable. The contract provides for potatoes being held by growers for a reasonable time, and this is taken into account in the guaranteed price. It is incorrect to state that last year##'##s growers were especially requested to increase the area of Bismarcks. On the contrary, as farback as two years ago, growers were warned by the Potato Controller that they were running serious risks in overplanting Bismarcks, and were informed that, irrespective of the variety grown, growers would be required to spread their deliveries over the season. Notwithstanding that advice, a number of growers planted over 100 acres each of Bismarcks and very few Brownells or other latekeeping varieties. Following on this heavy planting, a record growing season was experienced with consequent heavy yields. The result has been a surplus of early season potatoes. Growers in Tasmania have been repeatedly advised to dig and store potatoes so as to make their land available for other crops, and have been assured that the Government would abide faithfully by the terms of its contract with growers, and that potatoes would be accepted before undue deterioration took place. Quite recently, it was reported to me that growers in the Glengarry- Winkleigh area were threatened with severe losses from storage deterioration; an immediate inspection was made and the report was found to be groundless. More recently, another report was made to me of a grower in the midlands of Tasmania who had a very large quantity of potatoes on hand and that the Australian PotatoCommittee had taken no steps to honour its obligations. Again, an immediate inspection was undertaken, which disclosed that the grower himself had nominated Launceston as his port of shipment, but was endeavouring to ship via Hobart; it was ascertained that, he had taken no steps to contact either the Distribution Manager in Launceston or the Tasmanian  Deputy  Potato Controller. This he frankly admitted and further stated that he had no complaint to make about the treatment he had received. The complaint which reached me apparently came from a relative without the grower##'##s authority. The point to he noticed in these cases is that there has not been undue deterioration to date, and I can assure Senator Herbert Hays that the position is being closely watched so that growers will not suffer. The effect of some of the requests would be to compensate growers for large quantities of potatoes still in the ground undug, and allow potatoes to go to waste. The attitude of the Australian Potato Committee was, and is, that it will not sanction the destruction, or writing off, of a single ounce of foodstuff unless that action became inevitable. It is admitted that some growers have been put to inconvenience in having to hold a portion of their crop longer than usual, but the net returns of growers have been exceptionally satisfactory and the Australian Potato Committee has kept a careful watch to ensure that growers did not suffer loss through any of its actions. </para>
                <para>Demands for potatoes are likely to increase towards the end of the season, and in view of the guaranteed prices being paid by the Government and the assured position of the industry, it is only reasonable that growers should co-operate, even to the point of some inconvenience, in ensuring that supplies of potatoes will be available right throughout the season. </para>
                <para>It is quite natural for growers to wish to deliver their potatoes at their own convenience, but one reason for control is the need to regulate supplies on to the market, and, as mentioned, this aspect was considered in fixing the guaranteed price. It is pointed out, also, that there are growers##'## representatives on all State Potato Advisory Committees, and as a result any matters affecting growers can be ventilated readily,and usually can he adjusted quickly. </para>

                    <para>- On the 3rd July Senator Aylett directed my attention to the matter of payment to farmers for vegetable seeds. I now advise the honorable senator that before payment to primary producers for produce grown under contract for the Commonwealth is effected, it is necessary that proper verification be obtained of the service which involves such payment. Payment in respect of vegetable seeds grown under contract is dependent upon the results of purity and germination tests which involve a recognized procedure. My colleague, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, has specifically directed that in any matters where payment to primary producers is the responsibility of his department, there shall be no avoidable delays. If the honorable senator wishes to instance particular cases of delays in payment for vegetable seeds supplied. I shall have them inquired into. </para>

                        <para>It is not the policy of the Government to protect Australian industries by prohibiting importations. Manufacturers of pressed panels are protected by heavy tariff duties. It is considered that any decision by importers to import panels will be governed largely by a comparison of their landed cost with the price to be charged for similar locally produced panels. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to regulate life insurance business conducted in Australia, and to protect the interests of persons who have effected life insurance policies. Life insurance business has been developed extensively, and there are now about. 4,500,000 policies in force in Australia. It has long been recognized that some form of public control is necessary over a business which affects such a large proportion of the people, and in fact various enactments with this object in view have been passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. It if generally admitted, however, that the control exercised by existing legislation is not completely satisfactory, and it is the object of this bill to consolidate and extend the provisions of those acts. </para>
                    <para>To explain the type of control proposed by this bill it. is necessary to refer briefly to the historical development of life insurance business. The business was largely developed in G##&gt;##reat Britain during the last century, and after the failure of one or two companies had attracted public attention, a system of legislative control was instituted in 1870. Under this system, the principles of which have been described as ##"## freedom with publicity ##"##, a company is required to lodge a relatively small deposit with the Government as security for policy-holders, but otherwise it is allowed considerable freedom in the management of its business, provided that it. publishes its accounts and statistics in a standard form. In the past the publicity given to a company##'##s results, and the competition between various companies has been relied upon to ensure a minimum standard of protection for policy-holders. Life insurance in Australia is carried on mainly by local mutual companies on lines very similar to those adopted by </para>
                    <para class="block">British companies, and the British system of legislative control, i.e., ##"##freedom with publicity ##"##, was adopted by all the States, with the important exception of New South Wales, before the Commonwealth was founded in 1901. As these State enactments differed in details, though not in principle, the need for uniform insurance legislation was fore seen when the Commonwealth Constitution was drafted, and power was taken accordingly. As a step to implement this power, a royal commission was appointed in 1908. The commission reported in 1910, and although bills were twice prosented to the Senate, neither of them was proceeded with. On two special subjects only has the Commonwealth passed life insurance legislation. In 1905 it extended to life policies the limitation imposed upon friendly societies, regarding the amount that may be paid on the death of a child. In 1932 it assumed control over the deposits previously lodged by companies with some of the States, and imposed a uniform scale of deposits for the whole of Australia. It may be mentioned that this act effectively checked the formation of ##"##mushroom##"## companies, many of which had previously commenced business in New South Wales, where no deposit was required. The first purpose of this bill is thus to consolidate these existing State and Commonwealth acts. It has become apparent, however, that the principles of ##"## freedom with publicity ##"## embodied in these acts require some modification in view of modern conditions. This fact was recognized in Great Britain in 1923, when, following an inquiry into the methods of transacting industrial insurance, an Industrial Insurance Commissioner was appointed, with wide powers of supervision of the companies. In the present bill it is proposed that a Commissioner be appointed to supervise the administration of the proposed act, both as regards ordinary and industrial insurance. A further point is that whereas the bulk of life insurance business in Australia is transacted by companies which have acquired a world-wide reputation for their soundness, there are a few companies that are not yet so firmly established. In the case of the strong companies it is antici pated that the duties of the Commissioner will be largely of a supervisory nature. In the case of those companies which are not so well established, it isexpected that he will have to take more active steps to procure the maximum possible protec tion for the policy-holders. In such circumstances, British legislation provides only that the Commissioner can make application for the winding-up of the company by the court. It is thought, however, that in respect of a life insurance company, it will frequentlybe possible to make arrangements which are more satisfactory to the policy-owners than a complete winding-up of the company, and the bill provides the machinery whereby each case can be closely examined and, subject to directions of the High Court, the procedure most favorable to the policy-holders can be adopted. The procedure adopted has been modelled upon an enactment of the South African legislature. </para>

The Commissioner may. subject to the Treasurer##'##s approval, refuse to register any company not already transacting life insurance business in Australia. Companies already doing life insurance business in Australia are entitled to registration on application within three months, but such registration is merely to ensure the continuity of their business, and will not imply that the Commissioner is satisfied with the methods under which their business is conducted. Should the Commissioner have any doubt as to whether an existing company should be allowed to continue transacting life insurance business, the biLl gives to him power, after registering the company, to make an immediate investigation, and then, if he thinks fit, to compel the company either to improve its methods or to cease doing business in Australia. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>It has long been recognized that the funds of life insurance companies are in the nature of trust funds, and that they should, subject to any proper allocation of profits, as decided by the members of the company, be applied solely for the benefit of the policy-owners. This principle is enforced in the bill by the establishment of statutory funds. All moneys received in respect of life insurance business must be carried to a statutory fund, the assets of which must be kept entirely separate from all other assets of the company, and no part of a statutory fund may be applied towards any purpose other than life insurance business. Thus, if a company transacts, say, fire insurance business, as well as life insurance, and suffers losses on its fire business, the life statutory funds cannot be charged with those losses. The bill provides that accounts and balance-sheets in respect of each statutory fund shall be prepared annually in a prescribed manner and that such accounts and balance-sheets shall be audited by cornpotent persons. A person must, in the first instance, secure the approval of the Commissioner before he undertakes the duties of auditor of a life insurance company. At least once in each five years the affairs of each company must be thoroughly investigated by an actuary. These provisions follow thos* set out in British legislation, with one or two further safeguards. Foi instance, it is provided that the basis of valuation adopted by the actuary shall be not less stringent than a prescriber ##"## minimum basis ##"##. This minimum, basis cannot be called a severe one in present conditions, and no solvent company should have any difficulty in complying with it. For those companies whose position is not entirely satisfactory, however, the adoption of a uniform minimum bash of valuation, will assist the Commissioner lo determine the course of action heshould take. Besides being entrusted with the general administration of the proposed act, the Commissioner is to be given very full powers to make confidential inquiries into the business of any life insurance company. He can demand any relevant information from a company, and can, if he thinks fit, investigate any part of a company##'##s business. In the event of such an investigation, the legitimate interests of the company are preserved by the fact that the Commissioner must inform the company of the ground.on which the investigation is to be made, and of the results of an investigation. Also, the investigation must be conducted in secret, and no information may be divulged except in pursuance of a duty under the act. As a result of his investigations, the Commissioner may give snob directions to the company as he thinks necessary, but, in view of the fact that such directions might seriously affect the business of the company, it is provided that the company may appeal to the High Court against those directions. It is anticipated, however, that the Commissioner would normally give directions only on matters of minor importance. Should his investigations show that there is anything seriously wrong with the management of a company, his remedy would be to apply to the High Court for the appointment of a judicial manager to ##'## the company. If appointed, the judicial manager will, subject to directions from the court, take over all the powers and functions of the management of the company. The judicial management is intended to be only a temporary phase to protect the interests of the policy-owners, mid, as soon as practicable, the judicial manager will report to the court, indicating whether he considers the company should be wound up, or its business transferred to another company, or whether any better arrangement can be made in the interests of the  policyowners.  These, then, are the powers whereby the Commissioner will be able to ensure that all life insurance companies remain solvent, not only as ##"##regards their immediate liabilities, but also as regards the actuarial reserves that must be built up to pay future claims. Tt will be noted that there is nothing arbitrary about his powers on any question of ##'##vital importance; if the company is not satisfied with the Commissioner##'##s decision, it can take the matter to the High Court for decision. - </para>
                    <para>A considerable part of the bill sets out certain minimum rights that a policy-owner shall have in relation to his policy contract. These provisions, for the most part, follow similar provisions in the various State acts, and in any event, are merely privileges that the better companies have freely allowed to their policy-holders for many years. The object of the bill is to require all companies to maintain these minimum standards in all States. </para>
                    <para>In recent years the Victorian Government has taken an active interest in life insurance legislation of this nature. Senators will remember that a Royal Commission on Industrial Insurance was appointed in Victoria in  193S, and the recommendations of that royal commission were subsequently embodied in the legislation of that State. </para>
                    <para>The present bill has included all the provisions of recent Victorian legislation, with minor amendments, and thus extends to policy-owners in all States the benefits of the findings of that royal commission. The most important of these provisions is, perhaps, the institution of a minimum scale of surrender values and paid-up policy values which, as in Victoria, are extended to both ordinary and industrial insurance policies. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose at this stage to enter into details regarding the other provisions of the bill, some of which are of a technical nature, since they arc described in the memorandum which I am presenting for the information of honorable senators. I would, however, once more emphasize the need for uniform and comprehensive legislative control of this business which so closely affects the lives of the Australian people. Before this bill was drafted, an extensive study was made of comparable legislation, in Great Britain and in most of the British dominions, and I believe thai the form of control suggested by the bill is the most suitable to Australian conditions. The provisions of -the (bill are not unduly harsh on the management of life insurance companies; indeed, I think it can be said that the better companies have already voluntarily given to their policy-holders substantially all the rights conferred by the bill. The measure will, however, introduce improvements into the practices of some other companies that have not been so liberal in the past, and will also have the undoubted advantage of rendering the  minimum  rights of policy-owners uniform in all companies and in all States. </para>

In such circumstances, the  Deputy  Governor would remain in control until another Governor is appointed by the Governor-General. The act of 1911 provided that ##"##if the Governor is absent from the Commonwealth, or is absent from duty on leave, or is unableby reason of illness or other cause to perform his duty, or if any vacancy exists in the office of Governor, the  Deputy  Governor shall have and exercise all the powers and functions of theGovernor during his absence, or while the inability continues or the vacancy exists ##"##. In 1924, that section was repealed and, in lieu thereof the existing section 23 was inserted. The reason for the wording of the clause now before the committee is that it is more appropriate in relation to statutory appointments. </para>

                        <para>. -  The Minister will realize that probably the reason why the section to which he referred was repealed was that the bank was placed under the control of a hoard, and the board could immediately grant all necessary powers to the Deputy Governor, it would seem that the matter I have raised has been overlooked. An amendment should be inserted in order to give to the Deputy Governor power to carry on in the event of the illness of the Governor, or incapacity from other causes to perform his duties. </para>

                            <para>.- The Government has decided to substitute an Advisory Council for the present board. Apparently, it deems this method the best way of supplementing any wisdom which the Governor may possess in his management of the bank. It is curious to note how this provision fits into the scheme of the measure, the object of which is to make the bank completely subservient to the Treasurer of the day. </para>

                            <para>- This proposal seems to me to be like the fifth wheel of the coach. It is merely a trimming to lead the people to believe that the Governor will be guided by the Advisory Council. It may be better than nothing, but compared with board control it will be practically useless. This proposal is designed to lead the people concerned with the bank to believe that they will still have some interest in it. The measure as a whole, and particularly this clause, reduces the status of the Commonwealth Bank to a public department. The Government seeks to achieve that objective by appointing officers of a government department to advise the Governor of the bank on financial matters. But such officers will have no responsibilities and no powers. The Governor need not take rue slightest notice of any advice they may tender. </para>

                            <para>- These officers will have no responsibility and no power. It would be an improvement to provide that the Advisory Council shall report to Parliament in respect of any difference of opinion with the Governor. That would bt  ti  safeguard, but under the clause the Governor can ignore any advice which the council may give, and he cannot be called to account for such action because no one except himself will know what advice the council may offer. The council will report to him alone, and he may simply sweep their advice aside. I do not propose to move an amendment, but I point out the uselessness of the proposed council. It will be of no value in looking after the affairs of the bank. The Governor with the Treasurer standing over him will simply run the bank. Obviously, the proposal is intended to lead people to believe that the Advisory Council will have some responsibility and power. That is not the case. The council will not even have the power to submit its advice to the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>-. - The Minister, by interjection, said that the members of the Advisory Council would be non-political. That is probably true; but an earlier clause passed by the committee provides that in the event of disagreement the Treasurer##'##s view shall prevail. In effect, that means that the council must work under the control and direction of the Treasurer of the day. The Treasurer, whoever he may be, will be distinctly political and it is useless to say that the Advisory Council will not be political, because the bill is political from beginning to end. That is indicated by the provision that in the event of disagreement, the will of the Government shall prevail. The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representa.tives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has announced that when the Liberal party gains the treasury bench, the Bank Board will be re-established. Henceforth, every general election will be fought on banking. The stability of banking ##'## depends on the application of a constant policy. People  a ling with banks, and they are legion, ought to be able to ascertain exactly what the banking policy is, but they will not be able to do so, because with every change of government, there will be a change of the banking legislation. That will destroy stability. At the next general elections, the people will be asked whether they prefer the Commonwealth Bank to be administered by politician? or independent men. I have no doubt what the people will say. The Government should seriously reconsider the? extremely dangerous substitution of political control for the independent control of the Bank Board. </para>

However, I should like to know if this clause means that the bank may arrange with any individual - not a company or an organization, but a single individual who is not a member of the bank staff - to act as its agent? One can understand a branch manager acting as an agent, but not a person who has noconnexion whatever with the bank. </para>

                    <para>When this legislation becomes operative, it will be necessary for recruits for the Commonwealth Bank staff to pass a prescribed entrance examination. That, however, does not apply to officers of banks taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. Although clause 156 does not go so far as the amendment does, it provides adequate protection. The object of the amendment is to have officers of private banks taken over by the Commonwealth bank accepted in the Commonwealth Bank on the same status and with the same rights as they held in their original employment. It is reasonable to assume that any officer who held a position of importance in a private bank will not be derated when he is absorbed into the Commonwealth Bank staff. However, there may be other officers who because of drunken habits, or for some other valid reason, cannot be regarded as desirable members of the Commonwealth Bank staff. The Commonwealth Bank should not be under an obligation to employ people of that type. I admit that this is one of the main objections of certain bank officers##'## organizations to this legislation. Representatives of these organizations have been conducting a campaign throughout the Commonwealth, and telling bank officers that if this legislation becomes law they will lose their jobs. That is not so. The interests of officers of private banks will be protected adequately. </para>

It is all very well for the Minister for Trade and Custom* <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> to say that ample provision is made in clause 156, but  all that  that clause provides, in sub-clause 2, i* that ##"## the Bank may appoint person* who have not. passed a prescribed! entrance examination to such positions or to positions of such classes,, as are prescribed ##"##. Sub-clause 3 goes a little farther; it provides that officers of  a  bank which is taken over by the Commonwealth Bank may be appointed although they - have not passed the prescribed examination. That means only that the staff of any bank which is taken over will be at the mercy of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt it will do so to the best of its ability, but  a  private bank which is carrying on business successfully and is making profit? is not likely to want to hand over its business to the Commonwealth Bank. Only when a private bank is experiencing difficulties will it be willing to enter into negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank, and, therefore, it may nol be in a position to lay down, hard and fast, the conditions which shall apply to its staff. I cannot understand why the Government proposes to treat the staff of private banks so badly. Most of these officers are not highly paid and after many years of service with  a  bank they will not be fitted for other classes of work. The Government##'##s duty is to see that officers of a bank which ie being taken over by the Commonwealth Bank shall be adequately safeguarded. T cannot understand the reluctance ob the part of the Government to accept the amendment. I wish to make it  cleaT  that I have not consulted with any bank officer in his matter, and that no representations on this subject have been mad* to me. When I saw this clause, I marked it immediately as one deserving of further consideration, because I foresaw that it could cause hardship. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am. astonished that the Ministry hae not taken the opportunity to reassure officers of private banks that their interests will be safeguarded. The Government professes to represent the working people of this country and I cannot understand its attitude in this matter. </para>

For many years the note issue has had a backing of either gold or other suitable security, but now the Government says that there is no necessity for any such backing. Clearly, the Government wants the power to print, as many notes as it thinks fit; it wants freedom to act wildly, and to print notes without limit and without supporting security of any kind. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that before, but those resources are already heavily mortgaged. The existence of a backing, in either gold or other security, to the note issue would give the people confidence that the currency was being safeguarded. Moreover, such a backing would constitute a valuable nest-egg for use in connexion with foreign transactions. The Minister knows that Australian notes are not accepted outside Australia. Most of our transactions overseas will have to be paid for either in gold or in goods and, as I have said, the existence of a backing to the note issue would be valuable should the trade balance be against Australia. </para>

At least, the Government should have regard to the amount of the note issue, and ##'##should agree vo some limitation being placed on it. Before the war, Australian notes in circulation represented about ##£##6 or ##£##7 per head of the population ; to-day notes to the value of from ##£##28 to ##£##30 per head of the population are in circulation. What proportion of those notes is held by banks, and what proportion is held by the public, 1 do not know, but I suggest that a limit of ##£##25 per head of population would adequately serve all currency requirements and buying necessities of thicountry. Such a limit would be flexible, because it would vary with any increase of the population. I move - </para>

However, my main objective is to place some limit upon the total value of the note issue in order to prevent this, or any government in the future, from wildly printing notes. I know that it will be argued that notes in excess of what is demanded by the public will not be printed. However, the people do not hold all the notes now on issue. Notes are held also by banks and other institutions. I suggest that when we come to the appropriate clause, the Minister should make a statement setting out not only the value of the notes now on issue, but also how these notes are distributed as between private individuals and institutions. I am not exactly wedded to the basis of ##£##25 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> mentioned in my amendment. although I think that that amount  would  be ample. My objective is  to  place  a  limit upon the value  of  the note issue. This is imperative having regard to  the  fact that the Government has abolished the note issue reserve, which, in the past, restricted the issue of notes. Under this bill, no limit whatever is provided with respect to the printing of notes. I wish to protect the people of Australia from the ruinous experience of Germany, and other continental countries, where administrations printed notes <inline font-style="italic">ad lib</inline> Surely, the Government does not wish to see such a state of affairs occur in Australia? However, if it refuses to set a limit to the note issue as I now propose, one can only conclude that it intends to print bank notes <inline font-style="italic">adlib.</inline> I also point out that my amendment provides that the Treasurer of the day may seek the permission of Parliament to increase the note issue. I have no doubt that should sound reasonsbe advanced for such a course, Parliament would give its consent. Does the Minister refuse to put any limit on the value of the bank notes which may be printed? </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of theOpposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie).</inline> It is a very fair proposal. In1938 the amount of money in circulation averaged ##£##7 <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> whereas to-day the amount is about ##£##25 <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> The amendment proposes to limit the note issue at that level, unless Parliament consents to exceed that limit. It is obvious that to-day many people are hoarding bank notes, because all of the notes issued are not in circulation. With freer circulation of notes the present note issue could be greatly reduced. The main reason for the present shortage of notes is that notes are being hoarded by many people who seem to think they are hoarding something of value, whereas the notes they hold would be just as safe in the hands of banking institutions. A limit of ##£##25 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> would be the equivalent of a total note issue of approximately ##£##180,000,000. </para>

                        <para>.- For practical purposes the effect of the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> would be to impose a maximum limit on the note issue of approximately ##£##165,000,000 except with the consent of Parliament. In deciding to abolish the note issue reserve the Government gave careful consideration to the alternative of placing a statutory limit on the note issue. During the last six yearsthe note issue has, for war reasons, increased from approximately ##£##50,000,000 to a high water mark of about ##£##200,000,000. It is now about ##£##185,000,000. The Government considers that this war-time expansion which may be followed by a large contraction, makes it inappropriate at the present, stage to impose a maximum limit on the note issue. The Government also considers that under modern conditions control of bank credit is more important as aprotection against inflation than the placing of a legislative limit of the note issue. </para>

                <para>I should like the clause to provide that that statement shall show not only the number and amount of Australian notes on issue, but also the number and amount held by the banks, and the number and amount held by the public. If there should be any great difficulty in making such a return I would not persist, but I can see no such difficulty. It will be realized that money in the hands of private persons is not all thrown onto the market at once, but there could be a great danger in a sudden flooding of the market with money by a financial institution. </para>

                    <para>. - Some explanation is needed of this clause which provides a penalty of imprisonment for four years for the possession of ##"## any instrument or thing which may be used in making any form of any Australian note ##"##. All printers engaging in delicate work like the printing of cheque forms have printing machinery capable of being used in the making of any form of any Australian note. It seems rather rough that they should be liable to imprisonment for four years, when their only purpose is to carry on a legitimate trade in which they are engaged. There should be some qualification, perhaps a licensing system, to enable them to carry on without fear of sudden imprisonment for having been engaged in a legitimate enterprise. I do not suggest that thai is the intention of the Government, but there should be no possibility of such a happening. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">These words appear in the Victorian Closer Settlement Act. I move this amendment because at present, the Mortgage Bank Department does not make loans on machinery or anything incidental to farming or land settlement. The amendment if carried would enable the Mortgage Bank Department to carry on a farmer##'##s entirebanking business, that is, his overdraft as well as his mortgage. At present the Mortgage Bank Department can make loans by way of mortgage only on land. Thus, a farmer may be compelled to take a second mortgage, and I assume that if the Government holds the first mortgage, no other institution would take a second mortgage. If my amendment be made the Mortgage Bank Department will be able to make advances on machinery, livestock and plant. It is advisable that a primary producer##'##s accounts should be kept by one institution. If that were done, the Mortgage Bank Department would know immediately the total amount that it bad advanced and the security that it held. Clause 141 of the Victorian Closer Settlement Act enables advances to be made on implements, livestock and even manures. To date, the total number of applications granted by the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank is 814, but 819 applications have been rejected, no doubt mainly for the reason which I have stated. The Minister would be wise to accept the amendment. Land values are now being deter mined by government valuers on the conservative side. The Mortgage Bank Department will advance up to 70 per cent., leaving a 30 per cent. equity for the farmer in his property. If  a  man has a 30 per cent. equity, he has a good hold on his property, and the bank is not likely to lose anything by the acceptance of this amendment which would permit the Mortgage Bank Department to grat loans for the purpose which I have stated. </para>

Also, the position is most difficult for primary producers in Queensland where the bulk of pastoral land is held on Crown lease.

                    <para>.- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has stated that it is not appropriate for the Rural CreditsDepartment to make loans on livestock and machinery. The words which I propose should be inserted in this clause have been taken from the Victorian Closer Settlement Act, which deals wholly and solely with land. Provision is made in that legislation for a farmer to borrow up to80 per cent. of the value  of his property. In addition, he may borrow from the same bank on his livestock, machinery and manures. I am asking only that primary producers should be able to borrow from the Rural Credits Department for implements and livestock. Apart from soldier settlement undertakings, the Victorian Government has not lost money on its closer settlement schemes. Up to date, the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank has refused applications totalling ##£##1,S19,000, chiefly because the applicants did not have a 30 per cent, equity in their properties. Under the Victorian system, those applications probably would have been successful, because the equity required is less. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the amendment which I have moved. Competent officers will be available to determine whether or not the risk involved m lending money on  marchinery  and livestock is reasonable. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has submitted a reasonable proposal. The explanation of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> was that, under this clause, the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank would have a mortgage on either freehold or leasehold land. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has pointed out that the land-holder would have difficulty in borrowing money elsewhere, but the Minister answered that objection by saying that he could borrow money from the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank. Let us consider the position of a man who receives from the Mortgage Bank Department a loan of 70 per cent, of the value of his land and then needs more money with which to purchase live-stock, or plant and machinery. He would be unable to get that money from any private institution, and, therefore, he must go to the Commonwealth Bank for it. That means that he must enter into a new instrument of mortgage with the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank and give additional security for his borrowings in respect of plant, machinery and livestock. That complicates  the transactions unduly ; a single mortgage with the Commonwealth Bank would be much better because it would obviate dealings with two different departments. As has already been pointed out, the Victorian act has worked well. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is. Is not this also a closer settlement provision? It provides for mortgages on broad acres, which means primary producing land. This bill places impossible conditions upon a man who has not sufficient money to buy the live-stock necessary to stock his land which is already mortgaged. The only inference that can be drawn from the attitude of the Government is that after the Commonwealth Bank has accepted a mortgage over a man##'##s land, the land-holder will be compelled to apply to the Commonwealth Bank for any further financial accommodation that .he may require. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> proposal is reasonable, and I cannot see why the Minister cannot accept it, unless it be that he is acting under strict instructions. Acceptance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> proposal would undoubtedly make things easier for the man on the land. </para>

Many men who may ask for assistance from the Mortgage Bank Department, would be helped if provision were made for them along the lines that I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment for the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ##'##Cooper</inline> and also those which I gave in support of the previous amendment. Although the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank was established in order to benefit the man on the land, it has rejected 819 applications for loans amounting to ##£##1,819,000. Probably many of those applications were rejected because they would have represented more than 70 per cent, of the value of the estate or the land-holder##'##s interest in the land. Honorable senators know that Commonwealth Government valuations of land are exceedingly low. Had the Mortgage Bank Department been authorized to make advances up to 80 per cent, of the value of the land, it is probable that few of those applications would have been rejected. Those unsuccessful applicants have ##'##been f orced to seek money elsewhere. Unfortunately it frequently happens that the man whose application is rejected is the man who is most in need of financial assistance. The margin of 30 per cent, should be reduced to 20 per cent. The alteration proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ##'##Cooper</inline> is more necessary now than at any other time during the last 30 years, because of the losses which men have suffered through drought and the depreciation of their properties because of war conditions. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

                        fixed percentage of 70 per cent, of the value of the land must have been decided on by men who do not understand the difficulties which face the man on the land. In my second-reading speech, I said that a government controlled bank does not allow of that flexibility which is one of the greatest assets of the private banks. A man is most in need##'## of financial help when he is in difficulties. There may be times when 70 per cent, or even 80 per cent., of the value of his land would not be sufficient to meet a man##'##s needs. In such circumstances, private banks do not follow an inflexible rule; they take into consideration the character of the applicant, and the reason for his losses, and they make advances to him, not so much on the value of his land, as on their assessment of his character. In practically 100 per cent, of the cases in which private banks have acted generously, the men have succeeded, whereas if the banks had been subjected to an inflexible rule the men might have been forced off their holdings. Even a loan of 80 per cent, of the value of the land is not as much as I would like to see provided for, but an increase from 70 per cent, to 80 per cent, would help many men who are facing the results of droughts, bush fires, and ##'## other catastrophes.

Other members included the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald. One of the most contentious matters with which that committee dealt was the limit which should be placed on loans. Ultimately, a limit of 70 per cent, was agreed to, but during the discussions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald contended that the limit should be 60 per cent. I am, therefore, astonished to hear honorable senators opposite now asserting that a limit of 70 per cent, is too low. </para>

                <para class="block">Health and Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> has referred. I assure the Minister that the limit set out in this clause will force many landholders to apply to the private trading banks for financial assistance. In these days, most land-holders are without cash reserves, and must obtain finance somewhere. This clause aims at assisting men who are primary producers in a small way, because the amount of the loan which may be granted to any man is limited to ##£##5,000. It is not too much to ask that .the struggling land-holders should be entitled to advances up to 80 per cent, of the value of their holdings. That is generally the limit of the trading banks. A reluctance to increase the percentage is an indication that the sufferings which men on the land have endured during recent years, are not understood. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Government makes rosy promises of relief to the man on the land and then refuses to honour them. The fact is that up to the present the man on the land has been able to obtain financial accommodation on more liberal terms from the private banks and the State financial agencies than from the Mortgage Bank Department, because he could give a lien on his machinery and live-stock. The Government says that the Mortgage Bank Department was established for the purpose of benefiting the small man who wants to borrow up to, say, ##£##5,000, and it adopts the attitude that it is making a very practical proposition; but when we examine that ##'## proposition we find that the conditions imposed upon the borrower are not so easy, because, first, valuations given by the Commonwealth are lower than those given by other financial houses, and, secondly, the amounts advanced are less than those made by outside institutions. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that at the next general elections the Government will boast that it has set up a mortgage bank to help the man on the land. </para>

In modern farming practice stock and machinery represent considerable value. In ordinary circumstances, a man with capital only sufficient to buy land would be obliged to mortgage the land up to 50 per cent, of its value in order to enable him to purchase stock and implements. Therefore, this limitation on the Mortgage Bank Department will greatly ##'## hamper its ability to help the small man who wants to borrow up to ##£##5,000. Under it, borrowers will not be able to obtain terms as liberal as those which they have been able to obtain up to the present from other institutions. In addition, the managers of wool firms and private banks take##'## a personal interest in the affairs of clients, whereas no such policy will be adopted by a mortgage bank of this kind. In this instance, applicants will be obliged to deal only with the head office. The promise made by the Government to provide easy money for the man on the land is merely ##"## eye-wash ##"##. </para>

                    <para>. - The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> has shown the inconsistency of the arguments adduced by honorable senators opposite in respect of this measure. He and his colleagues now say that this provision will drive the small man on the land into the hands of the private banks. But during the second-reading debate, those honorable senators declared that the objective of the measure was to destroy the private banks by driving them out of business. Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. I believe that the Minister in charge of the bill can give good and sufficient reasons why it is proposed to limit the amount of the advance to 70 per cent, of the valuation of the security. The Minister for Health and Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> has pointed out that when the original measure to establish the Mortgage Bank Department was before Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> in the House of Representatives, were not prepared to allow the bank to make advances of even up to 70 per cent, of the valuation of the security. On the basis of the arguments now advanced by honorable senators opposite, the purpose of those two gentlemen, apparently, was to cause the Mortgage Bank Department to fail in its objectives. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is comforting to hear a little argument now and again from honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan##'##s</inline> contention that the arguments of members of the Opposition are inconsistent is ridiculous. We have said that the bill is hostile to the interests of the private banks. Now, we say that in ordinary circumstances, borrowers, up to the present, could obtain from private banks more liberal accommodation than is provided under this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> should not forget that the Commonwealth Bank will have at its disposal surplus funds of the private banks amounting to ##£##240,000,000. Deprived of those resources, the private banks, obviously, will not be able to continue to provide accommodation on the liberal terms they offered in the past. Therefore, we are not inconsistent. The honorable senator conveniently forgets that the measure takes funds from the private banks, and also restricts the classes of advances which those institutions will be permitted to make. Private institutions in future may not advance money on certain classes of property in respect of which the Commonwealth Bank may do so. By that means the man on the land will be forced to deal with the Mortgage Bank Department. Therefore, the honorable senator##'##s charge of inconsistency is. absurd. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is difficult to understand the attitude of the Government with respect to this clause. Only for this measure, the private banks would have sufficient capital to make advances on easy terms to the man on the land who will now have to seek accommodation from the Mortgage Bank Department. The inconsistency of the Government##'##s proposal lies in the fact that up to the present borrowers could obtain more liberal terms from the private and State financial agencies. It is extraordinary that the Government should curtail the resources of the private banks, and thus prevent them from doing their ordinary business in an ordinary way. The State financial agencies are making advances up to 80 per cent, of the valuation of securities. Yet this Government has boasted for years that it would do more to help the man on the land. Under the bill, the Mortgage Bank Department will not only provide less liberal accommodation than that provided by existing State financial agencies, but, at the same time, the Government will limit resources of private institutions which have rendered better service in the past. To-day, the Tasmanian Government, under its housing scheme, is providing finance up to the full cost of homes, and under the scheme losses to date have been practically nil. When the people realize exactly the conditions governing advances from the Mortgage Bank Department they will treat the Government##'##s boasts with contempt, and will fall back upon the State financial agencies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said that honorable senators on this side have been inconsistent in their attitude towards the measure. We voted against the second-reading of the bill, because we believe that it is unnecessary, and that the interests of the community would be better served under the old system of board-control of the Commonwealth Bank. However, as we have not sufficient numbers to carry our point, it is- our purpose to try to improve the bill as much as possible. </para>

                <para class="block">Mortgage Bank Department to provide terms even as generous as those provided by private institutions up to the present. We should make a special effort to enable the Mortgages Bank Department, even at the risk of incurring a small loss, to give the most generous terms to borrowers. Let us recall the risks run by the private hanks, particularly in times of drought. The private banks and the pastoral finance companies of this country have greatly assisted the development of Australia. They have come to the rescue of primary producers in times of stress such as in the recent drought. We on this side are often charged with being tories, but the real conservatives are shown to he on the Government side by this very conservative provision that the Mortgage Bank Department shall advance only 70 per cent, of the value of the asset. If the Government is as concerned as it professes to be for the man on the land and had the interest it claims in decentralization, it would comply with our reasonable request that, the Mortgage Bank Department should be authorized to advance up to 80 per cent, of the value of the security offered. Here is a chance for the Minister to prove the Government##'##s sincerity. </para>

                    <para>.- My last word on this matter is to say that I had some justification for saying that men would be compelled to leave the Mortgage Bank Department and go back to the trading banks. The last time I was home a young man came to me and said, ##"## The mortgage on my property is due What do you advise me to do?##"## I said, ##"## Get your money from the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank ##"##. He said, ##"## What are the terms ? ##"##  I  told him what they were. He then saw the manager of the branch of the bank with which he had been dealing, who quoted better terms than were obtainable from the Mortgage Bank Department. The next time I saw the young man, he said, ##"## I have made arrangements to get the money from my bank ##"##. He named the bank. He got on overdraft the same amount of money as the Mortgage Bank Department would have given on mortgage at the same amount of interest. Scores of men are being compelled to go to trading banks to get advances that they cannot get from the Mortgage Bank Department. I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment. Otherwise, even more men will be driven to the private banks to get at the same rate of interest a greater amount of money than they could get from the Mortgage Bank Department. </para>

I believe that the eventual effect of this legislation will be the closing of the private banks. That is why I so strongly advocate provision in this clause for an 80 per cent, advance. When the Commonwealth Bank is the only bank, its policy may be to reduce the maximum advance to 60 per cent, or 50 per cent., and those seeking advances will have no redress, because they will have no choice but to take what the Commonwealth Bank offers, in the absence of other means of obtaining finance. </para>

This clause provides for the establishment of an Industrial Finance Department. Already we have the Rural Credits Department, the Mortgage Bank Department, the central bank and the Note Issue Department, and we shall soon be dealing with the Savings Bank. The provisions relating to the Industrial Finance Department, are among the most dangerous in the bill. Some of the clauses, not any of which are cleverly drafted, leave the Commonwealth open to vast losses.

                        <para>. - The general manager of the Industrial Finance Department is to be appointed not by the Governor of the bank but by the Governor-General, which, of course, means that he will be appointed by the Treasurer. Once again, the cloven hoof is evident in the operations of the bank. The Treasurer will determine also the salary and allowance##'##s of the general manager of the Industrial Finance Department. Obviously, this officer is to be at the beck and call of the Treasurer, and, in fact, will not be a servant of the Governor. He is to be appointed for a period not exceeding seven years. No minimum period of appointment is prescribed. He may be appointed for three months, six months or twelve months if the Treasurer so desires. We can well imagine the hold upon the general manager that this provision will give to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be able to appoint a general manager virtually on probation for a short period to determine whether or not he is prepared to carry out the wishes of the Government. Ordinary business acumen suggests that a minimum term of office should be prescribed, of say, three years. This is further evidence of the Government##'##s intention to grasp all possible power. Ostensibly, the bank is to be controlled by the Governor, but here is an instance of authority being taken completely out of the Governor##'##s hands. In these circumstances, what class of officer will accept this position? The job is a most important one and should be attractive to the shrewdest banker in the country - a specially trained officerwith first-class credentials and wide experience. Does the Government really believe that a man of that calibrewill accept the position under the conditions prescribed in this measure? He will be liable to dismissal at a moment##'##s notice. The job is worth ##£##3,000 or ##£##4,000 a year at least, and unless it is held by a competent officer complete failure of the department may result. The proposal is fraught with dangerous risks. Whoever is appointed to the position of general manager should devote his full time to the job, and should hold office for a minimum period of three years. </para>

                    <para>. - This  provision represents a complete departure from established practice. The Industrial Finance Department is part of the Commonwealth Bank organization which is to be controlled by the Governor ; yet the Governor will not have a voice in the appointment of the general manager. Differences of opinion may arise between the Governor and the general manager of the Industrial Finance Department, but the Governor will not be able to take disciplinary action against the general manager. The general manager will be at liberty to act entirely on his own authority. That may place the Governor in a most awkward situation. </para>

The position of general manager of the Industrial Finance Department is most important, and it is possible that the gen er al manager may be paid more than the Governor.

                    <para>. - Hitherto, the policy of the Government has been to bolster up large industries and to drive small industries out of existence. Does paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> mean that the Government has undergone a change of heart and in future will look after the interests of the small business man? For instance, if a man wants to start a small engineering establishment does paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> mean that all that he will have to do to obtain sufficient finance to enable him to purchase machinery and plant, and probably buildings also, will be to go to the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank and ask for the money ? I have always understood that a bank is an institution to provide finance for various purchases. Does paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> mean more than that the Industrial Finance Department will grant financial assistance to enable industrial undertakings to be established and developed? It would appear that this paragraph is redundant. But the most amazing of the three paragraphs is paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline></para>

Assistance during that period could take the form of providing advice as to the best means of floating a company and complying with the various formalities necessary before business could be commenced. The amendment is not acceptable to the Government. </para>

                    <para>##&gt;##.- This is probably the cleverest and most dangerous clause in the bill. It authorizes a departure from well-established banking practice. Under Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the bank is to have power to ##"## purchase or otherwise acquire shares and securities and sell or otherwise dispose of shares and securities so purchased and. acquired ##"##. Under clause 95 <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> advice is to be given about the formation of companies. This clause empowers the bank to acquire shares in a company. I suppose that the intention is that the bank shall acquire more than 50 per cent, of the shares of certain industrial undertakings, so that it will be able to control those undertakings. That is merely another method of socializing an industry. Ordinarily,  banks do not buy shares in industrial concerns. Indeed, the acquisition of shares is forbidden by the articles of association of most banks, except as collateral security, and then only for the purpose of selling them again. This is a new departure in share dealing .by the Commonwealth Government. _ Under this clause, the Government will be empowered to take over practically any industry.##'## I believe that in a later clause, or perhaps it is in a clause of another bill, it is provided that the bank shall not deal in shares which are sold on the stock exchange. I can understand a bank lending money to a manufacturer on the security of certain assets, but that a bank should acquire shares and retain them, thereby accepting hateful profits, is beyond my understanding. That is a departure from ordinary banking practice. If this provision does not give power to the Government to take over companies and factories, what does it mean? That is the only interpretation that I can place upon it. It is a dangerous provision which may involve the Commonwealth in heavy losses. I regard the clause as one of the worst in the measure. I should like the Minister to explain why the Government proposes to depart from ordinary banking practice by giving to the ##'##Commonwealth Bank the power provided under the clause.

                        <para>- Yes. Considerable doubt exists as to whether the Commonwealth has power to engage in industrial undertakings; but the clause gives to the bank, as an instrumentality of the Government, power to take complete control of industrial undertakings. That is a departure from normal banking practice. It seems that the Government intends to adopt the German method of industrial finance, which I need hardly point out will not be tolerated in this country. </para>

                    <para>.- The purpose of the clause is to enable the Industrial Finance Department to acquire shares in a company where circumstances indicate that that course is more advantageous than the making of a fixed loan. Shareholding confers certain rights which could be of assistance to the department in rendering assistance to clients. The amendment would tend to nullify the advantages of this procedure. Accordingly, it is considered that the Industrial Finance Department should not in any way be limited as to the period which it considers would be advantageous for it to hold shares in any company. </para>

The explanation just made by the Minister in charge of the bill bears out all that I have said to the effect that the Government intends to acquire shares in companies. Under the Constitution, the ##'##Commonwealth has no power to conduct private industries. I doubt very much whether this procedure will survive a test in the High Court. I should be very surprised -if the Government is not prevented from driving through the Constitution in this fashion. This provision is merely a subterfuge to enable the Government to get round the Constitution. In this instance, the Government is absolutely defying the verdict given by the people at the recent referendum, when, by a very large majority, they decided that the Commonwealth should not be given the very powers which the Government is taking under this measure. In effect, the Government says that despite the verdict of the people at the recent referendum it will acquire enterprises through this department which, under the bill will  be given power to purchase, own and conduct factories. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, the Government need only say that the proposal is concerned with banking. The Government, instead of bowing to the decision of the people at the recent referendum, as it would do if it were a democratic government, intends to defy the people in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I disagree with the Minister on that point. Under this provision the Commonwealth is likely to incur very serious losses. This provision represents the first step in a plan under which the Commonwealth is to own businesses and departments of businesses. Then, apparently, the Government proposes to poke its nose into industry to give advice upon manufacturing. Such an idea, of course, is preposterous, when it is clear that the Government, owing to faulty organization, is not able to cope with its own small problems. Although it recently announced that all service personnel who had been in the forces for five years would be released, it now finds that its organization is so faulty that it is unable to implement that decision. Despite these facts, however, it now proposes to enter upon industrial undertakings, and, as it were, teach its grandmother to suck eggs. I shall persist with my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the Minister to define ##"## Industrial Finance Department ##"##. I take the expression to mean industry as we generally understand the term, that is, secondary industry, such as factories and the like. I should like to know whether under this Part the bank will be empowered to finance persons for the purpose of setting up, say, drapery or grocery shops. I should like a clear definition of what the Industrial Finance Department will deal with. If it is only factories, that is one thing, but if it can embark on any enterprise that is something entirely different. </para>

                <para class="block">That means that the savings of the ##"## little people ##"## are to be risked in the most hazardous branch of the Commonwealth Bank##'##s operations. Their money is to be lent by the Savings Bank to the Commonwealth Bank for investment in crooked industrial undertakings run by a Government which cannot organize anything. We have been wondering whence the money for the operations of the Industrial Finance Department will come. Now we know. Tucked away in this clause, which is, I think, designedly far away from the clause setting up the Industrial Finance Department, is the provision that the savings of the people are to be hazarded, in operating the department most likely to incur losses. There are other dangers in this clause. For instance, it is provided that at no time shall outstanding advances exceed ##£##1,000,000. Then we have the provision that the Savings Bank##'##s funds, the deposits of, I repeat, the ##"## little people ##"##, whom the Labour party should cherish, are to be used to whatever degree the Government determines. The money that may be borrowed from the Savings Bank is unlimited. It would be a good thing if the funds of the Savings Bank could be invested in something tangible such as houses, rural credits, and mortgages, but to venture those funds in dubious undertakings like the aluminium industry, with losses staring us in the face, is beyond understanding. Capital invested in manufacturing enterprises is largely used in the purchase and installation of machinery. That machinery is bought at high prices, but immediately it is used it becomes second-hand, and, should the venture be a failure, the price it will command on the open market is very  often, only the price that scrap iron fetches. If the people stand for <inline font-style="italic">this</inline> they will stand for anything. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the most dangerous of all clauses relating to the Industrial Finance Department. The risking of the savings of the people is the manner envisaged is a flagrant departure from hanking practice, because not only will the money be tied up for indefinite periods but also the investment will be made in enterprises in which the risk is greater than usual. Particularly would that be so if the Industrial Finance Department were pressed into making advances to bolster up unsuccessful undertakings that the Government desired to keep afloat. In order to impress upon honorable senators the danger of that, I need only refer them to clause 9, which empowers the Government to force the bank to make loans which it may not favour. Investment of the people##'##s savings deposited in the Savings Bank in business undertakings is improper. Honorable senators opposite may talk until they are black in the face, but they will not convince me that it is not absolutely unsound to use savings bank deposits for the purposes set out in this Part.

                    <para>. - The industrial finance Part of this bill is certainly notable for its many mad clauses. This clause provides -  (1.) That the Bank shall not provide finance under this Fart for the establishment or development of an industrial undertaking, unless the Bank is satisfied that the industrial undertaking has reasonable prospects of continuing to be, or of becoming, a profitable undertaking. (2.) In determining whether or not finance shall be provided under this Part for the establishment or development of an industrial undertaking, the Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the undertaking continuing to be, or becoming, a profitable undertaking and shall not necessarily have regard to the present value of the assets of the undertaking. </para>

                        <para>- I have been in business for a long time, and if the proposals in the clause are not unsound business practice I do not know what is. The bank need not even value the asset before making an advance. All it has to do in order to justify an advance is to take into account the fact that ten, fifteen or twenty years later an enterprise may be worth money. Could there be anything more unsound than that? The Mortgage Bank Department is forbidden from making an advance of more than  70  per cent, of the value of the substantial asset represented in farm lands and may not make an advance on buildings or stock. </para>

The Minister said that although an undertaking might not be able to provide full security based on normal banking standards, with some assistance it might have every prospect of success. That, of course, implies pure speculation and not investment. . Worse still, it is speculation with trust money. If the trustee of an estate were to speculate in that manner with money in his keeping he could be sent to gaol. Trustees are permitted to invest only in certain securities prescribed by law; yet, under the industrial finance provisions of this measure, trust money - in the form, of the savings of the people - is to he used, for speculation.

Honorable senators opposite should be consistent. The aim of this provision is to make money available to small enterprises which##'## require funds to set them on their feet. </para>

                    <para>. - It is difficult to understand the Government##'##s inconsistency in the framing of certain clauses of this measure. Earlier to-day the committee discussed the activities of the Mortgage Bank Department, and we on this side of the chamber, argued that that department was completely out of step with all other similar lending institutions##'## and that the limit of advances should, be 80 per cent, and. not 70 per cent. This country depends upon its primary industries for its overseas funds, and for its solvency. Can there be anything more important from a national point of view than the making of advances to assist primary producers? The Government, in effect, is saying to primary producers : ##"## You need not turn to the Commonwealth Bank for assistance, because other banking institutions will give you more generous treatment ##"##. Yet this clause enables the Government to dabble  in private industry. Have the people of this country not had enough of government-controlled enterprises? In Queensland at one time many important industries were under government control, and to-d##'##ay the countryside is strewn with their wreckage. The Minister for Trade and Customs##'## <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> claims that the object of this clause is to enable the bank to assist the small business man to establish his undertaking on a firm foundation. To what ##"## small business man ##"## does he refer. Where does this clause provide that small industries shall be assisted? The attitude of the Government all along has been, to freeze small industries out of existence. The small business man has practically disappeared from the industrial landscape. </para>

The proposal to use the savings of the people in this manner cannot be justified. Those savings are held in trust for investment, but not speculation. Private individuals are prevented by law from handling trust funds in this manner, and the Government is establishing a dangerous precedent. Yet the Government, as trustee for the people of Australia, is prepared to speculate. with their money. I support the amendment. </para>

                        Hays has told us of the failures associated with government enterprise in Queensland, but he supported the establishment of an industry in Tasmania in which  ##£##3,000,000  of the people##'##s money will be invested. That industry must continue after the war. He has told us that the aluminium industry is to be set up in Tasmania because Australia is at war. It may be true that legislation for the establishment of that industry was introduced in war-time, but I should like the honorable senator to say whether he supports its maintenance as a peace-time industry. I remind him that considerable risks are associated with it. It is all right for the honorable senator to say that legislation to establish the aluminium industry is justified as a wartime measure, but he must realize that it must be continued after the war if the people are to receive back the  ##£##3,000,000  of public money which is at stake.

Honorable senators know that at one stage of the war aluminium was unobtainable in Australia. When the Aluminium Industry Bill was before the Senate I said that we should take steps to ensure that we should not again be in a position when aluminium was not available, and that whether the industry proved profitable or otherwise as a financial enterprise, the production of aluminium in this country was necessary in the interests of the nation.

                        <para>- In his heart I believe that the honorable senator would like advances to primary producers to be up to 100 per cent. of the value of their property, or even more. I suggest that it is because the bill does not make provision for limitless advances on rural properties that the honorable senator is opposing it. The opposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is understandable; he has voiced his real reasons for opposing it. The honorable senator has been in business for many years, and I believe is closely associated with ##"##big business##"##. Naturally, he does not desire to see on the statute-book legislation which will help small businesses to develop. The day of development has passed for the honorable senator and his friends, because they have already ##"##cornered ##"## all the markets that they wish to ##"##corner##"##. This bill makes provision for competitors, and for that reason the honorable senator is opposing it. ##"## Big business ##"## desires to reserve to itself the right to say what businesses shall be established and allowed to develop in this country. This clause takes from ##"## big business ##"## the right to dominate industry. The bill seeks to allow the development of industries free from the controlling influences of monopolies. We are living in an age of invention, in which improvements to existing means of production are made almost weekly. Let us suppose that some new process which will constitute a threat to existing big business concerns is invented. Under this clause, the inventor or those about to develop the new process, could go to the Commonwealth Bank for financial accommodation, and the bank, free from domination by ##"##big business##"## as when it was under a board, could grant their request. In that way a new industry could be established. I recognize that in opposing the bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is acting in the interests of those who sent him here, and who want to control the industries of this country by confining them to a comparatively few persons in the community. The Senate would do well to reject the amendment. </para>

The fact is, however, that since I became a member of the Senate my business has largely disappeared. I rose to say that in his anxiety to score against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> unwittingly made a disclosure which I expected to be made at some time, for he admitted that huge losses are likely to be incurred in connexion with the establishment of the aluminium industry in Tasmania.

We should bear in mind that the Industrial Finance Department will employ in its activities funds transferred from the savings bank, namely, the savings of the people. We must also remember that industrial undertakings, of all the undertakings which the bank will assist in the post-war period, will involve the greatest risk. Therefore, any provision that, in financing such concerns, the department shall not have regard primarily to the assets of the undertaking, is most dangerous.

Naturally, the bank, being obliged to carry out the orders of the Government, will endeavour to get the best officers available; hut where does it expect to get such experts? Is this provision designed to make jobs for large numbers of people who, since the outbreak of the war, have been running round in departments like the Departments for Munitions and Supply and Shipping giving advice to those engaged in industry as to how they should run their industry? During the war those little tin gods have had a good innings. Since the outbreak of war, artificial conditions have obtained in industry. However, to-day, those people are regarded as experts. Is it the object of the clause to provide jobs for these ##"## dud ##"## experts, and so remove the danger of their dismissal?

                <para class="block">It is gratifying to find that the Government intends to provide finance for building homes. The more agencies and institutions we have helping to solve the housing problem the better it will be for everybody. As the number of houses increase, rents will tend to fall. The Commonwealth Housing Act  1928,  which is repealed by this bill, made provision to allot finance to the instrumentalities I have mentioned. This clause seeks to delete that provision. Various official and semi-official estimates have been given of the number of homes required. Some estimates include families living in slum areas. Distressful though the conditions in those areas may be, the occupants have at least a home. I suggest that those without a home should be given priority. A scheme for the abolition of slum areas can be tackled later. The estimate that 300,000 homes are needed is probably nearer the mark, and that should be the first objective. In the years immediately preceding the outbreak of war, the average annual expenditure on home building was about ##£##27,000,000. Based on an average cost of ##£##900, the number of dwellings built was 30,000. At this rate it will take ten years to overtake the arrears caused mainly by the restriction of building for so long. That restriction was necessary so that men and materials could be conserved in the interest of the war effort. The marriages of hundreds of service personnel, and the unwillingness of scores of pre-war rural workers to return to the country after engaging in essential war industries in the capital cities, has swelled the number of homes necessary.With the decentralization of secondary industries and the brighter prospects of primary producers, homes must be built in country centres. That is why I suggest local governing authorities should be included in clause 108. </para>
                <para>It is useless to blame any particular government for the present deplorable housing situation. The problem must be tackled and solved no matter what government be in office now, or in the future. The appointment of a Minister for Housing is a step forward. But is the Minister to be hampered by the departments which control man-power and the release of building material? Restrictions were necessary during the peak period of the war, but surely the stage has been reached when a tapering-off policy should be adopted. The need to meet the accommodation requirements of the British Pacific Fleet is not a sufficient reason for failure to undertake a more vigorous housing programme. </para>
                <para>At the outbreak of the war 63,000 tradesmen were associated with the building industry. I do not know how many have been released from the fighting services and essential war industries. A strong suspicion exists that those who have been released are not being used in meeting the most vital problem confront ing the Government, that is in providing building material and erecting homes. </para>
                <para>Recently at a meeting of master builders and representatives of unions connected with the building industry, held at the Melbourne Town Hall, to which the general public were admitted, statements were made that there was no shortage of timber and that millions of feet of seasoned timber was stacked at certain railway stations in Gippsland and elsewhere in Victoria. No doubt there are similar stocks in other States. There was a shortage temporarily of certain other necessary materials which could be produced as soon as approval was given by the appropriate departments. I urge the Minister to accept my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The purpose of the amendment will be covered at a later stageby the signing of agreements between the Commonwealth Government and theState Governments which will provide for the needs of those sections of the community which the honorable senator seeks to cover in his amendment. The clause now before the committee is primarily designed to aid individuals apart from the organizations mentioned by the honorable senator. Up to the outbreak of the war, in New South Wales alone, co-operative building societies had expended about ##£##11,000,000 on the construction of homes. If I were a young man without money, and wanted to build a home which I could obtain at a cost of ##£##800 inclusive of the land, I should combine with my mates to form a cooperative society. To this society we would pay a small sum each week, until the total funds equalled one-tenth of the amount of capital required for the purchase of a home. When I obtained ##£##80 in that way, I would arrange through some banking or financial organization for the immediate construction of a home. The primary objective of the clause is to help individuals along those lines. The honorable senator##'##s amendment will be fully met under legislation which will be introduced at an early date to meet the requirements of bodies of the class he has mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the Minister that there is a difference between homes and farm lands, but I do not accept his inference that a home represents the better security. Farm lands should command higher advances than homes, but the Government is prepared to allow the bank to advance up to 85 per cent, of the value of a home, but only 70 per cent, of the value of a farm. Where is the consistency? The Government should reconsider the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> with the object of increasing the advances on mortgage to primary producers from 70 per cent, to 80 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Many large employers accept the risk in respect of workers##'## compensation insurance. For instance, the Victorian Railways Commissioners accept the risk in respect of their thousands of employees because it pays to do so, as the number of accidents involving their employees is insufficient to warrant the payment of huge sums in premiums to some insurance company. I understand that the Royal Automobile Club, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures have similar schemes. The provision is wise. The bank will be able to please itself whether it accepts the risk or not, I think it would be well advised to accept it because fire insurance is not a bad risk. Most fire insurance companies do very well. Of course, the risk varies  according  to circumstances, but there is not a great fire risk in homes. There is not the slightest doubt that the bank will do its best to protect the interests not only of the home-builder but also of the bank itself. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The policy of the Government envisages a big expansion of the Commonwealth Bank. By a process of infiltration and strangulation, . private trading banks will gradually disappear. A commencement in that direction was made soon after the present Government came into office, when approximately 500 country branches of the private banks were closed. Their business, substantially reduced because of the war, was transferred to city branches. When an inquiry was made as to the Government##'##s real objective, it was stated that the action was taken merely to conserve man-power. We know now that the intention is to keep these branches closed##'## permanently. In the near future, suburban branches also will cease to operate, and the same fate awaits city branches. With the cessation of hostilities against Japan, there will be a vast increase in banking business. What is to- become of private bank officials, of whom 8,884, out of 13,913, have served or are still serving in the fighting forces? Unfortunately, 474 have been killed. No doubt, the Commonwealth Bank, under its new regime, will select officials with banking knowledge, who for good and sufficient reason did not don the King##'##s uniform. Sub-clause 1 of this clause provides for such transfers or appointments, and that provision, read in conjunction with sub-clause 2 of clause 156, provides a loophole by means of which the bank may appoint persons who have not passed the prescribed entrance examination. </para>
                <para>I move this amendment to ensure that preference shall be given, not only to the ex-servicemen employed by the trading banks, but also to other ex-servicemen who, although they may never have been on a bank##'##s payroll, have special qualifications for positions in the Commonwealth Bank. The Minister, no doubt, will say that the provisions of the lie-establishment and Employment Act protect such persons, but that is not good enough. Up to the present, the Commonwealth Bank has been most sympathetic towards returned servicemen, but under the new regime there may he some doubt, and I want preference in employment in the enlarged Commonwealth Bank to be specified in clear and unmistakable terms. Under section  10  of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, the Commonwealth Bank is an employer, and it would be embarrassing to the Government, if a Commonwealth instrumentality like the bank had to pay a fine of  ##£##100  for contravening the provisions of that act. </para>
                <para>I am sure that honorable senators will appreciate the justice of, and necessity for, this additional sub-clause, and I hope the amendment will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- No, but the work of a bank officer is not so highly technical as some people would have us believe. It is work that can he carried out efficiently by the average young man or woman. During my association with the Australian Railways Union, I carried out banking work of all kinds without any difficulty, as did a score or more of young men in that organization. All this talk of great skill being required for bank work is rubbish. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to know why the present conditions for first appointment to the Conwnonwealth Bank are to be set aside. For 32 years, before a person could be admitted to the service of the bank he or she had to be in possession of the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate, and be recommended by three persons - a headmaster or headmistress, a clergyman, and a well-known citizen. ##'##So far as I have been able to ascertain, this system has worked satisfactorily. No one can truthfully say that, on the average, the appointees during that period were incompetent. What is to be the standard of the proposed entrance examination ? In what subjects will candidates be examined? Has the curriculum been made public yet? </para>
                <para>Clause 156 (1) (c) provides for open competition. Appointments are to be made in the order of merit in which those persons passed the examination. A certificate of one person - not three - as to character will be the deciding factor. That person may be the applicant##'##s uncle, or a political friend of the father. How different from three independent certificates, particularly when one is from a headmaster or headmistress who has had opportunities to assess the applicant##'##s character! </para>
                <para>It is contended that as there is a competitive entrance examination for the Commonwealth Public Service, there should also be one for the Commonwealth Bank, but the two services are totally different. Young men entering the bank service are prospective managers, assistant managers, or future occupants of positions requiring the specialized technique of hanking. From the first day that they enter the bank, training with that object in view commences. If a young man turns out to he a misfit, the bank will have to carry him; he will be a deadweight on the other bank officers. A youth entering the hank must have a reasonably high standard of education; he must also be of good character, and adaptable. For entrance to the Commonwealth Public Service also, a reasonably high standard of education and good character are necessary. Having these two qualifications, the successful candidate in the competitive examination is appointed. Should he prove to be a misfit, or unadapted to his first position, he can be allotted to one of scores of other positions in the Public Service until he finds his niche. In the bank service that cannot be done. Every possible precaution has to be taken to ensure that from the commencement of his. service the confidence of his seniors in the young fellow##'##s ability to rise in the service of the bank shall he unshaken. The passing of an academic examination after months of cramming, together with a certificate from one person, is not a substitute for the present policy for first appointments. Strong exception is  taken to one person making a recommendation as to character.  My  amendment will make it obligatory to secure certificates from three persons. </para>

                    <para>. - I  support the amendment. So far as I know, bank officials, unlike officers of the Taxation Department, are not sworn to secrecy, and, accordingly, it is important that only persons of good character, who are not likely to disclose the business of the customers of the bank, shall be appointed. I lay some stress on this point, because character is important. It may be easy to get a certificate from one person. Every member of Parliament knows how difficult it is to refuse to sign a recommendation in favour of some person of whom he has little knowledge. The amendment is on right lines. </para>

In the service of the Commonwealth Bank there are many worthy people who are classified as temporary employees. Among them are returned soldiers employed as liftmen, attendants and cleaners, who have been in the service of the bank for from ten to twenty years. A person who has been in the employ of the bank for more than five years should be appointed to the permanent staff, and be entitled to all the privileges associated with permanency. As under this clause appointment can be made to the staff without examination, I hope that the Minister will take steps to make many of these worthy people permanent employees. </para>

I should imagine that the objective would be to keep or retain in the bank##'##s services all officers capable of doing their jobs. Why should we differentiate between a single girl and a married girl when both are equally capable of doing this work? The Government apparently does not desire to see large numbers of women employed on work of this kind. Bearing in mind modern conditions, this is rather a severe differentiation. </para>

In order to make this power effective, it is necessary to penalize failure to attend when summoned and the giving of false evidence. Hence, it is necessary to empower the inclusion of penalties in the regulations. </para>

                        <para>.- Consideration of this clause was postponed to enable the definition of ##"## bank ##"## to be examined. This has now been done and I am advised that the definition in its present form is satisfactory and not likely to cause any difficulty. The definition says that ##"##bank##"## means a person carrying on the business of banking. By reason of the diversity of banking business, it is difficult to define explicitly what is comprehended in the term ##"## business of banking##"##. Whether or not an institution is carrying on the business of banking is a question of fact which can only be determined by examining the facts of each particular case. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>On the few occasions on which the expression ##"## bank ##"## is used in the bill, there would not be any difficulty in applying the definition. For instance, under clause 36 provision is made whereby the Commonwealth Bank may act as the agent of any bank. Under clause 38 the Commonwealth Bank may enter into arrangements with another bank to take over that other bank##'##s business. In each of those cases there would be no difficulty in determining whether or not a particular institution was or was not a bank, that is, whether it was or was not carrying on banking business. </para>
                <para>It should be remembered that this bill relates to the Commonwealth Bank and not to the trading banks. In the Banking Bill, which deals with the trading banks, a different definition of ##"## bank ##"## is used. The word is there defined as meaning a body corporate authorized under that act to carry on banking business in Australia. There will be no difficulty, therefore, in identifying the banks to which the Banking Bill applies. It would be a mistake to think that the definition of ##"## bank ##"## in this bill operates for the purposes of the Banking Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - As I thought the ##"## bank ##"## means any institution that the Commonwealth Bank chooses to designate as a bank. And it will designate as a bank any institution), individual or company which is likely to take business away from it. Thus, we are now back where we started. Under this measure, and the Banking Bill, the Government itself will have power to declare what is a bank. Parliament is not to be consulted on the matter. The Commonwealth Bank - and that means the Treasurer of the day - will have the right to say what is a bank. The Government##'##s purpose is to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank shall have no rival in its field. I despair of getting anything more satisfactory from the Minister. The definition reflects the totalitarian and dictatorial attitude of the Government towards every person or thing with which it has anything to do. </para>
