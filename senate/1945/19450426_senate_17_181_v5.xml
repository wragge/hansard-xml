                    <para>. - I second tie motion. The news of the death at a comparatively early age of the Honorable Thomas Joseph Collinscame  as a great shock to all who knew him. He had a striking and pleasing personality, and many members of this Parliament, including myself, are indebted to him because of the fact that on many occasions drab moments have been brightened by his interesting and cheerful conversation. I have met only one other man who possessed personal gifts similar to those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins.</inline> He also had an extraordinary love of Australian poetry, and his ability to recite the works of Australian poets in a most pleasing voice was remarkable. We regard his deathas a great personal loss. Apart from his many social qualities he was a man of shrewdness and common sense. He knew the people of his electorate well, and he was well acquainted with the needs of the people of Australia. He was a true Australian, and one of those bright spirits whom this country can ill afford to lose. He took a deep interest and played an active part in public life andwas agreeable in all his personal and social relationships. I join with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> in expressing deep regret at his passing, and our sincere sympathy with his widow and daughter in their bereavement. </para>

                    <para>-The members of the Australian Country party in the Senate desire to associate themselves with the motion. They deeply regret the death, in the prime of life, of a man of the calibre of the late Honorable Thomas Joseph Collins. The deceased gentleman was an active member of the Australian Country party, and during his term as member for Hume he held ministerial rank. He lived in close contact with the country people whom he represented, and at all times he made it his business to be well informed in connexion with the problems which affected them. He endeavoured always to improve their conditions. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> had a likeable personality, and made friends wherever he went; yet he had strong and firm convictions and was a staunch fighter for the principles which he believed to be right. As a Minister he travelled extensively, and his passing will he mourned by many personal friends throughout the Commonwealth. The members of the </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - During the debate on the motion for the adjournment on the 7 th March last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> made representations in relation to the appointment to the permanent staff of the Commonwealth Public Service of certain meat inspectors employed by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture on a temporary basis. The matter has been referred to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who replied to the honorable senator by letter indicating that the policy being followed by the Public Service Board during the war is to avoid making permanent appointments. When appointments of meat inspectors are made, any suitably qualified persons will be entitled to apply and preference in employment must, in accordance with the law, be given to returned soldiers. Permanent employment does not follow as a natural corollary to temporary employment. The matter of making some permanent appointments has been noted for consideration when circumstances will permit, and it is pointed out that temporary employees retained for lengthy periods may be granted superannuation benefits and furlough in accordance with legislation enacted by the present Government. </para>

                <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire to make a personal explanation. In the House of Representatives a statement has been made, and reported in the press, that the itinerary of my visit to New Guinea shows that I did not visit the forward areas where it was very dangerous indeed to go, that I remained in Soraken for only 90 minutes, and that the whole of my time in operational areas seems to have been spent with generals and not with the rank and file. It w as also stated that I did not go near the troops in the Torricelli Ranges, and that I arrived at Lae three hours late and refused to interview the troops there. As t here is no truth in these statementsI desire, for the protection of my own good name, which to me is of great value, to state the facts. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It has been suggested that duringmy visit to the northern battle areas I did not carry out either the letter, or the spirit, of the Prime Minister&#39;s message, the terms of which honorable senators will be fully aware. My conscience is quite clear that at all places which I visited I carried out to the best of my ability, both the letter and the spirit of the Prime Minister&#39;s message. If I did not see every soldier in those areas, it was because that was physically impossible; but I saw as many soldiers as I possibly could in every area I visited. I had previously advised the General Officer Commanding the Second Australian Army that it was my desire that no formal parades, or gatherings, of troops should be arranged at any area to be visited by me, because I was aware that if such action were taken, it would be used by unprincipled persons, and for political reasons, to endeavour to prove that the evidence heard by me had been prearranged by those in authority. As the troops in the areas which I visited can testify, I walked among them unaccompanied by staff or regimental officers, and talked with them freely about their problems. I endeavoured to create an unofficial and informal atmosphere, and from the reception given to me by the lads, I am satisfied that this was achieved. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested also that I arrived at Lae three hours behind schedule, and informed 300 troops who had been paraded to speak to me that it was very late and I was very weary, and that I spoke to only one soldier and went on my way. The fact is that my timetable was adhered to throughout the whole period, with the exception of my visit to Lae, when because of following winds from Atherton to Nadzab, which is the airport for Lae, I arrived ahead of schedule and with the General Officer Commanding the First Australian Army, proceeded immediately to his headquarters for lunch according to arrangement. At no time during my visit to Lae, or any other operational area, did &#91; state that I was weary or too tired to speak to any troops, although I may say there were many occasions when such a statement would have been quite correct. Honorable senators know full well that I have the interests of our fighting lads far too much at heart to treat them in the manner which has been indicated. As various allegations of waste and extravagance have been made regarding the headquarters at Lae, it was only natural that my first action on arrival there would be to investigate these matters. My report, which will be made available to the public, will give the results of these investigations. I was not so greatly concerned with the general conditions at Lae as with conditions in the actual battle areas. There appears to be some misconception in regard to Lae, which is the head-quarters and main base of the First Australian Army. Even by the greatest stretch of the imagination this centre cannot be deemed to be a battle area, the nearest of which - New Britain - is 375 miles distant. However, I visited a number of the base units, including the hospital, and conferred freely with the men. I also visited the men&#39;s club at the time of the evening meal and spoke to a number of men there. Subsequently I visited the hospital and spoke to members of the Army Nursing Medical Services. Compared with men serving in actual battle areas, the men at the base at Lae are well off and should have little cause for complaint. </para>
                <para>I wish to refer now to the allegation that I did not visit the troops in the forward battle areas. My itinerary shows that on the 10th April, I left  Torokina  in Bougainville, at 7 a.m. and reached the  Soraken  Peninsula at 12.30 p.m. This involved a five-hours&#39; journey over open seas in a small motor launch, and a return later on the same day when the seas had become rougher, and therefore the journey occupied a longer period. While on the  Soraken  Peninsula, I interviewed in the forward area a number of men of a battalion which had been in action against the Japanese in that locality only seven days previously. The evening before, .the area had been shelled and the commanding officer had narrowly escaped a direct hit. I then proceeded by jeep to the mountain battery, 7 miles distant, and this battery was in action against the enemy during the whole period of my visit. At .the 19 th Field Ambulance station adjacent to the area, I spoke to sick and wounded soldiers, some of whom had been wounded in action during the previous 24 hours, and were awaiting transport by launch to the main base hospital at  Torokina.  I spoke also to engineers working at the limits of the jeep line in that locality, and to members of a patrol returning after three days in the ranges. I also saw the field bakery, where bread was being wrapped in waterproof paper for native carriers to take it over the native tracks to the forward patrols a few miles distant. </para>
                <para>It has been stated also that I did not see any of the fighting troops in the Torricelli Ranges. The itinerary itself proves this to be wrong. On the 12th April, after an hour&#39;s journey from Lae to Nadzab, I left by Liberator for the Tadje aerodrome, arriving at 11.20 a.m., journeying thence to Aitape. After a quick lunch I proceeded by launch over the open ocean to But, some 60 miles distant, a trip which took three hours. On arrival at But, which had been in the hands of the enemy only ten days previously, I noticed signs of battle everywhere. Japanese motor vehicles were strewn beside the roadways and destroyed Japanese aircraft lying in great number, around the Tocal airstrip. After a night at But I proceeded further towards the operational areas and spoke to troops who had been in active fighting and were thus in the best position of all the troops I had visited to speak of actual fighting conditions. These men gave me their first-hand observations. </para>
                <para>I regret that it has been necessary to make this personal explanation, because it was my desire not to speak of matters such as these, but to give my studied views on the matters which I went to the battle areas to investigate. I have the greatest respect and admirationfor our fighting troops, and I have no wish to create the impression that I have, in any way, encountered the dangers and difficulties which these gallant boys have had to face; but I have felt impelled to answer the allegations that have been made concerning my visit to the battle areas. In conclusion I say with feeling and with pride that there are no cowards in my family. </para>

                            <para>A few alien doctors have been appointed as ActingRepatriation Local Medical Officers in certain country districts,  as  they are the only medical practitioners available in those districts. To give the assurance required by the honorable senator would mean that ex-members of the forces who reside in such districts would be deprived of immediate and easilyaccessible medical attention. It  is  pointed out that, in every instance, these doctors are legally qualified medical officers according  to  the law of the State in which they are permitted to practise. It will be seen that  it  was not possible,  in  the circumstances, to avoid the appointment of these doctors. For the information of the honorable senatorI should state that local medical officers do not assess pensions and that their duties are primarily the treatment of war disabilities and the supply of such clinical data as is required  for  consideration by the department, and, especially its medical officers. </para>

                            <para>Yes. The ex-soldier referred to was discharged in October, 1941, on account of hysteria, and was granted a war pension. The Discharging Medical Board made no recommendation as to the need for treatment at the time, but he was notified how he could obtain treatment if he required it. This man re-enlisted in January, 1942, under an assumed name, and was discharged in September, 1942, again on account of hysteria. Since his second discharge he has received short periods of inpatient treatment. He was considered by the alienist in September last to be suffering from hysterical episodes complicated with alcohol. There is no evidence to show that this man was wrongfully discharged from the forces. Treatment is available as and when necessary,but it should be remembered that theRepatriation Commission has no power to compel an exsoldier, under these circumstances, to undergo treatment or to continue treatment. </para>

                    <para>. - 1 realize, of course, that it is inevitable that this motion should be made and carried. In the circumstances, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> cannot do other than propose an adjournment, because there is no further business before the Senate. Honorable senators are asked to show a great deal of amused toleration at the spectacle of being called together from various parts of Australia, meeting for a little over half an hour in <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> week, adjourning for nearly a fortnight, and in the meantime returning to their homes in the far corners of the Commonwealth. This situation displays ineptitude oil the part of the Government. Within the last hour I have seen honorable senators arriving here in hot haste ready for business, but some of them, will probably leave Canberra by tra.in this afternoon, and practically no business will have been transacted by the Senate. <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> that the kind of business management to be displayed by this Government? Why wore honorable senators brought back  this  week? Surely the Government must have known that no business would have been available for the Senate for some time. Prior to the previous adjournment we were assured that, legislative measures would await our attention upon our return to Canberra, but the net result is nhat we have no more work to do than we had when we last adjourned. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I realize that the Leader of the Senate lias no measures to put before us, and that we may as well return to our homes; but, on behalf of members of the Opposition, I protest against the treatment that we have received. Even in the present circumstances, when it was found that no business would be received from the House of Representatives, there was surely some  scope  for discussion in the Senate on the matters at present engaging the attention of the House of Representatives. Considering the fact that -the Acting Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> had submitted a report to the Government concerning the equipment of the Australian troops in the New Guinea area, I see no reason why a discussion should not have been initiated in this chamber regarding that matter. Honorable senators might even have discussed the pro nouncements being made by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to the people of Great Britain, and might have considered to what degree his statements contrasted with the opinion held in the Senate. From whatever point of view we regard the situation, the fact remains that we have been summoned to Canberra without having any legislative business to consider, and we have been deprived of an opportunity for a full discussion on world affairs, and particularly matters connected with the war, which are exercising the minds of the people. The members of this chamber have not had an opportunity to debate foreign affairs for a considerable period, yet at this very time representatives of Australia artattending a conference overseas for the discussion of matters of great international significance. I protest against the methods of the Government which have made this adjournment necessary, and I hope that the protest, will be supported by honorable senators generally. We desire to do the work which we have been sent here to do, but we do not wish to be brought here on a fool&#39;s errand and find that there is nothing for us to do. It is time for honorable senators on both sides of the chamber to take steps to ensure that the business of the nation is properly managed. As I have already stated, I am not blaming the Leader of the Senate personally for this predicament. I realize that he has to do what his colleagues in. the other chamber decide, but in the interests of the Senate and of the country it is important that the business of this chamber shall be carried on in a business-like way. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie).</inline> Like him, I do not blame the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> for what has occurred, but I emphasize that in respect of practically all legislation the powers of the Senate are equal to those of the. House of Representatives. The status of the Senate in the minds of the people depends largely upon its members. There are five Ministers in the Senate, and about the same number of exMinisters on the Opposition benches. There is. therefore, no good reason why more bills should not be introduced in this chamber. The present practice is for practically all legislation to be initiated in the House of Representatives. That is a disadvantage to the country. I realize that measures dealing with financial matters must be introduced in the other chamber, but that qualification does not apply to such measures as the Reestablishment and Employment Bill. Nor can it be said that there are not among honorable senators men capable of dealing with that measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> for instance, was Minister for Repatriation in a previous government, and could put the view of the Opposition. In the interests, not only of the Senate but also of the country as a whole, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to consult with his colleagues in the other chamber in this matter, so that the Senate may fulfil its obligations as an equal partner with the House of Representatives in the legislative life.of this country. </para>

                <para>- I support the protest voiced by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie),</inline> and, with him, express regret that the report which was furnished to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> recently by the Acting Minister for the Army (SenatorFraser), following his recent visit to forward operational areas, has not been made available for discussion in this chamber, particularly as it was here that the matter was first given the publicity which led to the Prime Minister sending his colleague to make investigations on his behalf.We in this chamber are just as keen as are members of the House of Representatives that the right thing shall be done. I am confident that the Government has no desire to restrict debate in this chamber on Army matters, particularly as a Senate Minister, for whom all honorable senators have great respect, visited operational areas on behalf of the Prime Minister. I hope that when the Senate resumes its sittings an opportunity will begriven to discuss the report of the Acting Minister for the Army. </para>

                <para>I also express regret that the Department of the Army has not made available answers to questions asked some weeks ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and myself in relation to matters which we consider to be of great importance. I know that departments generally are busy, but there has been too much delay in supplying answers to questions. After a fairly long adjournment, honorable senators were justified in expecting that answers would be supplied to all questions which had appeared on the notice-paper. I do not blame Senate Ministers for the delay, particularly as the Minister for Health (SenatorFraser) is only acting on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> who is absent from Australia. I am particularly interested in the question relating to the activities of Australian fighting services abroad which I placed on the notice paper. Every day we read in our newspapers of the doings of famous British regiments, and of the exploits of Russian leaders- </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - When the Senate rose for the Easter adjournment, I deliberately moved that the adjournment be to a date to be fixed, because I knew that the House of Representatives would have before it certain legislation which could not be ready for the Senate if both Houses were to resume on the same day. Some progress has been made in the other chamber with the Government&#39;s legislative programme, but, unfortunately, bills which it was thought would be available for discussion here to-day have not yet reached the Senate; I refer to theWool Use Promotion Bill and two measures dealing with income tax. Other business has interfered with the Government&#39;s programme, and the result is, as the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> has said, that the Senate is a chamber without business to transact. I have had a conference with Ministers in the other House, and can say definitely that when the Senate resumes its sittings on Tuesday week there will be some business .to transact. After that, however, there will probably be a fairly long adjournment because the legislation to be dealt with in the other chamber will involve lengthy debates. Honorable senators will realize that the discussion of such measures as the Government&#39;s proposals for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, its banking legislation, and its proposals in respect of insurance, may occupy some weeks in the House of Representatives. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays that more legislation should be initiated in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- No; they are urgent measures which the Government is anxious to have placed on the statute-book as soon as possible. Those bills will be ready for discussion by the Senate on Tuesday week. T agree that more legislation could be initiated in this chamber and passed on to the House of Representatives. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Eraser)</inline> has in preparation a bill to consolidate all social service legislation now on the statute-book; that measure will be introduced in this chamber before going to the House of Representatives. The present position arises because it has been the rule for very many years to initiate nearly al! legislation in the House of Representatives. I do not agree with that system. 1 shall take an early opportunity to discuss the whole matter with the Prime Minister. However, I was more than careful to arrange an adjournment which would enable me to have business ready for the Senate when it reassembled. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to revert to the matter I raised earlier, namely, the desirability of- publicking the activities of Australian troops engaged in the New Guinea area. Owing to the publicity given to the exploits of the armies of our gallant allies, and their leaders, on the Western and Eastern fronts many of their names are becoming household words in Australia. That, of course, is very desirable. At the same time, however, no publicity is being given to the exploits of Australian troops now engaged in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville. This lack of publicity has a very unfortunate effect so far as Australia itself is concerned. I venture to say that as the result of thu publicity given to the activities of Marshal Zhukov and other famous Russian generals, Field-Marshal <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bernard</inline> Montgomery, the Allied Corn.manderinChief, General Eisenhower, and Generals Patton and Bradley, the average Australian child knows more about those commanders than they do about, any leader of our own troops, with the possible exception of our Commander-in-Chief, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, who  ha3  figured in the press, somewhat unfavorably, during the last few months. I fail to see how security considerations should prevent us from making known the activities of various Australian units fighting in the New Guinea area. The excellent publicity given to the exploits of Australians when they captured Bardia, Tobruk, and other centres in the North African campaign, reflected considerable credit upon Australia and gained much valuable publicity for this country. To-day, however, the exploits of our troops are not being publicized either here or abroad. At the same time, we read about the exploits of specific British units, .such as the Guards Battalion, the Sherwood Foresters and . other famous regiments, of which, with the Motherland, we are equally proud. The same kind of publicity should be given to Australian units fighting in the New Guinea area. What harm can be done to our war effort simply by giving publicity to some of their exploits? Such publicity would help to build up our morale, and also provide an excellent advertisement forthis country overseas. In lastSunday&#39;s issue of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> I read an interview by an Australian journalist with  Colonel McCormick,  the notorious American isolationist and newspaper owner. In that interview,  Colonel McCormick  was critical of the part being played in the war by Australian troops. I know, of course, that that gentleman is notoriously antiBritish. The point I make is that the absence of publicity concerning the activities of our soldiers gives to such men opportunities to indulge in that kind of criticism, whilst it makes more difficult the task of our friends who wish to defend our position. Our soldiers themselves are very proud of their respective units. That fact is clear from the popularity of Anzac re-unions when the men foregather with other members of their old units. Members of various units also hold independent re-unions from time to time. I know that many brigades and battalions have gained a reputation for exploits in the north. The men and leaders of our Army should be given full credit for their exploits. I am reminded that this course is followed in respect of units of the American forces fighting in the Philippines. Communiqu&#233;s from that area deal separately with the exploits of sections of those forces as well as giving full publicity to the leaders of the respective sections. Our allies, obviously, do not regard such publicity as detrimental to their security. Our failure to give similar publicity to the activities of Australian troops has contributed largely to the misunderstanding which is apparent in the United States of America with respect to the part which Australians are playing in battle zones at present. I havemy own personal opinion regarding the wisdom of utilizing Australian troops in certain areas in which they are now engaged, but that is beside the point.I again urge the Leader of the Senate to bring this matter to the notice of the Prime Minister. </para>

                <para>When the Leader of the Senate was replying to remarks made earlier, he did not say whether it is the intention of the Government to give the Senate an opportunity to debate the report presented by the Acting Minister for the Army (SenatorFraser) to the Prime Minister relating to the equipment of Australian troops in northern operational areas. In view of the statement of the Leader of the Senate that he did not expect to have very much business for the Senate upon its resumption, we should be given an opportunity to debate that very important subject. I do not suggest that we fee given that opportunity merely in order to enable honorable senators on this side to voice grievances. Such a debate would give an opportunity to the Government to clarify points raised by all honorable senators. Therefore, I ask that the Senate be given full opportunity to debate the matter when we resume our sittings. </para>

                    <para>. - I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Eraser)</inline> to the present serious plight of the dairying industry. This matter has been brought to the notice of the Government on many occasions during the last three or four years, but it must be obvious to every one who studies the position that the industry is going from bad to worse. To-day, we find that a great primary-producing country like Australia is threatened with a very acute shortage of dairy products. Prices are the cause of the problem. Had action been taken not only by this Government but also by its predecessor to ensure that those established in the industry received a reward comparable with that received by labour in other industries, our dairy farmers would not find themselves in their present deplorable position. The problem of an adequate supply of fresh milk is extremely urgent. Something must be done immediately to assist milk producers. In the interests of this country it is vital that action be taken. There is no substitute for fresh milk. On behalf of the dairying industry protests have been made from time to time to the Prices Commissioner and in this Parliament, but without avail. In my view the only remedy for the present position is to give to the people engaged in this industry a reward for their labour more in keeping with the return obtained from other forms of primary production. Obviously when dairy farmers find that they can obtain 100 per cent. more income with less labour by undertaking other farming activities, such as the growing of crops, they see no reason why they should continue producing milk, the return from which is much less than it was before the&#34; war taking into consideration costs of production. Very commendably, the Government is paying a subsidy to dairy farmers, but the result has not been good enough to warrant the complacency which is exhibited by honorable senators opposite. This country is committed to send large quantities of dairy products overseas, and should the present trend continue we might well find that there will be a shortage of milk and butter for our own people. An adequate supply of fresh milk is an absolute necessity, particularly to city dwellers. The position must not be allowed to deteriorate any further. It has been growing worse steadily from week to week. We are informed now that it may be necessary in the near future to ration milk even more severely than it is rationed at. present. </para>

                        <para>-I am referring to the dairying industry as a whole, but particularly to the supply of milk. Requests by milk producers have been refused by the Prices Commissioner on the ground that an increase of the price of milk, if granted, would automatically bring about an increase of costs of production generally. It must be clear, however, that although the Government may be able to prevent dairy farmers from securing an increased return for their products, it has no power to compel these people to continue dairy farming. The result will be that more and more dairy farmers will turn to other more remunerative lines of production and sell their dairy herds for beef. What can we do to rehabilitate and resuscitate this industry? </para>

                        <para>- We can encourage increased production only by ensuring a higher return to the producer. To-day the main concern of milk consumers, and, in fact, of consumers of many other commodities, is not the price but theshortage of supplies. The motorist is concerned not with the price of petrol but with the possibility of getting more of it. Consumers are not greatly interested in the price of milk because that is taken into consideration in determining the cost of living. We must take steps to ensure that sufficient milk will be produced not only to satisfy the minimum requirements of the people of this country, but also to safeguard their health. Therefore, the matter is one that must be given early attention by the Government. As I have said, the remedy is to make the industry more profitable, and so to ensure not only that farmers now engaged in this important, avenue of primary production shall continue this work, but also that others who have abandoned dairying in favour of more profitable activities will restore their dairy herds. </para>

                    <para>. -I wish to bring to the notice of the Government a matter which is causing great concern, namely, the work undertaken at Australia House, London. RecentlyI have come in contact with many servicemen and civilians who have returned from Great Britain, and they all complain of the lack of courtesy and information at Australia House. They all agree that Australia House has become too &#34; Londonified &#34;, and that those in authority at: that centre have been there too long and have lost their Australian point of view, with the result that they have little sympathy with Australians who continually are seeking information and assistance. Allied to this matter is the appointment of a new Australian High Commissioner in London. I believe that any one who has held that position for more than a decade must have losttouch with the Australian outlook. It is advisable, therefore, that future appointments should be for a shorter duration, so that the holder of that important office will not lose touch with the Australian Government and people and with Australian conditions. </para>

                <para>That leads me to another important matter, the transport to this country of the wives of Australian servicemen.I have been informed that there are between 400 and 500 wives of Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen in England awaiting an opportunity to come to Australia. That is very bad from all points of view. Many statements have been made about the need to encourage migration, and here we have migrants of the most desirable kind - &#39;those whom young Australian heroes have selected for themselves. Yet very little is being done to help them to come to Australia to make their homes. The delay is also having a bad effect on many young men who arc expecting to leave soon for northern battle areas, and who want to see their wives settled in Australia before they go. The housing shortage is acute in Australia, but, it is more acute in Great Britain. &#34;We would do the Mother Country a service if <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> relieved it, of the accommodation problem created by these 400 or 500 young women who are anxious to start life in Australia. Every means possible should be used to expedite their transportation to this country. In the meantime, they should be shown the utmost courtesy and consideration at Australia House, London. If Australia is to maintain its reputation for hospitality and courtesy, the employees at Australia House should be inculcated with those virtues. </para>

                    Hays referred to the dairying industry. As he knows, a great deal of attention has been given to the industry. The colossal amount of nearly &#163;13,000,000 has been devoted to its assistance, an award has been made for men engaged in the industry, and the Commonwealth Food Control is keeping the position under observation continuously.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline>
                    Hays contended that higher prices should be paid for dairy products. I remind him that the Prices Commissioner must have a hand in this matter, and rightly so, particularly as the dairying industry is being raked fore and aft, both in relation to production and distribution. Its problems have caused a lot of trouble. Dairy products are now bringing the highest prices ever paid in Australia&#39;s history. &#39;Nevertheless, the. milk suppliers of New South Wales were  had enough to go on strike. The Government told them that a strike would not be tolerated, and they are at work to-day. Milk suppliers in Tasmania also proposed to go on strike and action had to be taken to prevent them from doing so. I undertake to confer with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
