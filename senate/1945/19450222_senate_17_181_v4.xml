The Government is taking every precaution to ensure that discharged servicemen, if they were in business prior to their enlistment, are provided with sufficient rationed goods to enable them to re-open those businesses. In other cases we are endeavouring to give every consideration to the claims of the men, even though they were not in business prior to the war. </para>

I have heard no complaints about lack of equipment, either personal or mechanical, for members of the Australian forces. It may be that in some parts of New Guinea the use of picks and shovels is found necessary. I have seen something of the work carried out by our engineers in the early stages of this war, and it stands as a monument to their ability. We have since improved on the equipment used at the outset. If the honorable senator desires further information on the matter I shall take steps to obtain it for him. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">M.y officers have made raids on some of these hotels in New South "Wales and prosecutions are to be instituted immediately. That is one aspect of the matter. Another is the fact that beer, in common with many other commodities, being in short supply leads to black marketing. The Government has no complaint against the brewers of Australia or against organizations like the United Licensed Victuallers Association, which helps the Government in every way; but there are still scoundrels conducting hotels in this country who should be put out of business. That matter, of course, i3 covered largely by State laws under which hotelkeepers are licensed and their trading hours are fixed. For the last few years the Commonwealth Government has tried to spread fairly the supply of liquor throughout Australia, and to some degree it has been successful; but the people generally have had more money to spend in recent years than formerly, and they are wanting more liquor than previously. The quantity consumed, apart from wines and spirits, is 7,200,000 gallons a month. That has not been exceeded during the last two years. Australia is consuming beer at the rate of 94,000,000 gallons a year. "Wine also is in short supply, whilst supplies of overseas whisky have practically been exhausted, and Australian whisky cannot be sold until it has matured for a certain period. A special squad to police the liquor laws has operated for the last six or eight months, during which period it has discovered numerous cases of shocking practices associated with the liquor traffic. Unfortunately, we are greatly handicapped at times by stupid magistrates, who do not seem to realize the gravity of these offences; when appeals have been made to a higher court the decision has, in some instances, been given against the department. On one occasion when certain offenders in Sydney were fined heavily and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, an appeal to a higher court resulted in their release. They are now laughing at the Administration. The system of control which has been, in operation in New South Wales was recently extended to Queensland with the result that numbers of black market cases have been listed for hearing in that </para>
                    <para class="block">State. Similar action is being taken by the officers of my department in Victoria. Honorable senators may not be aware that "the price at- which liquor is sold is a matter for the Prices Commissioner; other matters relating to the control of liquor are dealt with by the excise officers of my department. The officers of the departments concerned work reasonably well together, and I hope for an early improvement of the existing conditions. The fact that large numbers of service personnel of an Allied nation have left Australia has removed one form of abuse; while they were in Australia American fighting men were sold some frightful liquor at exorbitant prices. The average Australian would not be so easily duped. In this connexion, I remind the Senate that large numbers of British Army and Naval personnel whose rate of pay is not high are in Australia, and will, no doubt, desire liquor. Their presence in Australia presents a further problem to my officers in reserving for them a reasonable supply of liquor under fair selling conditions. Another problem is the production of barley to make malt. I assure honorable senators that the control of liquor is one of the most worrying aspects of administration, but the matter is being handled as fairly as possible. </para>

I now ask him whether ho was correctly reported in the press, soon after his return to Australia from America, as saying that lie thought Australia's liquor laws, particularly those providing for the closing of hotels at C o'clock, were absurd, and also whether he is aware that the approach of the closing hour may force men belonging to British forces to obtain the liquor that they desire in a short period, which does not permit them to drink in comfort? Will the Government make representations to the State controllers of the liquor traffic with a view to improving conditions in areas where British servicemen congregate when on leave, at least for the duration of the war ? </para>

                            <para>- When I returned from the United States of America, I did say that, in my opinion, the licensing hours in Australia were absurd and that the system of licensing was wrong. I expressed the view that it should be mandatory for those who sell drink to sell food also, and that men who had partaken of a dry lunch should not be forced, because of the early closing of hotels, to drink under conditions which would not only injure their health but also cause unhappiness to their families. In my opinion, this is a subject for discussion at a Premiers Conference; but I recall that on a former occasion when I brought it forward at a conference of Premiers, my proposal was defeated. I was amazed at the attitude adopted on that occasion by the State Premiers. I mention that incident in order to show the difficulties confronting the Government in administering the liquor laws. The greatest evil is associated with the sale of liquor in hotel lounges. In New York hotels remain open from8 a.m. till 4 a.m. on the following day, but notwithstanding the existence of 53,000 hotels in that city, I noticed no abuses while I was there. An army of inspectors works day and night to ensure compliance with the regulations. Honorable senators may be interested to know that no barmaids are employed in New York hotels, and that the control of liquor there is such that a man can obtain wholesome food and drink almost at any time of the day or night, under proper conditions. I visited most of the large cities of the United States of America, but I did not see more than one or two persons under the influence of liquor, although I was on the lookout for them. On my homeward trip, I called at Honolulu when there were at least 7,000 American bluejackets ashore. As the result of my observations, I am happy to say that those men were a credit to the American Navy; there was no insobriety. </para>

When that time comes, the obligation will be on this National Parliament to ensure that when the men and women now with the forces return, after having done their job, they will be afforded an opportunity to take their proper place as citizens, in accordance with the ideals for the preservation of which they have fought so heriocally and tenaciously. </para>

                    Royal Highness' intimated that the Government intended to introduce comprehensive legislation for the reestablishment in the life of the nation of members of the forces. The repatriation of the personnel of our fighting services, together with the rehabilitation of workers in war industries, will be a colossal task, but the Government recognizes its magnitude and has planned accordingly. By co-operation with the States, it is endeavouring to give effect to a policy which will ensure that the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth will be utilized in order to bring about a smooth transition of the national economy from a war basis to a peace basis. The Government aims not only to ensure that work will be available to all returned service personnel, but also that such work shall be adequately rewarded. The activities of the nation will be directed towards a rising living standard; an improvement of the environment of workers in both industrial and rural districts; the provision of decent housing conditions; town and country planning; modern transport; social services, embracing freedom from all basic economic worries, as well as an opportunity to rear happy, healthy, and welleducated families. The problems that will face the Government in the changeover from a war economy to a peace economy will be tremendous. Plans must be finalized to place in industry approximately 1,600,000 workers as they become available -workers who have been withdrawn from normal production for the express purpose of prosecuting the war. Obviously a return to the
                    <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline>
                    will not suffice to deal effectively with the situation, and therefore a systematic and extensive survey of the whole of our resources is necessary. The Government must pursue relentlessly a sound policy if Australia is to play the part we desire it to play in the post-war period. The objective of the Government is not something to be reached in the distant future; its policy is based on the knowledge that every resource of the nation must be available immediately the war ends, and on the realization that the great army of workers who will return to peace-time production will bring to their tasks the same qualities of courage, endurance and strength of purpose as they have exhibited during the war years. "We can therefore  expect in the post-war years a degree of human happiness never before attained in the history of mankind.  In his Speech,  His  Royal Highness intimated that decent housing conditions were an essential part of the Government's programme of post-war reconstruction. Unless good houses and living conditions are available to all, we cannot attain to that high standard of living, or that degree of human happiness, that we desire to see in this country. Therefore, the Government proposes, in collaboration with the States, to build 50,000 homes in the first postwar year, S0,000 homes in the second year after the war, and an increasing number of homes in succeeding years until the existing shortage of 257,000 homes is overtaken. Probably the introduction of new methods and materials in the building industry, such as prefabrication and the utilization of plastics, will expedite the Government's programme to a considerable degree. The problem of housing embraces the whole realm of social organization. There can
                    <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline>
                    no proper consideration of this urgent problem unless we ensure that housing occupies its proper place in society. Modern housing can only be approached from the very basis of industrial and social organization, because in common with every other branch of human endeavour it has been affected by the scientific progress made during the war which is evidenced in the unbelievably wide range of new methods and new materials now available. It is now on record that on .the 6th May, 1944, a twostory house, with three bedrooms, was built in nine hours by eight men and four women, at Hull, England. At the Norfolk Naval Base, 5,000 houses were constructed within a period averaging three and a half hours for each house. The walls of those houses were of insulated board, manufactured from mashed newspaper chemically treated. Even before the war the  Gunnerson  Housing Corporation, of Indiana, could supply a pre-fabricated home within practically two hours after the order was received. The scope for new methods and materials appears to be unlimited, and Australia with its great need for tens of thousands of homes, most of which cannot be con-  structed  until the post-war period, will have the same opportunity to break away from the old tradition of bricks and mortar. Notwithstanding the fact that this will mean a revolution in the building industry, our architects and builders will measure up to the problem when information concerning new methods and material is available. As a matter of fact, the Minister for Housing in New South Wales,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline>
                    has already intimated that pre-fabricated homes, which can be built by five carpenters in eight days, will be erected by the New South Wales Housing Commission. These homes will be constructed of fibro-cement with an overall floorage  of 760 square feet, and will consist of three bedrooms, a combined dining and living room, a bathroom, kitchen facilities and a sleepout verandah.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr</inline>
                    has emphasized that these homes would not be temporary structures. They would be permanent in order to meet immediately the needs of those people who cannot afford to wait to participate in ballots for homes to be erected under Commonwealth or State housing schemes. Unfortunately, many people come within this category to-day. Because of the shortage of man-power and materials, owing to the demands of war, they are now compelled to live under conditions which they would not tolerate for one moment longer than was necessary in a time of peace.  His  Royal Highness intimated that the Government is doing everything to cope with the situation. It is endeavouring, to the best of its ability, to alleviate the position resulting from the shortage of man-power and materials, and, at the same time, is pushing on with its plans for the implementation qf a large scale building programme immediately the war concludes.
                </para>
                <para>The housing problem is not confined to the capital cities, but is more or less general throughout the Commonwealth, and any plans to rectify the present position must take into consideration the problem as a whole. Probably, when the Government is dealing with the problem of decentralization and the revolution which is inevitable in the building industry, the opportunity may arise to reconstruct completely many of our country and coastal towns. It may even be possible to reconstruct certain towns on entirely new sites and locations which would be beneficial to the health and general happiness of the people in the localities affected. My home town, Port Pirie, for instance, could be reconstructed on a long-range basis, say within the next two decades, in ideal surroundings at Nelshaby, at the foot of the Flinders Range, approximately 7 miles from the existing town. On this new site, a town second to none in' the Commonwealth could be established, with all the community amenities which scientists and competent town planners are capable of providing. A fast electric train service could take the workers to their places of employment just as expeditiously as they now walk or cycle to their work. This service could be continued to Port Germein, approximately 12 miles farther on, which is a splendid site for the development of a first-class residential area and holiday resort. The foreshores at this centre could be greatly improved with the provision of bathing boxes and lawns. It could be transformed into an ideal resort catering for the pleasure of the people residing in the adjacent districts. As an alternative, or in addition, a fresh-water lake could be constructed on the new site, and the surrounding area beautified with trees. An up-to-date shopping centre and residential avenues leading off the lake could also be provided. This development could form the foundation of a new town where all homes could be equipped with the latest  electrical  labour-saving devices. Residential allotments  could  be provided with sufficient space to enable helicopters to land. Twenty years hence, four-seater helicopters will be just as numerous and as cheap as motor cars are to.-day. People residing in Port Pirie will be able to fly to Adelaide within an hour, or to Melbourne to see the Cup and return home in time for supper. As a matter , of  fact,  I hope to do my campaigning in the 1950 elections in a helicopter. In accordance with the Government's policy of decentralization, new industries could he established on the old site of industrial Port Pirie. There is now plenty of room for this purpose on park lands. The establishment of such industries would obviate the necessity for boys and girls leaving their homes in search of suitable employment in other centres. The practice of establishing a great proportion of our secondary industries in and .around capital cities is entirely wrong, and must be corrected at the earliest possible moment. The planning of industrial' development in every town in the Commonwealth in the post-war period must be carried out by experts, whose recommendations concerning reconstruction and the establishment of suitable secondary industries should be implemented without delay. Port Augusta, at the head of Spencer's Gulf, could be completely reconstructed on a long-range basis on lines similar to Whyalla. The establishment of the latter modern industrial town completely exploded the theory that all industrial towns must bear the appearance of being temporary, as though they might have to  be  abandoned at any moment. Leigh Creek, with its great potentialities for the generation of electric power through its huge deposits of coal, will form the spearhead for the complete reconstruction of industry in South Australia. Underground gasification of coal, with the abolition of opencut and underground mining, is not only practicable but has already been in operation; and with our coal mines converted into power stations at Ipswich and Rosewood in Queensland, at Cessnock and other centres in New South Wales, at Yallourn and Wonthaggi in Victoria, Leigh Creek in South Australia, and Collie in Western Australia we could have a national hook-up from which power could be reticulated throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth for use wherever required. Anticipating the usual question of where the money is to come from for the reconstruction programme outlined, and for other projects which may be considered necessary for the future of Australia, I must say that I agree with the opinion expressed by William Hatfield in his book, <inline font-style="italic">Australia Reclaimed.</inline> He pointed out that at the time he wrote that book Australia was spending approximately £600,000,000 a year on war. Notwithstanding the fact that 1,600,000 workers have been withdrawn from normal production, we now enjoy a better standard of living generally than we did prior to the war. At the same time, Australia fed approximately 5,000,000 people overseas. Annual production in this country in 1938 was valued at £400 <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Therefore, the workers who have been withdrawn from normal production can produce, each year, goods to the value of £640,000,000. Our railway system throughout the Commonwealth, including buildings and rolling-stock, have cost the people of this country more than £300,000,000; in the last peace year, the manufacturing industries of this country, including buildings, plant, machinery, &amp;c., were valued at £245,000,000; and cur post office establishments, including telegraphic equipment, &amp;c., have cost approximately £56,000,000, making a grand total of £601,000,000. The annual production potential of £640,000,000 when we return to peace-time production at the conclusion of this war would be sufficient to rebuild our entire railway system every year, or to replace our entire manufacturing organization or post office organizations every year; but it will not be necessary to replace these assets every year, or even every ten years. Therefore, that £640,000,000 worth of labour power will be available for utilization wherever it is required, and will be capable of undertaking and completing the reconstruction programme that has been outlined, and any other projects which may be considered necessary for the future development of Australia in the post-war period. In my opinion, that is the complete answer to the question, " Where is the money to come from ? " </para>
                <para>HisRoyal Highness intimated that the Government proposed to submit to Parliament legislation for the control of interstate air lines, and to extend the powers of the Commonwealth Bank in  relation to the regulation of banking principles generally, along the lines which war-time experience has shown to be desirable in the national interest. I shall reserve my remarks in support of these proposals, which I heartily endorse, until the appropriate bills are submitted to Parliament for consideration. </para>

                    Royal Highness referred also to the fact that the Leader of the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline>
                    as Minister for Trade and Customs, had recently visited the United States of America and Canada, and had participated in important discussions on matters relating to the procurement of war supplies from North America. We are informed that arrangements have now been finalized for the continuation of full-scale lend-lease aid to Australia. That achievement speaks for itself. The Minister for Trade and Customs has done a splendid job in the interests of this country, not only from the point of view of his own department, but also, according to press reports, by placing the Australian view-point before the people of the United States of America and Canada. We are looking forward to the presentation in this chamber of the Minister's report, which I am sure will be indicative of the magnitude of the task, and of the importance of the achievements in regard to reciprocal aid. Other Ministers also have rendered a great service to Australia in the international sphere. The Minister for Air
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline>
                    the Attorney-General
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline>
                    the former Minister for Supply and Shipping
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline>
                    the Minister for the Army
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline>
                    and last but not least, the Prime Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                    himself whom I believe placed Australia on the map so far as international relations are concerned, have all made worthy contributions to Australia's prestige. Undoubtedly, more international conferences will be held, and it is up to us to send as our representatives to these gatherings the most able men available. The experience and knowledge which they obtain in this way will be of value to Australia, not only in the immediate future, but also throughout our post-war reconstruction programme.
                </para>
                <para>Reference was made by  His  Royal Highness to the disastrous drought and its effect upon the food front in this country at a time when maximum production was required. Forty years before Japan moved towards the South-West Pacific, the greatest of all Australian poets, Henry Lawson, warned of the time when this country would be faced with " an enemy at the harbour gate, and a raging drought behind ". Australia let Henry Lawson starve, and then, when he died, erected a bronze statue to his memory. At that time the people of this country were not sufficiently educated on such matters as the fundamental causes of soil erosion to take heed of the warnings given by Henry Lawson. After all, what could a poet be expected to know of irrigation or national defence? Possibly, because of their ignorance, the Australian people were justified in adopting that attitude,but in the light of scientific discoveries, there is no excuse for us to-day. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bradfield,</inline> Ion Idriess, William Hatfield, F. R. V. Timbury, Brunston Fletcher, and many other authors, have dealt at length with this matter, pointing to the danger of procrastination, and advancing ideals which, in their opinion, constitute the solution of the problem. It is estimated that of 200,000,000 acres of land formerly under cultivation in Australia, 60,000,000 have now been rendered worthless. This loss is continuing at the rate of 2,000,000 acres a year. Obviously, the problem is one demanding our immediate and urgent attention. The Bradfield plan, the Idriess "Boomerang plan ", and other projects must be investigated fully and definite and immediate action taken not only to arrest, but also ultimately to remove for all time, this menace which threatens to destroy vast areas of this continent. Experts agree that the fundamental cause of the problem is to be found in the interior - the so-called " dead heart " of Australia. Closer in, denudation has been caused by over-stocking, and in the agricultural districts, particularly the. Mallee, by incorrect methods of farming and the removal of trees, shrubs and heritage which formed a natural binder for the soil. Probably there are many other contributory causes, most of which, no doubt, are known to experts and scientists who specialize in the study of soil erosion. These factors must receive our immediate attention, and must be dealt with in the light of our scientific knowledge of the subject. Water conservation, afforestation, irrigation, reticulation, and education are all part and parcel of the solution which goes much farther than merely indicating to the farmer the correct method of working land or telling the grazier the number of sheep that he should run on his property to get it back to normal. The price of land, and farmers' commitments to the banks must also be taken into consideration. A national system of debt adjustment must be implemented in cooperation with the States to enable farmers to join in a general plan of rehabilitation. . The whole question of what constitutes a fair and reasonable price for land must be explored, decided and stabilized to ensure that land values shall not be inflated and thereby undermine the fundamental structure of a national plan. The problem in the interior of this continent is such that its solution demands huge schemes of water conservation, irrigation, reticulation and afforestation on a scale unprecedented in the history of Australia, and whether we like it or not we must face this problem and implement national projects which are essential for the future welfare of Australia. These projects are part of a general pattern for the building up of our population to the degree necessary to defend this country in any future wars. Already the Government of Western Australia has taken the initiative and has decided to harness the River Ord in the east Kimberly ranges. Plans for this project are being prepared, and the work will proceed as rapidly as possible. The chief engineer of the Government of Western Australia highly commends the scheme, and has given an estimate of the fertile country which will be brought under cultivation when the project is completed. This, indeed, is a big step in the right direction, calling in no uncertain manner for repetition, not once but many times, and clearly pointing the road which must be travelled if Australia is to become the nation we all desire it will be in the post-war period - a nation capable of defending itself against any aggressor, and of providing its people with a standard of living and a degree of human happiness never before attained in the history of mankind. This should be our immediate post-war project. We must call upon every one who has at heart the future welfare of this great and glorious nation to play his part. Then, when these ideals have been achieved, we shall be able to say in all sincerity, and with all the fervour at our command - </para>

                        <para>. - A great honour has been conferred upon me in entrusting tome the task of seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The honour is due rather to the State which I represent than to me personally, because whatever may he my vocabulary, I fear that it would be quite inadequate to express adequately the gratitude of honorable senators for the address delivered to us yesterday by  His  Royal Highness the Governor-General . The ceremony in this chamber was an historical one. Since the inception of federation we have had at least four visits by members of the Royal Family, but this is the first occasion on which a member of that family has addressed this Parliament as the Governor-General of the Commonwealth. On each of the two previous occasions when a member of the Royal Family addressed the Parliament of this country,  a  message of goodwill and encouragement was given. My memory goes hack to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, when I stood in Spring-street, Melbourne, and watched the arrival at Parliament House of the members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. I recall the great hopes which the people then entertained regarding the future of this country as the result of the inauguration of federation. At that time the Duke of York, who later became King George V., read a proclamation establishing the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Later, another Duke of York, a son of the former, read a proclamation establishing the capital of the Commonwealth at Canberra. Because of the historical significance of the occasion it is interesting to trace in retrospect the progress which this country has made, and the possibilities which lie ahead. Our progress has been so great that we are justifiably proud to be Australians, and we should be grateful to those who took steps to ensure the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This Parliament having been opened for the first time by a Royal Governor-General, we visualize the possibility of further progress, and ask ourselves whether it will be as great in the future as that experienced in the last 40-odd years. It is perhaps significant that this Parliament was originally opened in the closing stages of a war, when the great sister dominion of South Africa was added to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Will history repeat itself? We at least hope that the opening of the present session by a Royal Governor-General may be taken as an indication that the terrible war in which we have been engaged for nearly six years is drawing to a close. I hope that history will repeat itself, and that in the near future the bells of peace will ring. Men and women in all parts of the world may then devote the whole of their attention to the arts of peace, and give expression to the highest ideals and sentiments inherent in mankind, so that progress and development rather than death and destruction shall prevail upon this planet. </para>
                    <para>We welcome  His  Royal Highness, who,as I have said, has come to us in strenuous times, because his presence indicates that Australia is an important member of the great British Commonwealth of Nations. That it intends to remain so is beyond doubt. During the course of the speech which he delivered he intimated that the Government intends to introduce certain legislation. I quite appreciate that a section of the community, and, no doubt, a section of this Parliament, will disagree with some of the proposals. That would not be surprising, because in the early days of federation certain members violently dissented from the legislative programmes then placed before the people. Disputation regarding proposed reforms is characteristic of our history. Most people dislike change, but, once a reform has been brought, about, the majority of the people admit its wisdom. I have no doubt that some of the legislation to be introduced by the Government will be warmly contested. Various sections in the community have already indulged in anticipation regarding what is likely to happen during the present session. I venture to say that it will be one of the most momentous in the history of this country, because the war has caused a re-orientation of the views held by  many of us. Many eminent men and women with vision realize that the old system of society has been responsible for the destruction that has occurred in the past as the result of war, and they visualize a new world. They deplore the destruction of the beautiful things of life. Large cities have been razed to the ground. Notable edifices and invaluable works of art have been destroyed. As many ideals for which we have struggled down the ages have been swept away, thoughtful people now say, " There must be a new society and a new world ". The members of the Labour party subscribe to that view, but disputation will occur as to the methods to he adopted in attaining that objective. </para>
                    <para class="block"> Reference was made in the Speech to certain proposals of the Government. The mover of the motion dealt effectively with the problem of post-war reconstruction and housing. I shall not deal at length with that important matter at this stage, because opportunities for doing so will be presented later, other than to say that it is necessary for the State Parliaments, which have sovereign powers, to cooperate heartily with the Commonwealth Parliament in the implementation of a nation-wide programme of housing and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, this National Parliament has not reached the limit of its powers. It was anticipated in the early days that, as the people became accustomed to the federal system of government, they would gradually clothe the National Parliament with increased powers, but for reasons good or ill they have refused to do that. Therefore, we must still depend on the State Parliaments and the State Governments co-operating with the National Parliament and the Commonwealth Government with regard to many of the great projects necessary for the development of Australia as a whole. I am pleased to read in the Speech that the Commonwealth Government intends to co-operate with the Governments of the States with regard to these important matters. Other proposals, of course, are the sole prerogative of this Parliament, and I anticipate keen discussion with regard to one or two of them. </para>
                    <para>As  His  Royal Highness has said, it is proposed to deal with banking. The present system, no doubt, will be somewhat radically changed. Honorable senators will recall the waves of protests when, in the early days of federation, it was proposed to deal with this matter. Loose thinking is being indulged in today by a section of the community which is opposed to any change in the financial system. Like other members of this chamber, I have received numerous letters suggesting that this Government is about to take certain action for which the authority of the people of Australia has not been obtained. I have received letters objecting to the socialist policy of the Government, and the Speech which  His  Royal Highness delivered yesterday indicated that the Government intended to introduce legislation which will, no doubt, be described as an instalment of socialism. It has been said that the Government has disregarded the decision given by the people at the last referendum by deciding to introduce legislation for the purpose of securing national control of banking. It has been suggested that the Government is setting at nought the decision of the people at the recent referendum by intimating, through  His  Royal Highness, that it proposes to set' up an authority to control the interstate air lines of this country, and to introduce legislation with respect to life assurance companies. It is a dangerous practice to encourage the people to believe that the Government of their country is about to engage in activities for which it has no authority. The powers and functions of the Parliament should transcend party considerations. All British peoples pin their faith to their parliamentary institutions, and the power of their elected represents tives. They know the value of then priceless heritage in being able to displace those representatives should they do things of which the people do not approve. Because it is dangerous to tell the people that the Government is likely to exceed its constitutional powers, I point out that the Constitution gives to the Parliament authority over banking and insurance, and power to make laws in regard to transportation extending beyond the limits of one State. I emphasize that these powers have been conferred, not on any political party, but on the Parliament, and that those who framed the Constitution are now regarded as having been conservative in their outlook. The point to remember is that the people of Australia agreed to these powers being vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. Yet there are men who, in order to secure some slight political advantage, are prepared to inflame the minds of the people by suggesting that the Government will exceed its authority and flout the expressed will of the people. All that the Government proposes to do is to give to the Commonwealth Bank the powers which the founders of the Constitution were prepared to vest in it. That there are those in the community who would distort the Government's intention is nothing new. I remember that when it was proposed to transfer the right to issue bank notes from the private banks to the Commonwealth Bank there was a great outcry. It was suggested then that such action would soon lead to national bankruptcy, and to the Australian currency becoming valueless. Those fears were ill-founded ; Australia is not bankrupt. The people recognize that foresight and .wisdom were displayed in so organizing the nation's currency as to make possible the development of Australia at a rate which otherwise would not have been possible. Then, as now, we heard of the possibilities of hank officials and others being thrown out of employment and other misfortunes befalling the community. Those predictions did not materialize; and I suggest that when the legislation which has been foreshadowed by His Royal Highness is placed on the statute-book the people will realize that it, is in the best interests of Australia, and that it is better that the control of the nation's credit and currency should be in the hands of the elected representatives of the people than in the hands of a small section of the community over which the great bulk of the people have no control whatever. </para>
                    <para>The Speech delivered by  His  Royal Highness informed the people of Australia of the Government's intention to introduce legislation in respect of Australia's wool-growing industry. Unfortunately, conditions over which neither the Government nor the people have had control have resulted in a reduction of the quantity and quality of the wool clip, as well as of the price received for it; but, thanks to the arrangement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Great Britain, a standard price for wool has been maintained. We must, however, visualize the conditions which may operate after the cessation of hostilities and when the term of the agreement has expired. We must be prepared to meet changed circumstances then. We read a good deal of the development of scientific processes in respect of synthetic products and of their effect on the wool industry, and honorable senators will agree that something must be done to stabilize Australia's greatest primary industry. To that end, legislation will be introduced in the early stages of this session to establish a fund to which the wool-growers and the Government will contribute, and from which funds will be applied to research and to publicity in connexion with wool and its uses. Matters affecting the biological, technical and publicity aspects of the wool industry will be dealt with. Action along those lines is necessary because of the announced intention of the Government to introduce, legislation to provide for the settlement of servicemen on the land. Any scheme of rehabilitation must take land settlement into consideration. Australia is a vast continent, and we have only a very small population. Some people believe that much of our country Ls not suitable for settlement, and, therefore, we cannot absorb a very great influx of population. The Government must encourage the application of science to our soil, and seek the aid of science m every way possible for the development of this Commonwealth. The settlement of ex-servicemen on the land, and, in later years, the settlement of their families, will involve biological research in order to determine the most profitable breeds of sheep for our pastures. We must also undertake research on the technical side in order to combat the competition of artificial fibres. We must discover new uses for wool. I compliment the Government upon its decision to introduce legislation at a very early date to achieve these objectives. I trust that when those measures come before this chamber, they will provide tully for the future development of this country. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>
                        Royal Highness referred to the part that Australia has played not only on the field of battle, but also on the food front.  His  statement showed conclusively that although we are small in numbers, Australians have played a magnificent part in the present conflict. When we visualize the efforts made by this country in organizing its Navy, Army and Air Force, and supplying the civil requirements of our population, and, at the same time, the tremendous task which this small nation has performed in assisting members of Allied forces in operational areas adjacent to Australia, we can say with pride that wo have done a magnificent job. However,  His  Royal Highness foreshadowed that greater efforts will be required of our people. I wish that his words could resound in the ears of many sections of the community who, unfortunately, owing to the successes of our armies and the valour displayed by our fighting forces, as well as the great organizational effort's which hare been made by those entrusted with the protection of this country, are inclined to feel that we are comparatively safe. Too many of our people believe that the war is as good as over. We seu signs of dissatisfaction developing in certain sections of the community who are beginning to resent any restraints being placed on them. In these circumstances, the duty devolves upon all members of this Parliament, regardless of their party political affiliation, to tell our people plainly that danger has not yet passed; that while we live in comparative peace and security at present, the great struggle in which we are engaged has not yet been brought to a successful conclusion. Unfortunately, before the enemy is driven beyond reach of this country, and before the peace terms arc finally decided on, sorrow will enter the homes of many of our people. More lives will be lost before Australia oau say that it is truly free. We should make every possible effort to rally the people of this country to a last effort, and do our best to make them recognize the possibilities which the future holds. Our people must recognize that we shall not win the struggle by com placency or by over-indulgence in the pleasures of life. It is the duty of all of us to do our best to dispel the spirit of complacency, and to urge our people again to gird themselves for the final struggle.
                    </para>
                    <para>As I said earlier,. I hope sincerely that the fact that this Parliament has been opened by a member of the Royal Family may be an omen, as was the case when the first Parliament of the 'Commonwealth was opened by a member of the Royal Family, that the end of the war is approaching. However, wishful thinking will not achieve victory. I heard with a feeling of pride and satisfaction the references made by  His  Royal Highness to the part which Australia has played and is playing in the rehabilitation of other countries not so fortunate in the struggle as has been our own land. Last session, legislation was passed enabling us to play our- part in bringing into operation an organization which is now laying plans to bring help and succour to countries which have been devastated by war. I refer to Unrra. A sect-ion of that organization has already met in conference in Australia. It is not difficult to visualize the problems which will confront that body in the task that has been allotted to it. We are now having placed before us a picture of devastated countries, many of them within close proximity to our shores; and as the result of the meeting of this organization, and the decisions -it has made, we can now visualize the part which Australia will be called upon to play in assisting it in its great humanitarian work. When we view these matters collectively and see the picture of world happenings as a whole, and, at. the same time, visualize the development of our great Commonwealth - when we visualize the days of peace to come, when destruction will no longer be the order of 'the day ; when the thoughtful men and women of the world will bo able to come together and plait the future new world - we can gather from this momentous meeting of this Parliament, which has assembled on the threshold of a new world, an inspiration for the future. One inspiring thought which fills my mind is the fact that this Parliament, through the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government, has indicated that its outlook is in keeping with the high ideals I have outlined.It is encouraging to us, therefore, to meet here to-day, and on the eve of this task realize that it is possible for nations to provide a better outlook for the peoples of the world in the near future. I believe that I express the sentiments of all honorable senators when I say that we visualize the end of the bad order of things, that every one, regardless of party politics, will give his best attention to these problems. Some one has suggested that I may be wrong in taking that view. If I am wrong, it will only be because, since the beginning of the world, some effort has always been made to prevent progress. However, out of the collective wisdom of this Parliament, I am certain that wo shall make progress. At any rate this Parliament contains sufficient men and womenable and willing to overcome any vestige of obstruction that might arise. We, at any rate, shall nail our banner to the mast. I trust that as the result of our deliberations we shall progress towards the fulfilment of the great destiny awaiting this young country. </para>
