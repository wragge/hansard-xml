In reply to the honorable senator##'##s question, it has been ascertained that there are at present three telephone speech channels between Adelaide and Perth and two additional channels are in course of installation. It is hoped that they will be completed and ready for service within the next few weeks. In addition to the speech channels referred to, there is also one high quality circuit available which is suitable for broadcast transmissions in either direction between the west and the east. The matter of duplicating the broadcast transmission facilities is receiving consideration but in view of the technical difficulties involved it is not practicable at this stage to indicate when the additional circuit will be provided. </para>

It will be appreciated, however, that before payment is effected, it is necessary that proper verification of the service which involves any such payment must be made. My colleague, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, has specifically directed that in any matters where payment to primary producers is the responsibility of his department, there shall be no delays. If the honorable senator can advise me of any individual cases where settlement has been protracted, I will undertake to have them investigated immediately. </para>

                    <para>.- When I spoke on Friday, I dealt with the causes of the depression. I propose now to refer to some of its effects, not the least of which was the lowering of the standard of living, and the resultant malnutrition of large sections of the community. Another effect was that the minds of the people were affected by the strain, resulting in many instances of persons committing suicide rather than face the future. Other effects were noticeable in the ill-nourished children born of mothers suffering from malnutrition. It can be said with truth that the results of the depression were more calamitous to Australia than were the results of the war of 1914-18. It will be remembered that the then Treasurer endeavoured to alleviate the distress among the community by  a  fiduciary issue of ##£##18,000,000, and it is to the eternal shame of those who then sat in opposition in this chamber that that legislation was defeated. When the present Government announced its intention to introduce legislation to control banking in Australia, members of this Parliament were inundated with communications from interests closely associated with the private banks. Fortunately, supporters of the Government were not diverted from their loyalty to the party by the communications that they received. I am not astonished that the financial interests of this country became frantic when the Government##'##s proposals were made public, or that they should have taken every means in their power to divert the Government from its purpose. I have never known of a burglar who has successfully looted property, after many weeks or months of preparation, willingly dropping the loot. He only does that when he is forced to do so. The private banks have so long enjoyed their illgotten gains that I did not expect them to submit quietly to the Government##'##s proposals. </para>

                        <para>- On many subjects, my opinion differs from that of the honorable senator. Had I been in this chamber when the proposal for a fiduciary note issue to provide employment came before it, I would not have voted against the bill, as he did. The honorable senator represents certain interests in this chamber, whereas I represent other in##"##terests. In this legislation, the Government has set out to provide economic security for the masses. Its social welfare programme aims at providing for the care of children and of the aged and infirm, as well as ensuring economic security for all. If the Government can achieve that objective, it will deprive the Opposition of one of its greatest weapons - the bogy of communism. There will be no need to fear communism if the Government can perform the job that it has set out to do. I warn honorable senators opposite that in offering uncompromising hostility to the Government##'##s, legislative programme, they are treading a dangerous road. Honorable senators opposite may giggle and smile; but when we analyse the position we find that only the progressive policy of the Labour party stands between the people and red revolution. I have no doubt about that. But for the fact that this Government is able to ameliorate the conditions of the un-emancipated we should certainly be faced with revolution. Therefore, I warn honorable senators opposite not to go too far in their hostility to the progressive policy of the Government. The Labour party stands for economic security. We realize that in order to implement our  policy we must not only occupy the treasury bench but also control the banking system in this country. We must accept that responsibility in the best interests of the people. That is the objective of the Government##'##s banking proposals. I have never had any doubt that, regardless of any endeavour we might make to control the production and distribution of goods, we must at the same time control exchange, because without the control of exchange any other effort on our part would be as useless as the fluttering of the wings of a butterfly trying to escape from the hand of its captor. Therefore, if we wish to implement our progressive legislation we must control credit. That is the object of the measure before us. if embers of the Bank Officers Association have threatened me with political extinction at the next general elections; and I know that similar threats have been hurled at my colleagues. In the main, the members of that association do not lean politically towards the Labour party. In my long political career I have learned of no action on their part which could be interpreted as support for the Labour party. Therefore, I ignore those threats. At the same time, members of that association exhibit concern over the possibility that in the transition from the existing banking system to the system proposed by the Government some of them may be displaced. In that respect I sympathize with them ; but I do not share their pessimism. </para>

                <para>I am hopeful that during the post-war period, industry, business and commerce will expand to so great a degree, and economic conditions generally so improve that we shall attract to Australia migrants of the best possible type. In such circumstances the number of employees now engaged in banking activities will certainly not diminish. At the very worst, all now employed in that calling will have work to do ; whilst the probability is that a greater volume of man-power will ;be required in banking activities to meet improved economic conditions. We have witnessed the almost complete extinction of the harness maker. To-day he is almost as extinct as the dodo. And I have seen the sheet metal trade contract to a substantial degree because of the development of other industries. To-day, blacksmiths and boilermakers are practically members of a vanishing trade. Therefore, whilst I sympathize with members of the Bank Officers Association in their fear that the system proposed to be established by the Government will displace many of them, although I, personally, ##'##believe that that is most unlikely, I can only say at this juncture that should they experience the bad luck which they appear to contemplate, such bad luck would be only in line with that suffered by others who have gone before them. I had not intended to speak at such length and would not have done so, but for the necessity to answer interjections by honorable senators opposite. I heartily support the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened carefully to the speeches of honorable senators opposite in the hope of learning something about banking generally; but the views expressed by those honorable senators who have spoken in support of the bill have made me only more confused than ever concerning the Government##'##s real intentions since the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> attempted to explain them in his second-reading speech. Although the bill now before us deals exclusively with the Commonwealth Bank, certain provisions are linked with the activities of private banks, and it is impossible to debate the bill without going over much of the ground which we shall have to cover with respect to banking generally when the Banking Bill comes before us. </para>

                <para>Each honorable senator opposite who has already spoken has given different reasons why the Government has found it necessary to introduce this measure. After listening to them I have come to the conclusion that the Government has introduced its banking proposals as the result of its study of the life of Ned Kelly, the famous Australian bushranger, but with the one qualification that Ned Kelly used to wear a mask in order to hide his shame, whereas the Government has adopted the principle of wholesale bank robbery naked and unashamed. The periodica##]## hold-ups perpetrated by that notable Australian character were hold-ups of branches of banks, whereas the Government proposes ##"## to go the whole hog##"## and wipe out the private banks altogether. The bill now before us deals mainly with the Commonwealth Bank, but most of its provisions embody powers already possessed by the bank, the main exception being that the bank is now controlled by a board whereas the Government proposes to place the bank under the control of one individual. I shall deal fully with that point later. </para>
                <para>Senators Large and Grant related the very interesting history of banking since the days when the merchants of Lombardy entrusted their jewels and other precious possessions to each other, but I fail to see what that has to do with the Australian banking system.  Speaker  after  speaker  on the Government side of the chamber placed at the door of the private banking institutions of the world the responsibility for all the troubles that have occurred during the last century, including wars and depressions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> went even further and added murders  and suicides. These charges are without foundation. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> contradicted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to some degree by declaring that the banks were not responsible for depressions, but that they prolonged them. What possible reason could the private banking institutions of this country, or of any other country have for creating or prolonging depressions? We all know what the effects of depressions are. First of all, share values fall, and that applies to the shares of banking institutions as well as business organizations. What then have the private banks or their directors to gain by depreciating their own stock? </para>

                        <para>- That allegation is about as intelligent as other observations which have come from the Government side of the chamber. Can any honorable senator explain why holders of stock in a bank or in any other joint stock company, should desire to prolong a set of conditions which have resulted in the depreciation of their assets? The entire business of banking suffers considerably in a depression. Is it not to the advantage of public companies whether they be banks or ordinary business enterprises, to have full employment in the community, brisk business, and prosperous conditions ? Honorable senators opposite have .given a ##'##long dissertation on the evils which they contend have been done in generations gone by in the name of international finance. These include, as I have said, wars, depressions, and general##'## suffering, but after all, what are the Australian banking institutions? Are they not simply organizations built up by the savings of our own people? Figures have been quoted showing that of the nine private banks operating in this country, all except two belong entirely to the Australian people, and that shareholders in these institutions number 80,000, the average holding being ##£##500. What nonsense it is then to say that the owners of these organizations are engaged in some form of plot to cause wars and depressions, or even to have prolonged depressions! Our private banking institutions are no different from other public companies except that they have specialized in finance. Without the confidence of depositors, the private banks could not live. An organization could have the biggest list of shareholders of any company in this country, and a palatial building, but unless it had the confidence of people who wished to deposit their money in savings banks accounts, or current accounts, it would not do any business. </para>

                <para>My colleague from Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> in a very able speech, traced the history of banking in this country. He pointed out that the bank of New South Wales had started- in humble circumstances 125 years agc- -17 or 18 years after the first settlement in this country was established, and that our banking system had grown since then as part and parcel of the life of the people. The private banks were started with small capital and small deposits, and they have been built up by the Australian people, not by international financiers. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has said, the Australian private banks have not paid huge dividends. In fact, the average dividend, paid by these institutions is low and unattractive compared with dividends paid to investors in other business organizations. </para>
                <para class="block">Bank shares are recognized as a trustee investment, and usually are bought by people seeking a safe return for their money. They invest their money in banks because of the capable way in which these organizations have been managed in the past, and because such an investment is not of a speculative nature. </para>
                <para>This measure which deals primarily with the re-organization of the Commonwealth Bank is divided into various parts including housing, rural loans and industrial finance. Most of the activities provided for in the bill are . already being carried out by the bank, and could lie carried out in the future in competition with existing organizations, without the creation of a government monopoly in the banking field which undoubtedly is the objective of the Government in introducing this legislation. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> instance, the State Savings Bank of Victoria operates a Credit Foncier department, which in the past has enabled it to discharge satisfactorily many of the  functions  for which provision is made in this bill. </para>

                        <para>- The bill proposes to establish a Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank, but such a department is already in existence and deals promptly and fairly with applications made to it. A further proposal is to set up an Industrial Finance Department. In (his field the activities of the Commonwealth Bank are limited because it is necessary for it to ensure that its advances are properly secured. Irrespective of its charter or the extent of government control, or what party is in office, no Commonwealth Bank would eVer rendel##'## service by way of advances to industry comparable with that of the private banks. No government bank would dare to take the risk that a private bank is willing to take. -Under the proposed set-up constant references will be made by the Commonwealth Bank to the Government and the Treasury Department, and the Auditor-General##'##s Department will keep a watchful eye on its activities. All these factors will be detrimental to the making of advances to industry. A further important consideration is that the bank will be handling the taxpayers##'## money, and if it sustains failures in respect of any undertaking, it will not be government funds but taxpayers##'## savings that will be lost. Every one knows the length of time involved when seeking to have an application granted, because of red tape and the set-up of government departments. With a similar set-up in the Commonwealth Bank the possibility of securing a quick loan in a time of emergency will be practically non-existent. In country areas primary producers sometimes require financial accommodation at, perhaps, half an hour##'##s notice, for the purpose of buying stock or new machinery. A manager of a private bank with which that man may have dealt for years will take a chance and make the accommodation available to him. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> pointed out, many country men who have been dealing with private banks over a lengthy period have never been asked to lodge security in respect of overdraft accommodation they have been given. When that type of transaction is brought under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, in respect . of which the final say will rest with the Treasurer, it is extremely doubtful whether such accommodation  will be made available under similar conditions and at short notice. Government departments are strangling the lifeblood of industry continually. </para>

                <para>The Government proposes to abolish the Commonwealth Bank Board, but that would be a retrograde step. Each private bank has its board of directors, consisting, as a rule, of men who have had wide experience in the financial and business world and are thus able to give sound advice to the general manager. But the Government proposes to take away the board - at a time when more and more responsibility, and a greater variety of work is to be given to the Commonwealth Bank, and when the Governor would be in greater need of advice from the board. It has been pointed out that when the Commonwealth Bank was first instituted, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller was the sole executive authority. The bank, however, was then a tiny organization with a very small turnover, and did not justify the existence of a board of directors. Through the years it has expanded more rapidly than its creators dreamed possible and it is now a huge organization. In spite of the fact that the Government proposes to enlarge its functions and powers still further - which one would imagine would necessitate an increase in assistance from a directorate - the Government proposes to abolish the body capable of giving advice. In the bill the Government envisages the undertaking of housing schemes and the provision of finance by the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose. An Advisory Council is proposed, but will it include among its members a person with a practical knowledge of housing problems and the cost of building? </para>

                        <para>- There may be such men among the permanent officers of the bank, but they are not to be members of the Advisory Council. It is essential in times like the present, when values are fluctuating so widely and other economic difficulties have to be dealt with that experts should be appointed to advise how millions of pounds of the depositors##'## money should be handled so that failures and losses may not result. Is there any other organization in Australia handling funds to the extent it is proposed that this bank shall handle the depositors##'## money, which has not the benefit of. a board of directors ? Yet the Government proposes to place in the hands of the Governor - and in the event of a dispute, in the hands of the political head of the Treasury - the responsibility of directing how these savings shall be invested. What section of the financial world involves a more delicate business than that of making rural advances, particularly in the light of fluctuating values of land, stock and all commodities associated with primary production?. Does that not call for the most expert consideration and advice? But the Government proposes to repose all responsibility in the hands of the Governor or the Treasurer. Ever since the establishment of the board, at least two members have been men actively associated with rural industries. They have been appointed so that the board may have the advantage of their wide knowledge of primary industries. </para>

                <para>Under Part X. the Commonwealth Bank will have power to advance money for the purposes of industrial development. I do not know exactly what that implies. If the Government desires that loans shall be advanced without sound security to persons who wish to establish new industries, I predict that a good deal of trouble will be experienced. A sound case can be presented for the retention of the present board and the strengthening of it, particularly as the bank will have greater powers under this bill than it has previously exercised. When a member of the Opposition was speaking, an interjection came from the Government side casting a reflection on the present board. An honorable senator opposite said that the members of the board had been looking after their own interests. That was most unfair. The majority of them are known personally to us, and, as far as I am aware, each has given disinterested public service, and has been of great help to the present Governor and his predecessor. They were not appointed because of their financial position in the community. Some of them came from the ranks of the workers. Two of them have spent the greater part of their lives in the organized Labour movement, and others have been engaged for many years in primary production.  <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Claude</inline> Reading severed his own business connexions in order to devote the whole of his time to the work of the board. </para>
                <para>Clause 9 takes all power from the Governor of the bank and transfers it to the Treasurer of the day, thus placing the bank under political control. In the event of a dispute arising between the Governor and the Treasurer on any matter, the Treasurer has the final voice regarding it, and the bank must conform with his wishes. Even if the Governor thought it sound policy to make an advance not favoured by the Treasurer, he must, irrespective of his wide experience of banking affairs, give way to the Treasurer of the day, who might have no qualifications whatever to control a great financial institution like the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>The general criticism levelled at the trading banks has been most unfair. The associated banks are quite able to defend themselves, and I have no doubt that they will be able to furnish ample proof that the charges made against them of having created depressions are quite untrue. The proposal of the Government to take complete control of banking is bitterly opposed not only by the trading banks, which have about 80,000 shareholders throughout Australia, but also by the employees of those banks and of the Commonwealth Bank itself. </para>

                        <para>- A ballot was held amongst the whole of the employees of the Commonwealth Bank recently on two aspects of this bill, one in relation to their classification, and the other with regard to the publication of salaries, and the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the present method of control. The employees of both the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks realize that they will be under great disadvantages in the event of the Government achieving its purpose of having one banking organization controlled and conducted by itself. The spirit of competition which exists between the trading banks is beneficial to both the banks and the employees. </para>

                        <para>- I should be surprised if that practice were adopted. If a bank is already giving satisfaction to a customer and another bank asks him to transfer his business to it, that might be a different matter, but the keenest competition arises for new business. ##"##When a customer states that he is not satisfied with the treatment received from his bank, it is not long before another bank is prepared to offer him better service. There has been just as much competition between the private banks as between traders in other lines of business. It is true that during the war the competition between the banks has not been so keen as formerly because of the efforts of the Department of War Organization of Industry to save man-power by restricting the number of banks operating in certain districts. Present conditions may not reflect the normal practice of keen, even fierce, competition between the private banks. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say anything of the kind. The Commonwealth Bank was established long before my entry into politics. I frankly admit that it has served a useful purpose, and I hope it will continue to do so; but if it is to continue to have the most beneficial effect on the community, it should operate in active competition with other banking institutions. Whatever banking business I have transacted has been done through the Commonwealth Bank; the members of my family also do their business with that institution. I cannot find any reason for the introduction of this legislation, except that the Government has been influenced by the growing leftwing section of the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said that the framers of the Constitution were wise to provide that the Commonwealth should have power to control banking, but I submit that no Constitution would be complete in the absence of such a provision. There is a great deal of difference between giving to the Commonwealth power to control banking, and the use of those powers to destroy the existing organization by swallowing up the private banks and establishing one big banking monopoly in the Commonwealth. That is what the Government proposes in this bill. </para>

                        <para>- For a time the Government did concentrate on the war, but for the last twelve or fifteen months it has presented to the Parliament legislation of a most contentious nature - legislation, moreover, for which it received no mandate from the people. This is not the time to introduce legislation to divide the people into opposing camps. In the committee stage Opposition senators will move a number of amendments, and I hope that decisions of a regimented caucus will not operate in connexion with this measure as they did when the Reestablishment and Employment Bill was under consideration. The storm of protest which followed the Government##'##s rejection of Opposition amendments to that measure was nothing to the storm of protest which will come from the people when they realize what the Government##'##s objectives are in connexion with banking. The reason why the banks of this country, with the exception of a government-controlled bank in New South Wales, have weathered the storms, is that the people have had confidence in them, and that they have not been the plaything of party politics. No institutions in Australia have earned greater respect for their sound methods of finance than have the banking institutions of Australia; in saying that I include the Commonwealth Bank. Under this bill, the banking institutions of this country will become the plaything of party politics. Unfortunately, the Government has yielded to pressure from ##"## left-wing ##"## organizations outside the party, but in yielding to that pressure the Government will bring about its own undoing. The only real pleasure that I get out of the introduction of this legislation, is due to the knowledge that only about fifteen months will elapse before the present Government will be driven from the treasury bench by an irate public, and that another government will then be able to undo the mischief which the passing of this legislation will cause. Honorable senators who support the Government may think that they arc doing something clever and are fooling the public, but I assure them that the reaction of the people to these proposals is stronger than, in connexion with any other proposals with which I have been associated during the whole of my public life. The only ##"## kick ##"## I get out of it ##'##is the knowledge that about this time next year when the next general elections are held, a new government will be returned and will be able to undo the mischief perpetrated under this legislation. </para>

However, if the Opposition maintains its recent form, I have no doubt that we shall have further opportunities to discuss the different provisions of the measure at the committee stage. All that is done in this chamber is preceded by a prayer that our labours may be directed by Providence to the true welfare of the people of Australia. ##£## have listened intently to speeches made in this debate, most of them by honorable senators opposite, and I have yet to hear from an honorable senator opposite that the measure is either directed against the welfare of the people or is likely to adversely affect that welfare. En fact, the speeches of honorable senators opposite have been directed to the protection of the banks rather than to displaying any concern for the welfare of the people.

                    <para>- -On that point I cross issue with the honorable senator. There are two classes of money held by the banks - that of the shareholders which is a small proportion of their total funds, and that of the depositors which forms the bulk of the money held by the banks and forms the base for the credit which the banks issue. The depositors, whose money represents the bulk of the money controlled by the banks, have no say whatsoever in banking or monetary policy. They are entirely without a voice. Reverting to my theme, time and experience have shown that many measures passed by this Parliament have not been for the true welfare of the people, and in sp: fa of the fact that all governments, no doubt, desired to achieve this objective, a good deal of legislation, even at the time of the passing of particular measures, must have given rise to doubt as to whether it would serve the true end of the welfare of the people. I am not in any doubt as to my position in relation to the measure now before us. I am sure that it is designed to bring about the welfare of the people, and I am equally certain that it is going to go a long way in that direction. The first portion of clause 8 provides the key to the spirit that animates the whole of the provisions in the measure which are new. It reads - </para>

                <para>In my experience this is the first time that that has been written into any act of Parliament as a statutory duty imposed upon any authority set up by this Parliament. I regard it from a legal viewpoint as setting up a statutory obligation which could, if necessary, be enforced by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth by way of injunction against the bank if it were proceeding to act in any way detrimental to the interests of the people. Therefore, that clause is not a mere pious platitude, or a mere broad expression of opinion, or desire. It is a definite imposition of a positive duty upon the bank to so conduct itself that the welfare of the people will be served. I should like to consider  for a while why the welfare of the people is so intimately bound up in currency and banking problems. In the earliest days, exchange of commodities was effected by barter. That was a very inconvenient system, and one which restricted trade within very limited boundaries. I need not elaborate the difficulties that would arise in trading fowls for cows if those articles had to be exchanged. But, later, as money was set up as the measuring rod of value, trade was able to get beyond its very limited confines. It was enabled to become international; and money became a really indispensable convenience. Money had two qualities. It was endowed by law with certain powers, and it also had certain inherent qualities of value in itself. By virtue of both those powers it was able to command goods and services in a very free way; but, presently, groups who got control of money and the credit were able to gain possession of this element which was intended to be a medium of exchange and, ultimately, by virtue of the power that they acquired through the possession of money and the control of credit, they not only dominated governments and dictated the policies of governments, but, in fact, also gained a control which exceeded that of the governments of the world. At the risk of repetition, I propose to refer briefly to four statements made by prominent parsons since 1790. Three of them were made by prominent bankers, and the fourth by an ex-Prime Minister of England. I shall later bring the views recently expressed by the bankers into my statement, and so draw a clear picture of the control exercised by banks and the recognition of that control at the present time. That will lead me to demonstrate the need for a measure of control over banking, currency, credit and exchange which exercise a vital influence on every one. As long ago as 1790, Meyer Rothschild, who founded the famous banking house of Rothschild, said - </para>

                <para>Those quotations show the power that resides in bodies or corporations which control banking and credit; and as those powerful financial groups grew in the world, so grew the national debt system. Prior to 1694, when the Bank of England was established, it is interesting to recall that there was practically no public debt in England, but three years after the institution of the Bank of England the national debt was ?3,000,000. It has grown continuously until following the war of 1914-18 it amounted to ?7,830,000,000. There is no need for me to tell honorable senators that this figure will be vastly exceeded by the time the present greater war is over. </para>

                        <para>- I would not blame either of them, but probably both. I shall develop that theme when I deal with the financial emergency which arose during the depression from 1929 onwards. I agree with the view expressed in the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems that bodies other than banks must accept a measure of blame for that condition. As the commission puts it, governments of the day, trading banks - including the Commonwealth Bank as it was then constituted - and the community at large must accept their share of blame for that position. I would not attribute it to either the banks or the governments, but to both. The establishment of the Bank of England had an interesting history. </para>

                <para>All that I have said goes to show that banking plays a very vital part in the life of the community. It affects the life of the nation. Money controls everybody - I might even say from the cradle to the grave. As a lawyer I have a very lively knowledge of the fact that even if a person were unable to pay one penny in the ##£##1, it would cost him a considerable sum of money to file his petition to become bankrupt. It costs money even for that; it costs money, too, to be buried. In fact, money governs us from the cradle to the grave. The days have long since passed when each of us could produce all that is required to maintain life. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> has said, that even the unborn child may be affected by the amount of money, and, accordingly, the facilities, that may be made available to the child##'##s mother. I say deliberately that the ultimate control of banking, currency, credit and exchange must rest in the nation, because it provides a vital national service. It profoundly affects everybody in the community, and the power given to those who control these things transcends even the power of governments themselves. I develop that by saying that monetary policy is of vital national importance, because it affects us in so many ways. I shall give brief instances. It plays a very large part in determining the degree of employment, or unemployment, in the community. The last depression was an example of its power in that direction. I have already adverted briefly to the part that the banks played##'## both in the creation of, and in the recovery from that particular depression. Monetary policy affects the standard of life of everybody in the community; it affects the quantum of trade and commerce; it goes further: it determines which industries shall be established, which industries shall be developed and which industries shall be retarded. Inherent in that power over trade and commerce lies the possibilities of international conflict. That is an additional reason why ultimate control should, and must, remain with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the banks at present have power to do that. They can direct industry without regard to national interest. If the banks were concerned with##"## national interest, we should have had in this country long ago, an aircraft production industry, as aluminium industry, and other undertakings vital to our existence in time of danger. Disregarding for the moment war-time controls, the banks can develop and establish industries, or force industries out of existence. That is a power which ultimately should not be completely in the hands of those institutions, but in the hands of the nation. I am not pretending that the nation should step in and control every loan that a bank makes or every advance that it contemplates. The view that I expressed in my first speech in this chamber was that the Government ultimately must have the final voice in these matters. It must be able to direct that national industries shall come first. After that, private industry, banks, and anybody else, may have free play. In matters that are vital to the safety and development of this nation final power must  be in the hands of the Government. That control is necessary also for other reasons. The degree and speed of our national development are dependent very largely upon banking and monetary policy. I say too, finally, that that policy has a lot to do with the determination of price levels. The amount of money and credit available in the community are vital factors in determining price levels, and the stability and economics of the nation. Unless prices are kept reasonably stable, there is an unfair differentiation between producer and consumer, borrower and lender, debtor and creditor, taxpayer and Government, and employer and employee. Without stability of prices there is no firm basis on which production and trade and commerce may be carried on. Who should determine monetary policy in the last resort? Should it be under public control and in public interest, or in the hands of private industry - the private trading banks and, if you like, the Commonwealth Bank, as it is at present? let us for a moment examine the constitution of the private trading banks. In this country they are few in number, and they arc all companies. They all have shareholders, who I understand, number approximately 80,000. Each bank has its board of directors who are the trustees for the shareholders and who are elected by the shareholders. They have a bounden duty under their appointment to protect the assets of the shareholders, and to make for them the maximum profits. Let us consider the 80,000 shareholders: Do they have an equal voice in the election of directors? Unquestionably they do not. There is one vote for each share, and it may well be that the boards of directors of the banks are elected by very few people holding a great bulk of the shares, and that a substantial proportion of the 80,000 shareholders do not have an effective voice at all. So, the appointment of directors virtually rests in the hands of very few people in the community. Another point worth remembering, is that these shareholders are a changing commodity; their personnel changes with every transfer of shares. They do not have any responsibility to the bank in which they hold shares or to the public. In fact if there is a conflict between national interest, and the interest of the shareholders, the  directors of a bank have a plain statutory duty to ignore the national interest. If they did otherwise, any one of their shareholders could apply to-the court for an order restraining such action as might, be in the national interest and against the sectional interest of the shareholders. </para>

                <para>There again is the plain admission on the part of the banks that in them is vested this vast power which, I submit, unquestionably should be vested in the National Parliament. Let me put it this way: Who should be the repository of these powers? Should they be vested in the private banking institutions, with their 80,000 shareholders, and with the degree of irresponsibility which I outlined, or in the Parliament of Australia with its 7,000,000 subscribers? That I suggest is the question that has to be determined. Private trading banks make their profits very largely by the use of the money of their depositors which they lend at a profit to themselves. If one deposits a huge sum in a bank, at call, one does not get any interest##'## upon it. However, for the payment of 10s. a year one is able to get a great deal of service. The bank will issue cheque books, keep all accounts^ and render other services. The benefit which the banks derive for those services is the utilization of the money of their depositors, realizing, of course, that the##'## depositors will not all seek to withdraw all their money at one time. It is a well known banking practice that approximately 10 per cent, of all deposits is sufficient to meet all commitments which reasonably might be expected to be incurred at one time. </para>

                <para>Again  we  have the words ##"##vital national service ##"## obtruding. If I were asked to defend nationalization of banking I should seek no better proof than that statement, because the justification  for nationalizing any item of public service is that it is dangerous to the civil well-being to allow it to be left in the hands of private enterprise. I have only to refer to items such as water supply, control of sewers; and drains, railways, postal facilities, and. that type of public utility to illustrate my meaning. Once an activity falls into the category of vital national service then, unquestionably, it should belong to the nation, and be controlled by the nation for the nation. I am not here, however, to advocate nationalization of public utilities, because that is not involved in the measure now before the Senate.

                    was not restricting his remarks to the war period, but to all periods. I suggest to honorable senators that the control of credit is none the less necessary in times of peace as in times of war. In matters such as housing, immigration, the implementation of the Atlantic Charter, defence, social services, full employment, and national development generally, credit control will be necessary in the post-war period when the emergency will be as acute as it is now. I voice no criticism of trading banks either generally or in particular. I am prepared to concede that they have rendered a great deal of national service and that they have helped to develop this country in an appreciable way. I am aware, however, that they have done so incidentally, in serving their main purpose of preserving their assets and making profits for the shareholders. My only complaint is that the power they possess, and which I illustrated, is too vast and too important to the people of Australia to be allowed to remain in their hands. It affects the country so vitally, internally and externally that the ultimate control of that power should be  in the hands of the nation. I ask honorable senators to remember that in the post-war period, safeguards against inflation now exercised will not then be available. I refer to wage-pegging, rationing, and price control, and I suggest that there will be a grave emergency existing which will call for the wisest possible control in the interests of the nation.

                <para>Coming to the bill itself I find myself happy over the constitutional position.

Para-* graph (xiii) provides that this Parliament may control - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Practically the only limitation of that power is in relation to State banking, and for that reason there cannot be complete nationalization of banking by this Parliament whilst the Constitution remains as it is now. The bill repeals ten Commonwealth Bank Acts, two Housing Acts and the Bank Notes Act, 1910. Because it is a repealing and consolidating measure it will be a convenience and subject to no criticism on that account. There are. new and vital provisions introduced! in the measure, however, comments on which have already been made by members of the Opposition, and I shall summarize them before dealing briefly with certain points. First of all, there is the power given to the Treasurer to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank shall carry out the monetary and banking policy of the Government. Then the bill deals with the formal constitution of the Commonwealth Bank as a central bank; creation of a general banking division of the -bank; the obligation of the Commonwealth Bank to develop its general banking business ; the abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board and the setting up of an Advisory Council; the abolition of the note issue reserve; the creation of an Industrial Finance Department; provision for housing loans; and the abolition of the Commonwealth Savings Bank commissioners, and reorganization of the Commonwealth Bank service. </para>
                <para>I consider that the first of the matters mentioned is of utmost importance - that is the power vested in the Treasurer under clause 9 enabling him, in the event of a difference of opinion with the Commonwealth Bank as to what monetary and banking policy should be applied, to insist that the view of the Government shall prevail. I have already shown what a vital part banking and currency played in the affairs of the nation, and I agree with what the Minister for Trade and Customs stated in his second-reading speech - </para>

                <para class="block">In other words, the Government must rule. It has the power, and it must govern. In a matter so vital to the people, their will must prevail and their will is exercisable every three years. I have already shown that the banks have admitted there must be a measure of control hereafter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McConnan##'##s  speech plainly shows that, and the actions of the banks themselves during the war period con-firm it, because they admit now that these controls must extend some distance into the post-war period. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> stated that representatives of the private banks came to him just prior to the outbreak of war with Japan and suggested the imposition of the very controls they are subject to to-day - or something very akin to them. The banks themselves recognized that Australia was in grave danger - not only its population, but also the banks and their assets and prospects - and that in a national emergency of that kind, everything depended on wise government action and control. Therefore, they readily submitted to it. I say without hesitation that the banks are not complaining about government control in the post-war period. It was their own suggestion in the first instance. </para>
                <para>War is not the only emergency that this country will have to face. I listened with great interest to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> in which he drew a picture of conditions in the depression and I heard the criticism by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> of his remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> stated that he doubted whether the sufferings of the last war were any greater than those of the people in the last depression. I make bold to say that I doubt whether the sufferings during the depression, caused by bankruptcy, unemployment, malnutrition and disruption of prospects, were not greater than the damage suffered in the present war through the loss of loved ones, the interruption of careers, the dislocation of industry and all the evils attendant upon war. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> I agree that the last depression left indelible injuries on the minds and bodies of Australian citizens, and it will take a long time for the tens of thousands afflicted to recover from those effects. I promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> who interjected, that when dealing with the depression I would advert to the report of the royal commission on that subject. Paragraph 540 of the report which dealt with this matter reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para>Without attempting an analysis of the causes of booms and depressions, it is imperative, before we comment upon the behaviour of the Australian monetary and banking system, to express our views as to the part which monetary measures played in the depression and recovery in Australia. No action by the monetary and banking system of Australia could have avoided some depression, although the system together with the Governments and, indeed, the community as a whole, must share Borne responsibility for the extent of the depression. The development of boom conditions could have been checked and the depth of the depression could have been lessened. Monetary measures alone did not produce recovery, but their effects would have been greater had they been taken earlier. </para>

                    <para>The proper policy for the Commonwealth Bank, as the depression developed, was one of expansion, using any necessary powers in that direction, and enabling the trading banks to do their share. As conditions improved, the proper policy was to cease expanding credit, and, if necessary, to contract, using any appropriate powers to bring the trading banks into line. Two of the most important monetary measures taken during the depression were the expansion of central bank credit hy means of treasury-bills in 1931 and 1932, and the movement in the exchange rate in January, 1931. In each case, in our opinion, the depression would have been lightened, and some of its worst effects avoided, if these measures had been taken earlier. </para>

A great deal of publicity has been given to one extract from that paragraph by private bank propagandists. The paragraph states - </para>

                <para class="block">The emphasis in that statement ought to be placed on the word ##"## deliberately ##"##. Then we come obviously to what was in the mind of the ##"## commission, that although the banks had not done it deliberately, they had nevertheless done it either through ignorance or inadvertence. That fact plainly emerges, and was commented on by the commission. I think that the inference which I have drawn is correct, having regard to the wording of the paragraph. </para>

The honorable senator is referring to an expansion of ##£##35,000,000 overseas and ##£##55,000,000 in Australia. The royal commission adverted to that, and the burden of its complaint, is that that action came too late. It was not done until 1932. As the commission pointed out, had (hat action been taken earlier, some of the worst effects of the depression would have been avoided. That charge is not levelled by me, but by the royal commission, and its complaint is that the movement on the part of the banks took place far too -late. </para>

In the last resort, too, the Central Bank must be prepared to carry out the policy laid down by the Government of the day, as the 1936 RoyalCommission on Banking recognized. But this does not mean reducing the Central Hank to subservience. </para>

                <para class="block">I agree with that. If I view the position correctly, the Government will intervene only in the event of an emergency. It will put first things first and see that the national interests are protected. Even in the worst emergency it will not pursue control into individual accounts. In a further measure on the subject of banking, which is to engage the attention of the Senate, it is set out that there must be no direction as to individual advances. Many distortions have been made of what the Government intends to do by means of the Commonwealth Bank. It will unquestionably exercise very real and necessary control, as even the trading banks admit, in the immediate post-war period. </para>
                <para>What is provided for in the bill is what the royal commission set out in paragraph 530 of its report. I frankly admit that the Government has made one departure in that respect. The commission recommended that before the Government enforced its will it should give an assurance that it was in a position to take, and would take, any action necessary to implement it. What is involved in the words, ##"##is in a position to take##"## has been dropped from the bill before us, and for a good reason. A go vernment elected by the people may come into the House of Representatives with an exceedingly strong majority and a mandate to carry out a particular policy, but it may be confronted by a hostile Senate, which by a political accident, only one-half of the members being elected every three years, might be in opposition to the will of both the Government and the people. So the Government, in framing this bill, has departed only in that particular from the recommendation of the royal commission. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Bank has never been formally created a central bank. It is in the position of Topsy, of <inline font-style="italic">Uncle Tom##'##s Cabin</inline> fame, who ##"##just growed ##"##, according to her own words. The bank assumed the position of a central bank by keeping control of the note issue and taking control of gold and the foreign exchange rate in the depression years. It succeeded in that regard, not only because of those activities, but also because of its own prestige and technical excellence. One of the functions of the central bank is to control the volume of credit in order to stabilize both internal and external currency, and take such steps as will preserve a reasonable level of employment and keep industry on an even keel. The central bank, in the emergency which faces us now, must go one step further in the post-war period at least, and direct to a considerable degree the distribution of credit. The proposal for a central bank contained in Part III. of the bill has the endorsement of the royal commission, which specifically advocated it. </para>

                    <para>Although it is unusual for a central bank to carry on trading bank activities and to control a savings bank, we consider it desirable that the Commonwealth Bank should do both. Through its trading bank activities it possesses powers of competing with the trading banks which can be exercised as and when required. Similarly, its savings bank activities add to its ability to regulate the volume of credit and enable it to compete, if necessary, with the State savings banks. We are of opinion that the use of its trading bank activities as an adjunct to central banking policy  13  in keeping with its central bank functions and is to bc approved. </para>

                        <para>- It is apparent that that will be the case by reason of the fact that the capital of the bank is fixed. If we read the working capital provisions of the bill, we shall see that the general banking division itself is given a fixed capital only, and no provision is made for loans to the general banking division. With the ##£##4,000,000 of its own capital and such transfers as come from its own credit reserves, the general division is to find its way against the private banks. Whatever profits it makes have to be divided in halves, and half will go to the National Debt Sinking Fund. Therefore, the general banking division of the Commonwealth Bank will be carrying even a heavier burden##'## than the private banks in the matter of paying their own income tax. </para>

                <para>The abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board is an action on the part of the Government that has provoked considerable opposition, and has been the subject of a good deal of contention. As honorable senators know, apart from the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor of the bank, six members of the board have to be selected from interests representing agriculture, commerce, finance and industry. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##'####]##</inline> The basic objection to a board of that nature is that the men so selected would have divided interests. As the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has said if the Commonwealth Bank is to be a truly national bank it must be divorced from all sectional interests. That view is contained in the third recommendation of the royal commission - (3.) The limitation on the field of choice of directors in Section 11 (2.) (6) of the Act should be removed. The members of the Board should be selected for capacity and diversity of experience and contact, and not as representatives of special interests. </para>
                <para class="block">It is apparent that the Government hai followed closely the recommendations of the royal commission. That recommendation underlies the objection of the Government to the appointment of six members of the Commonwealth Bank Board to represent special interests. The present board which is so constituted will be replaced by an Advisory Council consisting of officers of the Treasury and of the bank who will be entirely disinterested. </para>
                <para>I wish now to advert to the remarks of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> regarding the action of the Commonwealth Bank Board in .1931  during the depression when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, its then  chairman,  wrote to the##'## Commonwealth Government that, provided wages and pensions were reduced, and social services cut down, and other steps of that nature taken, the Commonwealth Bank would come to the aid of the Government in its efforts to relieve unemployment and help industry. That wa&lt; a perfect example of my contention that those who dictate monetary policy control governments, and ultimately control the nation by dictating the policies of governments. That bank boards are not disinterested was shown during the last general election campaign when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Claude</inline> Reading, the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, entered the fray on a purely controversial issue. The point as to whether money could be found in peace for the needs of the nation on anything like the same scale as it had been provided during the war was being debated, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Claude</inline> Reading entered the contest to say that that would not be possible in the post-war period. That may have been his view and also the view of the Commonwealth Bank Board. At the moment I am not concerned as to the correctness or otherwise of that view, but I point out that if he were a member of the Advisory Council that kind of thing could not have happened. That incident demonstrates that political considerations and sectional interests can influence a bank board constituted as the present Commonwealth Bank Board is constituted. It is well that the people of Australia should realize that the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has announced publicly that if the Government is defeated at the next elections, a new government will restore the Commonwealth Bank Board as at present constituted, and will delete from the act the provision that the banking and monetary affairs of this country shall be under the ultimate control of the Government. As I have said, it will be well for the people of Australia to keep that undertaking in mind between now and the next general elections. </para>

Should it wish to assess a situation or discover trends, it is free to consult any person or institution in the community. That is one of the normal functions of a bank; it is a practice which the Governor of the bank will no doubt adopt. </para>

                <para>I come now to the abolition of the note issue reserve. I support the proposals contained in the bill, which give effect to a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. The existing provision could have been got round in either of two ways. The royal commission has pointed out one way, namely, that if the exchange rate were increased the value of sterling held by the bank by way of reserves would be raised, and, therefore, a proportionate increase of the note issue could be made. But there is nothing to stop the Commonwealth Bank from making an issue of notes, and out of the proceeds purchasing sufficient sterling or gold to bring the reserve up to the established minimum of 25 per cent. </para>

                <para>There has been criticism of the provision empowering the bank to take shares in  any  undertaking that, it may help financially. It is not at all unusual for a lender to insist upon a certain number of shares being made available to him.  He doe##"##s so for a number of reasons. In the first place, he wishes  to  be assured that he will get copies of balance-sheets, and profit and loss accounts, and tthat he will have the right to attend meetings. Not infrequently  the  lender insists that he shall be made  ii  director of the concern, in such cases,  he  is required to hold a certain share qualification. Without knowing what  is  in the mind of the Government, I have no doubt that  the  power to take up shares in (.hat  way  will be used only for the purposes that I have indicated. In establishing .this department of the Commonwealth Bank the Government is departing from the practice followed in other countries. In England there are four corporations set up as adjuncts to the Hank of England for the purpose1 of financing industry. It is well to remember i  hat  Germany and Japan adopted a somewhat similar procedure, With the result  that  in both countries there was a rapid development of industry, which gave to  them,  a great deal of the power that has been demonstrated to the world during  the  last six years.  Whilst  I do not suggest that our industries should be diverted into similar directions, it is important to this young country that its secondary industries shall be developed, because,  as I  read present trends, we shall have  to  rely more and more upon ourselves in the future. </para>
                <para>I  do  not propose to deal with other aspects  of  the bill now, as there will be other opportunities to  do so.  I shall conclude  with  the thought with which I began, namely, that this bill  is  directed towards the true welfare  of the  people  ofAustralia.  This bill and the Banking Bill which  is  to come before us constitute, not a  sten.  but a leap along the path  to  Australian nationhood. The spirit  of  Australian nationhood was conceived on the 1st January. 1901. As I have wandered through the Australian War  Memorial  at Canberra, and have looked upon the relics  of  the war  of  1914##'##-18, I have experienced a feeling  of  awe. Iri the Hall  of  Remembrance, I witnessed evidences  of  the birth  of  a nation. T realized there that this Australian nation was born in blood and travail in the war  of  ##"##1914-18. It  is  now undergoing its baptism  of  blood in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> present greater war. 1 believe that the measure which we are lOW C considering##'## will accelerate Australia##'##s progress towards true nationhood, and, therefore, I feel honoured to have this opportunity to support it with my voice and vote. </para>

                    MATTNER  (South Australia) ##[##5.42 j. - This bill may be best described as a- botch, because it is definitely eonfusing to honest, thrifty and progressive citizens who wish to know about banks and their functions. The progeny of this measure will be paper 11011133- - by caucus out of printing press. I shall npt traverse the history of banking or discuss the views propounded by monetary theorists, as honorable senators have already had to listen for hours to almost every known theory, but those who have advanced such theories have failed to show that they constitute sound banking practice. It is evident that the apostle? of banking reform are quite prepared to experiment with the other fellow##'##s money, but are not prepared to risk their own. The acid test of a theory is willingness to risk one##'##s own money in giving effect to it. It is remarkable that nearly everyone who condemns the present bank-  ing system adds that he is not a shareholder iri any bank, has never had a deposit in or has been a customer of a trading bank.

                        <para>- Some people s##'##ay that the policy of the private banks is not iri the interests of the people. The banks operate under a charter granted by Parliament. Their capital is subscribed by their shareholders. Their  business is conducted in order to give service to their depositors and customers who either have a current account or borrow from the bank. They are the only people who have the right to influence a bank##'##s policy or its business methods. To say that the general public, including persons who are not shareholders, depositors or customers of a bank, should dictate the policy of the trading banks and savings banks is quite wrong. I am not a member of a trade union. I do not subscribe to the funds of any trade union. Therefore, the affairs and policy of all trade unions are closed to me, and rightly so. I have no moral or legal right even to attempt to say how any union of which I am not a member should be conducted. This rule holds good equally in respect of the conduct of private banks. Let us now deal with private banks as they are conducted in Australia at present. I fail to see why honorable senators opposite should hark on what happened 500 or even 50 years ago. We are not concerned with such events, nor are we  concerned  with the banking system of any country .except Australia. The bill must be related to conditions as they exist in Australia at present and the manner in which this legislation will affect the future of banking in this country. I propose to give my views as one who is a depositor, a borrower and a customer of one of our trading banks, the Bank of Adelaide. As a customer of that bank, I have had fair average business transactions with it for many years, in good times and lean times, in periods of boom and periods of depression. There is nothing mysterious or secret about a bank##'##s transactions. Provided the bank and its customer observe the sound rule of straight dealing their business transactions will develop to their mutual satisfaction. I emphasize the importance of straight dealing because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> said, ##"## Our present financial system, to use a mild term, is one of the greatest rackets and swindles ever known ##"##. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> should substantiate that charge or admit his error. Or has he taken a course in mendacity?  His  charge impugns the honour of about 25,000 bank officials, because it implies that they are accessories to a swindle. But the fact is that officials of banks are honest and perform honest service. They are doing a job of national importance; they are of high standing and observe a high code of business honour. If the officials of our banks were to go on strike - and other sections of the community have gone on. strike with less provocation - the people would realize their value to the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> also said that the National Bank of Australasia Limited closed its doors in 1893, and that some of its depositors are still waiting for their money. What are the facts with relation to that bank? In 1893 the bank did close its doors and could not meet its commitments immediately. It had to defer payment of approximately ##£##6,800,000. But by March, 1900, every penny of that amount had been paid to the original depositors. In addition, interest at an average rate of 4##£## per cent, was paid on the amount outstanding each year until the whole of the sum of ##£##6,800,000 was progressively liquidated in seven years. Thus the bank paid to depositors their deposits in full, plus interest. </para>

                <para>Reverting to banking practices, I possess a cheque-book, and use it too, and I hope to be in a position to use it in the future. I have yet to meet a depositor with a trading bank who could draw, or PaY, by cheque an amount greater than tie actual monetary deposit, or security, lodged with the bank in his name. With respect to loans, the only money a bank can lend is that which is placed on fixed deposit with it, and a proportion of the money in its current accounts. This percentage is a definite amount determined by banking practice over a long period of years. During the war, the Commonwealth Government has utilized ##£##240,000,000 of this money at 15s. per cent. ; and because of governmental action the customers of the trading banks cannot obtain a loan, advance or overdraft so long as the war lasts. No one who trades with a bank wants to submit to such control after the war ends. The trading banks do not and cannot create credit. No private trading bank, or government trading bank, should have the right to create credit. If and when credit is required, it should be issued under a new department of the Commonwealth Bank to be known as the Commonwealth Central Bank. As I foresee the future, and I believe it will be bright for Australia, it will be unnecessary to issue credit because sufficient work will be available for every person willing and able to do a fair day##'##s work for a fair day##'##s pay. This profitable employment will establish real stability, progress and a higher standard of living. The Commonwealth Central Bank should be clothed with the necessary powers to issue credit if required ; it should control the credit already in existence and the note issue, and should be in charge of foreign exchange rates. This would once and for all the bogy that trading banks create credit. Therefore, I urge the Government to take this opportunity to set up a Commonwealth Central Bank, and a Commonwealth Trading and Savings Bank, to be controlled by a board of directors appointed by the Government, the board to consist of twelve or fourteen members selected from representatives of every important phase of business, industry, primary production and labour organizations. It is important that representatives of labour organizations take their proper place in the management of the financial affairs of the country, because it is only when men are entrusted with the responsibility that they realize there is no easy way to sound finance. Under the general supervision of a board of directors, there should be a separate administration of the Commonwealth Central Bank and a separate administration for the Commonwealth Trading and Savings Bank, because the functions of the central bank differ entirely from those of the Trading and Savings Bank. The board should work in close co-operation with the government and Treasurer of the day, but the Treasurer should not be able to direct the board on important issues without parliamentary approval. These proposals which I have outlined differ from those embodied in the measure in two vital respects: First, the board of directors should be responsible to Parliament instead of the Treasurer of the day; and, secondly, separate administration should be provided in respect of the central bank and the Trading and Savings Bank. As every action of the central bank will affect the financial position of every person in Australia, the people##'##s wishes mast be expressed through Parliament; and discussion in Parliament is the only safeguard to ensure the protection of their rights. The bill completely botches up the central bank##'##s functions and the activities of the Trading and Savings Bank, because it gives to the existing bank new trading activities together with tremendous new powers of central banking, all under the control of one man. Labour##'##s cry is ##"## democratic representation ##"##, but here we find a Labour Government in control in both branches of the legislature reverting to a financial dictatorship under which one man will regiment and direct the finances of every person in Australia and thereby direct employment by controlling the avenues of employment of every person. The appointment of a financial dictator will never restore to the people control of the central bank. </para>

                <para>This bill will open the way for unlimited expansion of credit. To prevent that disaster - the unlimited expansion of credit would be a disaster of great magnitude - there should be certain safeguards including a statutory limit to the note issue of the central bank, which could not be exceeded without parliamentary approval; and a statutory amount of gold or sterling to be held by the central bank, not necessarily as a reserve against the note issue, but as a buffer against any government squandering the overseas assets of this country. That buffer would be like a stack of hay held by a farmer as a reserve supply of fodder. When the cold winds of winter blew, he would not feel his pocket cramped. So, in the financial world, if the reserve of which I have spoken were held, when the cold winds of adversity blow, and I venture to say they may blow, we shall not feel our pockets cramped. Tinder the industrial finance##"## provisions, the solvency of the central bank could be impaired, because no limits are placed on advances, and these advances are of a highly speculative nature. .Speculative finance should not be the function of the central bank; it would be better suited to a special organization which could use the existing structure of the trading banks, in which to function. The Government should instruct the Commonwealth Trading Bank, in conjunction with the other nine trading banks in this country, to set up a properly constituted organization to provide finance for industry throughout Australia. Thus the great store of knowledge of our highly trained bank organization throughout the length and breadth of the land could be used. The service would be conducted  efficiently  and cheaply and, moreover, it would be readily available to the community. It is the small producer, either in secondary or primary industry, who relies on bank credit, and it is his strength that gives stability to Australia. The Commonwealth Central Bank would then function in one of its correct spheres, by advancing the finances required. This set-up would overcome all possibility of political interference and would curb all wild-cat ventures, which could, but must not be allowed to, destroy the efficiency of the central bank. </para>
                <para>My remarks have been aimed at improving the bill. The measure is designed to alter the functions of the Commonwealth Bank. It is the first instalment of the programme of socialist legislation visualized by the Government. By controlling the nation##'##s purse, the Government automatically will control the people and the country. I am not concerned with what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> may have said in 1943 about his plans, or lack of them, to nationalize finance and industry. It is true that the Government did obtain a majority at the last elections; but it was not given a mandate by the people to revolutionize the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para class="block">What the people must know is that the Government is implementing the first plank of its policy, namely the nationalization of banking. War or no war, it is proceeding with the business of nationalizing, or socializing, the financial and industrial life of this country. Government supporters admit that this measure alone does not fulfil their wild dreams, and have threatened the country with further doses of socialistic legislation. This measure which is sugar-coated has a high sounding preamble authorizing the Commonwealth Bank to aim at currency stability and full employment; but these conditions cannot be brought about by parliamentary enactment. The plain hard fact Australians must learn is that the stability of currency and the highest level of economic activity depend upon sound financial administration and the maintenance of confidence - the very factors which this measure threatens to destroy. </para>

                    <para>.- This bill has been widely discussed both in the House of Representatives and in this chamber. We have listened to an extraordinarily vivid and comprehensive discussion of what, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> is one of the milestones in Australian history. To-day, this Parliament is making history as very few parliaments have been able to do in the history of this Commonwealth. We are laying the foundations of the system by which the great problem which this Government, or whatever government is in power, will have to face at the conclusion of this war, will be tackled - the problem of re-establishing in civil life discharged members of our fighting forces, and of transferring from industry those men and women who ceaselessly during the last five years have devoted their whole time and attention to our war effort. That problem can be met successfully only if the economic set-up of this country remains entirely in the hands of the Government. We cannot afford to contemplate a recurrence of events which have taken place in this Parliament in comparatively recent years. Although I am one of the ##"## babies ##"## of this Parliament, I can remember a resolution asking for ##£##500,000 for unemployment relief at </para>

                <para class="block">Christinas-time being moved in the House of Representatives. The reply of the government of the day was that money was not available for such a grant. A few years earlier, when a Labour administration wanted to take certain action to alleviate distress during the depression, and asked the Commonwealth Bank for a fiduciary issue of ##£##18,000,000, certain individuals outside this Parliament - individuals upon whom the people of this country had no check and whose names were practically unknown to the citizens of this country - were able to tell the Government that the money would not be made available. In other words, they took the power of government away from, the Government. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to survey in detail the provisions of this measure. They have been very well surveyed already by other honorable senators; but there are one or two aspects of it which I should like to discuss. Honorable senators opposite have spoken of the great job that the private banking institutions of this country have done, first of all, for their ##"##shareholders. It has been claimed, in effect, that the great body of shareholders in those institutions is beholden to the banks for the dividends which have been paid and that any interference by the Commonwealth Bank such as that contemplated by this measure would place those dividends of shareholders  in  jeopardy. That is an interesting point of view, particularly when one surveys the actual dividends that have been paid by the private banking institutions of this country over the last ten years. In that period, the dividends have averaged approximately 3 per cent, on shareholders##'## funds, and it seems to me that the best we can do for the bank shareholders is to close up these institutions as soon as possible, and allow the shareholders to get their money back and invest it in Commonwealth loans. Looking at the matter from a purely financial and pecuniary point of view, the alleged great job that these directors have done for their shareholders has been to pay them a rate of interest less than that which they would have obtained had their money been in Commonwealth loans. However, there may be reasons for that, and I shall proceed to tell honorable senators why I think that the shareholders of the banks have not received the return on their money that they are entitled to. </para>
                <para>First, banking policy is such that these institutions do not distribute in dividends as much of their profits as other commercial companies do. They endeavour to build up terrific reserves. One of the first tasks which a bankseems to set itself is that of establishing huge edifices in the most expensive quarter of the capital cities. One finds that banking institutions go to the limits of building restrictions in the capital cities and set up structures which obviously do not return to them in rentals a very good rate of interest. That, is one avenue in which the profits of the bank are expended. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> pointed out, the ordinary shareholders in the banks have no real voice in the management of these concerns. T recall that not very long ago the Bank of New South Wales, the oldest bank in this country, indulged in an act of interference in private business. It walked into the political arena in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson was then the general manager and tried hard to organize the Labour movement in that State. I cannot tell how many thousands of pounds the Bank of New South Wales spent in its efforts, but the story is that, in New South Wales at that time thenwas a break-away movement from the Lang Labour party. The faction which had broken away called itself the Heffron Labour party, and comprised certain trade anions that bad a large share of interests in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily.</inline> They were opposed to Lang, and by a majority vote of the shareholding unions, the board of directors of that newspaper was changed. They discovered, however, that over a period of years Lang had invested more than ##£##19,000 of his money to keep the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> going. The members of the Heffron Labour party immediately turned to none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson who, through the Bank of New South Wales, provided about ##£##42,000 so that these break-away unionists might buy out Lang##'##s share in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> and assume full control of it. There is no doubt that when the Bank of New </para>
                <para class="block">South Wales finally wound up the affairs of the newspaper it lost about half the money it had provided. </para>
                <para>When dealing with this matter in an. other chain her in 1938, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> detailed how <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, by every effort at his command, tried to further the interests of the Bank of New South Wales with the Labour party. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bevin, who was Minister of Labour in the Churchill National Government, was on his way to Australia some years ago he was met in New Zealand by a representative Of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, who asked him if he would arrange to meet the leaders of the Heffron Labour party when he arrived in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> replied that he would prefer to find out something about the Heffron Labour party before he gave his consent. When he arrived in Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson met him at the boat and arranged to have a quick talk to him then and there about the set-up of the Labour party in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Me</inline> vin stated that he had no knowledge at that time of the breakaway movement, but he made some inquiries from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, who explained that it was a party that had broken away from the official Labour party in New South Wales and formed another organization. He added that the Heffron Labour party was anxious to discuss its problems with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin. Mr. Bevin</inline> then said that he had no desire to talk to a break-away Labour movement and pointed out that if a leader of the Australian Labour party caine to England he would not think of talking to break-away members of the British Labour party, but to the leaders of the official Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson did not get very far on that occasion because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> said he would talk to the official Labour leaders and find out the position. </para>
                <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson was not to be thwarted so easily he waited for another opportunity, and it came on the occasion nf the garden party at the home of Major-General Macarthur-Onslow, at Camden, given to the delegates to the Lapstone conference, which Mi\ Bevin wan attending. In the course of conversation <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-.

Generally, a new Labour organization is required in New South Wales Referring to the leadership, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> said that the Heffron party claimed that Labour could hot win with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson, was in accord with that view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> inquired whether##"## it was a fact that his, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson##'##s Government was in power, and if so, why he wanted Labour lo win. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson##'##s reply was to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> did not quite understand politics in New South Wales. He said, ##"## It is different here. What we want in New South Wales is a ##'## properly led ##'## Opposition. We have not got that with Lang ##"##. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin##'##s</inline> final summing up was that it seemed very strange to him to find a leading banker so deeply interested in the affairs of the Labour party as to have such a close alliance with men who claimed to be militant Labour representatives. </para>
                <para>There, in a nutshell, is the story of the trading banks that set themselves up as being beyond reproach. They were meddling in politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> has spoken about spending one##'##s own money and the courage needed to do it. It did not cost <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson a penny to spend that ##£##42,000 of the shareholders##'## money. One can be fairly certain that at the annual meeting of the bank he did not discuss with the shareholders what he had done with the money used tn buy out Lang##'##s interest in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor</inline></para>

                    He did that with the specific purpose of extending the power of the Bank of New South Wales over the Labour party and the grip of the private banks on politics. He wanted to reach the stage where it did not matter what party was in power, it would have to obey the voice of the trading banks. It would be interesting to know how much of the depositors##'## money the private banks have spent for the purpose of villifying this Government because it has brought down bills to amend the banking legislation. It would also be interesting to know how much money was spent on newspaper advertisements and organization throughout the Commonwealth in order to build up opposition to the national security regulations governing banking. There has not been a public uprising against the bill ; on the contrary, the public, generally speaking, has welcomed the measure with open arms.

                        <para>- They have shown every sign of it. Members on this side of the chamber have received not only sheaves of propaganda inspired by the banks, but also many letters and telegrams congratulating the Government on taking a step which it considers should have been taken years ago. The trading banks have adopted the same tactics on previous occasions to protect their own interests. In their propaganda, they began by pointing to the little man and suggesting that it is in his interests and those of the poor shareholders, and the man on the street who never had a pound, that they are working. I shall read a circular letter, which was sent to the managers of trading banks. It is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators have received voluminous mails on this subject and I, personally, received 32 letters at the same address at Flindersstreet, Melbourne, on the one day. I was also interested to notice the exact similarity of the letters which I received from, such places as Maroubra and Gum </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Scrub, via Telegraph Point, near Kempsey. Although those are widely separated in New South Wales, the text of the letters is identical, the same words are underlined in each case. That is proof positive that the letters are part of the trading bank propaganda. That is an indication of how the trading banks were  prepared to spend the shareholders##'## money. I am not very impressed when I hear the story of the marvellous financial knowledge and genius of the men controlling private trading banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> appear to be most anxious that there should be some one controlling the banks who knows something about financial policy. That is exactly what the bill provides, and the Government proposes to abolish the Commonwealth Bank Board, which represents only sectional interests, ft was all right to put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ##"##</inline> Jim ##"## Ashton on the board, because he was an excellent polo player. That gave him the qualifications necessary to represent the agricultural industries. When he was asked about his knowledge of finance, he admitted that he did not know anything about it. This shows that the control of banking must be placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank, which will get its policy from the government of the day. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased that the Government has introduced this bill. The future welfare of the nation depends upon the Commonwealth Parliament running its own business. Wo can no longer afford to have the interference with Commonwealth policy which has occurred since the establishment of federation. The late  President  .Roosevelt truly said ##"## A necessitous man is not a free man ##"##. If the Opposition ever returns to the treasury bench it will find thai it cannot eliminate this measure from tin- statute-book, as the Leader of the Opposition in the House nf Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> has rashly promised to do. The effect of the application of the banking proposals of the Government will be such that the community will have accepted them as a permanent policy, as they have already rejected the propaganda indulged in by the private banks in the last six months. That propaganda has fallen so flat that, as far as the community is concerned, this bill is already an accomplished fact. In country districts one hears nothing but commendation of the Government upon this measure and the Banking Bill. The memories of the people are not so short as to forget the terrifying days of the depression. A prominent business man in Sydney said to me recently - ##"## I support the banking proposals of the Government. The people of this country can take almost anything, whether plagues, pestilences, war or famine, but they cannot stand another depression like that of 1930. Anything which the Government can do to make a repetition of the depression days difficult will have the support of the great thinking mass of the men and women of this country ##"##. </para>
                    <para class="block">The farmers were brought to the deplorable position in which they found themselves in the depression period largely by unparalleled lending by the private banks. Had a Commonwealth authority been in existence for the purpose of reviewing the overall position, and had it warned the financial institutions not to continue to lend money on properties and thus inflate their values, the desperate developments of those days, which were too much for the struggling farmers, might have been prevented. When, throughout the world, spending was curtailed and we found difficulty in selling our primary products overseas, the primary producers were almost instantly ##"## on their uppers ##"## and they will not forget the treatment they received from the private banks. Farmers who had worked good properties for many years were encouraged to borrow by local bank managers who knew nothing about primary production, but the sight of easy money and a promise of increased prices for wheat and wool was too big a temptation for the farmers to resist. </para>

A definite policy of expansion was followed by a policy of deflation, and that was when the Labour party said that the continuance of credit expansion of some kind would have been of value. Had the sum of ##£##18,000,000 asked for in the House of Representatives when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> was Treasurer been made available, it would have been of considerable help,  but the Senate rejected the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- But how much of it was provided to meet the short-term loans which the Bruce-Page Government had made as part of its policy ? Those loans had to be met before the Scullin Government had been in office four months, and that closed the overseas money market to that Administration. Those days should be quickly forgotten by the members pf the Opposition because they do not reflect credit on members of this Parliament who, at a time of national need, were not big enough to face up to the problems of that period. Henceforward, we shall place the responsibility with regard to financial policy upon the government of the day, and if it does not stand up to it, the people can turn it out of office at the elections. That is why I am anxious that the responsibility in this matter shall always be placed on the shoulders of the members of the government. On every street corner, the people know the names of the responsible Ministers, and they arc the men whom the people will blame if things go wrong. The names of men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson are not known to more than one man in a hundred in an industrial area. Why should he and men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> have power to tell the Government what to do in matters of finance? No responsibility can be placed on their shoulders, because they arc not responsible to anybody, not even to the shareholders of the banks with which they are associated. </para>

                        has referred to the issue of notes, but even before the war, when the note issue was about ##£##50,000,000, it was increased every Christmas by ##£##10,000,000 or ##£##12,000,000 in order that the people might do their Christmas shopping. That proves more convincingly than anything else the value of notes in the community. They are simply a means of exchange. When I first entered Parliament in  193S, an application was made by the Labour Opposition for a grant of ##£##500.000 for the relief of unemployment. The application was rejected by the government of the day ##"## because there was no money ##"##.

                            <para>- Yes, they are all puppets. The private banks have brought these legislative proposals upon themselves. Had they been content to do the fair thing in their own financial sphere and keep out of politics, they might have postponed the introduction of this legislation, but because of their influence for evil as far as the common people are concerned, the present Government was unable to wait any longer and has determined to place in the hands of the people the power to plan for the future without interference. Had the Parliament had this power in 1930, the brunt of the depression would have been eased, hut we shall now make certain of having the power when our troops return from overseas, when gigantic water conservation schemes have to be carried out, when the railway gauges of Australia have to be standardized, when homes have to be built in thousands, and when other developmental works, even the construction of railways for defence purposes, have to be put in hand. That work can be done only through one channel, the Commonwealth Bank, under the control of this Parliament, which stands for the people of this country. </para>

                    <para class="block">Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to emphasize that under National Security Regulations the Government already possesses all the powers which it seeks under this measure. Indeed, those regulations so control all financial matters that not only trading banks and other financial institutions, but also the financial transactions of individual citizens are completely under government control. The Government now seeks to perpetuate these war-time controls by statutory authority, but it is not. in the best interests of any country that its financial institutions should be subject to the whim of whatever political party happens to be in power. I venture to say that in no other country has a government taken advantage of war-time conditions to do what the Commonwealth Government proposes to do under this bill. In a matter which affects the life of every citizen of Australia - even the boy with a few pennies in his money-box - it would have been better to have appointed a select committee, consisting of members of all political parties, and representatives of banking and commercial interests, to confer in an atmosphere free from political bias, and prepare a report for the guidance of the Parliament. Such a body would be a cross-section of the people of Australia, and its considered judgment could have been followed with safety. Action along those lines would have inspired confidence in the country##'##s financial structure. Finance should not be the plaything of any political party. </para>
                    <para>For many years the Labour party has advocated a change of the monetary system; since the last depression it has been more insistent than ever on such a change. No good purpose is to be served by going back to the beginning of the banking system, as some honorable senators have done, but we do well to reflect that Australia has made remarkable progress under the financial system which is condemned by the Government and its supporters. Australia##'##s development compares more than favorably with that of any other country. What is wrong with a banking system under which such progress has been made? The only argument advanced in favour of this legislation is that during the depression money was not made available to provide employment which would have granted relief to those who suffered from lack of purchasing power. The memory of those flays is still a nightmare to many people. ##[## candidly admit that the banking institutions could have done more than they did to help sufferers during the depression. The remedy which was then applied to the evil was too severe; but whatever we may think of the Premiers plan, and the injury it caused to many people in our midst, Australia recovered from the depression more quickly than did any other country, largely because of the policy of thrift and the curtailment of unnecessary expenditure which was put into operation. Those who suffered during the depression included many besides wage-earners; the people who previously had enjoyed a fairly comfortable existence found their standard of living reduced very greatly. Those people were not seen among the many who were forced to line up to accept assistance, but they were among the greatest sufferers from, the depression. How can any honorable senator charge the private banks with having caused the depression? ##"##Why did the depression hit Australia so severely? The answer is plain. It was mainly because, as the result of the world-wide character of the depression, we lost our overseas markets. Remembering that fact, it is useless to say that we can prevent another depression merely by controlling financial policy within this country. By inflating our currency, the Government might be able to give some assistance to our people; but so long as we have a small population, and remain dependent to so great a degree upon overseas markets for the disposal of our primary products, and those markets are suddenly closed to us, we cannot continue to spend freely and, at the same time, maintain a sound financial system. It ##'##s as clear as the noonday sun that, while production is the source of our wealth, the value of that wealth depends upon our trade with other countries. If Australia were developed like the United States of America and we had a population sufficient to consume all the goods we produced, we could possibly afford to adopt an isolationist policy and, as it were, live to ourselves. In such circumstances, it would not matter two hoots what system of finance we maintained so long as it was operated equitably between the consumer and the producer. However, the fact remains that Australia must take its place in the future alongside other nations. Therefore, if we commence to. ##"##monkey##"## with our financial system, other countries will soon lose confidence in us, and we shall be left with no markets for our exportable products. Any government which monkeys with our financial system does a great disservice to this country. ##"##What good will really be achieved by the measure? All of us look back with pride upon the progress made by the Commonwealth Bank. That institution started from a small beginning. Its establishment was strongly opposed by certain people, but to-day all of us realize that its establishment has been to the benefit of the nation. Originally, it was placed under the control of a governor; but, later, as its activities expanded, it was placed under the control of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Like other honorable senators, I have received circulars alleging that the Bruce Page Government destroyed the original charter of the Commonwealth Bank by appointing the board to carry out all the functions which previously had been carried out by the Governor. Obviously, as the bank##'##s activities expanded, the responsibility of controlling the bank became too great a burden to be shouldered by one man. That was the reason for the appointment of the Commonwealth Bank Board. In addition, the members of the board represented all sections of the community. It constituted a truly representative cross-section of the people. I ask honorable senators opposite to study the wonderful expansion of the Commonwealth Bank since it was placed under the control of the board. That expansion tells its own story of achievement. ##"##We look with pride upon the record of the bank in conjunction with the private banks in financing our war effort. I fail to see why that system, which has proved of such benefit to us in very difficult times, should now be cast aside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O##'##Flaherty</inline> alleged that previous governments ##"## packed ##"## the board in the interests of the private financial institutions. Such statements tend to destroy the confidence of the people in the bank. Our people as a whole regard the Commonwealth Bank as the sheet anchor of our future financial structure. Honorable senators opposite are always ready to denounce monopolies, but under the bill if is proposed to make of the Commonwealth Bank the greatest monopoly we have yet known in our history. Surely, they will not deny that they owe their presence in Parliament very largely to the support of the trade unions, and that in future those bodies will dictate the financial policy of Labour governments to which effect will be given through the Commonwealth Bank under the system of control proposed under the measure. Such control should be placed only in the hands of people absolutely beyond party political influences. The record and progress of the Commonwealth Bank to date prove conclusively that that is the best form of control of the national bank. I fail to understand the criticism of honorable senators opposite of. the private banking institutions. I remind them that the Commonwealth Bank Board under which the Commonwealth Bank in association with the private banks has done such a magnificent job during the war in financing our war effort was appointed before the Labour Government assumed office. Why should we not retain the services of these great captains of industry who, regardless of party politics, gave so willingly of their services to the nation in its hour of trial. The Government has relied upon such men to establish our vital war industries. In that work those men proved their absolute disinterestedness where the interests of the nation were paramount. Is there any reason to suppose that they will be less patriotic, or will not act honorably, merely because they happen to be members of the Commonwealth Bank Board entrusted with the control of that great institution? Various Ministers have paid tribute to the achievements accomplished by our captains of industry, and their contribution to our war effort; but, honorable senators opposite now say that such men are not to be trusted in control of the Commonwealth Bank. Indeed, one honorable senator declared that through the board the private banking institutions were working a ramp and a swindle. Long before the Commonwealth Bank was established, the same interests and their representatives contributed vitally to the development of the nation. At that time the private banks were the only institutions to which people in need of help could turn. There may have been occasions when many people felt that the private banks did not assist them as they should, and were perhaps a little too strict in making clients conduct their businesses on commercial lines. In doing so, the banks rendered very good service to this country. In any case it cannot be said that those institutions acted unworthily. To-day, in association with the Commonwealth Bank, the private banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions are making a worthy contribution towards the financing of our war effort. The action of the Government in bringing down its banking proposals ##'##while the war is still on is an act of base ingratitude when we remember what the private banks have done in the interests of the nation. Would it not be more reasonable to allow those interests to carry on as they are carrying on at present until six months after the war ends, that is, until the lapse of the national security legislation under which they are now thoroughly controlled? The Government should refer this problem to a select committee representative of all parties in the Parliament, or to a royal commission representative of all interests concerned ; or, better still, it should make this matter an issue at the next general elections. So long as the war lasts, the Government cannot justify its action in introducing this legislation. I oppose the bill, because the Government has no mandate from the people to introduce such revolutionary changes in our monetary and banking system. The Government is rendering a disservice to the people of this country. Under war-time measures it has all the power that it requires. Let first things come first. Let us first win the war, and then let this matter be decided by the people in an atmosphere free from party bias. Surely honorable senators opposite /10 not believe that all the financial knowledge of this chamber is on the Government side, and that the Treasurer must always have the last word. If this legislation becomes law, there will be a tendency, especially just prior to elections, tor whatever government is in power to he generous with the people##'##s money, whereas at present control is in the bands of a board free from political interference or bias, and therefore able to exercise impartial judgment. That is a matter of the utmost importance, not only to Parliament but also to the people of this  country, and one which may have a great bearing upon the confidence of oversells nations in the stability of this  country.  I shall leave further remarks on this measure until the bill reaches the committee stage. I shall- vote against the second reading. </para>

At that time anti-Labour forces created a scare amongst investors by suggesting that the Labour party intended to assume control of the banks. People rushed to withdraw their money, and in one case the doors of a bank were actually closed. A similar endeavour is being made to discredit this Government and its banking legislation. When the banking bills were first announced, the private banks embarked upon a campaign of propaganda against the Government, Thousands of circulars bearing such headings as ##"##Control of Bank Credit##"##, ##"## Protest Against Proposed Banking Legislation##"## and ##"##Send this to your Federal Member ##"## were sent out. Having access to the electoral rolls of Western Australia, I endeavoured to check some of the names and addresses given on these pamphlets, and I found that most of the names were not on the rolls. The circulars which were posted to me had some value, of course, because I was able to tear the stamps off and send them to the various schools and colleges where pupils were interested in collecting postage stamps; but others, which were merely distributed by hand, had no value at all and found their way immediately to the waste-paper basket.

                            <para>- It was the trading banks that caused the depression and increased unemployment when they began to call in overdrafts. A relative of mine who is a farmer was given six months in which to pay off his overdraft. He applied, to a. trading bank, which immediately asked him what bank ha was dealing with. When he gave the information, he was informed that the trading bank to which he was applying could not help him. He asked me to assist him and I took him to a financier in Perth, who advanced him sufficient funds to clear his overdraft. In another case, a businessman who employed 30 men was asked to reduce his overdraft. The only way he could do so was to dismiss some of his hands and use the income formerly used to pay their wages to meet his obligations. This bill will prevent that sort of dealing, and it is designed to help industry. That is one of the great needs of the country A suggestion has been made that primary producers are opposed to the bill, but they are most favorable to it. There ie no need for the people to be afraid of the Commonwealth Bank and, whether a Labour government or a Liberal government is in office, its affairs will be administered for the benefit of the people. I also approve the principles that when municipalities or the Government finance contracts the funds should be obtained from the Commonwealth Bank. The people##'##s work should be paid for with the people##'##s money.

                    <para>.- I appreciate the courtesy of the Minister in furnishing the answer to the question I asked, outlining the Government##'##s policy relating to mining in the post-war period. The appointment of the Mining Advisory Panel should assist the gold-mining industry as well as other forms of mining. Reports have appeared during the last few days to the effect that the United States Government has lifted all bans from gold-mining in that country with a view to stimulating gold production and providing employment. </para>

                <para>To-day. I asked the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> a question concerning the newspaper report of a probable shortage of penicillin following a strike at a glass works in Sydney. I regret that, by an oversight, I did not address the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who represents the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> may be able to throw some light on the matter. </para>

He desires me to correct that suggestion and to state that he has never at any time been a member of the consultative council. If he had been a member, I would not regard it as anything to his detriment, because that body consisted of men of admirable qualities. He served with great distinction in the last war, and since then he has been an active member of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia. He was Director-General of Medical Services for the Department of the Army until ill health compelled him to relinquish that position. He has been one of the strongest supporters of the league from its early days, and is also one of the hardest workers for the Australian Red Cross Society. </para>

                        <para>- That stands to his credit. Whatever else may be said in his favour, if he is opposed to the policy of the Labour party I greatly admire him for it. That is something for which he needs to make no apology, and he is as much entitled to his own political views as is the honorable senator. No man has a better record of public service in the interests of returned soldiers organizations . than that gentleman. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> remarked that he was a member of the consultative council, but he has never been associated with it. As Director-General of Medical Supplies ##"## he held the rank of general, and was entrusted by the government of the day with complete authority in respect of the medical services of the Army. He has served his country well. He spoke at the meeting of protest organized by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia as a citizen and as a member of the league, quite apart from any political associations. I should be glad if the Minister representing the Minister for the Army would supply me with the information I sought by means of a question I asked earlier to-day as to supplies of penicillin being made available to the Australian forces in forward areas. </para>

We shall be wasting our time in bringing tourists to this country unless we can provide them with hotel accommodation equal to that obtainable elsewhere. I do not know whether it would be possible for private enterprise to establish a chain of tourist##"## hotels in Australia, but the first thing one notices in Canada is that in every city of importance there is a magnificent hotel owned by the Canadian Government. In some of the states, the Government works in conjunction with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. In Vancouver one hotel has closed down and another is conducted jointly by the Canadian Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. After a visit to Canada one cannot help recalling the magnificent hotels such as the Chateau  Frontenac  in Quebec. In Australia we have not one first-class hotel comparable with those of Canada. Although Melbourne and Sydney are bigger than any city in Canada there is no hotel comparable with some of those in -cities of the si se of Winnipeg, with a population of under 300,000. If we desire tourists in Australia, we must give them attractive accommodation so that they will wish to return to this country. At  Petropolis,  in Brazil, there is a hotel with 3,000 bedrooms with bathrooms. When a monarch like King Carol wishes to take his gold where he can spend ##£##200 a day he goes to Petropolis </para>

                        <para>- He would not have been able to keep it long there. Wherever one goes in America one finds attractive hotel accommodation. There are wonderful dining facilities and good floor shows and bathing facilities. I ask the Leader of the Senate whether we are to depend upon private enterprise to provide the necessary hotel accommodation for tourists, or whether the Government will take a step forward and co-operate with private industry in providing accommodation comparable with that obtainable in any other part of the world. I suggest that a company should be formed in which the Government should  hold51 per cent. of the shares. It could possibly raise some of the necessary capital from people interested in hotels and the entertainment business,##'## and the company could operate on a basis similar to that on which Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited is conducted. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that it is absurd that people have to guzzle their beer for twenty minutes before 6 p.m., and then go without it for the rest of the evening. I urge the Leader of the Senate to consider my proposal without delay; so that hotels may be built in this country which will compare favorably with the best in any other part of the world. It is necessary to give to tourists such attention in the matter of hotel accommodation that they will be anxious to revisit this country. </para>

                    <para>. - I draw attention to the acute shortage of galvanized barbed wire. Black wireis now made available, but it has a short life and is not worth using. In view of the urgent demand for galvanized barbed wire, I suggest that the Government should release supplies as soon as possible, because of the difficult position in which farmers find themselves. </para>

                <para>Increased supplies of power kerosene should be released to the farming community, because it is necessary in agricultural production. In some of the outlying areas, the farmers experience difficulty in getting sufficient power kerosene to enable them to carry on their work, and I hope that the Government will endeavour to release additional supplies. </para>
                <para>I also direct attention to the need for prompt payment to farmers for vegetable seeds. Farmers##'## organizations have complained to me that growers have been waiting for months for payment for seeds already supplied Prompt payments would assist them to meet the interest on their overdrafts, and square their accounts. </para>
