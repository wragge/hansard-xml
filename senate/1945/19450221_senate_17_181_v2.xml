It is unlikely, therefore, that the Commonwealth can expect any great increase in help from the United Nations&#39; pool of shipping.

My Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> represented Australia. At the conference there was a great degree of agreement on the technical standards and procedure to govern international air navigation, but there was understandable difference of opinion on politico-economic aspects. The Australian-New Zealand proposal for international ownership and operation of trunk international services was not generally acceptable, though support was &#34;iven in several unexpected quarters. A proposal favoured by British nations, that there should be an International Authority with powers to allocate routes and frequencies and to control competition between the nations, also did not receive general support, and ultimately the conference adopted a draft convention providing for an International Authority, with purely advisory powers. Pending ratification of this convention, there is an interim agreement constituting an interim authority, with generally similar powers. The conference could not reach general agreement on the question of rights for international air -transport services to operate and carry passengers to and from foreign countries.

          <para>We are now well into the sixth year of war. Due to our unpreparedness and our belief in peace, the enemy&#39;s earlier ascendency on all fronts was so complete that the demands on us to survive were colossal and, at times, looked beyond our capability. The heroism of our fighting forces and the stoical and sacrificial qualities of our rac&#171; in general stood with us and, as I have said earlier in my Speech, we now approach the climax of the war, with our confidence in victory unbounded. We have, however, a still further price to pay before victory can come. On the battle fronts our casualties will continue. On the home front sacrifices must persist. While war rages anywhere the test on the civilian population is inescapable. </para>

          <para>- The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Dennis was probably not well known to many honorable senators in this chamber, but he was an old friend of mine, and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his memory. No man was more highly esteemed in the districtin which he lived than was the deceased gentleman. He was active in all matters affecting his district and in various forms of philanthropic work. He was a member of the House of Representatives for only a short period, but his sterling qualities must have earned for him the respect of all his colleagues. I offer my condolences to the members of his family in their great loss. Victoria, and indeed the whole of Australia, is the poorer for the passing of a man who did his duty in ail circumstances. </para>

He was a fine citizen, who represented his district on the local council for many years. He was also a member of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.
