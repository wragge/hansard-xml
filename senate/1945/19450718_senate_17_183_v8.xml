                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - In pursuance of the powers conferred on me by section 92 of the Australian Broadcasting Act, I recently found it necessary to issue orders prohibiting certain persons from selecting, passing and rendering matter <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> broadcasting for periods up to three months. This action was taken as a result, of a complaint concerning a broadcast which, after investigation, was found to be objectionable. The provisions of section 92- were incorporated in the act on the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which was appointed by the Menzies Government in 1941 to investigate all phases of broadcasting in Australia. Believing that no other medi um of entertainment has such a powerful influence for good or evil, the joint committee very wisely paid much attention to the ethical standards of broadcasting. The act allows the broadcasters almost complete freedom in the selection of their programme matter, the only restrictions being such as are designed to avoid the inclusion of items of embarrassing vulgarity or indecent suggestiveness. In this regard, it. is reasonable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> demand a higher standard from the broadcasting .services than the stage or the picture theatre.  "Whereas  the latter are patronized by the deliberate choice of those who attend, the broadcasting programmes daily come into the homes of the people, who are entitled to demand that adequate precautions should he taken to prevent the intrusion of objectionable matter. The broadcasters have practically the whole nf the nation for their audience and. for that, very reason, it is not too much to expect that those who are privileged to conduct the service should observe over the air the ordinary proprieties that, they would observe in any gathering in the home, or anywhere else where men, women and children may be assembled. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>T am glad to acknowledge that the great majority of those who are responsible for our broadcasting programmes show a high appreciation of their obligations in this regard, but it is nevertheless, a regrettable fact that abundant evidence was tendered to the Joint, Par liamentary Committee on Broadcasting, which i indicated that a good deal of laxity had been displayed by some broadcasters over the year in the selection of programme material, notwithstanding the warnings they received from time to time. The joint committee felt so strongly on this matter that it made definite recommendations under which it was proposed that the Minister in charge of broadcasting should have certain summary powers in respect, of the punishment, of those who selected, passed or rendered offensive items for broadcasting. The Government accepted these recommendations and accordingly sections 91 and 92 were incorporated in the Australian Broadcasting Act, which was introduced into Parliament, in 1942, following the submission of the committee's report. </para>
                    <para>During the debate on the bill, reference was made to the extraordinary powers which it was proposed to confer upon the Postmaster-General under section 92. but. obviously. Parliament felt that in the light, of the. very strong views expressed unanimously by the members of the joint committee, the circumstances were such as to justify the suggested legislation. The Joint Parliamentary Committee realized that there may be differences of opinions as to the propriety of some broadcasts, and accordingly it expressed the view that all complaint* concerning objectionable items should be referred by the Postmaster-General to an advisory committee for investigation and report. In. this regard I might say that it is the invariable practice to refer such complaints to the Broadcasting Advisory Committee in the State in which the alleged offence has been committed. </para>
                    <para>These advisory committees have been established in each State on the recommendation of the Joint Committee, and they consist of the Deputy Director, Posts and Telegraphs, who is Chairman, representatives nf the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Federation nf Commercial Broadcasting Stations, and four representatives of the general public. This procedure provides adequate protection for the broadcasters, as it is inconceivable that any Postmaster-General would take action under either section 9.1 or 92 of the act unless  he was justified in so doing by the relevant report of the Advisory Committee. Before deciding to make the orders in the case under consideration, I carefully considered the report- of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which investigated the matter, and, after examining the script myself, came to the conclusion that the persons concerned should the given a salutary lesson. In reaching this decision I was influenced only by my conception of the duty imposed on me by the Australian Broadcasting Act, under which I have a definite responsibility to ensure that broadcast programmes comply with accepted standards of decency and propriety. That is a very great responsibility and. no matter how reluctant I may be to  impose  penalties on any person, I will not flinch from my obligations but will exercise the power conferred upon me by Parliament whenever there is adequate evidence, based on a report of a State Broadcasting Advisory Committee, that such a course is desirable  in  the public interest. </para>
                    <para>I have briefly referred to the origin of the powers which I have exercised because of the absurd suggestion in the press that I have constituted myself as a court and dispenser of penalties - in regard to these matters. The simple fact is that, after mature consideration, the law has been put into force, as Parliament intended it to be, for the purpose of raising .broadcasting standards from the low level of vulgarity to which certain programmes had descended; I am astonished that, instead of applauding such action, the press should see fit to  take  exception to the powers conferred upon the Postmaster-General for the purpose of ensuring that programmes shall be in accordance with good taste and accepted standards of propriety and that matter which borders on the salacious and indecent shall not be thrust into the hearing of decent citizens in their homes. As I have said, Parliament acted on the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which, following its very careful examination of this very distasteful subject, was in my opinion; well equipped" to advise the nation as to the measures which should be adopted to deal with the offensive broadcaster. "With its full  knowledge  of this matter, the committee expressed the opinion that stricter laws were necessary for broadcasters than for their stage counterparts. Official records clearly indicate that this evil has been one of the most difficult problems with which successive Postmasters-General have been confronted in their administration of the broadcasting laws. In this regard it is worthy of note that during the course of the debate on the Australian Broadcasting Act, two of my predecessors in office wholeheartedly endorsed the inclusion of the provisions under which I have taken action. </para>
                    <para>It is a fact that considerable time elapsed between the broadcasting of the offensive matter and the making of the recent orders. In this regard, however, delay is unavoidable because of the various stages in the procedure which has to :be followed. For instance, as I have already mentioned, the script has to be referred to the State Broadcasting Advisory Committee for consideration, and the persons concerned have to be allowed a reasonable time in which to offer an explanation of their conduct. Broadcasting is a great national asset and it must therefore be controlled in a manner which will meet with the general approval of listeners. I am sure that they have no desire to have inflicted on them, the subtle, double meaning type of humour which unfortunately has crept into certain programmes, and as far as I am able, I will use the powers conferred on me by Parliament to protect the public from this offensive matter. </para>

The station has been warned that should there be any repetition of the broadcasting of objectionable matter its licence will be dealt with. I have also been in communication with the advertising firm concerned, and it has given a written undertaking that no further objectionable matter will be broadcast.

                        <para>- On the 5th June, Senator Leckie asked me a question relative to a report published in the newspapers on the 4th June, to the effect that several tons of camouflage paint which had been dumped at a pit at Portland. South Australia, had been recovered by certain individuals who were able to sell it at rather high prices. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I had inquiries made regarding the matter and discovered that the paint had been dumped by the Department of Works, South Australia. At my request the Minister for Works had a thorough investigation made and he has advised nin as follows: - </para>
                    <para>During February and March, 1942, when the ill rent of Japanese invasion to Australia was most grave, a considerable quantity of camouflage paint was supplied to the South Australian office of my department for urgent defence cm mo nl I age purposes in that State. This paint was intended for the camouflage of dispersal areas for aircraft at various I 'oya I Australian Air Force stations, and would have been painted on hessian, trees, wire, &amp;c. As the threat of invasion disappeared, the service departments did not proceed with the whole of the camouflage works originally intended. No use could bc found for the camouflage paint and it remained in store at Port Adelaide until a decision was made to dispose of all surplus camouflage materials. </para>
                    <para>In May, 1044, samples of this camouflage paint were forwarded to the Munitions Supply Laboratories in Victoria with a view to investigation and examination of the condition of the paint. A report was subsequently received from the laboratory to the effect that the paint was below standard quality and was unsuitable for any use other than that for which it was originally intended. </para>
                    <para>It was then decided to offer the paint for disposal by public tenders, and advertisements were inserted in the Adelaide press. No tenders were received, and in accordance with departmental and Treasury instructions a board of survey then investigated the paint in stock and unanimously decided that the paint and the containers had no recoverable or commercial value and recommended that itbe destroyed and action taken to have thevalue written off as a charge to public funds- </para>
                    <para>Consideration was given to the question of salvaging the paint containers but it was found that the cost of cleaning these would have amounted to approximately 2s. Gd. per tin, whilst the recoverable value amounted only to ls. per tin. </para>
                    <para>The Chief Auditor, Commonwealth Audit Department, Adelaide, advised that there was no audit objection to the destroying and writing off of this paint and Treasury approval  wu*  subsequently received. </para>
                    <para>Arrangements were made with the town clerk, Port Adelaide, for the paint to be dumped at the rubbish pit at Portland. In accordance with the usual procedure for destruction of condemned stores, the containers wens hacked open with mattocks as they were rolled from the trucks into the dun.p. lt appears that information regarding the department's intention to dump this paint had reached thu public as when the first lorry arrived at the pit scores of people were in attendance. Many of these people endeavoured to gather up the liquid which was running out of the tins and others to scrape out some of the solids remaining in the tins. It is pointed out. however, that neither the liquids nor the solids ha.d any value as paint. </para>
                    <para>As a result of my inquiries, I am convinced that all proper precautions were taken by my department to destroy the condemned paint, and I have no doubt that it had no value except for the purpose for which it was originally intended. </para>

                            <para>- I refer the honorable senator to the rules printed on the back of the " Notice of Question " forms for the guidance of honorable senators in asking questions. It has been the practice of the Chair to debar honorable senators from quoting extensively from newspaper reports when asking questions. In the past I have erred sometimes on the side of leniency. On occasions, I have allowed honorable senators to quote several lines from newspaper reports. However, Senator Lamp, in asking his question, was exceeding reasonable bounds in that respect. As I am not a clairvoyant I could not foresee the length of the honorable senator's quotation. It is not the rule to allow honorable senators, when asking questions, to quote extensively from newspaper reports. Personalities do not enter into the matter as far as the Chair is concerned. If any member of the Opposition errs to the degree to which Senator Lamp erred to-day, I shall treat him in like manner. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to preface a question which I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Army byreminding him that a few weeks ago when he was Acting Minister for the Army he assured the Senate that full and adequate pre parations had been made for the reception and welcome of Australian prisoners of war on their return to our shores. He made that statement following a visit to Sydney. Has he seen a press report dealing with the arrival, on the 7th July, of a number of prisoners of war, including 114 Western Australian soldiers, which stated that the cattle pavilion at the Sydney Showground was allocated to these men as sleeping quarters? Is he aware that the men objected to those quarters because the barbed wire enclosing the pavilion reminded them too vividly of a German Stalag? In view of the fact that approximately 20,000 Australian soldiers still held as prisoners by the enemy are expected to return to Australia, will full and adequate accommodation be provided for their reception, and will steps be taken to 'ensure that such accommodation will not remind them of their incarceration in enemy prison camps? </para>

However, should the State Government desire to change the gauge of its railways, or embark upon a plan for modernization of its rolling-stock and the standardization of equipment and parts, the Commonwealth Government will be happy to co-operate in making available all technical information in its possession: and in any other manner subject to mutual agreement. </para>

                 <para> One of the principal functions of the Rent Controller is to fix room rents in those States in which the rent fixing provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Regulations are in operation.. The rights of pensioners are better safeguarded under the amended regulations than they were under the  former regulations in that there is now no necessity for room tenants to approach the Fair Rents Board in order to secure a .reduction of extortionate rents.</para>

Under the arrangements agreed to between the Commonwealth and the State, the State will be primarily responsible for the administration of land settlement for ex-servicemen, although the Commonwealth Government will be required to contribute to the associated costs and to confer with the State Government on a number of aspects. Draft legal agreements covering the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States were forwarded to the State Governments about six weeks ago, and it is expected that legislation to ratify the agreements will soon be introduced into the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. In anticipation of ratification, a number of settlement proposals have been submitted by the Queensland Government and these are being examined by Commonwealth officers. </para>

A disagreement -between a Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank on an important matter of policy would be most serious, and this Parliament should know of it. As the clause stands, knowledge of such a disagreement might be withheld from Parliament and from the public for months. That would be most undesirable. What is Parliament for? Surely its members have some privileges. We appreciate that the Government has been returned by the people, and has the numbers to pass whatever legislation it desires: but it is the privilege of Opposition members to disagree with any proposal which the Government may advance. I atn afraid that the Minister has not thoroughly considered this matter. </para>

The only reason given by the Minister for the rejection of the amendment is that its acceptance might lead to undesirable publicity ; but surely members of the Parliament, should be given full information about any difference of opinion between the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and a Treasurer.

Beading the report of my speech, it seems that I went farther than I had intended to go at the time, and I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Knowles has taken exception to my remarks. As I said on that occasion, I had no intention of reflecting upon <inline font-weight="bold">.Sir George</inline> Knowles, or upon any of his officers. In fact, I have a great regard for them. I was driven to making certain statements because of the fact that the Government had received some most extraordinary advice from the Crown Law authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Knowles has said that he takes personal responsibility for all opinions expressed by his officers. I repeat that I had no intention of reflecting upon the probity of the Solicitor-General or his officers. </para>
                <para>In effect, the Minister has said that members of Parliament are not to be entrusted with information regarding disputes on matters of high policy between the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and a Treasurer. Could anything be more vital ? Why should the Government of the day be afraid to tell the Parliament and the public of its policy? In other matters the Government proclaims its policy without hesitation, but, apparently, in matters of finance a " hush-hush " policy is to be followed, because the public is not to be told of the negotiations which take place between the Treasurer and the Governor of the bank. I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude. Surely there can be no objection to telling the Parliament within seven days that a dispute has occurred. </para>

                    (Queensland) [4.21.- The Minister's answer amazes me; he says that it is most -undesirable that publicity should be given to differences of opinion between the Treasurer and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. On that ground he contends that the elected representatives of the people should not be informed as to the negotiations that have taken place. It has already been pointed out that the amendment refers, not to trivial matters concerning which differences of opinion may arise, but to vital matters of policy which might lead to a financial crisis. The negotiations to which the amendment relates are those- of an important character between the Government of the day and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and may involve hundreds of millions of pounds of the people's savings held in trust by the bank. It, must be remembered that the Commonwealth Bank acts not merely on behalf of the Commonwealth Government but also on behalf of hundreds of thousands of individual depositors. Surely, in such circumstances, a major dispute between the Government and the Governor of the bank is a matter which concerns the people. They should know about it. The Minister for Trade and Customs
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline>
                    should give a better answer than the one he has given to the committee. During the regime of the present Government there has been too much withholding of information from the public. Believing that it is secure because of its majority in both Houses, the Government has adopted a totalitarian attitude in respect of administrative matters and legislation. Knowing how reasonably the Minister has acted on previous occasions, I am sorry that on this occasion he has adopted such an unreasonable attitude. I urge him to postpone consideration of the clause, at least until he can give to the Senate a better reason than he has already given, why the Parliament should not be advised of vital matters in dispute between the Treasurer and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.

After the war, nothing will be more abhorrent to the general public than the unnecessary continuation of the restrictions which have been imposed during war-time, particularly if they should relate to disputes between the Treasurer of the day and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank on important matters of financial policy. I believe that the withholding of information from the people on such matters will be resented by them. The non-acceptance of the amendment strikes at the root of parliamentary government because it means that the Parliament, instead of being acquainted with what takes place, will be kept in the dark in regard to many important matters. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Non-acceptance of my amendment will, I believe, cause widespread distrust in the Commonwealth Bank because the people will want to know what there is to hide. This clause relates, not to minor disagreements on unimportant, matters, but to disputes on major matters of policy. The clause already provides that, in the event of a major dispute between the Government and the Governor of the bank, the policy of the Government shall prevail after the bank has been notified that the Government accepts responsibility. My amendment merely asks that the Parliament shall be notified of the instruction given to the bank to carry out the Government's policy in such cases. Surely, in such matters the Parliament should be advised. In any case, the public will want to know who is in control of the bank. In its own interests, as well as in the interests of tie bank, the Government would be well advised to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I should like some information from the Minister in charge of the bill as to what is his conception of the Commonwealth Bank and its functions, and as to how he thinks it will carry out the functions of a central bank. Is the central bank to have a capital of only £4,000,000 plus certain other sums from the reserve fund, which amount to only £4,130,000, that is, a total of approximately £8,000,000? In this respect, we should bear in mind all the things which the central bank shall have to do as set out in clause 13. Apparently, the central bank is to deal with hundreds of millions of pounds. Bearing in mind the millions of money which the central bank will control, this is analogous to using a pop-gun to stop a 50- ton tank. </para>

The Minister has just told us that in the past the bank has  acted  as the banker and financial agent of the Government and that that arrangement has worked amicably.

                    <para>. - I raise the question of gold backing for our currency now because this is the first opportunity I have had to reply to some statements made by the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> in concluding the second-reading debate. In his speech, which we all know was a prepared statement, he ridiculed the idea that it was necessary to have a sheet-anchor for our currency, as the accumulation of gold reserves was capable of becoming a frozen asset, and of no value to Australia in time of crisis. He referred to the Theodore bills during the depression years and the shipments of gold from this country to Great Britain and the United 'States of America, but what he did not mention - and this is vital - is that an adequate gold reserve in Australia need not become a frozen asset, because there are outlets for the movement of gold in support of our currency. He did not mention those outlets, but I did in my second-reading speech. One outlet is the issue of gold bullion in the form, of currency. That is liquid enough and would soon be absorbed by the people. Therefore, to suggest that a gold reserve could become an immobile asset is, to say the most of it, sheer buncom.be. The fact that the Lyons Government, which succeeded the Scullin Government, did not take steps to reintroduce the gold reserve only begs the question. I should like the Minister now to review his remarks on the question of a gold backing for our currency. It is necessary that subscribers to Avar loans and war savings certificates shall have reason to be confident of the value of the money that they will receive in return for their investments. </para>

Therefore, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">I,</inline> the Commonwealth Bank could say to the private banks, " It is incidental to the carrying-out of some of our powers that we should have another couple of hundred millions from you people". Such wide powers cannot be controlled. The bank will be able to do anything incidental to them. If the Commonwealth Bank wanted to buy bullion and had not enough money to do so, under this provision it could call upon the trading banks to supply it. Will the Minister consider striking out paragraph Z?

Is the Minister or his legal adviser able to say what powers will be incidental to the powers specified?

                    <para>. - The Commonwealth Bank will be unique in that we shall have combined in one banking structure a central bank,  a  general trading bank, an industrial finance department, a savings bank, a  mortgagebank, and a rural credits department. That is quite contrary to the accepted practice of central banking all over the world. The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in paragraph 157 of its report states - </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Bank has taken the view that its centralbank activities are of paramount importance, and that its development its a central bank should go hand in hand with some limitation of its trading activities. This proposal, however, is for a general expansion of the functions of the central bank to embrace almost every banking activity including trading. That is where it clashes with accepted central banking practice. It is significant that the Bank of England for two centuries was purely a commercial bank, as was the Commonwealth Bank upon its inception. It was not until 1844 that the Bank of England began to assume central banking functions. Since then it has gradually divested itself of its trading bank activities, until to-day, they are purely nominal. Most other central banks do not have trading powers. I suggest that the separation of the central bank and the trading bank functions of the Commonwealth Bank is most desirable. Adequate justification for such action is to be found in the royal commission's report. The complete dissociation of these two activities,by the formation of a separate institution as a central bank, is by far the most desirable course. The present proposal simply means that control of banking, currency and everything else will be in the hands of one man, the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>. - It is regrettable that trading bank and central bank functions have been confused. I understand the Government's proposal to be that the central bank should be the bulwark of our financial institutions, but under the conditions laid down in this measure, that purpose will not be achieved because the central bank will be competing in every sphere of business activity. The result will he that when a reserve is required to meet certain contingencies, the central bank will be left high and dry. The functions of the central bank should be restricted in accordance with the generally accepted principles of central banking, and the trading banks should 'be permitted to carry on ordinary trading activities. This proposal defeats the whole aim of i he hill'. Clause 13 sets out a list of activities of the central bank, and clause 14 provides the capital required. I should like to know where the hundreds of millions of pounds required to exercise central banking functions, and all the other functions specified, are to be obtained. </para>

This bill divides the Commonwealth Bank into sections, one of which will deal with central banking. Specific provisions will control its central banking functions. Hitherto, all the capital of the Commonwealth Bank, including deposits-, has been available for use, but with the division of the bank into sections, the capital of the central bank will be only £4,000,000, plus certain additions from the reserve fund, which altogether will be a small sum to carry out a large job. The Ministers explanation does not cover that point. In carrying out its functions as a central bank, the bank hitherto, has had almost unlimited capital, including, as I have said, deposits by various governments and bodies as well as by private depositors. I. want to know how the bank will carry out its central banking functions wilh the small capital for which this bill provides? The committee is entitled to that information. </para>

                    <para>. - A perusal of the last balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank discloses that, although its capital was £4,000,000, its total assets were valued at over £600,000,000, or ISO times its capital. The funds of the central bank will be derived from deposits by Commonwealth and State Governments, trading banks, and special deposits. The Commonwealth Bank was established with a nominal capital of £1,000,000, but actually it started without any capital at all. To-day, as I have said, its assets are valued at over £600,000,000. We have it on the highest authority that banking is so attractive that there is practically no risk so long as proper controls are established. </para>

                    HAYS (Tasmania; | 5.10]. - The Minister's explanation is not satisfactory. Hitherto the Commonwealth Bank has acted as a central bank, a rural bank, and a mortgage bank, in addition to carrying out general banking business and, as the Minister has said, it has operated profitably. Now, the bank is to be divided into sections, and a certain sum of money is to be set aside as the capital of the central bank. Can the .Minister say on what basis a capital of £4,000,000 was arrived at? If that amount was fixed arbitrarily, why insert it in the bill at all? I ask" the Minister to say what amount of capital has been required by the Commonwealth Bank to carry out its central banking functions in the past.

                    <para>.- It is evident that honorable senators opposite do not understand what amount of capital is required to establish a bank which is to function as a central bank, or what constitutes the working capital of a bank. The position is that a bank does not use its reserves for ordinary business 'at all. A bank's power to create credit against its assets represents its capital. I could quote many authorities to show that that is so, but there is no need to do so. Honorable senators know that money deposited with a bank earns interest at about 1£ per cent, whereas interest, at a. rate of about 4f per cent, is paid on overdrafts. The difference between those two rates of interest is about 3 per cent., but no bank in the world has built up its huge reserves merely by charging higher rates of interest on overdrafts than it pays on deposits. That proves that it does not matter at all what the capital reserves of a bank are. The  simple fact is that a bank trades in credit, and that behind the credit which it creates stand the resources of the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> wants to know whether the capital of the central bank is to be only £4,000,000 plus certain additions, but we, on this side, say that it would not matter if the bank had no capital at all, and that the sum of £4,000,000 is merely a. figure decided upon arbitrarily. A bank uses the wealth of the community which is the .productive capacity of the community, as a basis for the issuing of credit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenna,</inline> an accepted authority on banking, says - </para>

                    explanation, it says in effect, " We are going to lend credit without anything tangible to back that credit ". An ordinary bank does not lend money unless it has the requisite security. The clause simply states thai, the capital of the central bank is to be £4,000,000, with additions from the reserve fund. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline>
                    is right the Government need not provide that capital. The honorable senator's explanation is surprising and I am wondering whether it is the explanation which will be given by the Minister. Is it wise to let it go out to, the people that, in the opinion of the Government, the function of the central bank is to create and sell credit? An ordinary bank must have something behind it before it can sell credit or borrow or lend money; but the Government is going to set a new criterion in banking. Its bank is going to start from nothing.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline>
                    has not contradicted the statement that the capital of the hank is to be £4,000,000. Further, it is provided under this measure that some special credits shall not be placed to the credit of the general banking business. What I want to know is whether the sums, amounting to £240,000,000, forcibly taken from the private banks, will be at the disposal of the central bank for use in its ordinary functions? Will that money be used as a means of" placing the central bank on its feet?

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that it was not necessary for a government bank to have any backing at all behind it. He seems to be satisfied  with  the vague  idea  that the  whole  of the resources of the. community are behind  it.  We are not able to forget that' at present the resources of the community  ave  very largely mortgaged. </para>

                        <para>- We live on what we produce; but when the honorable senator speaks so airily about the credit of the community he cannot ignore the fact that the community has already borrowed £2,500,000,000 from various sources, and must pay those debts. When the honorable senator speaks about the credit of the community, he must recognize that that credit is largely mortgaged, and also bear in mind that our present tax rates are so high that  Ave  can expect to raise very little more from that source. We can only overcome the problem by increasing our productive capacity. The Government now says that the money it has taken from the private banks is not  to  be used as a central bank fund; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> says that we do not require any money at  all  but need merely to create credit. </para>

                    <para>. - If I remember correctly my history of the Commonwealth Bank, the only sum made available to  it in  the beginning  was  £10,000 from the Commonwealth Treasury, and that its actual funds came from the State of Tasmania where the State  Savings  Bank was taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. That really provided the working capital of the Commonwealth Bani?; and from that very small  working:  capital it was able  in  a very brief period to finance the first  world  war  in  1914-18 to the amount of £350,000,000. It also has played a major part  in  financing the present  Avar without  the need of debentures  for  which provision was made  in  the measure passed  in  1.924. T suggest to the Acting Leader of  the  Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie),</inline> who is raising difficulties about the inadequacy of a capital of £4,000,000, that  in  view of the two performances which I have just cited he need have  no  misgivings as to how the central bank will be able to carry on its functions. If I understood the Acting Leader of the Opposition aright, he said that the general banking division, which is now separated from the central bank, would not be able to make deposits with the central bank. If he did say that, I disagree  with  him- on the point. I refer him to clause 17 which says -  (2.) The Bank shall have such powers as are necessary for the purpose of carrying on general banking business and shall, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, have all the powers referred to in paragraphs (6) to (/) (inclusive) of section thirteen of this Act. </para>

                <para>And sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 13 provides that the general banking division ah all have power to lend money. I cannot find any prohibition in the bill against the general banking division lending whatever money it wishes to the central bank. The  whole  of the resources of the general banking division will be available to the central bank at all times, and, particularly, in emergencies. That is quite apart from the special deposits of £240,000,000  which  the bank holds at present. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Herbert</inline> Hays asked why the sum of £4,000,000  was  to be allotted to the central bank and a similar amount, to the general banking division. I suggest that as the Commonwealth Bank has accumulated a reserve fund of more than £8.000,000, and its functions are now being divided into two separate divisions, it is a natural and normal thing to divide the capital equally between the two parts. Accordingly, the £8,000.000  which  the bank has accumulated in reserves- </para>

                <para>On preceding pages of the annotated co|-y cf the measure we find that the capital of £4,000,000 was obtained from the bank's own resources, and that was frozen as capital in 1934. I put it to the committee that the whole of that sum of £S, 130,000 represents profits made by the bank up to the present, after contributing one half of its profits to the National Debt Sinking Fund. The bank was without actual subscribed capital whether from the Commonwealth or debenture holders ; and the whole of that fund is now to be equally distributed between the two sections of the bank.

                    said that the reserves of the bank amounted to £8,130,000. He will see that the reserve fund amounts to only £4,130,000, and that capita] amounts to £4,000,000. Seeing that the central hank is being separated from the other section of the bank, I should like to know how the central bank is going to carry out all the functions allotted to it on such a small capital. We have not yet been given adequate information on that point.

                <para class="block">Does that mean- that the Commonwealth Bank, through its General Banking Division, shall seek the customers of the other banks and shall not refuse to conduct general banking for any person, or does it mean that it shall not refuse to conduct general banking business for any person for the reason that to conduct that business would take business away from another bank? Where will the bank get if it has to accept any business offered to it? I acknowledge the qualification contained in sub-clause 2. I am puzzled, however, whether the clause does not go further than would appear. If it mean.* that the Commonwealth Bank shall not refuse the general banking business of any one, the trading banks may he placed in. a great difficulty. </para>

                    <para>. - In paragraph 5-59 of its report, the banking commission referred to the fact that the Commonwealth Bank, as a matter of policy, had restricted its trading bank activities, and pointed out that, although the bank had not refused credit accounts, it had not sought clients from a trading bank where it considered that the trading hank concerned was giving satisfactory service. The commission, subject to a dissent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> expressed the opinion that that wa3 a proper practice for a central bank to adopt. Paragraph 11 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Chifley's  dissent, published on pages 264-5 of the report, reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para>The present policy of the Commonwealth Bank is to restrict the activities of its trading section, and to refuse an advance to a customer of a trading bank, unless in the opinion of the Commonwealth . Bank the customer is not receiving fair and reasonable treatment from the trading bank. It has not been disclosed in the evidence that the Commonwealth Bank has never taken a customer on these grounds. People should, in my opinion, have the right to obtain advances from the Commonwealth Bank without question as to whether they are customers of a private trading bank. The only considerations, in my opinion, should he whether they are credit worthy, and whether in conformity with the central bank policy, advances should be made to them. At present, the Commonwealth Bank by its self-imposed restrictions as to the extent of its advances, deprives itself of any real power to prevent a rise in rates on advances. Although the Commonwealth Bank did not increase its advance rates in March, 1936, when some trading banks, in opposition to its wishes, increased deposit rates and later advance rates, it was unable to force the trading banks to respect its wish that rates should nut bc increased. That was an occasion on which the Commonwealth Bank, if it desired to enforce its wishes as a central bank, should have intimated that it would seek ^business at its lower rate from the trading banks who disregarded its wishes. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> that the reason for the clause is obvious. It was deliberately inserted for the purpose of enabling aud encouraging the Commonwealth Bank to take accounts from the private trading banks. The Commonwealth Bank's overdraft rate has always been lower than that of the private hanks. One honorable senator referred to an overdraft rate of 4$ per cent., but the Commonwealth Bank's overdraft rate has never been more than 4J per cent., as far as I am aware. Its rate has always been one-half per cent, lower than that of the private banks. The Commonwealth Bank, however, recognized that it would not be good for the community to have all banking business done through it. To my knowledge, no accounts have been refused by the Commonwealth Bank, except when people have gone to it merely for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the lower rate of interest on overdrafts. Under this legislation, the Commonwealth Bank will be able to charge almost any rate of interest, no matter how low it may be, because it will not matter to it whether it shows a profit or a loss, since it is provided that all its funds shall be governed by the Commonwealth Treasury. This clause is intended to give to the Commonwealth Bank power to take accounts in direct competition with the trading banks. That, of course, is the intention of the Commonwealth Government. Instead of the Commonwealth Bank actively cooperating with the trading banks, as it has done up to the present, it is intended that it shall scramble with them for their clients by offering lower rates of interest on overdrafts and higher rates' of interests on deposits. Under this legislation, it will not be able to refuse to take any account offered to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> referred to the great financial achievements of the Commonwealth Bank in this war, but those efforts have also been made possible by the* response of the people to loan appeals. Every loan has been fully subscribed. That ready response of the people and not merely the activities of the Commonwealth Bank has made the financing of the war effort possible. Under this clause, regardless of the circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank will not be able to refuse to take any account offered to it. It will not be able to say, " We think the financial stability of this country may be better maintained by a wider spread of banking activities". I know the Government's intentions. It makes no secret of them. The Minister for Trade and Customs is not so explicit as are some of his supporters, but he knows as well as I do that the main reason for this legislation is to enable the Commonwealth Bank to monopolize the banking business of Australia to the total exclusion of private banks. </para>

If it desires =that the general banking business shall be expanded, the necessary instructions to the Governor to that effect are emitained in sub-clause 1. The purpose of sub-clause 2 is that every manager of a branch of the Commonwealth Bank shall set out to rake in at more advantageous terms the business now being done by the trading banks, with the sole object of destroying competition so that there shall be a government monopoly of banking in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No fear! This bill provides for the fair and honest competition that honorable gentlemen opposite have been advocating all their lives. Now, when it. is offered to them on right lines, they do not want it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Riddle was Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, he laid it down that it was not to compete with the private banks for ordinary banking business. I bought a house and was paying interest at 8 per cent, on the money I borrowed for the purpose. When I had paid off one-half of the debt and had a concrete asset, I asked the Commonwealth Bank to take over the mortgage. I was told that the bank did not engage in general banking business. The Commonwealth Bank Board was established to stop the Commonwealth Bank from competing against private banks. The effectiveness of the brake upon the Commonwealth Bank is shown by the small number of branches of the Commonwealth Bank established in the last ten years. In Tasmania, one finds about five private banks in almost every locality, but only four branches of the Commonwealth Bank are operating throughout the State. That proves that honorable senators on the opposite side do not want the Commonwealth Bank to compete with the trading banks. No bank can carry out business without premises. I am very pleased that this bill has been introduced, and that it includes this clause authorizing the Commonwealth Bank to conduct general banking business in competition with the private banks. </para>

                    <para>. -  From the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> one might be led to believe that, when this legislation becomes law the Commonwealth Bank will enter into fair competition with the other banks. The  fact  is, however, that this bill will remove whatever small measure of fair competition exists at present. For instance, the Commonwealth Bank does not pay rates or taxes to State authorities upon its properties. Under the Constitution, exemption from such dues  is  granted to all Commonwealth instrumentalities. To that degree, therefore, even in the past there has not been fair competition .between the Commonwealth  Bank  and the private banks. What have the private banks done to deserve to be penalized as they will be under this measure? They commenced operations in this country  long  before  the  Commonwealth Bank was thought of, and carried on business successfully, not only so far as their  own  interests were concerned, but also in the interests of the development of this country. In the past, the practice has been for the Commonwealth Bank to discourage the transfer of accounts from  the  private hanks, and the private banks have taken similar action in regard  to  Commonwealth Bank accounts. That is fair competition. If the Government believes that it can engage successfully in commercial enterprises why does  it  not permit the Commonwealth Bank  to  enter the trading hank field on a competitive basis? The effect of this measure will be to create a virtual banking monopoly in this country. How can honorable senators opposite reconcile this legislation with their frequently expressed opposition to monopolies? No Government supporter  will  deny that this  measure provides the subtle means w here by banking in this country may be nationalized if the Government so desires. It does not provide for straightout nationalization, but provides the machinery whereby the private banks may be forced out of business by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

I do not argue that the Commonwealth Bank has not been a useful institution, but this legislation will make it the plaything of politics. There are clear indications throughout the Commonwealth that the Labour Government will not be in office after the next elections. The people of this country are eagerly awaiting an opportunity to remove it from the treasury bench. When that has been accomplished, we shall restore the Commonwealth Bank to its former position in the banking field.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - This clause places a definite obligation on the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. It provides that it shall be the  duty  of the bank - which means, of course, the Governor - to develop and expand its general banking business. That will be the law when this measure has been passed, and the Governor will have to obey the law. If he does not develop the general banking business, he will be breaking the law. He will be obliged to increase the business of the bank by hook or by crook. .Sub-clause 2 is rather unique in that it limits the power of the Commonwealth Bank to refuse business. What unlimited opportunities for political pressure this clause will present. A disgruntled would-be borrower will only have to cry that the Commonwealth Bank has refused, him because it would be taking  businessfrom  the private banks, and presumably the Government will come to his assistance. Minor matters such as credit worthiness, and security may very easily be brushed aside under these conditions. This clause is in complete conflict with the conclusions of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. Almost every  speaker  has quoted from the report of that body passages which suited his case. My learned friend from Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.,</inline> produced some tit-bits which supported his arguments, and I have found some which support mine. Paragraph 559 states that it has not been the practice of the Commonwealth Bank to accept clients from the trading banks, in cases where it considered that these banks were giving satisfactory service.

If their funds are to be tied up, difficulties will arise. I point out, that under clause 18 (2.) of another bill which has not yet come before us, a direct relationship is to be established between the trading banks and the wool-broking firms. If that be so, hardship will be inflicted on persons engaged in the pastoral industry.

                    <para>. -  This clause offers the greatest insult to the Senate that it has ever received. It assumes that other legislation which has not yet come before the Senate will be passed. Reference is made in this clause to the Banking Act 1 945, although no such act is on the statute-book. Under legislation passed by the House of Representatives, woolbroking firms may have to yield to demands made by the Commonwealth Bank, and their money would be put into special accounts. This clause provides that those special accounts shall be kept in the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank, but the Minister has not said where they shall be kept. Earlier to-day, he notified the committee that such moneys would not be used in the central banking business of the Commonwealth Bank, but he did not say how they would be used. I do not imagine that the moneys will be left idle, and not used at all. They will have to go into a special account,and they will be used in some part of the bank's business. If that were not so, there would be no object in the Commonwealth Bank having the money, except that by " freezing " such funds the private banks would be deprived of money with which to carry on their legitimate business. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause strikes at a. principle which the Government has professed to believe in, namely, that money should be used for developmental purposes. One reason given for the depression by supporters of the Government is that there was no free flow of money. It was said that 100 much money was tied up and not made available . for the development of industries. Yet, under this clause, the Commonwealth Bank will take away the surplus funds of the private banks, apparently in order to " freeze " them. Of what use can " frozen " funds be in the development of this country? One would have thought that, instead of " freezing " funds, every encouragement, would be given to the use of surplus funds by banks. It seems entirely wrong to take money away from the private banks, and not to use it. We should bc told what is intended to be done with this money. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> is similar to one moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in the House of Representatives. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> promised that the proposal would receive consideration. In the meantime, he has discussed the matter with the Government's legal officers who are of opinion that the amendment would not add to the protection already given under the clause. It should be noted that the clause provides that the special deposits of the trading banks shall not be kept in the general banking division, and, therefore, cannot be used in that division in competition against the trading banks. Safeguarding clauses have been placed in other parts of the bill dealing with the various departments of the bank. For instance, in Part IX., which covers the Mortgage Bank Department, clause 78 provides that the funds shall not be used in the business of the Mortgage Bank Department except as expressly provided by the act, and the provisions of the act limit the funds of the Mortgage Bank Department to its capital and advances from the Treasurer, provided that in the ease of the Bank itself the advances outstanding at any time shall not exceed £1,000,000. Therefore, the Government cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has now informed us that the surplus funds taken from the private banks are not to be used by the Commonwealth  Bank. They will not -be used in the General Banking Division because they will not be paid into that division ; and he says that they cannot be used in the Mortgage Bank Department because the act definitely limits the amount of capital which can be made available to that department. In those circumstances, what is to become of the funds? What is the use of taking these surplus funds from the private banks if they are not to be used ? Surely, it, would be better to leave them with (hose institutions in order that they may use them. It seems, as the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> has pointed out, that the Government, purely out of pique, is taking this course as a step in a plan, to strangle the private banks. The Government is taking the surplus funds from the private banks to freeze them; and, apparently, it intends to do this a3 one step in its plan to destroy the private banks. On the Minister's own admission, the position is most extraordinary. These funds are to be taken from the private banks, but will not be used by the Commonwealth Bank. Why does not the Government leave them with the private banks to be used in providing legitimate advances in order to assist industry in this country? </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline>
                    clearly indicates that the object of the clause is to limit the activity of the trading banks. Such a proposal could be readily understood as a wartime measure, or as a remedial measure in a time of financial stringency or economic depression in order to enable the Commonwealth to undertake urgent public works. But the Government has declared that whilst it believes in the principle of government control in respect of certain undertakings it will work in co-operation with private enterprise. The Government has declared as a matter of policy that it desires not to destroy private enterprise but on the contrary to co-operate with it. Under this measure, however, it proposes to take these surplus funds from the, private banks whether it requires to use them or not. Unless these funds be required for some national purpose, they should be allowed to remain with the private banks because they are the working capital of the private banks. Should the Government require to take over these funds for some specific purpose it already possesses power to do si. under the national security legislation. There is no need to insert this provision in a measure of thi3 kind, because this is not a war measure. It is a measure dealing with the control and management of the Commonwealth  Bank in peace-time. I am sure that no honorable senator would contend that the measure is related directly, or indirectly, to war purposes. The private banks require these funds in order to carry on their legitimate business.

                    MATTNER  (South Australia) | S.25].  -  No guarantee is given under the clause as to the use that may be made of these surplus funds. Even if these funds are not kept in the general banking division there is nothing to prevent the Treasurer from borrowing money against  i  Treasury-bills from the General Banking Division, or the central bank and lending to the Industrial Finance Department or the Mortgage Bank Department. Would 6UC,11 a course be possible under the clause as drafted?

                    COOPER  (Queensland)  1.3.26]. -  On the one hand the bill seeks to facilitate through the Commonwealth Bank the borrowing of money in order to establish small businesses, but on the other hand it provides for the freezing of £240,000,000 of surplus funds taken from the private banks. If it is necessary to advance money to establish businesses, would it not be far better to allow the private banks to retain those funds and use them for that purpose? The alternative proposal is that the Commonwealth Bank while holding those surplus funds out of use will create fresh credit for that purpose. That seems to be the position in the light of the explanation just given by the Min.ister for Trade and Customs
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane).</inline>
                    That is a ridiculous proposal. One can only conclude that the objective of the Government under the clause is to restrict the activities of the private banks, and, ultimately, to strangle them, because no reason at all is given for the proposal to take these surplus funds from the private banks.

                    <para>.- I. am at a loss to know exactly what are the investable surplus funds about which honorable senators opposite have so much to say. No such sums are shown in the balance-sheets of the private banks. I challenge honorable senators opposite to produce a balance-sheet of the private banks as a whole which shows surplus investable funds amounting to £240,000,000. If the private banks have that amount it must exist in the form of deposits, and as deposits are liabilities how can they be loaned ? If this money were advanced for the manufacture of goods such a policy would result in inflation with a consequent rise of prices, and the money would be automatically cancelled out. The more money that isput on the market the higher prices rise. What are these surplus investable funds?' Nobody seems to have a proper idea of what they are, hut I say that they have been accumulated by a secondary expansion of credit on top of the deposits that the private banks now have. I' believe that this £240,000,000 is a swindle. If the banks have it, they should show it in their balance-sheets. If they cannot show it, it must be mythical. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Bank has money or securities. Of course it does not just take a mere cheque and nothing else. It must have securities. It must know that the money is in its hands. So the Banking Bill gives the lie to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp's</inline> claim that the £240,000,000 represents a swindle. The lie is also given to him by the returns of the Commonwealth Bank. It is also given to him in the Minister's second-reading speech. So I advise the honorable senator to argue with his Minister whether the Commonwealth Bank has the £240,000,000. The Minister expressly stated that it had. I persist with my amendment. The money taken by the Commonwealth Bank from the trading banks is real. We want to ensure against its being used to stifle fair competition. It is against normal business probity and honesty that it should be so used ; but the Minister has carefully evaded telling us what is to be done with the money. </para>

                    <para>.- It is provided that the Commonwealth IBank shall pay 17s. 6d. per cent. on the £240,000,000 involved in the special accounts. I ask the Government whether it is prepared, through the Commonwealth Bank, to pay £2,100,000 per annum for that money and allow it to remain idle. I do not think it is. The money will be invested in Commonwealth loans or in some other way. It is a moral certainty that it will not be allowed to lie idle. The Government should at least say what is to become of the money. I concede that it is to the advantage of the trading 'banks, to a certain degree, to have that money invested  with the Commonwealth Bank at 17s. 6d. per cent., because it will be available on application to meet the bank's obligations to depositors, but the bank could make much better use of it by advancing money to clients to whom the management cannot now make advances because it is unable to obtain the consent of the Government. However. I maintain that, if the Government is willing that interest shall he paid on the money, it will not allow it to be idle. </para>

A very large sum of money - approximately £240,000,000-  is involved. What we want to know is to what use will that money be put. The Minister may not have this information at hand, but surely he is able to obtain it from his advisers. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> that the Government would not be paying about £2,000,000a  year interest on this money if it were not being put to some productive use. </para>

On the assets side appears a number of narrations such as " Australian Notes ", " Money at short call in London", "Commonwealth Government securities including Treasury-bills", " Other semi-Governmental and municipal securities ", " Bills receivable in London", "Remittances in transit", "Mortgage Bank loans ", &amp;c. I am unable to say under which of these headings the  £184,000,000  has been spent. This money is not frozen in the real sense. It is being used by the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">During the second-reading debate on this measure, stress was laid upon the fact that one of the main differences of opinion between the Government and the Opposition on this legislation was the proposed abolition of the present Commonwealth Bank Board of Directors. Government speakers pointed out that when the bank was established, sole control was vested in the first Governor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller. I remind honorable senators of the subsequent development of the bank. When it was established, it was a comparatively small organization, and apart from its governmental activities, its only other work was the handling of a proportion of the savings bank business of the Commonwealth. It was not until the outbreak of war, when government finance assumed a much more important aspect, that the bank's functions expanded considerably. Finance was provided for various marketing schemes, and advances were made upon crops. Money was made available also to purchase accumulated stocks of primary products. After the war, the bank's activities continued to increase greatly and certain new functions were undertaken. The result was that not long after the war the government of the day deemed it advisable to follow the practice adopted by nearly every large business organization, and appointed a board of directors consisting of individuals who had had experience in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry, to guide the operations of the bank. </para>

                        <para>- It was. The expansion of the bank necessitated the creation of the board. No large business organization would dream of permitting dictatorial control by one person. Government supporters have criticized the personnel of the Commonwealth Bank Board, but I contend that, generally speaking, persons who have held office on that board have been public-spirited men whose wide experience in finance, industry, or primary production has made their services invaluable. Not only does this measure abolish the Commonwealth Bank Board, but also, by means of clauses already passed by this chamber by weight of numbers, it gives to the Treasurer complete control over the Governor of the bank. It provides that should a difference of opinion occur between the Governor and the Treasurer, the Governor must bow to the wishes of the government of the day. Earlier to-day, an amendment providing that any such difference of opinion should be notified to Parliament within a certain period was moved by an honorable senator on this side of the chamber but was rejected. That shows clearly that the Government's aim i:-- to exercise complete political control over the bank. I venture to suggest that millions of people who have invested their life's savings in the Commonwealth Bank would prefer the destinies of the bank to be in the hands of an independent board of directors, rather than of a Governor who will be under the direction of the Treasurer. If a referendum of depositors were taken on that question the vote in favour of the retention of the Commonwealth Bank Board would be almost unanimous. The proposal for the abolition of the board is not new. The Government has carried on a campaign against the board for a number of years. Long before this legislation was introduced, certain Government supporters, including some Ministers, were urging that at the first opportunity the Government should take steps to dispense with the  Commonwealth  Bank Board. Unfortunately, the Government has had to bow to the wishes of the extreme elements of the Labour party, as it has to do on many other occasions. The abolition of the board, which in the oast has been the bank's greatest guarantee of. security  is a. serious step, taken at the very time when the services of men with wide experience in business, primary production, and industry generally would be most valuable. The activities of the bank are to be expanded greatly, and it is to undertake functions of which it has not had any experience. The bank will break new ground in the administration of industrial advances, and will undertake much wider activities in regard to housing. At a time such as this, any sensible businessman would strengthen the board rather than abolish it. In my opinion, the Government is committing a grave crime against the men and women of this country who have been the mainstay of the Commonwealth Bank by. depositing their money in it. T urge the Government to accept this amendment in the interests of the bank, and of the people of this country. The abolition of the board would be a retrograde step. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Minister for Trade- andi Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> will reject this amendment because I believe that by removing the Commonwealth Bank Board we shall at last be giving to the bank an opportunity to do the work of the nation which its founders intended it should do. Honorable senators opposite talk of having the activities of the bank guided by a board of independent business men; but of what are they independent? Most of the men who have held office as members of the board in the past, have had associations with the private banks, and have been more inclined to look after the interests of those banks than the interests of the nation. It is time that the Government took a stand, and refused to allow individuals who have interests conflicting with those of the community, to direct the financial affairs of this nation. The Advisory Council, which the Government proposes to create, will advise the Governor, in the interests of the people. The reconstitution of the Commonwealth Bank Board would be a retrograde step. Earlier to-day, it was stated that the policy of the Commonwealth Bank in the past had been not to encourage the transfer of accounts from the private banks to the Commonwealth Bank. Why was that policy formulated ? Was it in the interests of the people of this country, or in the interests of the private banks? Obviously, it was in the interests of the private banks. We are determined that the Commonwealth Bank no longer shall be hampered by the board of so-called independent men.- I strongly urge the rejection of the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause substitutes a Governor for the existing Commonwealth Bank Board. What is the reason for the change? Has the Commonwealth Bank, under an independent, non-political board, stagnated since the board was created in 1924? On the contrary, the bank has made remarkable progress. Here are some facts: In 1924 62 full branches of the bank operated in Australia; there are now 275 branches - four times as many. The most modern building built in any country town during the past ten years is the branch of the Commonwealth Bank; the staff has increased more than three times, from 1,800 to 6,300; the assets of the bank have risen from £134,000,000 to £457,000,000. Before the war the Rural Credits Department had lent £125.000,000; in the last four and a half years the bank advanced £244,000.000 on the sale of primary products. Surely these facts reveal the flexibility and progress of the bank under the administration of an independent board. What is the need for its abolition? The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems made no such recommendation. </para>

                <para>The bank has been able to do wonderful work during this war and has earned the gratitude of the people. It has been able to do so because it has enjoyed the confidence of the people. That is because it has maintained proper banking procedure. If the Governor, or a branch manager, regards a man as not having a good security, or as not conducting his business properly, the bank should bo free to say, " We are dealing with the deposits of the thrifty people of Australia. The money we hold has been lent to us, because the people trust us. It is up to us, as a banking institution, to make certain that the money we lend shall be wisely and safely used ". The administration of the bank must be free to judge the facts. In collaboration with an advisory council, as is proposed in clause 29, the Governor has no such freedom. The Treasurer is to be a dictator. The Governor, or the council, may declare that the people's savings in the Commonwealth Bank and deposits in the trading banks, are being used to the best advantage, but the Treasurer is to have the power to override that decision. Outside pressure groups, led by extremists and currency cranks, will keep him up to the mark in granting financial assistance for any project - good or bad- The question of votes intrudes itself. These extremists will not be satisfied till every industrial establishment, from the great steel-works at Newcastle down to the smallest private enterprise, is government controlled. Bank credit in millions will be used to compensate owners and shareholders who have invested their savings in. these ventures,, but it must he remembered that the value of every £1. decreases as the amount of bank credit increases. Enterprises which in pre-war years provided employment for about 700,000. men and women, or 80 per cent, of Australia's employable population, are to be taken over by the Government, and some extremists even advocate that no compensation shall be paid. This proposed change in the administration of the Commonwealth Bank is- dynamite designed to destroy what has. been built up over the years. </para>
                <para>On many occasions I have said in this chamber that a greater use of bank credit should have been made during the depression years 1930-32, to carry out some national works, including housing, which would be of economic value at some future date. Should such a catastrophe unfortunately occur again, I believe a bank board, constituted as the bank board was in those depression years, would, in the light of experience, act differently. It would, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes has said, take up the slack and provide bank credit for economic national works. A government, linked with an advisory council . dominated by a Treasurer, is no substitute for a bank board. Such an authority cannot safeguard the savings of the thrifty people of the Commonwealth. I support the amendment. </para>

I cannot understand why honors able senators opposite continually try to undermine the confidence of the people in the Common-wealth Bank. Honorable senators opposite say that the Commonwealth Bank has done  a  good job while under the control of a board. No one denies that; indeed, no one denies that the private banks have done a good job. We on this side give to them credit for what they have done. But that does not alter the fact that we must look to the future, and take steps to provide against the danger of inflation or deflation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toll's</inline> speech was only so much propaganda designed to undermine the confidence of the people in the Government. He advocated a- referendum only because he -wants to delay this measure. He referred to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales which, he said, was forced to close its doors, but he did not say anything about other banks which also closed their doors. </para>

To whom has the Government looked for  advice  during the war if not to the captains of industry, and persons associated with private enterprise? The Government has had the good sense to retain the services of men who were appointed by previous governments to positions of responsibility, and has paid tribute to them for the services that they have rendered to this country in a time of national crisis. Many of these men are directors of big companies, some of which have been denounced as monopolies. Some of them are directors of private banks and other financial institutions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, for instance, is associated with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited which the Government, from time to time, has denounced and said should be taken over by the Government. </para>

                    <para>- Many of the men whom members of the Labour party once denounced have been praised by the present Government for what they have done during the war. Let us be fair to these men, and, instead of denouncing them, give to them credit for what they have accomplished, even though some of them are associated with big financial institutions. Lot us acknowledge that these men who have done so much for governments and the country in the past are worthy of a  place  in the control of the nation's bank. Having regard to their record of service to the nation, how can it reasonably be said that they would treacherously destroy this institution? The best tribute that we can pay to men of their type is to appoint them to the body controlling the bank, because in that capacity they will continue to assist this or any other government in strengthening the institution as the nation's bank. </para>

                    <para>.- People who have enjoyed privilege all their lives think that they are of great importance in the community. Assessment of their value to the nation depend? upon one's point of view, and one's own economic position in 'the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays said that the men of whom he spoke had rendered a great service to Australia. The fact is that while they were in control of the Commonwealth Bank they rendered service only to those privileged few who were entrenched in control of industry, and, during the depression, forced the people to the lowest possible level. Those interests must bear a fair share of the blame for the depression during which many people starved while the hankers lived in luxury. During the depression private banks increased their assets by millions of pounds. The balance-sheets of the private banks show that they made million!: of pounds profit during the depression. No one can deny that fact. This Government intends to take control of the Commonwealth Bank out of the hands of vested interest and thus ensure that the bank will be operated in the interests of the country as a whole. The Government intends to place it under the control of a man who, in respect of banking and monetary policy, will be responsible to the government of the day. He will be assisted by an Advisory Board consisting of experts who are trained in banking. Apparently, honorable senators opposite believe that if a man is a good pig-farmer he is a good banker, provided that upon appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board he is subservient te the interests of hig business. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, for instance, was an expert manufacturer of stoves and bedsteads, and upon his' appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board he was hailed as an expert banker; but as the  chairman  of the board he served the interests of the big financiers. Honorable senators opposite would like to see the old system continued. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson who said that unless the government of the day reduced wages, pensions and social service benefits, generally, the Commonwealth Bank could not make available to it the. finance necessary to enable it to carry on the functions of government. The day when such a thing could happen  ha3  passed. This Government intends to implement its policy which is that the Commonwealth Bank shall be operated in the interests of the nation as a whole. That is the object of the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause provides that the bank shall be managed by a Governor, but, in fact, that will not be the case, because the Governor will not be a free agent. The truth is that under the measure the hank will be controlled by the Treasurer of the day. This is the crucial clause of the bill, because under it the Bank Board is to  Iks  abolished. Thus the way will be open for political control of the bank. That is the object of the bill. No provision is made for consultation by the Governor with independent experts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> spoke about the Advisory Council. That body is to consist solely of servants of the Treasurer or the Governor of the bank. In effect, this provision means that one man who will be subservient to political control is to control monetary and banking policy in this country in the future. The clause places tremendous power in the hands of one man. He will be not the Governor of the bank but the Treasurer of the day. [ do not know of any democratic country, certainly not within the British Empire, where such a system operates. We hear much talk about democracy and democratic control, but the underlying principle of the measure is reversion to one man control of the Commonwealth Bank. That idea is opposed entirely to the, democratic principle. The bill definitely means political control of banking in this country. But when one pauses to consider the proposal, he will find that it is a twoedged sword. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not surprised at the outbursts of honorable senators opposite in their endeavours to reply to the criticism of the Opposition. It has been said that during the depression the Commonwealth Bank was not able, owing to its managerial set-up, to come to the assistance of the government of the day. I point out. that since the depression, the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems unanimously reported that the method of managing the bank by a board was satisfactory. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> who, possibly, is responsible for this measure to a greater degree than any other member of the Government, was a member of that commission. The commission in paragraph 575 of its report which was reported to Parliament on 24th August, 1927, unanimously made the following observations - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The present method of government of the Commonwealth Bank is by a board, appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and consisting of a Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, and six directors who hold office for a term of years and retire in rotation. The board elects its own chairman. We are of opinion that that method of government is generally satisfactory. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That report has been made since the depression. Therefore, I disagree with the arguments advanced by honorable senators opposite in- favour of abolishing the board and placing the control of the bank in the hands of a Governor who will be subject to direction by the Treasurer of the day. The object of such a provision is to give to caucus, through the Treasurer, complete control of the policy of the Commonwealth Bank. Under the system of board control, the Commonwealth Bank has grown from very small beginnings to its present proportions; and it has successfully directed financial policy through periods of depression and periods of boom. The selection of the personnel of the Commonwealth Bank Board from, representatives of all spheres of industry was wise, because it gave to the bank the benefit of the wisdom and vision of men experienced in industry. It will be a retrograde, step to do away with that system and place the control of the bank in the hands of a Governor subject to the direction of the Treasurer of the day. </para>

                    <para>.- All ofus visualize the Commonwealth Bank as one of the bul  warks  of the nation,  and  all of us wish to see it succeed1. "We visualize  Unprecedented  expansion in the post-war period. Under the bill  many  provisions are made to enable the bank to operate in many new fields. In such circumstances, those in control of the bank will require, to a far greater degree than has been the case in the past, the advice of men of wide experience and knowledge in industry. Therefore, it is unwise to throw the whole of the responsibility of managing the bank on to one man. One can easily visualize the expansion that  will  take place in our mining, wheat, wool, dairying and timber industries. In spite of what honorable senators opposite have said, the proposed Advisory Council will, I believe, prove to be an absolute "washout". It will not afford the Governor of the bank the assistance which he will require in order' to enable the bank to cope with the tremendous industrial expansion we now envisage. No matter how brilliant the members of the council may be, the fact remains that they virtually lead  a  cloistered life like monks in a monastery. They are out of touch with the outside world. I do not suggest that they lack ability in particular spheres; but they certainly lack the indispensible experience which can only be gained by rubbing shoulders with the outside world. In order to enable the bank to assist industry as it should, the Governor must have the benefit of the advice of men actively engaged in industry. </para>

                <para>I cannot understand the attitude of honorable senators opposite who decry a man simply because he succeeds in some undertaking,  and  brand such a man as  a  traitor. Men who have succeeded in business have rendered valuable service to this country. However, many people seem to think that it is a crime to succeed in life, whilst, at the same time, they laudthe unsuccessful man. If  we  wish the bank to prosper and flourish, those in control of it must have available to them the wisdom gained by experience in every section of industry. Every man, woman and child in the community will be affected by the policy of the bank in the future. The Government is to give all that power to one man. Has it any guarantee that that one man will be infallible? May he not make mistakes? I am not in favour of any Treasurer, regardless of the political party to which he belongs, controlling the financial destiny of this country. It is not right. It is against all the principles of democratic government. Honorable gentlemen opposite hark back to the depression. Under the very system proposed, the greatest depression could be created by one man. I would have twelve men on the board. They would give much sounder advice on what steps should be taken than could any one man in the community. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, largely by the private banks, and, as a matter of fact, our total indebtedness on account of the 1914-1918 war was only £300,000,000; so it was a comparatively small thing looked at from the present day point of view. In this six-year war, the Commonwealth Bank has done a magnificent job under the board. I have not heard one whisper from anyone opposite condemning that board for any of its actions, at any rate, since the war broke out. It is poor recompense to the board, after having carried out a magnificent job, to be suddenly attacked by honorable gentlemen opposite. It would be well for Government supporters to study their own party's history. They have completely turned about-face. This principle of control of the Commonwealth Bank by a Governor and not by a board is a sudden development, because, when the bank was created, the Labour party was in power, and the late Andrew Fisher and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, members of the Labour party that are credited by it with the honour of having established the bank, made it a cardinal principle that the bank should be divorced from political control. Later in the party's history, in 1930, when Labour was again in power, it sought to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act. </para>

                        <para>- There must have been some driving force outside to bring about the change of mind. There must have been some one saying, " We must get a grip on the finances of this country in order to control it ". So, when the Government puts forward the plea that a governor, not a board of directors, should control the Commonwealth Bank, it knows that a governor will be much more easily controlled by the Treasurer than would be a board composed of independent men who, if forced to do something against their will, would probably resign and thereby call public attention to the matter. The Government has refused even to make a provision compelling an administration to disclose whether there has been a dispute with the Governor whom it knows it could control more easily than it could central a board. This destruction of the Bank Board is a cruel act. I say " cruel act " in reference not to the board, because I do not suppose the members care very much, but to the people of Australia. The Government is departing from what it calls its democratic attitude by placing the whole financial structure and economic welfare of Australia in the hands of the Treasurer of the day. This clause is the crux of the bill. I have not heard it said in so many words, but it is very evident that the whole object of the bill  is that the will of the Treasurer of the day shall prevail and that he shall be able to give orders to the 'Commonwealth Bank to do whatever he thinks is right. </para>

                <para>It is no good dwelling much longer on this matter, except to point out again that this is altogether a departure from the previous performances and opinions of the Labour party. The Government has not given one reason, in this chamber anyway, why it is supplanting the board by a single governor. Various charges have been made by junior Government supporters which amount almost to charges of corruption against members of the board. They have been too astute to apply the charges to any particular member of the board, but the inference from their speeches is that members have been influenced in their duties by the fact that, being engaged in, say, agriculture, they have probably banked with private banks and have carried out their duties for the benefit of those banks. That is an outrageous statement about people who have given the best years of their jives- </para>

                        <para>- Yes, they have given the best years of their lives successfully in carrying out the financial policy of this country. They, are now talked about by Government supporters as if they were " crooks ", because they have been successful. Naturally, any man who has been successful has been engaged in some industry. The proposed Advisory Council, which is to be substituted for the Board of Directors, is the most absurd body I have ever heard of. Before it is too late, I appeal to the Minister to amend this clause in order to preserve the Bank Board. "We will take all the other provisions if the Government will do this. The provision that the Bank Board shall disappear spoils the bill and will inevitably react against Australia's economic security and mar the splendid record of success of the Commonwealth Bank under the board. </para>

                    <para>.- The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil's</inline> amendment would be to restore the Commonwealth Bank Board. That is contrary to the policy of the Government. The Government considers that an institution like the Commonwealth Bank should be under management which is divorced from profit interests and, after careful consideration, it has decided to revert to the original conception of control by the Government. This matter was the subject of a tremendous amount of debate in the Cabinet itself and, at the finish, the decision was unanimous. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot allow to go unchallenged the suggestion of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> that the Commonwealth Bank Board is anathema to the Government on account of associations of some of its members with profit-making institutions, because, in reference to some members of die present board, appointed by the Government, that is not correct. I gave their names in my second-reading speech. No one could associate them, as the Minister has done the Commonwealth Bank Board in general, with profitmaking motives. No one could associate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> B. Duffy with the profit motive, because he was appointed as the representative of the Melbourne Trades Hall. I mention him first because he is the only director whom I have personally met several times, and I hold him in very high esteem. To suggest that he is the creature of some profit-making machine is quite contrary to fact. Nor can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> point the finger of scorn at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> B. Taylor, another director appointed by this Government, who is Vice-President of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party. He is certainly not actuated by any private profit-making motives. Next we have <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> who was appointed by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> No one could associate him with profitmaking motives. Nor could any one associate the Secretary of the Treasury with private profit-making motives. Then we have the Governor, the fifth on the list. Could any one associate him with private profit making? There we have five of the seven directors, and one can safely say that all would support the present Government. No suggestion of association with any private commercial enterprises can be made against any one of them. What astounds me is that, when he was a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> was in favour of a bank board. In those days he was supposed to be a left-winger. Now - the press, I think, is responsible - his category is definitely "moderate". Now that he is a moderate he is to be a dictator. In my opinion, that is putting the cart before the horse. I would say that the left-winger of  1937,  when the banking commission'3 report was made, has shown by his actions in connexion with this bill to have become distinctly red, not moderate. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs should curb some of his supporters in their use of extravagant language, such as " this Commonwealth Bank Board, hiding under a cloak of privilege", because none of the gentlemen on it should be pilloried, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp,</inline> for one, has tried to do, for they are all very reasonable men. They arc men who reasonably could be expected to support the Treasurer of the day. Therefore, I cannot understand why the Government has decided to abolish the board. In the course of this debate, loose statements have been made with regard to the freedom of the Commonwealth Bank to establish new branches throughout the Commonwealth. I cannot see in what manner this freedom is restricted in any way. The bank continually has been opening new branches throughout the Commonwealth. In Western Australia there was a proposal recently to open two new branches, one at Wagin and the other at York. In Victoria also, two or three months ago, it was announced that at least, six new branches were to be opened. Under what rule - or misrule - is the Bank Board prevented from opening new branches? I am sure that there is no such rule, except, of course, the rules of banking which are scientific in their application. There is nothing in the charter of the Commonwealth Bank to prevent the board from opening new branches wherever it is thought that proftable .activities may be carried out. The practice is to establish first a savings bank branch in the post office of a country centre, and then, should business warrant it, to open a separate branch. </para>
                <para>There is no need for this measure at all, because the Commonwealth Bank already . has power to do all that is necessary in the interests of the safety and progress of the bank. The activities of the bank are limited only by banking practice. The Commonwealth Bank was not started by public servants nor has  it  developed under the control only of the Treasurer or his financial advisers. It was placed upon a sound footing by ex-officers of the private trading banks. I recall that when the Commonwealth Bank was established, the cream of the senior staffs of the private banks was selected for the new organization. These men were offered higher salaries and better prospects of promotion to work for the Commonwealth Bank. It was these competent officers who established the present system of banking, which I do not think has been excelled anywhere eli-e in the world. They have done an excellent job. </para>
                <para>I make this last-minute appeal to the Minister to accept the Opposition's amendment. </para>

                <para>I emphasize the concluding words " not as representatives of special interests". This measure takes control of the bank from the Governor and a Board of Directors, and places it in the hands of the Governor and an Advisory Council. The only distinction I see is that whereas the board is composed of representatives selected from agriculture, commerce, finance or industry - a part-time board and one to which I do not attribute any wrong motives, but which, at least, is open to the suggestion that it is biased in favour of its own interests - the Advisory Council will consist of high executive officers of the Government and of the bank, whose sole interest will be that of the bank and whose statutory duty will be to attend to the welfare of the people of Australia. They will not have any other interests to serve. Surely honorable senators opposite will not suggest that that is not a worthy objective. It cannot be argued that these men will not advise the Governor in the interests of the welfare of the nation. </para>
                <para>The bill provides that the general banking department of the bank may carry on general banking business. That provision leaves the generalbanking organization as free as any private trading bank to seek advice wherever it believes that useful advice may be obtained. In addition to obtaining advice from the Advisory Council, the Governor will be quite at liberty to consult men of wide experience in agriculture, commerce, finance and industry. I repeat that there is no innovation in the proposed clause, and in the interests of Australia, it has everything to commend it. </para>

                    <para>. -  For some time I have made representations to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> for a better trunk line telephone service between Adelaide and the other capital cities, but because of difficulties in connexion with the supply of materials, it has not been provided. Indeed, the position is getting worse, because it is almost impossible to speak from Adelaide to Canberra or vice versa. It frequently happens that a trunk line connexion applied for in the morning of one day is not made until the next day; or, it may be that the caller, is notified that no one is answering at the other end. That is understandable if the connexion is made after business hours. I ask that the telephone service between Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra be improved. If that cannot be done by opening new channels, I suggest that a connexion be made between the terminal cities without passing through Melbourne every time. Adelaide should be given the same telephonic facilities as exist between Sydney and Canberra. </para>

                    <para>.- Earlier to-day I asked a series of questions for which the Minister representing the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> asked for notice. My questions related to instructions recently issued to members of the Australian Military Forces that no officer below the rank of lieutenant-colonel shall, in future, be permitted to censor his own mail. Once a man has received the King's Commission it has been the practice to allow him to censor his own letters. He is placed on his honour, and, so far as I am aware, that confidence has never been misplaced. If the recent instructions have been issued under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, I can only say that it amounts to an insult to every officer below the rank of lieutenantcolonel. In some operational areas officers of the Australian Military Forces serve with officers of the Royal Australian Air Force and of the Royal Australian Navy, but only the military officers are subject to this ban; officers of the other services are still permitted to censor their own letters. What is the reason for this differentiation? In some forward areas, officers with the rank of lieutenant, captain or major may not have another officer serving with them. Such men commit a breach of Army orders if they write home to members of their families. That such an order should have been issued is disgraceful, and I hope that the Commander-in-Chief of the </para>

However, should the State Government desire to change the gauge of its railways, or embark upon a plan for modernization of its rolling stock and the standardization of equipment and parts, the Commonwealth Government will be happy to co-operate in making available all technical information in its possession, and in any other manner subject to mutual agreement. </para>

I do not suggest that the 3ft. 6in. railways of Tasmania be converted to 4ft. 8½in. gauge, but I do say that as the Tasmanian railways have carried extremely heavy traffic for defence purposes during the war, and have suffered from lack of man-power, a portion of the £70,000,000 which, I understand, is likely to be expended in improving railways generally, shall be allocated to Tasmania. In that State, as well as in the mainland States, bridges need strengthening and portions of the track require regrading.

                    <para>. -  Recently, 1 have received numbers of letters from men serving with the troops in Pacific areas, and some of the matters referred to have been taken up with the Minister representing the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Eraser).</inline> I wish, however, to refer now to certain matters which the men have emphasized, particularly in relation to food, tobacco, clothes, beer and leave. I shall deal, first, with the food position. The Army establishment lays down that a certain number of cooks shall be provided for each unit, but in island warfare it is frequently necessary that men shall be split up into small numbers. The result is that the standardized cooking arrangements break <inline font-style="italic">down.</inline> It should be possible to enlarge the cooks' establishment so that the food provided can be used to the best advantage. In my opinion, not sufficient attention is given by the Army authorities to the men who are responsible for the cooking of the meals of the fighting men. I should like to see cooks given the rank of corporal or sergeant, so that men of the best type may be encouraged to act as cooks. Usually, in the Army men are not anxious to take jobs as cooks. Men should be trained as cooks, and should be encouraged to take such jobs. This could fcu done by initiating some system of promotion for cooks, say, to the rank of corporal or sergeant. My experience is that, so far as food and cooking are concerned, men in the militia forces are better catered for than men in the Australian Imperial Force. Therefore, I urge that steps be taken to increase the number of cooks in Army establishments. I am told that our deficiency of cooks in the total establishments of all arms of our forces is 1.2 per cent. That may not seem to be a serious shortage, but upon examination it will be found, to be so. The accumulation of leave is also causing concern among members of the fighting services. To-day, many men have accumulated 70 days' leave, and at the present rate their turn will not come around until 1947. I realize the difficulties which exist in respect of this problem. I do not need to stress the importance of providing adequate and regular rations of tobacco to members of the service. Such amenities tend towards the contentment of the forces as a whole. I also bring to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> the shortages of clothing, particularly shirts and. trousers, and also boots. 1 realize that the Minister is anxious to rectify complaints in this respect and <inline font-style="italic">J am</inline> sure that once these matters have been mentioned he will give prompt attention to them. </para>

                    <para>.- One evening last week I attended a meeting  of  about 500 persons in a Melbourne suburb. The meeting represented a cross section of thrifty people of moderate means, and it  was  called to express indignation at the action of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in approving the compulsory acquisition by the Victorian Housing  Commission  of blocks of land . owned by members of the fighting services. Resentment was also expressed at the commission's high-handed methods in acquiring at  low  valuation building block? owned by non-service nien and women. Honorable senators are aware that the reason for regulation 15a of the National Security (War Service Moratorium) Regulations was to safeguard the assets of those who are fighting for the freedom and protection of Australia. It is true that the Attorney-General has the right to exercise his discretion in granting approval, presumably in exceptional cases; but I do not think that it was intended that the principle underlying those regulations could be destroyed by one stroke of the pen. The regulation as it now stands might as well be repealed. At the meeting to which I refer it was stated that land belonging to discharged servicemen, prisoners of war and others  now  serving overseas has been compulsorily acquired at half its purchase price. I asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice - </para>

                <para class="block">The answer which  was  supplied to me this afternoon was most unsatisfactory. The Minister quoted regulation 34a of those regulations, whereby claims for compensation  can  be made in certain circumstances within two years. What compensation is an owner likely to obtain after battling for his rights for two years? The assessment of the Housing Commission in the instances to which I refer should be at least the purchase price of the blocks in question. Some blocks which the commission assessed at  £75  were bought before the war, when' prices were normal, for  £140.  That is an injustice to  these  men many of whom are still serving overseas. Who is going to occupy the homes built on these blocks? Not the owner, but persons who have been able to record their names on the commission's first list of applicants for homes. I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General to reconsider the question I asked, and  see  if he cannot supply a more satisfactory answer. </para>

I am advised that approximately  7,500  members of the staffs of the department are now serving in the armed forces, and that approximately  800  officers of the department arc also in the services. In addition, the department is short of equipment. Owing to these shortages of man-power and equipment the department is not able to keep pace with the demands now being made upon it. I assure the honorable senator that his complaint will be fully investigated. I suggest that honorable senators who experience undue delay, particularly when they arc in Canberra, in obtaining trunk-line connexions, should let me know and I shall be glad to do all I can , to minimize such delays. I have already been able to afford some relief in that way. </para>

                    with respect to censorship is most important. If his statements are in accordance with facts there must be some good reason for the action of which he complains. However, the Government is well aware of the effect of such a decision upon the morale of the troops.
