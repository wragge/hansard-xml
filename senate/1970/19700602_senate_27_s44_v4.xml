            <para>- Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate recall a question about petrol prices 1 asked him on 21st May - almost 2 weeks ago - and further information I gave to him that night during the debate on the adjournment of the Senate, including a reference to a statement on petrol prices and possible tax evasion by petrol companies which are exporting millions of gallons of petrol from Australia? In view of the almost completed inquiry into petrol prices by the Prices Commissioner of South Australia, which is expected quickly to determine the prices of petrol throughout the Commonwealth, and because of the urgency of this matter. 1 ask the Minister: What action has the Government taken to investigate the serious statements made by the  Chairman  of XL Petroleum Pty Ltd? That action was promised by the Leader of the Government on 21st May. </para>

            <para>- I certainly do recall the question asked of me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald.</inline> I readily recall that he gave me a Press cutting which pointed out the substance of the question he posed. As is normal with questions outside my portfolio. 1 referred the question to the appropriate Minister. I am not in a position to give any information at the moment because none has been supplied to me by way of response As the honourable senator indicated, the retail price of patrol is influenced by a decision of the Prices Commissioner of South Australia. I have no shadow of doubt io my mind that the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> as the basis of his question will be within the knowledge and awareness of the Prices Commissioner of South Australia. Therefore, I would assume that this matter has been examined at that level. Nevertheless, I will seek to obtain an answer to the question that was directed to me. </para>

If the Department has not any specific knowledge of this matter, would it take steps to carry out an investigation, if this is practicable, as to the standard in these matters in the United States so as to p&#39;ace beyond doubt  whether  the ban imposed on exports of Australian mutton is political only or really bona fide? </para>

              <para>- Yes - making the lax available. So the concept is to gather the tax and then to make it available to rural municipalities. This is a Budget matter. As the honourable senator knows, all I can do is refer a submission put by way of a question to the Treasurer. I would not necessarily accept that if local government did get a rebate in that way it would follow that there would be a reduction of municipal rates because other considerations might come into that aspect of the matter. Nevertheless, the question is one for the Treasurer. Yes, 1 will ask the Treasurer to give consideration to the proposal. </para>

I immediately called for an inqury as to the circumstances. I understand, from a preliminary report that 1 have received, that the indications are that some beer ordered for the sergeants&#39; mess has been sold to a hotel on the Gold Coast, lt is clear that this was not done by the member of the mess for persona! gain, lt would appear to be an ill advised action However, 1 am awaiting a more detailed report before I reply. </para>

In view of the fact that interest on servicing returns on investment and such received from property are not regarded as income, would it not be reasonable that an ex-serviceman having a  disability  occasioned by war service should have his monetary compensation also discounted, particularly when war pensions are. in any case, not inadequate in many instances? </para>

            <para>- The future of the Rose Bay Flying boat base is interwoven with the future of air transport to Lord Howe Island. The Rose Bay flying boat base exists to serve the flying boats which transport people to and from Lord Howe Island. The general future of the air service to Lord Howe Island is also tied up with the provision of a potential air strip on that island. Discussions are going on between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales which constitutionally owns and is responsible for Lord Howe Island. The discussions are not very far away from reaching fruition. I hope to have something to say about them before too much longer when decision is finally reached. The decision will give some estimate of the time flying boats will be called upon to operate from the Rose Bay flying boat base. I imagine that when the time comes that the flying boat is no longer required for service to Lord Howe Island, the destiny of the Rose Bay flying boat base will be determined in the light of prevailing circumstances. This is a matter of interest to New South Wales and, as 1 said earlier, it is tied up with the provision of the future air service to Lord Howe Island. </para>

I read it in a slightly different context from that suggested in the question posed by the honourable senator. I believe that it was on a far wider canvas than was the question directed to me.I wantto make it abundantly clear that the Government has a very substantial interest in the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, We, as a government, are part of that organisation to that extent. I repeat what 1 have said here quite a number of limes: It is Government policy and it is certainly my responsibility to see that we have a viable aircraft industry. That does not mean only the Government Aircraft Factories; it means the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, the Hawker de Havilland company in Sydney and all industries associated with the aircraft industry. </para>

This was part of a plan in the normal working of the aircraft industry to see whether we had a capability in relation to a certain proposed type of aircraft that the Services may require in the future. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator is getting away from the serious answer that I am giving to the question that was putto me. I want to make it clear at all times that a tremendous amount of my Department&#39;s time is directed to the aircraft industry by way of trying to obtain an Australian component in any aircraft requirement. The Minister for Defence made a statement yesterday. I think, in which he pointed out that, because Australia will require a certain number of helicopters - more than a hundred - for our defence Services, and this will involve an expenditure of the order of$100m. we are seeking lo let contracts which will ensure that there will be an Australian content and that there will be a sub-contractual opportunity for organisations such as the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation,the Government Aircraft Factories and the Hawker de Havilliand company in relation to those contracts. Coming back to where I started,I think the honourable senator has placed an interpretation on the statement of the Managing Director of the Corporation which is perhaps a little more critical than he intended it to be. </para>

            <para>- My question is directedto the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Is the Minister aware that the present appointments of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Madgwick as  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Western Australian Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Masel.</inline> are due for renewal on 30th June of this year? In view of the Postmaster-General&#39;s criticism of the Commission last week, namely that the Government has a responsibility to require that expenditures by the Commission are not extravagant or wasteful, and in view of the fact that, for some time past, the Commission&#39;s current affairs programmes have been characterised, in his opinion, by a lack of sufficient care in the expenditure of public moneys, is the Minister able to say whether the Government intends to renew these 2 appointments at the end of this month? </para>

In the first place, if it is a military document, the authority for its publication will be obviously within the defence complex. But the honourable senator asked subsequent questions about the material that is contained in the document.

In the light of remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on 13th May, that a meeting of wildlife authorities was being held in Darwin in the week beginning 25th May as a possible prelude to a summit meeting between Federal and State Ministers on the same subject, can the Minister now obtain for the information of the Senate full details of decisions made at this preliminary meeting and ascertain whether a date has been selected for the summit meeting of the appropriate Ministers? </para>

            <para>- The meeting of officials was held as indicated in the previous answer and a number of resolutions were passed. However, as 1 am sure the honourable senator would appreciate on reflection, those resolutions are confidential until they have been considered by the responsible Ministers of State. So far no date has been set for the ministerial meeting. </para>

            <para>- lt is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> indicates, that we are approaching the time for the final firing at Woomera for the ELDO programme in Australia, lt is equally true that we are now embarking on some additional work at Woomera for the NASA organisation in relation to &#39;Aerobee&#39; firings. 1 made a statement earlier in relation to the employment situation at Woomera which suggested that there would be some rearranging of personnel. However, in the light of the new angle to the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> perhaps it would be more appropriate if I were to get a detailed reply from the Department, which I should be able to have within the next 24 or 48 hours. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased that it has been noticed that a display of historical records of Kingsford-Smith is on exhibition in Kings Hall, Parliament House, at present. It will be recalled that Kingsford-Smith made aviation history in 1928 by crossing the Pacific, that he followed this up by flying from Sydney to London in the same year, that he followed that by flying from Ireland to New York in the following year and then from New York to San Francisco, thus circumnavigating the globe by air. That was a feat which I feel is fit for comparison with that of Captain James Cook whose bi-centenary of the discovery of our land we celebrate this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The historical record in Kings Hall is the product of a devoted student of Kingsford-Smith&#39;s achievements, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byrne,</inline> who commenced his labours on this exhibition at about the time that Kingsford Smith was making history. As honourable senators will see, it consists of a model of the &#39;Southern Cross&#39; which was built to scale from the original blueprints and consists of about 110 moving parts. This is associated with many other pictorial and literary records subscribing to the outstanding position of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford-Smith in Australian aviation. The whole exhibit is offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byrne</inline> to the Commonwealth Government on the basis that it would be found a home in Canberra. It is therefore being exposed for the assessment and judgment of members of Parliament in Kings Hall this week and, upon that experience, a decision will be made as to whether it will be accepted as a national historical record. </para>

It could therefore be expected that multilateral action would be considered by the signatories under the Treaty if and when the need arose to control any threat of pollution to the region. </para>
            <para>Representatives of the signatories to the Antarctic Treaty meet regularly and make recommendations about measures in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty. One such set of measures deals wilh the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and I- 1 ora and covers such matters as harmful interference with the normal living conditions of those species - for example, each participating Government is requested to take al) reasonable steps towards the alleviation of pollution of the waters adjacent to the coast and the ice shelves of Antarctica. </para>
            <para>There is at present no commercial exploitation of mineral resources in the Antarctic such as already exists in the Arctic region and so pollution from that source is not an immediate problem. </para>
            <para>However, the action taken so far suggests that the need to introduce measures to control pollution in the general sense in Antarctica are likely to be kepi under review by the signatories to the Treaty. </para>

            <para>The estimated cost of roadworks, engineering, and bridgeworks associated with the ring road surrounding Capital Hill in Canberra is $2,330,000. lt will be appreciated that the ring road is a basic element in the total road system linking the several major residential and employment centres of Canberra. There are therefore a number of other road works which have a functional relationship with the ring road. Some of these works have been undertaken progressively during the past live years and others are still to be completed&#39;. There is currently a separate contract in progress for the interchange from Adelaide Avenue to Slate Circle amounting to $616,621. Works completed include the Commonwealth Avenue/Parkes Way interchange, the Commonwealth Avenue bridge southern interchange, Kaye Street and Flynn Drive, Langton Crescent and pans of Slate Circle. Adelaide Avenue and Yarra Glen Arterial extending to the Woden Valley. </para>

            <para>The presence of aRussian trawler of approximately 250 tons fishing to the north west of Stanley was reportedto the Department of Primary Industry on 9lh April 1970. This followed a sighting of a trawler bearing the mark SDT M8/415 on the previous day. From subsequent investigations it was established that two trawlers and another vessel, possibly a refrigerator ship, were operating in the area ofRobbins Island in Bass Strait. These craft were identified from an aerial survey as the &#34;Pelamida&#39;, the Cymbl&#39;, and the M8/415 mentioned above. </para>

            <para>I am not aware of any case in which a public servant  has,  been charged under the Crimes Act with neglect of duly: indeed, there is no such offence created by that Act.Mostcases of misconduct or neglect of duty on the part of public servants are  dealt  with administratively under the Public Service Act. Where, however, a public servant has apparently commited in the course of his duty, an offence against a law that is of general application (for example, a law prohibiting stealing from the Commonwealth) or against a law that imposes special duties on public servants(for example, a law prohibiting the disclosure of secret or confidential information) consideration is given to laving charges under the Crimes Act. Whether a charge  is  laid depends upon the facts and upon an  assessment  of what the public interest requires. </para>

First call on building funds is to satisfy air safety or operational requirements and it follows we believe, that funds that arc available for terminals should be spread over the maximum number of projects, with each terminal designed to ensure good ventilation.

            <para>- On 23rd April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> asked if, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, I would ascertain the reasons for the delay in the delivery of bound volumes of Hansard and. if the reason were shortage of staff in which departments of the Government Printing Office such shortages occur and the additional number of tradesmen requiredto eliminate such shortages. On13th May I provided an answer for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> which explained that the delay was caused by the magnitude of the work the fact that binding cannot beginfor 6to8 weeks after the close of a session until the indexes have been compiled by the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and set by the Government Printer, and the Christmas close-down. On 14th May <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> suggested that my reply did not answer those parts of his question concerning staff shortages at the Printing Office. If. however, the honourable senator will look again at the reply to his original question, he will see that the delay was. in the main, caused not by shortages of staff  in the Government Printing Office, but by other factors. </para>

              <para>Careful consideration has been given to this suggestion on a number of occasions previously. The position is that Australia is becoming increasingly popular as an international conference venue and in view of the numerous requests received for conference stamps, it is necessaryto adopt a very selective policy towards requests of this nature.It is necessary to limitnew stamp issues to about eight to twelve each year and. in order to maintain a reasonable coverage of subjects of particular national importance, the number of conferences which can be commemorated is relatively small. The Postmaster-General had already given his approval for <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> conference stamps for 1970 prior to the first representations by the Australian teachers&#39; Federation. Since thenthe Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Congress, originally set down for Australia  in  1971  and  for which a commemorative stamp was approved, will now be held here  in  October 1970, making  3  conference stamps already approved for this year. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Several important stamp issues have already been made this year  in  commemoration of notable occasions such as the Royal Visit, the Cook  Bicentenary  and Expo 70. The popularity of these issues has made it necessary to produce substantial printings which, in turn, have reduced the production capacity available for the remainder of the year. The printing presses will now be fully occupied for the next several months producing stamps scheduled for issue later in the year. The new stamp issues scheduled for the remainder of 1970, which, incidentally, is a particularly heavy year for stamp issues, include stamps highlighting out natural resources of bauxite, oil and natural gas; Snowy Mountains and Ord River developments; 4 famous Australians; the 25th Anniversary of the United Nations; and the 50th Anniversary of Qantas Airways Ltd. The Postmaster-General has assured me that he appreciates the importance of the Assembly of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession but for the reasons explained he is unable to agree to the issue of a commemorative stamp. </para>

            <para>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It refers to the French nuclear tests which are to be held in the Pacific area.I ask the Minister what special precautions against fall out or what programme for recording fall-out over Australia have been recommended by the Government during this week. 1 also ask the Minister which of the committees have responsibility in this matter. Is it the National Radiation Advisory Committee or the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee? Have only these 2 committees been asked to makethe survey or has the Government taken some other action to ensure the safely of the Australian people </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Radio-active fall-out in Australia is monitored in two complementary programmes. One has continued 24 hours a day since 1957 and is devoted to the low levels of long lived isotopes in fallout. Strontium 90 and Caesium137. The other programme is directed mainly at the shorter-lived radio- isotopes in fall-out which may be of signifiance only in the few months during and immediately after atest series. This short term programme is instituted for particular series of tests for which fall-out might reach Australia, such as those carried out by France in Polynesia. Results from these monitoring programmes are publishedafter the scientific journals as soon as possible after the measurements are completed. The National Radiation Advisory Committee was appointed by the Commonwealth Government in </para>
            <para class="block">May 1957  to  advise the Commonwealth Government through the Prime Minister  on  matters concerning the effects  of  ionising radiation  on  the Australian community. The results of the monitoring programmes which are conducted by the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee  are  made available  to  the National Radiation Advisory Committee. In November 1965 the NRAC  in  conjunction with the AWTSC undertook  an  assessment  of  any biological hazard which might arise  in  Australia  as a  result of the French Tests then scheduled  to  be conducted  in  the South Pacific Ocean area. The NRAC, after consideration of analyses from the AWTSC,  was  satisfied that the proposed tests were unlikely  to  lead  to a  significant biological hazard  in  Australia. This conclusion was confirmed by the NRAC  in its  reports  in  March 1967 and December 1967.  In  its most recently published report - that  of  March 1969- the NRAC concluded that the fall-out over Australia from the most recent series of French nuclear tests  in  the Pacific, like that from earlier French nuclear tests was  of no  significance  as a  hazard  to  the health  of  the Australian population. As far as further tests by the French are concernedthe same monitoring programmes and assessments will be undertaken but the NRAC can see no reasonto depart from its conclusions that the French nuclear weapons tests are unlikely  to  be of significance as hazard to the health  of  the Australian population. </para>

        <para>Thai the  Senate  lake note of the  report. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">In presenting this report to the Senate, I remind honourable senators thai the Select Committee tabled an interim report in the Senate on 25th September 1969. in which it listed its recommendations and suggested that the Committee be re-constituted for the purpose of completing its full report and tabling the evidence taken during the inquiry. As the Committee&#39;s terms of reference were couched in very wide terms, the Committee considered thai it hail a responsibility to inquire into and report upon the widest possible aspects of national health and not to restrict itself lo matters relating to medical and hospital insurance. In this respect the Committee acknowledges the co-operation and assistance of the 1 37 witnesses, whose names are listed in appendix B to the report, and to those other persons and organisations who gave submissions lo the Committee. In addition to recommendations relating to medical and hospital benefits and health insurance organisations, the report contains recommendations and sections relating to a diversity of other subjects, such as nursing home benefits, domiciliary care, denial care, mental health, care of the physically and mentally handicapped and the problems of pharmaceutical costs. In this way the Committee has attempted to lay clown basic proposals for an integrated health care programme, with emphasis on the proven areas of need and the assistance required in respect of them. </para>
      <para>The Committee has also made suggestions in chapter XVII relating to the creation or appointment of certain representative, advisory and consultative bodies and 1 particularly mention to the Senate the suggestion for the appointment of a Senate standing committee on health. Such a committee would serve the dual purpose of overseeing the national health scheme and providing the opportunity for the submission to the Parliament of the views of interested persons and organisations. The members of the Select Committee are acutely aware of the need for the value of both these functions, and the appointment of the recommended standing committee would, J am sure, prove to be of great significance to the future effectiveness of both health insurance and the national health programme. During the inquiry the Committee directed its efforts, and its recommendations, towards the areas of greatest need in the community, lt became apparent thai appropriate, timely, and adequate assistance is vitally necessary in these areas, and should be provided without delay by ail the authorities and organisations involved, including, particularly, the Commonwealth and State Governments, health insurance organisations and the medical profession. The continued existence of a viable national health programme may well depend upon such joint action being taken. </para>
      <para>As  Chairman  of the Select Committee, I wish to record my appreciation of the time and effort put into the Committee&#39;s inquiry by the members of the Committee. The success of a Committee depends mainly upon the work carried out by its members, and 1 have been grateful for the assistance given at all times by the members of this particular Committee. In conclusion, I should also like to refer again to the assistance given to me, and the Committee, by the staff assigned to the Committee. The Secretariat, consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> R. Cumming Thom, the Principal Parliamentary Officer in the Senate, as Secretary, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> Carroll, an Assistant Director-General of Health in the Commonwealth Department of Health, as the Committee&#39;s adviser. The Committee is greatly indebted to both these gentlemen, and I, as  Chairman,  wish to express my own thanks, and the Committee&#39;s thanks, for their dedication to the important and often onerous duties which the Committee&#39;s inquiry imposed upon them. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>VI eC LEL LAN D (New South Wales) |&#39;3.0|  -  During the debate on the National Health Bill a great deal of discussion has centred around the findings of the departmental committee - the Nimmo Committee - but very little has been heard of the Senate select committee that was established to inquire into medical and hospital costs. The Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> ivy Wedgwood has said, was not restricted merely to an inquiry into medical and hospital insurance; it was established to inquire into the vast area of health costs generally in Australia. </para>
      <para>The final report of the Committee has now been brought to fruition. On behalf of the members of the Committee, I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood who performed the task of  chairman  very efficiently and thoroughly As other reports of Senate select committees from time to time have acquired the name of the  chairman  of the committee - for instance, the Vincent report on television and the Anderson report on road safely - 1 believe that it would be fair for this report to be referred to commonly as the Wedgwood report on medical and hospital costs. </para>
      <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood has said, the officers oi the Committee also performed outstanding work on behalf of the Parliament, the Senate and the Australian people. Again as a member of the Committee. I personally express my appreciation to those who did so much to see this report brought to finality. The report contains a tremendous wealth of information. I believe that its contents should bt debated fully in this chamber at some timeHaving that in mind, I now seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

          <para>- by leave - I am sure that all honourable senators are grateful for the work that has been done by the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. I believe that the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> - namely, that the report ought to take the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> ivy Wedgwood - is a very happy one. We have not bad the opportunity to consider the report. We have been able to glance al it in the few minutes since copies of it were distributed, lt shows evidence of a very great deal of care, attenlion and hard work by the members of the Committee, for which we are very thankful </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have a special feeling tot this Committee because it was on 2nd April 1968 that I moved for its establishment, lt is one of the ironies of politics that Government senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood, at that time voted against the motion for the establishment of the Committee. But I think I should say in fairness to Government senators that, when the Committee presented its interim report towards the end of the previous Parliament, it was agreed on all hands to reconstitute the Committee. In fact, a motion that that be done was moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Anderson). We are very grateful that the Committee moved so expeditiously and brought in its report within the time that was set. We trust that the example of expedition that this Committee has given will be followed by other committees, the reports of which are eagerly awaited by the Senate. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to pui into effect the Government&#39;s promise to extend the present program of assistance to teachers&#39; colleges with  a  further S30m in the form of unmatched grants to the States. The Bill provides for expenditure of up to $30m spread over the 3 financial years starting 1st July 1970 under the same arrangements as provided under the existing legislation. The wording of the Bill is, accordingly, substantially the same as the wording of the Act for the current period. Payments will be made to the States in respect of college projects which are selected by the States, to be erected on sites selected by the States, and in accordanace with plans and standards drawn up by the States and approved by the Minister. A schedule showing projects proposed by the States is attached to the copy of this second reading speech which is circulated to honourable senators. All ot the money is going to State Education Department colleges but at least 10% of the places attributable to the expenditure of these grants will be made available to students not bonded to State Education Departments. Winners of Commonwealth advanced education scholarships and university scholarships may apply their scholarships to courses at these colleges. These arrangements provide reasonable opportunities for those students who wish to move directly from college to teach in non-government schools provided, of course, that they meet the other normal entrance requirements. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of the Senate to provisions of the Bill which show changes from the existing legislation. First, the total amount available for the triennium has been raised from $24m to $30m. This increase is designed to assist the States with their teacher education programmes at a realistic and reasonable level and was determined in the light of current experience and knowledge of building costs. Secondly, the preliminary distribution of the $30m among the States has been determined as set out in the Schedule to the Bill. While the Bill makes provision for this distribution to be varied, 1 am pleased to say that the tentative programmes have already been developed to the stage where significant variations are unlikely. The amounts set out in the Schedule to the Bill were determined after due consideration of the many important factors involved. These factors include the population of each State and the amount available to each State in the current triennium. Another major factor is the amount of matched assistance that New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania are receiving for teacher education in colleges of advanced education The overriding considerations however have been the needs of the States and the expected effectiveness of the grants in meeting these needs. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, the amount available in each of the first 2 years has been set at $11m. This is calculated to enable the States&#39; programmes to proceed without undue financial delays and at the same time to avoid excessive fluctuation in both Commonwealth expenditure and State building activities. The expected rate of progress in the first year of the next triennium will be greater than in the current triennium because the States have planned ahead and will be able to use the grants as soon us they become available. </para>
          <para>The need to improve the quality of the teaching force is central to the task of improving the quality of education generally and these grants will enable the States to provide new and replacement teacher education facilities at a better standard and a good deal earlier than they could hope to do from their own resources. This, of course is not the only Commonwealth assistance in this field of education. Over 40% of Government teacher trainees are in universities and the Commonwealth shares fully in the cost, both capital and recurrent, of their education. Furthermore, the Commonwealth is now supporting teacher education in colleges of advanced education - for this triennium, in New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania. There can be no doubt of the pressing need to increase substantially the number of places available to educate teachers for both government and independent schools. Rising enrolments, increasing retention rates at the secondary level, a progressive change from 2 to 3 years courses tor primary teachers and a steady reduction in the pupil-teacher ratios all add to this need. The grants proposed in this Bill will make a significant contribution towards meeting it. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

        <para class="block">The proposed amendment relates to the provision of an appeal by a medical practitioner against a decision of the Minister to disallow a claim in connection with the pensioner medical service.

        <para class="block">Many medical practitioners claim that it is unfair that there is no method of appeal against decisions of disallowance which might be recommended by the committee or decided upon by the Minister. The committee of inquiry conducts its hearings in camera and I understand that there is some disputation, or there has been some disputation, as to whether a doctor appearing before the committee is entitled to legal representation. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> has said in another place that he has had discussions with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> in an endeavour to find some appropriate form of appeal to a court in a case where the committee has found that particular medical services provided for should not have been claimed. The Minister has also indicated that because these committees of inquiry are conducted on a doctor to doctor basis and this system is the one most favoured by the medical profession therefore to bring in a judge on appeal not only on medical matters but also on legal matters will further complicate the situation. </para>
        <para>I point out that already in relation to the immediate termination of the agreement or reprimand of the medical practitioner the medical practitioner has a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. We are also suggesting that so far as section 34 is concerned on the disallowance of claims on report of the committee of inquiry there should be a right of appeal to a court. We say that because this is recognised by the Government under section 37 if the doctor, in connection with the disallowance of a claim, thinks that there has been a miscarriage of justice, this could quite easily be overcome by a right of appeal to a Supreme Court being vested in this case. We believe that it is in the interests of justice that this amendment be carried and I have therefore moved it on behalf of the Opposition. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;3.27&#93; - I have listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> and the points he has raised concerning the amendment which he has placed before the chamber. In replying on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> whom I represent here, 1 inform the Committee that the Govenmcnt must oppose this amendment but it is sympathetic with the objective which is sought by the Opposition and will certainly, after it receives the report of the Administrative Review Committee, give further consideration to the question whether it is practicable to find a form of appeal to a court or. alternatively, to an administrative tribunal in these cases. On coming to that point 1 think. 1 should go into more detail as indeed the Minister himself did. The Minister has been examining the question of an appeal against the reduction and disallowance of claims under the pensioner health medical service for some time and he has had many discussions with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> and the medical profession in an endeavour to find some appropriate form of appeal to a court in these cases. However, he has pointed out, and very clearly, that the principal difficulty is that the committee system itself provides for the examination of the conduct of a medical practitioner by his peers and it is considered that mis is the system most favoured by the profession generally. He also said that the provision of a right of appeal to a court would involve both legal and practical difficulties. </para>
        <para>Let us first look at the legal aspects, lt must be kept in mind that a judge could not make any judgment on the correctness of the committee&#39;s recommendation or on the decision of the Minister to disallow or reduce claims in accordance with the report of the committee without calling expert witnesses to give evidence as to the necessity or otherwise of the visits made to the pensioner patients. There is the undesirable feature thai particular cases would be examined and pensioners could and probably would be called upon to give evidence. In both cases there could be a serious intrusion - I think everyone will appreciate this - into the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship. A/so, as the decision of the Minister is based on the Committee&#39;s assessment of the level of services necessary for the medical needs of the patient a court would not decide an appeal without calling expert witnesses to inform it. </para>
        <para>The most important practical considerations - as compared with legal ones - involved in providing an appeal to a court are that if an appeal to a court were provided it would be difficult to get suitable medical practitioners to serve on the committee and a medical practitioner would be unwilling to serve if he knew that the judgment of the Committee could be examined and questioned in open court. The appeal to a court against termination of a doctor&#39;s agreement to participate in the pensioner medical service is provided in the National Health Act, but in very few cases is the agreement terminated. Since the pensioner medical service was introduced there have been only 12 cases which represent <inline font-style="italic">1%</inline> of the total of the cases examined. The effect of that proportion of cases going to court will probably not discourage medical practitioners from serving on the committee, but if this became the rule rather than the exception the Minister feels quite certain that it could discourage them, lt may be equally difficult to obtain expert witnesses to testify in open court against fellow practitioners who were willing to serve on a committee, and in any case the criterion laid down in the proposed amendment, that the court should consider whether the medical practitioner has been guilty of failure lo discharge conscientiously his obligations under the agreement entered into with the Director-General is inappropriate and inadequate. 1 am so advised by the Government&#39;s legal advisers. </para>
        <para>The committee may recommend disallowance of a claim on the basis that a doctor was being over conscientious in providing more services than were necessary for the medical needs of the patient. The State branches of the Australian Medical Association did not unanimously support he concept of appeals against decisions based on the committee&#39;s recommendations. The only State branch of the AMA which has had very much to say about this matter at all is the New South Wales branch. The debate on this Bill, concerned as it is wilh the major changes in the medical benefits arrangements, does nol seem to me to be the appropriate time to consider the complex question of appeals against decisions made in relation to the pensioner medical service, lt could well be possible to develop a system of appeals lo an administrative tribunal or to the proposed Commonwealth superior court. A committee known as the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee has been established with terms of reference which include consideration of the jurisdiction to be given to the proposed superior court to review administrative decisions. The report of this Committee may well express views concerning administrative appeals otherwise than to a court, and in the Government&#39;s view it would therefore be advisable to await the report of the Committee. That is a point which J want to stress again. I conclude as I commenced by saying that the Government must oppose the amendment but it fully sum.pathises with the objective sought and will certainly, after it receives the report of the Administrative Review Committee, give further consideration 10 the question as to whether it is practicable to find a form of appeal to a court or. alternatively, to an administrative tribunal in these cases. </para>

I am not sure and I would be grateful for the Minister&#39;s advice as to what are the amounts or the rates which are referred to in section 34. I have a belief that those are the payments which are made in respect of the services which a medical practitioner renders under the agreements which are made by the Commonwealth with the Australian Medical Association and with the individual medical practitioners. </para>

            <para>- I only raise the query because it does not appear to me that in the part of the Act in respect of which this amendment is being put forward there is any power specifically to prescribe what these rates or allowances are. As 1 said, I have an impression that they are designed to cover the services which are rendered but I would appreciate that confirmation. But then it appears to me that what may well happen - and I am told if has happened on some 12 occasions since this legislation came into existence - is that a practitioner shall be disallowed what he claims as allowances which are properly due to him. It may be that the claim should properly be disallowed. Equally it may be that the action which the committee of inquiry has taken and upon which the Minister has acted may be erroneous and some relevant factor has been overlooked. Under the arrangement which this committee has set up there does not appear to me to be any provision that the medical practitioner shall be heard. He has no knowledge and he is not required to be given knowledge as to who are the members of the committee. Indeed a decision can be made in his absence without giving him any right to present his case and when the decision is made he has no redress. 1 appreciate that this may not have been what has happened in the past and as to that J do not know. 1 am concerned with the fact thai there is before the Senate a provision which seeks to ensure that a medical practitioner who has a claim disallowed shall have the right of appeal and have the merits of his case aired before the supreme court. It may be that the supreme court is too high a jurisdiction for some of the amounts involved, and properly it could be any court of competent jurisdiction. That is not provided for in the amendment before the Senate. All I am concerned about is to ascertain whether there is any good reason why an appeal should not be available to a practitioner who feels that he has a grievance which he wants to have aired. </para>

            <para>- The principle of a right of appeal commends itself to me as appropriate in the circumstances in the absence of some good reason advanced by the Minister. I know the Minister said that there would be problems in requiring people to give evidence. That is to be appreciated. In some cases it would be a problem. On the other hand, however, there is the question of whether a person is properly remunerated or improperly deprived of his remuneration. These are matters of right which are equally as important as the inconvenience which may attend the giving of evidence in particular cases. </para>

        <para>I think the Minister said also that an appeal to the court would intrude into the area of privacy which should characterise the doctor-patient relationship. 1 recognise that that is a relationship which should be regarded in cases as confidential although of course it is not the doctor&#39;s privilege: it is the patient&#39;s privilege which he may waive. In any event the committee or the Director-General is in a position where he may intrude into privacy in the same way as the supreme court may be required to intrude into privacy. It appears to me to be no adequate reason to say that what the Director-General or the committee may do is acceptable, yet what a court may do in this area is unacceptable. I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate whether there is any substantial reason in principle why an appeal of this character should not be allowed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;3.39&#93; - I have some information on a few points which I should like to give to the Senate. The first point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised related to payments. The payment would be for treatment, and included also would be allowances such as for mileage travelled. Section 32 refers to the setting out of terms and conditions of an agreement which the Director-General may enter into with a medical practitioner for and in respect of his rendering of those services at such fees and allowances as are prescribed. I understand that these are prescribed by regulation No. 25 which provides that a medical service rendered by a medical practitioner to a pensioner, or a dependant of a pensioner, in the medical practitioners surgery, attracts a certain benefit, and a medical service rendered by a medical practitioner to a pensioner, or a dependant of a pensioner, otherwise than in the medical practitioner&#39;s surgery, attracts another benefit. That is the kind of thing covered by the regulation. </para>
        <para>I should like to refer again to the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee which I said had been set up. Its terms of reference include consideration of the jurisdiction to be given to the proposed superior court to review administrative decisions. </para>

            <para>- lt was quite some time ugo. I will try to get the exact date. The information which I am passing on relates to points which I think have been raised. The committee of inquiry system was introduced in 1953 and investigations conducted by medical services committees of inquiry into pensioner medical service cases are directed to breaches of the spirit and principles of the agreement rather than to breaches of the statutory provisions. Cases involving possibly fraud and prosecution are not, as a rule, referred to a committee. If in the course of a committee hearing it appears that the case is one of this type the matter is withdrawn. Such cases are investigated by departmental officers with a view to appropriate legal proceedings through the Crown Solicitor&#39;s oil ice </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <para>References to a committee arise from investigations carried out within the Department. When the monthly claims by doctors are prepared for payment the vouchers are examined for any evidence of incorrect charges, over-attendance or any other practice which appears contrary to the spirit of the pensioner medical service. Where the evidence suggests that the case warrants investigation by a committee of inquiry the Commonwealth Director of Health, as delegate of the Director-General, refers the case to the committee. In practice, practically all cases considered by the committees are concerned with over-attendance on particular patients, that is, more attendances than were necessary for the medical needs of the patients. </para>
        <para>Upon receipt of a case the committee gives it a preliminary examination and usually decides to ask the doctor to furnish clinical notes regarding each of the patients covered by the reference to the committee. Sometimes those notes are sufficient to satisfy the committee that there is no evidence of abuse and the committee therefore recommends that no further action be taken. In 58% of cases the doctors explanation has been accepted. Where doubt remains the committee notifies the doctor of the time and place at which it intends to hold its inquiry and invites the doctor to attend and to give further details. While the doctor is not compelled to attend the inquiry he almost invariably does so. Should he refuse to attend, the committee may conduct its investigation in his absence. The committee is held in private and a transscript of evidence is kept. The committee is not bound by legal rules of evidence but may inform itself on the referred matter in the manner it thinks fit. Usually the doctor and any other person appearing at the inquiry gives his evidence on oath but this is not mandatory. The doctor is entitled to be legally represented if he so desires, and in that event the committee is assisted by a Crown law officer. Only in rare cases is there legal representation. </para>
        <para>The hearing is traditionally conducted on an informal doctor to doctor basis, the committee endeavouring to ascertain the reasons for the doctor&#39;s high attendance rate and to determine whether the attendances were necessary having regard to the circumstances of each case. On completion of the inquiry the committee reports the facts to the Minister and recommends the action that it considers should be taken. As the committee&#39;s discussion relating to the inquiry is not included in the transcript of evidence, the recommendation may have taken into account clinical considerations which may not be apparent from the reading of the transcript. . </para>

          <para>-  I think the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is a good one. In fact, it had also occurred to me that in some cases the sums involved might be so small as not to warrant application to the Supreme Court. Of course, in some cases even though the sums involved may be very small the nature of the matters could be such that the parties would want a determination by the Supreme Court. I suggest that to meet the cases where that was not desired, some words be inserted in the proposed new section 36 (1.) after the words &#39;Supreme Court&#39; where they appear in the fourth line. I think the change would make it crystal clear. While I believe that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has said is correct, it may be preferable to spell it out by inserting after the words &#39;Supreme Court&#39; in the fourth line of the proposed new section 36 (1.) the following words:  district court, county court, court of petty sessions or other court of competent jurisdiction&#39;. The proposed new section 36(1.) would then read:  36(1.) Where a claim by a medical practitioner has been disallowed in whole or in part under sub-section (I.) of section thirty-four of this Act, the medical practitioner may, within twenty-one days after receipt of notice of the disallowance, appeal to the Supreme Court, district court, county court, court of petty sessions or other court of competent jurisdiction of the State or Territory in which the medical practitioner resides against the decision of the Minister disallowing the claim. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BYRNE</inline>(Queensland) &#91;3.5 lj- We are dealing now with the medical service to be provided by general practitioners, because no specialist service is available under the pensioner medical scheme. The Minister indicated - this would particularly a If eel my judgment on this matter - that the Australian Medical Association has nol been particularly concerned to obtain an alteration to the present procedure, although one branch - the New South Wales Branch - has shown concern. During the course of this debate on the Bill generally some concern has been expressed about the dichotomy of the views of the general practitioner section, of the Australian Medical Association and the final opinion that emerges from the Australian Medical Association as expressed in another context. lt could well be that if there has not been pressure from the AMA, as part of the breakdown of communications from general practitioners to the Government in relation to the pensioner medical service, their advocate may not be the appropriate advocate in this field, and therefore when the general practitioners were consulted as such they may have been holding lo a view different from that represented on their behalf by the AMA. If it were not for that factor 1 would feel that in the absence of any pressure from the medical profession, obviously this section is operating satisfactorily, but in the light of that factor it is probable that it is operating unsatisfactorily. As the appropriate body to present the situation has not been heard from, I cannot accept the alternative. </para>
        <para>In dealing with sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act it should be noted that section 35 provides for an appeal in certain circumstances; that is, where a doctor has been reprimanded or an agreement has been terminated. After a hearing before the Committee there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. We appreciate that as being of major consequence, but as for the argument that in the course of proceedings there may be a public rediscussion of confidential matters of particular practitionerpatient concern, that would equally be available as an argument against the provision of a right of appeal in section 35. I could imagine that that type of matter would have to be canvassed equally and an appeal would lie under section 35 where a doctor had been reprimanded or an agreement had been terminated or recommended for such action by the Committee, as it would in proceedings under section 34. For that reason also I cannot see that that would he an adequate argument to resist the proposed amendment. </para>
        <para>Finally, I feel that proceedings under section 35 may well follow from proceedings under section 34. In other words, if charges are wrongly made under section 34. that may bring a doctor under the jurisdiction of section 35. It would therefore be strange that he would be required, if he wanted lo appeal, to be brought under the provisions of section 35 when an appeal would be available, where more appropriately an appeal should be available under section 34. and the possibility of his coming under section 35 may never arise or emerge. In those circumstances I feel disposed, in the absence of explanations that might dismiss the 3 propositions I have presented, lo support the proposed amendment in the amended form, giving an area of appeal jurisdiction slightly lower than that of the Supreme Court in appropriate circumstances. 1 should be glad io hear the views of the Minister on the mutters I have had an opportunity to present. </para>

          <para>If the Court is satisfied that the medical practitioner has, in relation to his provision of medical services under this Part or under the repealed Regulations, been guilty of failure to discharge conscientiously his obligations under the agreement or of conduct which is an abuse or contravention of this Aci, the regulations or the repealed Regulations or shows him to be unlit to enjoy his privileges under the agreement, ii shall, subject to this section, dismiss the appeal.  1 think we should consider that provision. In replying to the points that have been raised I turn now to a matter to which I referred earlier: that is the possibility that pensioners may be called to give evidence. J think we must give this possibility deep consideration. When replying earlier in this debate I said that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> feels very strongly about the necessity not to damage the relationship between patients and their doctors.

            <para>- Yes. But I think that in relation to this point the court has to concern itself with the doctors&#39; agreement wilh the Commonwealth. I believe that we need lo look very carefully at the point I made earlier when I said that the Government must oppose the amendment because it has this Administrative Review Committee studying all these matters and working under particular terms of reference. I believe, as the Minister said in another place, it is important that we should sec and receive the report from this committee, give it the consideration which we believe it deserves and then ascertain whether it ls practicable to appeal to a court or, alternatively, to an administrative tribunal in these cases. I believe that this is the way in which this matter should be dealt with. We should wait until the report of this Administrative Review Committee is presented so that the matter may be reviewed in the light of that report. </para>

            <para>- I was certainly under the impression that it was well over 12 months ago that the Committee was set up. My impression is that at this stage one of ils members has ceased io be a member in the capacity in which he was appointed and that another member of the Committee has been overseas for a considerable part of the last 12 months. I had doubts as to whether the Committee was still in existence. I remember ii.sk ing not so long ago a question of the Minister representing the Attorney-General. This debate brings to my mind that 1 have not yet received a reply to that question. Irrespective of whether the Committee is undertaking what undoubtedly would be a task which would take a long time to perform when these mailers come before the Senate I would have thought that they should be considered on their merits because if a desirable appeal which at a subsequent stage should be brought into another appeal system altogether is provided there is no reason why at that later time the necessary changes could not be made. 1 feel that I must support this amendment because I sense that there could be instances of injustice arising because a doctor disagreed with a decision made and he would, in effect, have no redress. </para>

As the Minister said in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> the Administrative Review Committee that has been established by the Department to inquire into this and other matters has been sitting since September 1968. lt has been sitting longer than it took the Nimmo Committee to investigate hospital and health charges in Australia and to make its recommendations, lt has been sitting longer than the Senate select commit tee which was appointed to inquire into health and hospital costs in Australia sat. </para>

            <para>- The other committees had a very difficult task to perform also. This committee has been sitting since September 1968. It is now June 1970. We feel that now this Bill is before us - and the committee has not presented a report to the Minister who in turn has not reported on the matter to Parliament - we should see that rights of appeal are established under the legislation now before Parliament. The Minister has said that the departmental committee may conduct its inquiry in the medical practitioner&#39;s absence. The committee is not bound by legal rules of evidence. The committee is conducted in camera on a doctor-to-doctor basis. The transcript is not available for publication. Only on rare occasions are doctors represented by legal practitioners. These statements by the Minister are strong reasons why perhaps, on a very rare occasion, a doctor might feel that a great injustice has been done to him and therefore he should have the right of appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction. We believe it is an important matter of principle and an important matter of justice. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition, I press the amendment. </para>

          <para>- 1 thank the Minister. I asked that because the Minister, in her initial explanation, said that to provide this type of appeal would require the adduction of additional evidence, calling further witnesses and one thing and another like that. I would contemplate an appeal of this nature - an appeal under sections 35 and 37 - as an appeal on the record of the orginal hearing. Additional evidence would not be called and a new hearing would not take place. If this is so, the situation as visualised by the Minister in her reply that additional witnesses would be called and that the matter would be recanvassed would not apply. That would be my understanding of the nature of the appeal contemplated under sections 35 and 37. That ;s why 1 asked whether an appeal had taken place and, if so, what form the appellant proceedings took. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> raised the matter of appeals under sections 35 and 37. lt seems to me that the nature of appeals is one of the most vexed subjects in the law. I would not expect the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> to answer very easily the apparently simple question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> when this matter has plagued some of the courts here and overseas - in all parts of the British Commonwealth and in the United States of America - as to exactly what is involved in some of these propositions. Some very great cases exist as to what the nature of the appeal would involve - whether it is a true appeal to be decided on exactly the same material as was before the person or body from whom the appeal was taken or whether it is an appeal in the sense of a hearing de novo, or commencing from the beginning. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This is expressed to be an appeal and the court is directed to have regard to the evidence before the committee of inquiry and the report of the committee. I think it is sufficient for the Senate to decide at this stage that, in principle, there ought to be an appeal. This is what we want to do here. If any difficulties arise in the course of the administration of this, no doubt the Administrative Review Committee, to which the Minister has referred, will be able 10 deal with them. But 1 think it is enough, if the Senate is so minded, that we do the best we can at this stage. As the Minister is not able to advance any satisfactory reasons against the appeal, so far as we are concerned, 1 suggest that we adopt this amendment without really being tied to any details on the basis that we would be pre? pared to modify it if experience or fun her thought on the matter showed that some modification was necessary or some further provision as to the taking or not taking of evidence was desirable. </para>

        <para class="block">This request for an amendment stems from a hangover of the days when public hospital treatment in Australia was free. In 1948 the Commonwealth Government paid 80c for every occupied bed day. In 1948 the patient was subjected to no means test and no charge, but when voluntary health insurance was introduced in 1952 the Commonwealth benefit became $1.20 for contributors who were insured for fund benefit of at least 60c a day. In 1952 this provided a combined benefit of SI. 80 a day. In 1958 the Commonwealth benefit was increased from SI. 20 to $2 for contributors to funds who were insured for at least $1.60 a day. thereby giving a total benefit of $3.60 a day. These two combined benefits equalled the usual public ward charge then applicable. But of course there has been a gradual increase in hospital charges. Today the generally applied public ward charge is approximately $10 a day. The Commonwealth benefit has remained at $2 a day for 12 years. The difference between the hospital charge and the Commonwealth benefit has generally been borne by the contributor through the health insurance scheme. But if people are uninsured the hospital authorities receive only 80c a day. This throws a burden on the State of Queensland which is the only State where free public hospitalisation exists. </para>
        <para>As was given in evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs it appears that comparatively few Queenslanders are members of hospital benefits funds and thus the State of Queensland receives, in the main, for public patients in a public hospital the sum of only 80c a bed day from the Commonwealth. The Senate Select Committee in its interim report presented to Parliament in September last year said: </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="50.">
            <para>Under the existing scheme the hospital authorities receive only 80 cents a day for each uninsured patient in a public ward, thus denying Queensland hospital authorities the full benefit of  $2  a day, which would be payable should patients find it necessary, through insurance, to cover charges applicable in a free-charging system. The free public hospital system achieves the effect of providing hospital services with full financial protection against cost, and therefore the committee considers that the full Commonwealth benefit of  S2  a day should be paid for all public ward patients, whether insured or not, </para>

          <item label="51.">
            <para>The Committee recommends: That the Commonwealth insured hospital  benefit  (at present  $2  a day) should be paid to Queensland hospitals for public ward patients, irrespective of whether the patients are insured. </para>

          <para>In the overall consideration oi the question of benefits for uninsured patients we think there are two distinct groups in respect of whom special consideration is warranted. The first comprises public ward patients in Queensland. The Queensland Government has long pursued a policy of free  treatment  in public wards for everyone regardless of the patient&#39;s financial stale. So long as this policy is pursued there is no real reason for Queensland people who are satisfied with public ward treatment to take out hospital insurance. In view of the Queensland  Government&#39;s  policy there is no basis for an agreement between it and the Commonwealth Government on the lines we have recommended earlier. The Queensland Government&#39;s policy gives full effect to the Commonwealth objective of affording the community adequate financial protection against the cost of hospital treatment. While the policy continues it is our view that the Commonwealth should pay its full benefit (at present  $2  a day) to Queensland hospitals in respect of all public ward patients </para>

As a member of the Senate select committee that unanimously recommended that the payment to patients in Queensland public hospitals should be $2 a day, in all justice I cannot now oppose that recommendation to which I was a party. I am also conscious of the recommendation of the Nimmo Committee which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> read out.

        <para class="block">The points that were stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> are factual. J am pleased to see a member of the Government parties supporting the amendment, too. I point out that the free hospitals system in Queensland has been in existence over a period of many years. Unfortunately, because of the attitude adopted by the Government a subsidy has not been payable. So, over the years since the introduction of the National Health Act Queensland has suffered considerably financially. </para>
        <para>It has suffered to such a degree that today many of the hospitals are operating in buildings that badly need renovation and in many cases badly need replacement. There are considerable problems in adequately staffing the hospitals. There are problems, particularly in provincial cities and country areas, in obtaining up to date equipment. It is largely because of the decision of the State government of the day to stick to the free hospitals scheme and the subsequent penalty placed upon it by the Commonwealth Government that this financial starvation has taken place. 1 believe that if this amendment is carried it will go some way towards alleviating the distress that has been caused. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLINER</inline>(Queensland) &#91;4.20| - I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> on behalf of the Opposition. The Government must be conscious of this very important point: Two committees, completely independent . of each other, have recommended that the S2 a day should be paid. In those circumstances I fail to see how any government could insist that the present unfair situation continue. After all is sard and done, a report has been furnished to this chamber today by the Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. The words of the Committee in that report are very clear. In paragraph 109 the Committee states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>On the question of Commonwealth benefit lo Queensland hospitals.  the  Committee believes thai the non-availability of  the  insured benefit of <inline font-style="italic">$2</inline> per day for the large percentage non-insured has the effect of discriminating against he ( citizens of Queensland, because they happen to have a system of free public ward&#39; treatment. The Committee therefore recommends the payment of the insured benefit for inpatients at Queensland public hospitals, irrespective of whether the patients are insured or nol.  1 think honourable senators would agree that, under the system under which we operate at the present lime, if the free hospitals system in Queensland is to be maintained - obviously that is the wish of both the Government and the people of that State - the money must be found to administer the hospitals. If the money is to be found to. administer the hospitals without the full entitlement from the Commonwealth Government, obviously some other services in Queensland will suffer as a result. 1 believe that among the principal bands of people who suffer because we have the free hospitals system in Queensland are the nurses. Their rates of wages are inferior to those in other parts of the Commonwealth. Their conditions of training and their working conditions are also inferior to those in other parts of the Commonwealth. So we have a situation in which people for whom each and every member of the Senate would have a great deal of sympathy are the victims, if you like lo put it that way, of the free hospitals system because the State Government just has not the money to assist them. Let me refer now to another field, that of education. I believe that the education authorities in Queensland could quite sensibly demand additional money for education facilities in that Stale; but because the State Government has to contribute to the free hospitals system it is unable to provide the Department of Education with the necessary finance to equip schools properly. 1 believe thai the committees have brought down a fine recommendation in that direction. I ask the Government lo accept the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> and supported by other honourable senators. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;4.24&#93; - I inform the Committee that these amendments are not acceptable to the Government. They would have the effect of making the Commonwealth benefit of S2 a day payable in respect of every person in he , community who is hospitalised in an approved hospital whether or not that person was insured against the cost of hospital treatment. This is entirely contrary to the Government&#39;s philosophy thai the national health scheme should encourage voluntary insurance. The amendments are completely opposed lo he philosophy concerning voluntary insurance which we are encouraging. Points have been made concerning the situation in Queensland. Let us have a look at the situation in Queensland. </para>
        <para class="block">I have said that the Government encourages health insurance. If this amendment were accepted the Commonwealth benefit would be paid regardless of whether the person concerned was insured against the cost of hospital treatment. When a person goes to a hospital the normal situation is, of course, for the hospital to impose a charge which the patient has to meet. The Government then assists the insured patient to meet the hospital charge by the payment of this benefit. But because of the free hospital system in Queensland, which has been referred to during this debate, hospitals make no charge and therefore patients have no charges to meet. So this is quite separate from the point which has been raised in the Bill itself in relation to the encouraging of voluntary insurance and the payment of this benefit to those whose are insured to assist them in meeting their hospital charges. I repeat that the Government is opposed to the amendment. </para>

        <para>The statement which the Minister has just made concerning hospitals in Queensland is one which has to be answered. Admittedly, the hospitals in Queensland impose no charge. The Minister has stated that because no charge is imposed the Commonwealth benefit should not be paid. The Minister implies that the provision of services costs the hospitals nothing. It is against the expenditure which the hospitals have to meet that the benefit has to be paid. The reports of 2 committees of inquiry have been quoted during this debate. Incidentally, both reports were prepared by people who had received expert evidence or were themselves experts in the field. The report of the </para>
        <para class="block">Commonwealth&#39;s Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance - the Nimmo Committee - shows that the Queensland Government meets 73.2% of the cost of hospitalisain that State. This was the position in 1967-68, but, relatively speaking, the figures are true as at this time. The New South Wales Government has a contribution rate of 48.9%. The Commonwealth Government, by neglect, has imposed on the Queensland Government a burden which it cannot meet. The result is that the standard of hospital services in Queensland has been reduced considerably. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline>has said that the amount paid to nurses in Queensland is the lowest in the Commonwealth. The service which is being provided is also falling away, lt is completely unjust for the Minister to say that there is no reason why the people of Queensland should receive the benefit of the full $2 subsidy which is paid by the Commonwealth. Does the Minister realise that denial of the Commonwealth benefit costs the Queensland Government $2m each year? This is unjust. Both the Nimmo Committee and the Senate Select on Medical and Hospital Costs have supported the payment of the full subsidy. For the life of me 1 cannot understand why the Government refuses to pay it. ! </para>
        <para>This Bill was rushed through the other place in a most intemperate manner. When a similar amendment to this one was moved in the other place it was ruled out of order. At least we have had a chance to discuss it in this place. However, the attitude of the Minister for Housing is similar to the attitude adopted by the Minister for Health in the other place. 1 wish to quote from the report of the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. Perhaps I will be able to get through to the Government by doing so. </para>

            <para>-  1 deferred making any contribution to the debate on this amendment in the hope that the Minister would give a fuller explanation of the position. To my mind, with  due  respect, she has failed to do so. Hence we had the query from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> concerning who would benefit  in  the  event of  the Government agreeing to this amendment. Would it be the patient, the hospital authorities or the State? </para>

            <para>-  At the present time, hospitals in all States except Queensland are paid $2  a  day  even  for non-insured patients. In Queensland hospitals are paid 80c a day.  One  cannot help but be impressed with the report  of  the Nimmo Committee of Inquiry on Health Insurance. I do not want to engage in tedious repetition, I do not want to read all of this passage because  1  believe that some of it has been quoted, but I believe that these paragraphs are important: </para>

          <para>At the present time  a  benefit of 80c a day is paid by the Commonwealth  to  hospitals  on  account of patients who are  not  pensioners  and are  not insured wilh a hospital insurance organisation. Payment of this benefit is  not  really part of the health insurance scheme,  lt is a  relic  of  the system which was followed  in  the late 1940s. Eligibility for payment has been continued, but the  rate has not been varied since 1948. At the present time payment at the rate of 80c a day is clearly of little significance to the patients who are eligible for it, bearing in mind that their hospital fees, even at the standard ward level, are in the vicinity of $10 a day in most States. </para>
          <para>In the overall consideration of the question ot benefits for uninsured patients we think there are two distinct groups in respect of whom special consideration is warranted. The first comprises public ward patients in Queensland. The Queensland Government has long pursued a policy of free treatment in public wards for everyone regardless of the patient&#39;s financial state. So long as this policy is pursued there is no real reason for Queensland people who are satisfied with public ward treatment to take out hospital insurance. In view of the Queensland Government&#39;s policy there is no basis for an agreement between it and the Commonwealth Government on the lines we have recommended earlier. The Queensland Government&#39;s policy gives full effect to the Commonwealth objective of affording the community adequate financial protection against the cost of hospital treatment. While the policy continues it is our view that the Commonwealth should pay its full benefit (at present $2 a day) to Queensland hospitals in respect of all public ward patients. </para>

The Committee therefore recommends the payment of the insured benefit for inpatients at Queensland public hospitals, irrespective of whether the patients are insured or not </para>

          <para>- I should like to make a quick comparison. The Commonwealth Government pays a subsidy to nursing homes. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the Government pays the subsidy to the hospital itself on the basis of per day of attendance, treatment or convalescence of a patient. Why can the same principle not be applied to the payment of the Commonwealth benefit to hospitals? Can the Minister explain why the benefit cannot be paid overall to the hospital rather than to the patient, because the end result is exactly the same? </para>

          <para>- I still am not satisfied with the argument that has been advanced in favour of the amendment - that it would have the effect of benefiting Queensland hospitals. From what the Minister has said, it will not achieve that purpose. The Commonwealth will pay $2 a day to the patient, but this will not necessarily contribute towards alleviating the situation in which Queensland hospitals are placed. So the amendment, by itself, would be ineffective in achieving the result which the Opposition intends. </para>

It was a benefit initiated in 1946 (when the amount was 60 cents per day), raised in 1948, and absorbed, somewhat paradoxically, into the present scheme in 1952. It has no place in this scheme. </para>

          <para>- In view of the way in which the Parties appear to be intending to vote I would appeal to Government supporters and remind them that much of the material that they have been quoting lo the Committee is contained in a report which was introduced into the Senate today. The Government has not had an opportunity to study the report or to review the propositions that are involved therein. Undoubtedly it will in due course accept many of the propositions that are put forward in an excellent report but these recommendations affect very greatly that which the Government has put forward in an excellent National Health Bill and I feel that we should not be taking from now on just the prepositions that are put in the Committee&#39;s report. I would be very anxious to accept many of them, but the Government has introduced legislation which it has considered over  a  period of years and the views that the Opposition is putting before us have not had the consideration necessary for us to make better legislation out of this matter. </para>

In any event, if it were thought that further time was necessary  for  the consideration of these important matters - and they are very important - then the obvnous course  is  to delay the passage of the Bill. What is happening is that the Government  is  insisting on pushing forward with the Bill so that the Opposition is hardly to be blamed when it says: &#39;Here is a proposal, a very reasonable proposal, first put up by a committee of  the  Senate after great consideration, in September. Now we are faced with the Bill  the  Government says that this is the time and this is the hour for dealing with  the  matters and so they are dealt with on the basis of the material which we have. </para>

The amendment was not permitted to be moved  in  another place on the basis that it would have had the effect of increasing expenditure, but we say that the deletion of the amount of SI. 50 and the insertion instead thereof of the amount of $2 only brings this provision into line with provisions affecting everyone else in the community. The amendment relates to benefits payable  in  respect of handicapped person care and it  is  moved to bring this provision into line with Commonwealth benefit for hospital patients generally. In its interim report the Senate Select Committee made some reference to this aspect in chapter 10 at paragraphs 149 and 150 in relation to physically and mentally handicapped persons. </para>

Representatives of several of these organisations appeared before us i  related  their  experiences  when they sough&#39; government aid to supplement what their organisations were able to raise to relieve the suffering of those for whom they were concerned. They stated that the Commonwealth informed them that health&#39; was a State matter and that they should approach their State Government for assistance. Their State Government informed them that it lacked the funds to grant their request and that they should go to the Commonwealth Government, for it alone had the financial capacity to provide the aid they required.

            <para>- The recommendations are the same in both reports. I am referring to the Wedgwood Report, chapter 10, paragraphs 254 and 255. Here, I believe, we envisage the Commonwealth and State authorities getting together and working out the best and most effective form of assistance that could be given in this very tragic area and I think it would be unwise for us to suggest that the Commonwealth should act unilaterally in this field. That may well, on history, discourage the State governments from acting at all, because they do in this field have certain responsibilities. I would rather urge upon the Commonwealth the need to discuss, as early as possible, with the State governments to try to find areas where together they could alleviate the suffering and the high costs involved. Therefore on those grounds I oppose the amendment. </para>

There is so much that money cannot provide for the handicapped child - that is in terms of a small benefit or subsidy on behalf of the child - and &#91; would hope that the Commonwealth and the States would be able to develop schemes to assist physically handicapped children which would be much more generous than the payment of$1. 50. </para>

Everyone, 1 know, is concerned with what can be done for both the parents and the child, and with the future of the child. 1 believe, however, that we have to look at what is being done. The payment at the present rate of $1.50 per day was introduced by the Government after very careful consideration of all the relevant factors. This benefit has provided very valuable assistance to the parents of handicapped children and is considered to be adequate in the present circumstances and having regard to the Commonwealth&#39;s overall commitments in the field of health. </para>
        <para>The rate of this benefit cannot validly be compared with the rate of hospital benefit. It should be noted that where a handicapped child who is covered by hospital insurance receives hospital treatment, the full Commonwealth benefit of $2 is paid. Also, if a child is receiving nursing home care and the institution is approved as a nursing home, then the benefits are paid accordingly. The section now under notice refers to the handicapped child who is in a handicapped children&#39;s home where the medical treatment required is not so intensive. After full consideration the Government believes that the legislation should remain as it is. Therefore it opposes the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. </para>

We feel that the word &#39;shall&#39; should replace the ward &#39;may&#39; in sub-sections (I.) and (2.) of section 69. The present provision amounts to the holding of a gun at the head of an applicant organisation. Section 69 provides:  (1.) The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the manner and form in which applications for registration are to be lodged and the documents and information which are to be famished in support of. or in connection with applications. (2.) The Director-General may refine to entertain an application for registration unlessthe applicant organisation furnishes, in accordance with the regulations particulars relatingto the affairs, finances, rules and conduct of the organisation. </para>
        <para class="block">The Opposition believes that there should be no discretion; that it should be mandatory; that the regulations should make provision for and in relation to the manner and form in which applications for registration are to be lodged. We say that it should be mandatory for applicants to provide documents and information in support of or in connection with applications by those organisations, and that in the event of such material not being forthcoming, it should be mandatory for the Director-General to refuse to entertain an application for registration. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> had something to say on this matter on 4th March. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> reminds me that the interim report of the Senate Select Committee on&#39; Medical and Hospital Costs - the Wedgwood Committee - also had something to &#39; say on the matter at paragraph 97 of its report. The Nimmo Committee dealt with the matter at paragraph 11.20 of its report. In dealing with management expenses it suggested that rates lower than those set out in its report could be achieved when the results of measures it had recommended earlier had taken full effect. We believe that it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that information of a full and frank nature is provided by applicant organisations; that it should be mandatory for the Director-General to refuse registration unless the information is submitted. Therefore on behalf of the Opposition I have moved the amendment which has been circulated. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;5.17&#93; - Section 69 of the principal Act provides the power for the making of regulations for the registration of organisations. The use of this power is at present discretionary and to substitute the word &#39;shall&#39; for the word &#39;may&#39; as proposed in the amendment would make it obligatory for the regulations to be made. Such a course would tighten this aspect of the Act with regard to organisations, but would have little practical effect having regard to the experience of the Department of Health over the years and the administration of the national health scheme. There is no secret about the details which the application form requires from organisations. Copies of the application form are made available to any interested organisation and there has never been any difficulty with any organisation with regard to this matter. The Government is opposed to the amendment moved by the Opposition because it believes that it would introduce unnecessary rigidity into the scheme. </para>

          <para>-  As I interpret the Minister&#39;s last remarks, she feels that we have learned nothing from the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has quoted from various reports of committees and it seemed from the recommendations of those committees that the Government might institute certain reforms. I remind the Minister particularly of the high pressure advertising that was undertaken by some of the funds and may even now be contemplated for the future. The Opposition is seeking by its proposed amendment to shackle such activities of the funds. The Minister referred to the accessibility of the information on the application form and to the fact that nothing is hidden. What I have to say may not be strictly applicable to the section with which we are dealing, but my idea of the rights and equity of contributors is such that never again should any hospital and medical benefits fund be able to purchase a light aircraft without consulting its members. I remind honourable senators that in the days of the friendly societies and the participation of trade unions in such organisations the members had some say in their administration. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Minister has indicated that the Government is opposed to our amendment. I would like to know whether the Government has any proposal to make the funds live within their income. Alternatively, is there any proposal to make them disgorge their profits over and above, say, one quarter of subscriptions paid by members during a year? </para>

          <para>- I direct the attention of the Committee, in dealing with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland,</inline> to sub-section (2.) of section 69 of the principal Act and the information detailed therein; that is, particulars relating to the affairs, finances, rules and conduct of an organisation. These are vital matters in a contributory scheme, a so-called voluntary contributory scheme. Contributors to a fund should know all the facts of those funds, many as they are. A person who wishes to examine the rules of a fund should bc able lo obtain a copy of them. The Minister said thai certain details ace available. 1 applied for  a  copy of the rules crf the Hospital Benefits Fund of Western Australia, but 1 have not been able to get it. Copies of the rules are not available to the general public. They may be available to other people, but they should be available to all contributors to the fund.. </para>

        <para>We ali are aware of the disgraceful position of the various funds throughout Australia in that huge amounts have been built up as reserves over the years on the pretext that it is necessary to provide for emergencies that might arise at a time of an epidemic. If ever an epidemic breaks out in Australia requiring the expenditure of sums of money as large as the funds wish to hold as reverves, it will be a lime of national emergency to be dealt with by this Government, and not a time for the funds to deal with the people affected by such an emergency. The word &#39;shall&#39; should apply to the finances of the funds handled on behalf of their contributors. No discretion should be provided in sub-section (1.) of section 69 in that the regulations may provide for these matters. I direct the attention of the Committee to the proposed new section 76a, which provides: </para>

We say that the word &#39;shall&#39; should be included and that the amendment should be carried because we think that this information should be made available when the organisations are reporting. To make regulations that may provide for these things is all right. The regulations that provide for these things may not be made. We think that there should be no discretion with respect to this. We think that unless the full facts of the affairs, finances, rules and conduct of the organisation are made available to the Director-General of Health the organisation should not bc registered. </para>

          <para>- 1 suggest that this is another instance of what has been referred to already and that is that in a new area it may be necessary to commence firstly by giving great discretion to public officials in relation to various matters, but as they gain experience the matters ought to be brought into the area of law and not of discretion. If reforms are being made, the regulations should cover these. If they need amendment from lime to time, let that be done. But the requirements ought to be matters of law and not of the say-so of the official. Those requirements ought to apply to all bodies. They can be fairly general in their terms, but some definite conditions ought to be laid down for applicants for registration and the public official ought to require that ail applicants conform with the conditions set forth in the regulations. That is the way the Law should progress. This is a simple instance of that </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Apart from that general consideration, my observation is that where voluntary associations greatly affect numbers of people and where they have public functions to perform - whether they be medical benefits funds, political parties or other voluntary organisations - experience shows that there ought to be requirements for the details of their handling of financial affairs to be kept in some records which are open to some public scrutiny. Otherwise experience shows that there is likely to be mishandling, there are likely to be scandals and no-one will be satisfied until the associations are kept under some proper scrutiny. That is the unfortunate experience of human affairs and we have had plenty of that experience within recent times. </para>

          <para>- I was interested in what was said on this amendment because, frankly, I had an open mind when it was introduced.I do not think that the case put forward by Senators McClelland, Mulvihill, Cant and Murphy really supports the proposition which they put. I think we are all concerned, in the light of what the Nimmo Committee said and in the light of what the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs said, about the need for firmer control over some of the activities of these health organisations. As I see it, that is not what the amendment is designed to achieve. The section of the Act which is sought to be amended deals purely with applications by organisations. Organisations either want to be part of this scheme or do not want to be part of this scheme. If they want to be part of this scheme, they will make the best case they can to be accepted. When they make that case it is up to the Director-General to refer the application, the documents and the information furnished in support of the application to the Registration Committee for its examination. This requirement is contained in the existing section 71 of the Act. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that an organisation would be concerned to put the very best case that it could in order to get registration. It may be that from time to time the manner and form of application will have to be prescribed. I do not know. But I think that the very character of the situation does not necessitate that there must be a manner and a form in which applications for registration are to be lodged simply because there does not appear to be any compelling reason why one must have a form which is filled out in a particular way and why one must have certain matters lodged. If one does not lodge that which is capable of being ascertained by inquiry that the Director-General requires, one will find one&#39;s application rejected. I would have thought that, as a principle, it is far better to have a permissive &#39;may&#39; rather than a mandatory &#39;shall&#39;. Unless a strong case is made out for a mandatory &#39;shall&#39;, the section is best left as it is. </para>

If the Department does not want to make regulations and does not have the interests of the public at heart, it will not make regulations so I am not really interested in that amendment. The second &#39;may&#39;,I think, should be changed to shall&#39; otherwise the Director-General may refuse to entertain an application. I do not think it should be left in his hands to waffle. In the second instance 1 think it is important that the word &#39;may&#39; should be changed to &#39;shall&#39;. I shall support that. </para>

          <para>-  I enter this debate because section 73 contains some important provisions. It leaves matters to the discretion of the Minister. In another field of activity we have always opposed that. The BDI provides that sub-section (1.) shall read: </para>

        <para>The Minister may, after considering the report of the Committee, grant, subject to such terms and conditions (if any) as be thinks fit . . . </para>
        <para class="block">That empowers the Minister to be the determining authority in regard to terms and conditions. It is contrary to what we have been advocating in this chamber for some time. Why should the Minister have the power to determine the terms and conditions when we do not establish the criteria as to the terms and conditions? The Bill provides that the Minister may determine such terms and conditions, if any, as he thinks fit, or refuse the application. That is despite the fact that there may be compliance with the report of the Registration Committee. I will not refer to the question of public inspection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has dealt with that. </para>
        <para>A similar principle applies to our 2 proposed amendments to sub-section (6.). The first reads: </para>

          <para>&#91;5.50&#93; - 1 inform the Senate that the Government is opposed to the amendment that has been moved. The first part of it relates to the approval or refusal of an application by an organisation for registration. The amendment proposes that the Minister shalL give his decision on the application by regulation. lt is felt that such a step is quite unnecessary. Provision exists in section 80 of the Act for an appeal to a State Supreme Court against any decision by the Minister not to grant registration. Also, the registration of organisations is part of the normal administrative process and, in the view of the Government, in this case legislative processes are not appropriate. The processes associated with the making of regulations could delay unnecessarily the approval of an organisation which applies for registration. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The proposed amendment to sub-section (4.) of section 73 of the principal Act would make the register of organisations, which is presently open only to persons authorised in writing by the Minister, open for public inspection. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to make public knowledge the terms and conditions under which the registration was granted to an organisation. We believe that this would serve no useful purpose as there is a requirement in the Act that particulars of registered organisations will be gazetted each year in accordance with section 81. Proposed new section 76a, which is contained in clause 27 of the Bill, provides for the tabling of an annual report setting out details of the financial operations of each individual fund. </para>
        <para>The same comments apply to those parts of the amendment which relate to the registration of organisations, lt is, in the view of the Government, cumbersome and pointless to require the use o,f the legislative process to implement a purely administrative decision to revoke or vary any or all of the terms and conditions under which registration is granted to an organisation. Let me add that the Minister cannot do anything by regulation. The Governor-General, of course, makes regulations. A grant is made by a person and cannot be made by a regulation. A grant is a particular executive act, whilst a regulation is a general law. I believe that those points bear out the statement that I made at the beginning, namely, that the Government opposes the amendment. </para>

          <para>- The merit of this amendment is obvious to me. I propose to support it. I believe that the power that is contained specifically in sub-section (6.) of section 73 is one which, as it stands, is frightening in its width. Of course, it is a power that depends upon a recommendation coming from the Registration Committee. The Committee consists of the Commonwealth Actuary or a person appointed by him to act in his stead and 2 officers of the Department of Health appointed by the Director-General. In that circumstance there could well be a ready acquiescence by Minister and Department in what for the time being was felt to be a desirable departmental policy. If the Minister has received such a recommendation, he may:   . . vary or revoke any or all of the terms and conditions subject to which an organisation has been, or is deemed to be, registered under this Act and impose terms and conditions additional to those terms and conditions. . . . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">When he does that, the terms and conditions subject to which an organisation is registered shall include the new terms and conditions that he imposes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said, there is no limit to the terms and conditions that the Minister may impose. They may be reasonable; they may be onerous; they may be far ranging and crippling; or they may be moderate and in the public interest. Whilst making all presumptions in favour of the Department, the width of that provision is great. </para>
        <para>I would like to know why sub-section (6.) is in the Act at all. It appears to me that, if there are terms and conditions which have to be changed as a result of operation, either they can be the subject of an amending Bill or at least they can be the subject of some provision by way of regulation. </para>
        <para>I understand that the intention of the proposed amendment is to submit to the scrutiny of the Parliament any decisions which will impose added burdens upon registered organisations. I dislike the whole scope of the power which is contained in section 73 of the principal Act. I would rather have something far more precise. But if the section were amended in the manner proposed it would at least ensure that regulations would be made and these regulations would be subject to examination by the Parliament and to disallowance if they made the rights of individuals unduly dependent upon administrative decisions. For that reason, I support the amendment. </para>
        <para>I would be grateful if the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> would elaborate on 2 things which she said. Firstly, she said that in some way section 80 of the principal Act is designed to give the right of appeal. I take the view that section 80 is limited to appeals against cancellations and suspensions of registration. </para>

I feel that this is a desirable aspect of the amendment. 1 should be grateful if the Minister would indicate whether the view she expressed is that the amendment would nullify the power which is sought to be conferred. 1 appreciate that regulations are generally made by the Governor-General, but it may also be that any regulations made by (he Minister will be required to be laid on the table of the Senate. 1. should be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on those points. </para>

          <para>- 1 feel that the matter which is now before the Committee raises very important principles. It is an attempt to reconcile the purity of the law and civil rights wilh what we might call administrative demands. This is always a very difficult problem. Ministers who have the responsibility of administering statutes and departments are often very widely entrusted with discretion. This is a built-in par i of the system of government under the Parliament. This is particularly so in a case like this where ministerial discretion is endowed and apparently - at least in some respects - is subject to appeal. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that there do not seem to be appellate provisions in relation to this section. I agree with that proposition. If this amendment were carried it would really create in this Parliament an appellate jurisdiction over the decision of the Minister. However that might be in relation to the purity of the regard for rights, whether it is consonant with any smoothness in his departmental administration is the very difficult matter which has to be resolved. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If the endowment of the Minister with discretion in this case were completely untoward and unusual, perhaps it might then come under critical scrutiny. But this is no different, 1 take it, from many other discretions conferred an Ministers under many other statutes. Parliament would be put in an impossible position if every ministerial action which involved the exercise of discretion were regulated and had to come before the Parliament, one chamber or the other, and be subject to disallowance. I feel that it must inevitably have the effect of completely stultifying the processes of government and, in particular, the processes of this Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I have very little more to say. 1 was merely pointing out that if this principle, which is implicit in the amendment, were written into this statute, it would have the effect of unjustifiably frustrating the legitimate use of ministerial power in the administration of departments and statutes. 1 pose one question: Why should it finish in this statute or in this section of the Act? Once the principle is written in in these circumstances, there could be 100 or 1,000 similar circumstances in other statutes where we would have to write it in. 1 think it would be completely unwise for the Committee to adopt the principle, because al a later stage it may be insisted that it be written in here and written in there. As I say, there would be total frustration of the processes of government. 1 would not like anyone to think that 1 am not as jealous of the exercise of discretionary powers in statutes as any other honourable senator, or that 1 am less solicitous of individual or group rights. But there must be that conciliation between those demands and the legitimate demands of government in the preservation of order and the administration of law. lt is that reconciliation that we in this chamber are always trying to discover. I feel it would be a tremendous blow, if such reconciliation has already been obtained, if this principle were to be adopted in this way. </para>

          <para>-  I enter into this debate to deal very briefly with the proposed amendment. We have before us a very dramatic and quite significant, change to the National Health Bill, lt brings into being a quite large area of change, and whether we like it or not. whatever happens in the early days of this concept - and 1 use that word for want of a better term - which is expressed in the Bill will place tremendous demands upon the Department of Health. 1 would not like to see this Bill, when it becomes law in whatever form it ultimately takes, inhibited too much by the application of the regulatory power. I was very impressed with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s</inline> observations before the suspension of the sitting for dinner that there are huge administrative problems in the present Act, even before we begin to alter it by this Bill. For instance, there are the various funds. There are the big funds, such as the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the Hospital Contribution </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Fund of New South Wales, and hundreds of thousands of people subscribe to those funds. A limitless number of contingencies could arise in relation to any one of the subscribers to any one of those funds. From an administrative point of view we want to give very wide administrative authority to the Department, at least in the early stages of the new Act. </para>
        <para>A tremendous change was brought about by the original medical benefits scheme introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page. But if we had written into that original scheme, restricting or inhibiting regulations, I doubt whether it would have come into being. There has to be a certain amount of trial and error, whether we like it or not. We are legislators, and we can say: &#39;This has to be done in an Act&#39;, or: That has to be done in an Act&#39;, or: &#39;That has to be protected by regulation&#39;. I would say that perhaps in 12 months time we might reach the stage where we can say that in the light of experience a particular area may well be considered to be covered by regulation. We could do that to narrow an administrative area; to make it tighter in terms of legislation by regulation. </para>
        <para>I have had experience of medical and hospital benefit funds. Down through the years as a senator I have made representations on behalf of certain organisations - I am thinking now about some of the smaller ones. If the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and their advisers had not had the authority to have discussions, to make arrangements and to adopt procedures, great hardship would have been experienced by the funds and, ultimately, by the subscribers to the funds. When we are talking about the bigger funds, it is all right, but do not let us forget that some organisations have grown up through the years. One can think of them and can name them. Perhaps they have not been top level funds in terms of administration, but they have given service to thousands of their lodge members and contributors. I would suggest that if, in the early stages, the original scheme had been limited, firstly, by very rigid legislative provision and, secondly, by very strict regulations, the subscribers to the funds would have suffered. </para>
        <para>I understand the principle of doing something by regulation, but in the early stages of this Bill when it becomes law I think there should be fairly tolerant administration which is capable of meeting situations as they arise. Later on, if we want to tighten the field or narrow the scope of the legislation, we can introduce a regulation, but in the early stages 1 think there is a good case for not being too severe in imposing regulatory power which, after all, has to be descriptive. When we put down a regulation we have to be descriptive. Even in my experience I could think of hundreds of areas in which there would be great difficulty in the early stages in doing it by regulatory power. </para>

          <para>- 1 again rise as a result of the contribution made to the debate by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson),</inline> because I have some sympathy with him and with whoever has to administer the National Health Act if we spell out that everything has to be done by regulation. But this amendment does not stipulate that. It refers only to the question of the registration of an organisation, and to the power of a Minister to grant or to refuse a registration without any criteria being laid down at all. If the organisation to which I may belong applies for registration under the Act, it is in the Minister&#39;s power to say whether he will grant that registration. If we lay down some criteria, which a regulation would require, then if my organisation complied with such criteria and the Minister refused the registration, there would be a right of appeal - and there seems to be some doubt about this question at the moment. The Minister could argue that although the organisation complied with the criteria he would still refuse the registration. The Minister has the complete right to refuse a registration, but if there is a right of appeal to someone, to succeed in the appeal the organisation would have to show that the Minister, I suppose, acted capriciously and the organisation would have to justify its whole existence. </para>

        <para>This is the question: The whole matter is in the hands of one man. A Minister of the Crown, after considering the report or recommendations of the committee, may grant the registration subject to such terms and conditions. Even if the committee made a recommendation which was in favour of the registration of an organisation, the Minister may still refuse it. What the amendment seeks to do is to write into the legislation the terms on which the Minister has  he  power to refuse a registration. lt should be done by regulation so that this Parliament has an opportunity to discuss the regulation and to disallow it. It becomes solely a question of whether we believe in ministerial control or whether we believe in the right of the elected representative of the people to decide these issues. That is the issue involved in this amendment. In addressing himself to this question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> 1 think from loyalty to the first speaker for the Democratic Labor Party, said that he saw something different in this proposed amendment from the amendment in respect of which he fought so hard for parliamentary control rather than ministerial control. &#34;The whole question in dealing with this resolution lo impose restrictions, to revoke a licence, to grant a licence or to withhold a licence is whether Parliament should have that power - whether it should be done by regulation which Parliament has a right to disallow - or whether the Minister should have exclusive right lo permit an organisation lo operate or to deny it that right. </para>

I shall come to that in a moment, but I am hoping that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> will be content to listen to a few observations briefly submitted to dissipate what 1 suggest is a manifest error. I have been referring to the act that the Minister is required to :-&#62; : v om. th-ti &#62;s. the act of registration, which is an administrative act. If we want a regulation we could have it in such terms as it exists under the Companies Act and have a general law whereby any organisation which would be entitled to be registered should have a specified number of persons, have a certain capital, have directors of such and such, and lay down rules to which it shall conform. But to say that the Minister may by regulation register an organisation is a piece of absurdity from the point of view of legal conception. Before I come to these inviting terms &#39;subject to such terms and conditions&#39;, I remind the Committee that in subsection (6.) the amendment .treks lo introduce, in relation to the words &#39;vary or revoke&#39; and &#39;impose&#39;, the words by regulation&#39;. </para>

        <para>In this sub-section the Minister is expected to bc exercising a specific decision in relation to a specific organisation am i if he lays down certain terms and conditions that is an administrative act in regard to a decision, just as in a court case if the court makes an order or a decree it relates to an individual person. Bui if we want regulations and we say that the terms and conditions that the Minister may impose shall be as prescribed - and we prescribe them - unless we have the power of discrimination expressed in the statute the terms and conditions would have to be applicable to all organisations. Then we would have a uniformity in that we would be laying down a set scale of conditions that would apply to all. </para>

            <para>- That is what the honourable senator has said. He beggars any knowledge that he might be presumed to have as to the way in which terms and conditions should vary in relation to different organisations. Then, having dissipated all that, we find comfort in section 73 where certain conditions are expressly permitted by the statute. We find that when an organisation has been registered under the Act, the Minister may suspend or cancel the registration under section 79, but  in  that case a thoughtful Parliament of previous years inserted section 80 which gave the organisation a right of appeal against any wrong decision on the part of the Minister. So I submit that it is quite a misconception to use the term &#39;regulation&#39; as used in Labor&#39;s amendment to section 73. It is a complete misapprehension to emphasise terms and conditions in relation to a specific decision if one gives proper effect to sections 79 and 80. </para>

          <para>- I have heard some extraordinary speeches from the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright),</inline> who has just resumed his seat, but his speech tonight was one of the most extraordinary. I believe that he set out not to argue what was in the Bill but to belittle what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> had said. It is the Australian Labor Party&#39;s proposition that these things should be done by regulation as they apply to the registration of organisations. There is little difference between the amendment and what is contained in sub-section (1.) of section 73 of the principal Act. Sub-section (1.) states: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">There is little difference between that and what is proposed in the amendment, except that he shall register the organisation accordingly. We think that in what is perhaps a minor field of administration, as it was referred to by the Leader of the Government (Sena:or Anderson), we should proceed by regulation. This should be not merely a matter of administration - simply the registration of organisations based on the advice of a committee that has been set up. The Minister is not bound to accept the advice but the advice is available to him. It is known that under the old section the Minister has exercised his discretion in the registration of organisations where the rules of the organisations have varied greatly. For instance, in Western Australia we have organisations to which people pay contributions but under the Workers Compensation Act the medical and hospital benefits are limited. When people exhaust their entitlements under the Workers Compensation Act if they are members of benefit organisations they can then start to receive benefits from those organisations. But there are 2 funds in the State that have been registered by the Minister despite the fact that they refuse to pay benefits after the exhaustion of the benefits under the Workers Compensation Act, so people pay into these funds and do not get benefits out of them. </para>
        <para>These are the sorts of things that we do not want to occur. We say that this should be done by regulation so that provisions are somewhat uniform- I do not want everything to be restricted - and the Minister does not have discretion to register funds which will be able to take benefits from people in circumstances so very greatly different from the circumstances under which people receive benefits from other funds. </para>

            <para>-I am  looking at section 73. We will probably get to section 81. We say that proposed section 73 should be amended by making provision in subsection (4.) that a register shall be open for public inspection. What is there to hide? Why should not these things be open for public inspection? The Government constantly talks about this being a public benefit, that the people should belong to the funds, that it is public insurance. Are the people only to have the interest of paying contributions and taking out benefits, whatever benefits the funds might pay out to them and whatever benefits the Government might pay out to them? Are they not entitled to examine the register? Are they not entitled to know that the fund that is encouraging them to join it is a registered fund? Surely they are entitled to examine the register. I support the amendment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GREENWOOD</inline>(Victoria) 8.23 -I am quite unrepentant in my very firm support for this amendment. 1 regret very much that I cannot see this regulation or this amendment in the way in which the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> and the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> see them. When one looks at the National Health Act one finds that an organisation, which is the body with which we are concerned in the amendment which is before the Committee, is defined as meaning a society, body or group of persons, whether corporate or unincorporate, which conducts a medical benefits or hospitals benefits fund. It may be in the traditional sense a proprietary body. It may be an aggregation of individuals and in that sense a voluntary body, but it is nevertheless a legal entity which is concerned to become an organisation under this Act. It makes an application to the Director-General with a view to being accepted as an organisation. By the amendment which the Committee has earlier passed it must comply with certain provisions which are contained in regulations. The organisation does what it is required to do and when the application is received everything connected with that organisation is examined by a committee. The committee then reports to the Minister and the Minister, under what the Government proposes, is then given a power to grant, subject to such terms and conditions, if any. as he thinks fit, the application which has been made. On the other hand the Minister is given the power to refuse the application. </para>
        <para>The section which is proposed by the Government says that if be grants the application he shall register the organisation accordingly and what one has therefore is an application accepted and a registration made, and an organisation is registered subject to such conditions as the Minister determines.I would have thought that that situation, even if it is called an administrative act, has with it all the elements which can work justice or injustice according to the way the Minister looks at it. This organisation may find itself subjected to conditions which the Minister imposes which are different from the conditions which are imposed by the Minister on a similar organisation. There is scope for discrimination; there is scope for injustice. </para>

            <para>- I accept what the Minister says and I propose to advert to that in due course but 1 would ask him, as he asked me, to listen to what 1 have to say. But where there is an element of discrimination and where there is an element of injustice that, 1 believe, should excite the attention of any honourable senator to whom these arguments are addressed. It is an administrative act and there must of necessity in the course of government be many administrative acts, and if it was simply a matter of the Minister accepting or refusing an application I would recognise that that was within the area of administration. I think I would probably be striving to have some element of appeal, but when we have a power to grant or to refuse an application and there is a power to impose upon the grant terms and conditions which nobody can challenge and which may be unjust and totally discriminatory, then it appears to me that one ought to be on guard against giving such a wide power to a Minister. </para>

            <para>- I accept your rebuke, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> and I will address my remarks to you. But having accepted the viewpoint which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has expressed that the amendment contains the same provisions as I see objectionable in what is contained in the Bill, I think there is one significant difference and that is that the unlimited power of the Minister which is involved in the proposal which is contained in the Bill is not so unlimited when one looks at what the Bill would be if it were amended by what is proposed. What is proposed is that any decision of the Minister will be by regulation and I understand that those words by regulation&#39; will involve that whatever decision tthe Minister makes imposing what terms and conditions he desires will be open to the scrutiny of the Parliament, and if there be an element of leaving to ministerial discretion terms and conditions which may work justly in one case and unjustly in another then the Parliament has the ability to scrutinise those terms and conditions. That is why I feel that this amendment is desirable. I have not heard from the Minister why she said before dinner that the expression &#39;by regulation&#39; would be nugatory because the Minister cannot make regulations, that it is only the Governor-General who can make regulations. I would be interested to hear what she has to say. I expect that the Minister can make regulations as the Governor-General can make regulations, but having briefly perused this Act I suspect that there is no power in the Act for the Minister to make the regulation and I would suggest to the mover of this amendment that the objective which is sought to be achieved would be more properly achieved if the words of the amendment were &#39;the Governor-General may&#39; rather than &#39;the Minister may&#39;. </para>

Where there is a power to grant an application which carries with it consequences of whether you can carry on an activity which you have been geared to carry on, and if there are terms and conditions to be imposed which may cripple your ability to carry on or which may enable you to carry on without any problems, 1 feel that it is very important that those conditions should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, lt is simply that view which I take which, as I said when I rose, makes me unrepentant in my belief that this amendment has merit which 1 feel requires support. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;8.32&#93; - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised 2 points before the suspension of the sitting which I said I would answer. He mentioned that section 80 of the Act applies only to the cancellation or suspension of an organisation and not to an application for registration. That is correct. However, on the introduction of the new health benefits plan all existing organisations will have to apply for registration to operate from 1st January 1971. If any application for registration is refused, either in respect of the whole organisation or in respect of an organisation&#39;s operations in a particular State, the Bill provides in clause 53 (7.) that the application will be treated as a cancellation of registration. In this event the organisation will have the same right of appeal to a Supreme Court as would an organisation whose registration was cancelled or suspended. I think that answers the queries the honourable senator raised and in relation to which we had a little crossfire before the sitting was suspended. </para>
        <para>The honourable senator also expressed doubts regarding the intention in the drafting of the amendment, lt is true to say that to require the Minister to act by regulation would be ineffective.

It has been mentioned previously in this debate that the reports of the Nimmo Committee and the Wedgwood Committee contain comments which castigate the management of some of the hospital and medical benefits funds. The Nimmo Committee said, amongst other things: &#39;The operation of the health insurance scheme is unnecessarily complex and beyond the comprehension of many&#39;; &#39;The benefits received by contributors are  frequently much less than the cost of hospital and medical treatment&#34;; &#39;Contributions have increased to such an extent that they are beyond the capacity of some members of the community&#39;: &#39;The rules of many registered organisations, including the so-called special account rules, permit disallowance or rejection of claims for particular conditions&#39;; The application of those rules has caused serious and widespread hardship&#39;; &#39;An unduly high proportion of contributions received by some organisations is absorbed in operating expenses&#39;; and The level of reserves held by some organisations is unnecessarily high.&#39; </para>

            <para>-  I cannot remember off hand. I have been through the reports of the Nimmo Committee and the Wedgwood Committee many times but 1 cannot remember the details. I cannot remember at the moment details about shareholders or the other matters to which we have referred, but comments were certainly made about the size of the reserves held by the funds and the manner in which some of the sums might have been invested. We believe that any other information that Parliament feels is required should be included in the annual report of the Director-General. </para>

Surely the public is entitled to know who are members of the fund, who the shareholders in the fund are, what the equity held by the fund is, the names of all the directors of the fund and how the directors are appointed. One of the major complaints that I, as a member of the Wedgwood Committee, heard was that very few funds had contributor representation on the boards of directors. Certainly the public is entitled to know details of how the reserve fund has been invested. I think to date approximately S90m of public funds are held in reserve. </para>

          <para>-  I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline> We seek to put these funds on the same basis as other organisations such as trade unions. I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline> Ever since the Bill was introduced in the Senate I have argued that the regulations controlling the funds should be the same as those controlling trade unions. I will give two classic illustrations. I may have been misled into this but I had joint membership in the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia and in the New South Wales Railways and Transport Employees Hospital Fund. Each time there was a change in policy the latter fund sent to its members a circular similar to that which a trade union would circulate to its members about a change of rules. The bigger fund, the HCF, did nothing like that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> referred to my efforts to get information on investments by funds. This stemmed from an article in the reputable Sydney journal Nation&#39;. The article probably would not have been released until the Bill was before Parliament except that the funds wanted to put up a good image. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The point I make is that, by going to the Industrial Registrar in Sydney or in any other capital city, a person can ascertain the numerical strength of a trade union. In another place the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> sought the information that this amendment is trying to get. He got the runaround. This is nothing new. I could go back to 1957, 1958 or thereabouts. I was a member of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council Social Services Committee. We were inundated with complaints about anomalies and shortcomings of the funds. We were naive enough to write to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harrop.</inline> He had a dual position. He was a director of one of these funds and he was Secretary of the Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. He told us thai he would not give us any information about the fund and that we could go and jump in the take. As Secretary of the Theatrical Employees Association he was bound by law to give certain information to the Registrar and anyone could ascertain the membership of the Theatrical Employees Association. But in relation to the fund he could not give any information. The whole basis of the health scheme is that the Government insists that a person has to belong to a fund to obtain this form of government benefit. Therefore, there should be no distinction. If the Government errs, it should err on the side of subscriber democracy. That is why I support to the hilt the amendment sponsored by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline></para>

          <para>&#91;8.56&#93; - The amendment moved by the Opposition is directed to the new section 76a. contained in clause 27. That section provides for the Minister to table each year in each House of Parliament a report of the Director-General on the operations of registered organisations. The new subsection (2.) lists 7 heads of information that are to be included in the report of the Director-General. The list is not an exhaustive one. Paragraph (h) enables the Minister to require additional information to be included, lt. follows that the Government contemplates that, if it appears desirable in the light of experience, the Minister will require additional information, it is made possible by the extra head in this section. In considering this amendment it is relevant, I believe, to keep in mind the various types of organisations that are registered under the National Health Act. Numerically, the main group of organisations is those registered under State law as friendly societies. The second important group includes the larger organisations registered under State law as guaranteed companies. Other State law exists, such as legislation applicable to co-operative societies, charities and benefit associations, which applies to organisations which are not friendly societies or guaranteed companies. lt follows that the majority of organisations, and certainly all the larger ones, are to a greater or lesser extent subject to dual control, that is, by both the Commonwealth under the National Health Act and a particular State or States under the appropriate State legislation. It is felt that the legal provisions relating to all those organisations are adequate for the general control and the protection of the contributors. At the same time it is realised that the Commonwealth&#39;s interest in the activities of these organisations is a vita! one. lt is for this reason that the Bill provides additional measures directed to activities of organisations. From what I have said, it is apparent that the amendment would probably not have application to all organisations but only to the larger funds - the guaranteed companies under State law. For instance, the information sought in the amendment would not appear to be relevant in respect of friendly societies whose financial transactions, reserve investments, etc., are closely supervised under the powers conferred by State friendly societies legislation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I reply to the mover of the amendment and to the Opposition that at this point of time the Government would prefer not to commit itself to the additional information that is sought to be included in the report to be tabled in Parliament. Some of the information sought in the proposed amendment could be relevant in an examination of an individual organisation&#39;s affairs, but unlit the Government has had an opportunity to consider the overall effects of including such information as is sought by the amendment in the report, the Government would prefer to have the Bill not made more specific at this stage. On these grounds, although not rejecting the objectives sought by the amendment, the Government cannot accept the proposed amendment which has been placed before the Senate. In view of the purpose of the Bill 1 believe the reasons which have been set out are very sensible and I support the Minister in rejecting the proposed amendment. </para>

          <para>- Amongst other things the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> asks for details of how the reserve funds have been invested. With respect to the Minister. I think ibis is a very pertinent question. These are sums of money paid by the contributors to the fund. They do not belong to the Government; they do not belong to the fund. They belong to the contributors. Whilst it is practical for any fund which is operating in a risk industry to have some reserves, it is not a practical proposition that the reserves of the various funds operating throughout Australia should be running at the rate of S63m. The schedule in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs shows that the free reserves, as they are referred to, have increased from $1,658,894 in 1951-52 to &#167;63,723,467 in 1967-68, which is the latest figure I imagine the Committee was able to obtain. This is an enormous amount of money which belongs to the contributors to the fund. Whilst funds are allowed to build up such enormous reserves the payments by the contributors to the funds must be increased continuously to maintain those reserves. I cannot accept as valid the reasons given by the funds for maintaining reserves at their present level. The Senate Select Committee recommended: </para>

        <para class="block">When one looks at the schedule which, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> is on page 136, one sees that $63,723,467 represents 7.1 months reserves, lt is obvious from the report by the Senate Select Committee that the reserves are excessive. We have heard nothing in these debates yet - and I have been in the Senate chamber for most of them - to indicate whether the Government intends to have any control over the reserves of these funds. I think it is essential that Parliament should know the details of how the reserve funds have been invested. </para>
        <para>Again I say that these funds belong to the contributors - the shareholders in the registered organisations..  The shareholders in the registered organisations, like the shareholders in most organisations, have little control over finances and how they shall be invested. The so called reserve funds could be invested in any sort of wild cat scheme. That sometimes happens. That has been happening recently in the stock markets. These funds could be lost. This has not only happened in wild cat schemes; the blue chip industries have fallen remarkably over the past few weeks. I say that it is valid for the Labor Party to ask that the reserve funds be included among those things which should be reported. It is not unreasonable, I think, to ask for the names of the shareholders in the fund, the equity held by each shareholder in the fund and the names of all directors of that fund. This is not an unreasonable thing for the Parliament to know and for the report to show. Remembering all the time that this report is made to the Minister, section 76a(1.) provides that the Director-General shall report these matters to the Minister. It does not necessarily mean that the Minister will report to the Parliament. I would have liked an amendment that the Minister be bound to report to the Parliament once each year. </para>

          <para>Organisations need to maintain reserves for various reasons, for example: to provide a buffer which can absorb fluctuations in costs from year to year, as a safeguard against rising rates of claims as the Schemes develop and utilisation of medical and hospital services increases; to secure them against the increasing cost of claims as the age of the member increases; as a provision against heavy claims resulting from epidemics or catastrophes&#39;, and with the exception of the last of these reasons, the Committee agrees that they form the basis for retention of adequate reserves. </para>

        <para class="block">Reverting to your reminder, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> whilst the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> deals with the details of how the reserves have been invested, if those reserves are not invested in a sufficiently liquid form they would not be available for the purposes for which the funds say they are required. So the amount of the reserves and how they are invested are relevant to whether they are available for the purposes for which they are required. Therefore I support the inclusion of the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline></para>

          <para>- I wish to draw attention to one matter, namely, proposed new paragraph (k), which reads: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(k)">
            <para>such other information as the Parliament requires to be included. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Under the Constitution, of course, the Parliament is the Senate, the House of Representatives and  Her  Majesty the Queen. Therefore, the only way in which the will of the Parliament can be expressed is by statute. So it seems meaningless to insert a provision such as such other information as the Parliament resolves by statute; in other words, when this Act is further amended. In effect, that is the only meaning that could be given to these words that are proposed to be added. </para>
        <para>I believe that it would reflect very poorly upon the Senate if such a provision were to be written into an amending statute. It certainly would expose the Senate to some degree of ridicule, in my conception. Therefore, I personally would not be prepared to be identified with that proposed new paragraph. In addition, this type of provision has the effect in some strange way of tying the hands of another Parliament. We would be resolving that certain particulars which this Parliament indicates should be required by another Parliament by statute. That seems to be an extraordinary situation. I rather doubt the actual validity of efficacy of that proposed new paragraph, being in that form and purporting to achieve that position. For that reason I shall be unable to accept that proposed new paragraph - quite apart from any of the other proposed new paragraphs to which I do not advert at this stage. </para>

          <para>- I have a view somewhat similar to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s.</inline> I believe that the argument that proposed new paragraph (k) - Such other information as the Parliament requires to be included&#39; - is preferable to paragraph (h), as set out in the Bill - &#39;such other information as the Minister requires to be included&#39; - cannot really command acceptance. The Minister can act far more readily and easily than the Parliament can act in this area. That is what the whole case made out by the Opposition in this respect is designed to achieve. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But, equally, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> made out a case which would appear to me to be persuasive with regard to the aspect of reserves. 1 do not believe that any case whatsoever has been made out for new paragraphs (h) and (j) as proposed by the Opposition. I do not know whether there is any procedure by which these paragraphs can be voted on separately. I believe that, if the objective of the Committee is to have as one of the requirements that the Director-General shall report upon to the Minister each year and which the Minister shall report upon to the Parliament each year, the desirable course is to determine the best set of conditions or criteria that one can. </para>
        <para class="block">To that extent, but from a different viewpoint, I indicate a view somewhat comparable to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> has expressed. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing)  &#91;9.14&#93;  - I wish to make just a few points in reply to the comments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> made. I believe that the proposed new section  76a (1.)  and  (2.),  in which are set out under various headings the matters that are to be included in the report, answer the points he raised. Those headings clearly refer to contributions payable to the fund, other amounts payable to the fund, medical fund benefits or hospital fund benefits payable out of the fund, other benefits payable out of the fund, management expenses, other amounts payable out of the fund and the balance of the fund as at the end of the year. I believe that the last paragraph - such other information as the Minister requires to bc included&#39; - is clearly preferable to the paragraph proposed in the amendment. The proposed new section also states that the report is to be tabled within  15  sitting days of the House of Representatives  and the Senate after it is received by the Minister. I believe that the proposed new section, in fact, covers all the matters about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> expressed concern. </para>

          <para>- The position of members of my Party is that we can see good reasons for proposed new paragraph (i) and good reasons for proposed new paragraph (j); but we can see no reason at all for proposed new paragraph (k) which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> has pointed out, is completely unnecessary. In regard to proposed new paragraph (h), I do not think any particular reasons have been given for including the names of all shareholders in the fund, the equity held by each in that fund and the names of all directors of that fund. That information would be obtained if proposed new paragraph  0)  were included. It refers to details of the shareholdings of the directors of the fund in certain organisations. So, it seems to us that it would be advisable for these proposed new paragraphs to be put seriatim. If they are put seriatim we will oppose proposed new paragraphs (h) and (k) and we will vote for proposed new paragraphs (i) and <inline font-style="italic">Q).</inline></para>

          <para>- I oppose the amendment, even as it would be amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McM</inline> anus&#39;s amendment. It seems to me that somebody is wishing to engage in some sort of a witch hunt. It is true that both the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs and the Nimmo Committee found that the reserves held by many of these funds were far too high and could not be justified, and reported accordingly. I think it is also true that the Department of Health was somewhat concerned. Perhaps we should not be critical of the Department for relying on persuasion to try to convince some of these funds that they should act differently. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Department was reluctant to use the ultimate power of suspension or cancellation. I believe that it had good reason for adopting that attitude, namely, fear of disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of contributors in some cases. From the outside we can be critical, perhaps, and say that the threat of the use of this power may have discouraged some of these funds from developing large reserves. But what is the Opposition trying- to achieve by this amendment? If we delete proposed new paragraphs (h) and (k), we are saying that the Director-General and the Minister should present to the Parliament details of how these reserves are invested. </para>
        <para>With the greatest respect to the Parliament, 1 suggest that we are not in a position to argue whether these reserves are invested wisely or unwisely. We could stand in this place and argue for hours as to the wisdom or otherwise of investments. I suggest that the people who should exercise their power properly are the Department and the Minister, and not necessarily the Parliament. After all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> might have one idea and 1 might have a completely different idea as to the wise investment of reserves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> referred to the funds investing their reserves on the stock exchange. Who would have had the foresight 3 months ago when Poseidon shares were rising to the sky to say that they would not be a sound investment? It may be that they are still a sound investment, today. </para>

            <para>- But who is to judge whether an investment is a sound or unsound investment? 1 do not believe that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to make such a judgment. I refer now to paragraph (j) of the Opposition&#39;s amendment, which relates to details of direct or indirect interest in shareholdings held by directors of a fund in organisations in which the funds reserves have been invested. I would regard this as the most glorious opportunity for anybody who wishes to do so to engage in the most outrageous witch hunt of all times. The fact that a director or somebody else has a shareholding in another company does not mean that investment in it by a fund would not be an honest or sound investment. For a Parliament to make a judgment on this would mean that it is engaging in a witch hunt. The fact that a fund invests in a company in which a director or shareholder of the fund has an interest does not mean that it is an unsound or unwise investment. 1 cannot follow the argument that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to make these judgments and these decisions. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>One could speak at some length on this subject, but I do not intend to do so because I cannot see the purpose of the amendment. I believe it is adequately covered by the provisions of the bill. Subsection (1.) of proposed section 76a states that the Director-General shall, as soon as practicable after 30th June each year, furnish a report to the Minister on the operations of the funds. Sub-section (2.) of proposed section 76a goes on to detail the type of information which shall be furnished to the Minister. Paragraph (h) refers to such other information as the Minister requires to be included. These provisions will give the Minister very wide powers in relation to supervision of the funds and their investments. He will have a week to week or month to month control of the funds. Subsection (4.) of proposed section 76a states that the Minister shall lay each report under this section before each House of the Parliament within 1 5 sitting days of that House after it is received by the Minister. This will give the Parliament an opportunity to debate the report and, if it wishes, to seek further information. 1. believe that the whole situation is adequately covered by the provisions of the Bill. Therefore, on these grounds, I strongly oppose the amendments, including the amendment to the original amendment. </para>

The amendment which has been moved on behalf of the Australian Labor Party states that at page 19, clause 27, line 23 of the Bill leave out paragraph (h) of sub-section (2.) of proposed new section 76a and insert 4 paragraphs in its stead. The amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> to the original amendment has resulted in the deletion of 2 of those paragraphs. The amendment now reads, as f understand it, that we leave out paragraph </para>

            <para>and (j) of the Opposition&#39;s amendment. The Opposition&#39;s lettering of the paragraphs would automatically follow. I agree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> that paragraph (h) does come out because 1 think, it specifically, says so. Therefore, the reference to &#39;such other information as the Minister requires to be included&#39; has been taken out and in place of it there will be details about how the reserve funds have been invested and details of direct or indirect interest in shareholdings held in organisations in which the reserves of a fund have been invested. If the Minister requires more time to look at this matter, I do not think that there would be any harm in proceeding with the next amendment. As I read the proposed amendment, it may be acceptable to the Government. The reference to &#39;such other information&#39; is being deleted and in its stead is to be reference to specific information. I make this offer to the Minister. I do not know whether she will require time to consider the matter. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to offer a suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman.</inline> With respect to what you have ruled on the advice of the  Clerk  and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> has said, I think that your ruling was quite correct. I think that paragraph (h) of sub-section (2.) of proposed new section 76a has gone out and that any recommittal of the amendment, unless people are prepared to change their minds, will result in the same consequence, and paragraph (h) will go out. But appreciating the point which the Leader of the Government in the Senate is wanting and which I think would have general acceptance throughout this chamber, whatever specific matters are included in the actual section as it finally leaves this chamber, it is also desired that there be a paragraph which states: &#39;Such other information as the Minister requires to be included&#39;. I think this is what he is desirous of achieving. Maybe that would be capable of being determined by leaving the position as it is at the moment and seeking the suspension of the Standing Orders to have that paragraph at this stage included in the Bill. I think that would have the unanimous support of the Committee. </para>

          <para>- There was a little cynical laughter when I suggested that the Senate did not understand what it had agreed to and therefore did not understand what it had in fact knocked out of the Bill. We are now in the situation where the Committee has expressed approval that there be included in the Bill a paragraph which reads: &#39;Such other information as the Minister requires to be included&#39;. 1 suggest that if the Committee knows What it has left in, what it has added and what it wants to add, some honourable senators should be able to say: &#39;This line in (i), (j), (k), (I) or whatever the letter is will appear in the printed document&#39;. At the moment it does not appear to me that that is known. We have an amendment to the Bil! before us which refer to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h). We are told that paragraph (h) is out. We are told: &#39;We want paragraph (h) in, but we cannot have paragraph (h) in because there is a new paragraph (h)&#39;. I want to know what letter precedes the line that we are asked to : agree to, namely: &#39;Such other information as the Minister requires to be included&#39;. Being told that, I believe that the Committee should be told what remains in the Bill from paragraph (a) down to whatever letter is now signified. </para>

          <para>- There seems to be some doubt in the minds of honourable senators as to what has taken place. Surely it would be very easy to sift this out. There was an amendment to the Bill. What were the terms of the amendment? Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> moved an amendment to the amendment, which is an unusual thing, but there it is. We should know the terms of that.

          <para class="block">This would mean that proposed section 80a of the principal Act would be amended in relation to the limits in respect of management expenses of funds. </para>
          <para>We suggest that where the word &#39;may&#39; appears in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed section 80a, there should he a mandatory power or a mandatory prescription. Therefore we suggest the use of the word shall&#39;. We believe that the principles which were enunciated earlier in the debate on amendments which were moved successfully by the Opposition should apply here. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> said earlier in the debate, section 76(1.) makes it mandatory for each medical benefits fund or hospital benefits fund to furnish certain information to the Director-General in respect of its organisation. We say that so far as management expenses of funds are concerned it should be mandatory and that a prescription in respect of limits of management expenses should be set out. </para>
          <para>The Bill should provide that the regulations shall empower the Minister to deduct from any Commonwealth benefit payable to a registered organisation in relation to the conduct of medical benefits funds or hospital benefits funds by the organisation an amount equal to the amount by which any management expenses in relation to that fund exceed any limit so prescribed that is applicable in respect of that fund. The question of management expenses of medical and hospital funds was dealt with fairly voluminously by the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs, which I shall refer to as the &#39;Wedgwood Committee&#39;. At paragraph 129 at page 40 of the Wedgwood Committee&#39;s report it is pointed out that for the year 1968-69 preliminary statistics showed that the total amounts expended on management expenses by registered medical and hospital benefit organisations, in ordinary account, were as high as$11,425,063, which was 15.5% of contribution income, for medical benefit funds and as high as $11,720,598, which was 10.7% of contribution income, for hospital benefit organisations. It was understood, of course, that there were more difficulties in the management of medical benefit funds than hospital benefit funds but, nonetheless, these were running pretty high. Paragraph 134 of the Wedgwood Committee report states: </para>
          <para>In view of the amount involved, and particularly in view of some of the advertising and other expansion activities revealed in evidence, the Committee considers the existing situation to be most unsatisfactory and wasteful of contributors&#39; funds. </para>
          <para class="block">The report then went on to say that the criticism could not be directed at all organisations in all States but was more relevant in Victoria and in New South Wales where the 2 largest open funds operated in strict and apparently fierce competition. The Nimmo Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry on Health Insurance also had condemnatory remarks to make about the management expenses of funds. The Committee said at paragraph 14.15: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As it is impracticable for contributors to large organisations themselves to maintain close control of the activities of the organisation, the responsibility falls to the Commonwealth Government to exercise controls on their behalf. It is for this reason that we recommend that new forms of control be conferred on the National Health Insurance Commission. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In this Bill there is no national health insurance commission being established or contemplated. We believe it is important that these matters be made mandatory in respect of management expenses of medical and hospital benefits funds, that the regulations should prescribe limits for management expenses and then, that being so, the regulations should empower the Minister to perform certain administrative acts. We believe that these  2  amendments are important. In our opinion they improve the Bill. Therefore, I move them on behalf of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>&#91;9.45&#93; - These amendments are directed to the regulation making power in regard to the level of management expenses and would require regulations to be made prescribing the limits of management expenses and require the Minister to deduct from Commonwealth benefit reimbursements management expenses in excess of the prescribed level. The requirement that open organisations shall seek separate registration in each State will enable the separate identification and assessment of the financial experience of the organisation&#39;s operations in each State. Approval for an open fund to operate in a particular State will not be continued unless it is shown that economic and efficient operations in that State can be expected. This should result in the management expenses of all funds being reduced to the desirably satisfactory level already achieved by the majority of organisations. Also, the economies which will be associated with the single medical table will assist all the funds to reduce their management expenses to the level of economic and efficient operation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The fact that contribution rates payable under the new scheme will be determined for each fund having regard to its particular financial position will enable contribution rates to vary as between funds. This in itself provides an incentive for funds to achieve economic and efficient operation, as it is in this manner that they will be able to reduce their contribution rates and compete effectively against other organisations. At this stage the Government is of the view that the measures I have outlined will be sufficient. However, if these measures are not effective in reducing management expenses and do not achieve the desired result, the time will then be appropriate to employ the regulation making power of clause 30. I believe that the points that I have mentioned show the view of the Government on this occasion. </para>

We believe that this discriminates against those in the community who already are in need, the people who are receiving some form of sheltered employment allowance, people who are receiving a Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service training allowance, people who are receiving some form of assistance under the Tuberculosis Act and indeed a female who is in receipt of a social service pension where the spouse of a claimant or a pensioner is not in receipt of such pension.

            <para>&#91;10.1&#93; - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has referred to section 82q of the principal Act and and has told us how it relates specifically to the manner of assessing the eligibility of low income families for assistance with the costs of health insurance. To understand sub-section (2.) of section 82q it is necessary to appreciate that the Social Services Act provides for certain forms of income to be exempt income when calculating the means as assessed of a person for pension purposes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Paragraph (e) to which the honourable senator has referred provides that certain forms of income are not to be excluded when calculating means as assessed of low income families for the purpose of assistance with the costs, of health insurance. The forms of income which are not to be excluded are sheltered employment assistance paid under Part VIIA of the Social Services Act, rehabilitation allowances paid under Part VIII of the Social Services Act, tuberculosis allowances paid under section 9 of the Tuberculosis Act, service pensions paid under the Repatriation Act and age or invalid pensions. The policy behind paragraph (e) is to provide that the various categories of eligible persons generally receive assistance from only one welfare source. The assistance with health insurance for low income families is directed to those groups in the community which are not otherwise assisted by way of pensions or allowances under the Social Services Act, the Repatriation Act or the Tuberculosis Act and by virtue of the payment of those pensions or allowances are usually eligible for medical, hospital and pharmaceutical care under the pensioner medical service. </para>
          <para>In assessing the eligibility of low income families for assistance it is necessary to place the applicants on the same relative basis. If the income falling within the categories I have mentioned was excluded when assessing eligibility, then it would place the recipients of the income in an advantageous position as compared to other families and this would give rise to anomalies. Therefore the amendment could not be accepted by the Government. </para>

            <para>- I want to raise a couple of aspects of the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline> The subsidy on the medical contribution is not payable in respect of a person receiving benefits under the Tuberculosis Act, the Act relating to sheltered workshops and the Act relating to the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. As the Minister has said, in most of those cases the people concerned would be receiving some form of medical service. I raise with the Minister the case of the male, the head of the family, who is receiving treatment and benefits under the Tuberculosis Act and whose dependants may require medical or hospital treatment. The onus then would be on the person receiving assistance under the Tuberculosis Act to take out insurance to protect his dependants. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not know what benefits are payable at present under the Tuberculosis Act. I know that over the years they have been rather generous when considered in relation to other social service benefits although not extremely generous. They were set down as an encouragement to persons to go into hospital and be treated for tuberculosis knowing that there was sufficient income for the family to live on while the treatment was being received. So the benefits under the Tuberculosis Act were much better than the benefits under the Social Services Act but they were never more than  the minimum wage. A person receiving benefits under the Tuberculosis Act would also be receiving free medical treatment for his condition but his dependants would not receive free medical treatment and out of the meagre income, if I might so term it, that the tuberculosis patient would be receiving he still would have to pay for some form of medical insurance to protect his dependants. </para>
          <para>Much the same position would apply to the person working in a sheltered workshop and to the person in a Commonwealth rehabilitation centre subject, of course, to the fact that a very strict means test is applied to persons in Commonwealth rehabilitation centres. They have to comply with certain requirements of the Department of Social Services and their remuneration is not very great in relation to benefits under the Social Services Act. Nevertheless they would have to take out some form of medical and hospital insurance to protect their dependants. For this reason we say that this Part should not be included in the Act, that the restrictions contained in it are much greater than those in the Social Services Act and that it would be better to delete the words as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline></para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The proposed amendment if carried would fit into section 82s of the principal Act. It relates to the waiver of contributions and reimbursement by the Commonwealth of the fund benefits where a contributor to a fund is in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefits. The Committee is aware that when a person is in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefits and was a contributor to a fund before it became necessary for him to receive those benefits, as a member of a medical benefits fund he could be accepted as having continuity of membership of the fund from the time of receipt of the unemployment and sickness benefits. The proposed new section 82s provides that where a contributor to a fund, being a person in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefits, lodges with the organisation conducting the fund a claim in respect of a professional service that has been rendered to him, and the professional service was in fact rendered to him during the period in relation to which the proposed section applies in respect of the contributor, and under a provision included in the rules of the organisation the contributions were not payable by the contributor, then the organisation pays to, or to a person on behalf of, the contributor fund benefit in respect of the professional service and there is payable to the organisation by the Commonwealth an amount equal to the fund benefit referred to in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1.) of the proposed section 82s. In other words, if a person in receipt of unemployment and sickness benefits goes to a doctor and receives treatment from him, assuming that the rules of the organisation enable him to remain a contributor to the fund for the period during which he receives the unemployment or sickness benefits, he will then receive a Commonwealth benefit and the fund benefit. Out of his own pocket he will have to pay any specified excess that is detailed in the Schedule to the Bill. </para>
          <para>The Opposition believes that the Commonwealth should ensure that the complete medical expenses of a person in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefits are met and that there should be payable to the organisation for payment to him the complete medical fee involved. We feel that he should receive the Commonwealth benefit, the fund benefit and the excess, bringing the amount up to the common fee prescribed in the Schedule. We believe that this is a matter of simple justice for an unemployed worker in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefits. He cannot afford in that position to pay the excess and he should not incur any disability financially. That is all I wish to say at this stage in respect of the amendment proposed by the Opposition and I request that it be accepted by the Government. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) &#91;10.14&#93; - The amendment moved by the Opposition, dealing with the proposed new section 82s (1.), is presumably intended to provide for the Commonwealth to meet the specified excess or patient gap for medical services rendered to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries. I would like to point out to honourable senators that the amendment in its present form would not achieve this purpose. It would have the effect of increasing the reimbursement to the organisation but would not increase the payment of benefit by the organisation to the contributor, which is governed by paragraph </para>

            <item label="(b)">
              <para>of the proposed section 82s (1.). In other words, the amendment would have the effect of providing for the organisation to receive reimbursement of both fund benefit and the specified excess, provided the organisation had paid only the fund benefit to the contributor. It follows that the amendment could not be seriously considered in the form in which it has been drafted. In any case, from the point of view of the policy involved, the Government could not accept it. </para>

          <para>By subsidising benefits in full for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries the Government has placed them in the same position as other contributors to the medical benefits scheme, without their having to pay any contributions to funds. The only payments that they will have to make towards their medical and hospital care are the relatively small amounts they will pay for medical services. These will not exceed $5 even for the most serious operation and the services directly associated with it, when the doctors charge the common fees. The Government is of the opinion that so far as the relationship of the patient to the doctor is concerned, these persons should be treated the same as anyone else. It is a basic concept of voluntary health insurance that the patient should make some small payment towards meeting the cost of medical services he receives. </para>
          <para>However, it should be kept in mind that the fee for a medical service is a matter to be settled between the doctor and the patient. As 1 have said, doctors are not bound to charge the most common fee and in the case of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and low income families it is most likely that most of them will relate their fees to the benefit rather than the most common fee. It has been the practice of the medical profession in the past to vary fees in accordance with a patient&#39;s means and I can see no reason why this should not be done in future. In fact, the abolition of the old rule limiting benefits to 90% of the charge will enable them to charge patients no more than the benefits payable for the service. The same considerations apply to amendments Nos. (24), (25) and (26) proposed by the Opposition, which relate to low income families whose benefits are subsidised in full, or to the extent of two-thirds or one-third. I repeat that the Government could not accept the proposed amendment. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing)&#91;10.27&#93; - The proposed amendment moved by the honourable senator is directed at ensuring that unemployment and sickness beneficiaries whose benefits will be subsidised by the Commonwealth shall receive not less than the cost of public ward treatment. There are 3 points to this. The first is that the proposed amendment is directed to section 82s which relates to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and no similar amendment is proposed with respect to section 82t which relates to low income families. This would create an anomalous situation. The Government desires that these 2 groups should be treated similarly. Secondly, the position in practice has been and will bethat these patients wilt receive fund benefits and Commonwealth benefits at least equal to the public ward charge. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the Minister may determine an approved scale of benefits which will be paid to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and low income families. This is provided for by the amended section 82r in clause 42 of the Bill. The difference between the Bill as it is drafted and the proposed amendment could be one of legislative approach as the approved scale of benefits determined by the Minister will at least equal the public ward charge existing in the respective States. This means that eligible patients in no case will receive lessthan the public ward charge. Thirdly, I want to draw attention to specific wording of the amendment. It provides:  but in no case will a contributor receive less than an amount equalto the daily cost of public ward treatment . . </para>
          <para class="block">I emphasise that the word &#34;cost&#39; is used and not the word &#39;charge&#39;. If this proposed amendment were successful in its present form, it would appear that for eligible patients the Commonwealth would have to meet the cost of the public ward treatment and not the charge. Such a situation would be completely unacceptable, the Government feels. </para>
