            <para>- by leave - The Senate will be aware that to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution the next Senate election must be held before 30th June 1971. Accordingly, the Government has decided to invite His Excellency the Governor-General to communicate with the State Governors proposing that the Senate election be held on Saturday, 21st November 1970. When replies have been received from the States I shall inform the Senate of the full timetable proposed for the election. </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  I propose to make a statement on behalf of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> relating to the receipts duty legislation. Honourable senators will understand that when I use the first person singular personal pronoun I shall be referring to the Prime Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable members will recallthat last June legislation was introduced to impose a continuing Commonwealth receipts duty on business receipts. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> explained that this was being done at the request of the States, and for their benefit, the purpose being to ensure that the States did not lose revenue as a consequence of the High Court decisions which invalidated their own receipts duty legislation as it applied to certain types of receipt. The Treasurer also explained that the Commonwealth legislation would - again at the request of the States - apply retrospectively to 18th November 1969, the date on which the Commonwealth's agreement to introduce legislation for the benefit of the States was foreshadowed. Provision was made, however, for exemption from duty under the Commonwealth legislation, in respect of the period 18th November 1969 to a date to be proclaimed as the end of a transitional period if duty, whether or not validly imposed, was paid under State legislation. </para>
          <para>The proposed legislation was approved by this House but failed to secure the approval of the Senate. Immediately after the resumption of the House following next weeks recess, the legislation will be reintroduced in the House with inclusion of provisions under which the Commonwealth legislation will cease to apply to amounts received after 30th September 1970. </para>
          <para>The overall effect of the new Commonwealth legislation will be that business receipts during the period from 18th November 1969 to 30th September 1970 will be liable to duty under it at the rate of 0.1 per cent, but that this liability will not arise if the provisions of State laws in this period - whether valid or invalid - are complied with. One effect of this will be that, to the extent that receipts are specifically exempted or simply not dutiable under State law, they will not be dutiable under the Commonwealth law. Another effect will be that receipts which Queensland legislation has purported to make dutiable during this period will remain liable to duty at the lower rate of 0.02 per cent - provided, of course, Queensland duty is in fact paid on the receipts or has already been paid. </para>
          <para>I add that, knowing of the Government's stated intention to proceed with Commonwealth legislation to impose - at the States' request- a duty on business receipts, many businesses have continued to pay duty to the States even though the payment of an excise may have been involved. In 1969-70 the States actually collected 85 per cent or more of the total amount they had estimated they would receive. The essential purposes of the new Commonwealth legislation will be to validate the collections already received by the States and, in the case of businessesthat have refrained from paying receipts duty in respect of the period to be covered by the Commonwealth law. to require them to make such payments. The Government appreciates that the 1970-71 Budgets of the States have been framed on the assumption that the Commonwealth receipts duty legislation would have continuing operation and that the States would therefore receive the full benefit of the receipts duty revenue that would have been payable to them in 1970-71 if the Commonwealth legislation had continuing operation. The Government also appreciates that limiting the operation of the Commonwealth legislation to receipts up to 30th September 1970 will have a significant effect on State revenues for 1970-71 and that something will need to be done to protect the budgetary situation of the States. </para>
          <para>We propose that additional Commonwealth grants will be payable to the States in 1970-71 to make good the reasonable losses of State revenue resulting from the termination of the Commonwealth receipts duty legislation on 30th September 1970. As in the case of other arrangements for the payment of Commonwealth assistance grants to the States in 1970-71, our willingness to do this is on the basis that the arrangements resulting from the June 1970 Premiers Conference will apply in their entirety. For the purpose of ascertaining such reasonable losses, I am in touch with the Premiers with a view to arranging consultations between the Commonwealth and State governments as quickly as possible. We have in mind that at such consultations there will be discussed the question of the future of receipts duty in the non-excise area under State legislation against the background that the Commonwealth legislation will cease to apply to amounts received after 30th September 1970. </para>

          <para>- Firstly, we welcome the announcement thai the Senate election will be held on 21st November. The sooner it is held the better for us all. We are pleased that the Government has supplied us with such a good battleground as it has in the last few days. Secondly, the Opposition considers the action of the Government in abandoning the receipts tax as from today to be very wise for the reasons that were stated by those who opposed it when it was debated in this chamber. It was inflationary, an administrative nightmare, and from every point of view ought not to have been imposed on the people of Australia. However, the Government's action in allowing the tax to operate up to yesterday discloses that it is prepared to adopt the worst kind of tax. I suppose about the worst kind of legislative measure is to impose a tax or a criminal sanction retrospectively, and it is no credit to the Government that it would do this to the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator seems to hang a lot on the postal charges, but it is very interesting to note that he and the Party to which be belongs allowed the Social Services Bill to go through without any motion being proposed for its withdrawal, lt was more important for them to save a lot of publishers and others the increased postal charges than to do something in the interests of the pensioners and the people affected by the means test. We make that observation here and now in reply to the honourable senator's interjection. 1 welcome the announcement of the election date because to have imposed the receipts tax, particularly on the Queensland taxpayers, would have been most unfair. In that State the receipts tax was a moderate tax which returned to the Treasurer something over $2m in the last financial year. The Government's proposal would have meant a considerable increase in the tax collected from the people of Queensland. 1 am glad that the Party to which 1 belong took the initial steps to arrest the drift of that tax throughout Australia, and in particular in Queensland. </para>

        <para>I have 2 other comments to make. Firstly, I am disappointed that we go to yet another election without the voting age in Australia having been lowered. It is plain that it is the wish of the Australian people that that should be done. Now that Queensland has come into line I think that every State government intends to lower the voting age. The generation gap is driven much wider when oldies like vis hesitate and vaccilate- </para>

            <para>- I can hear someone saying that I should speak for myself. I do speak for myself because time passes me by very quickly. Apparently we cannot see something which is obvious and we allow the present system to continue for yet another election. Without going into the very highly emotional things which affect youth today, it is obvious that they will shortly have the vote at 18 years of age and it is a disappointment to me that this Parliament, unless I can coax the Government into slipping a Bill through in the next few weeks, will not give the vote to that section of our community. </para>

        <para>The other thing which disappoints me is that this Government has failed to take its courage into its hands and bring together again the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate. The present arrangement is inefficient. It came about for political purposes and, whatever the justification for it in those days on a political level, it is drifting along. It is expensive. It is not good for any government to have to shape its policies towards an election, and it is not good for the Australian people to be going to the polling booths just about every second Saturday afternoon to vote in one election or another. I hope that the next time an announcement is made about an election both the question of giving the vote to our youth, and the question of bringing the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives together again, will be in the forefront of the Government's mind. </para>

          <para>- by leave - I notice <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> is seeking to rise. With great respect to everyone, I say that f do not want to enter into a debate on the matter. Let me say, in response to the first question, that honourable senators will recall that in my statement I said that when replies had been received from the States following the invitation issued to  His Excellency  the Governor-General to act on the matter, a full timetable proposed for the election would be prepared. Therefore, at the moment, it is not possible for me to do that. I am very alive to the need and I have it clearly in my sights that when we come back on the Tuesday after this break we will have to face up to our timetable and all matters relating to the time between then and when we rise for the election. I am aware of the problem. I will give it consideration and as soon as I am in a position to do so I will bring a statement into the Senate. </para>

          <para>- by leave - 1 raise objection to a very important statement being made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> without copies being made available to honourable senators. I do that because if I heard the honourable senator correctly some part of his statement dealt with a decision made by the Premier of the State which I have the honour to represent. My understanding is that if everything which was agreed upon between the Premiers and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> when they met some time ago in regard to CommonwealthState finances is carried out some money will be given back to the States from a tax which has been levied on all transactions until today. I do not imply for one moment that the Leader of the Government read his statement in such a manner that one could not hear it but there was a little bit of cross fire. I have been guilty of this in the past and no doubt I will be guilty in future for the little time that I will be here. As the Senate will not meet for a weekI wonder whether the statement could be roneoed and copies given to honourable senators because I believe it is vital to the finances of all States. I am concerned, of course, about my own important State. </para>

          <para>- by leave - I crave the indulgence of the Senate to make a plea on behalf of backbench honourable senators. Could we have something positive as to the future of the estimates committees? Candidly, many of us find that during a recess representatives of organisations come to us on various matters. It is not much use our listening to them and taking copious notes - we do not have the research officers to collate all the material - and then having to square off later by saying that nothing is happening. The Leader of the Government may say that the position can be partly met by putting questions on the notice paper. But honourable senators have looked forward to this innovation. We would not like to see it left incomplete in view of the date of the Senate election. </para>

He said that I was out of order. I do not know what right he has to say that I am out of order.I say with the greatest of respect that you have all the right in the world to say that I am out of order or that I am in order. But I will not take a statement that I am out Of order from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, however much I may like him personally.

I tabled the latest annual report of the Tariff Board in the Senate some weeks ago and it is now a document of the Senate.

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation: What redress has the purchaser of an airline ticket who, before purchasing the ticket, studies the airline's printed time table - in this case dated 17th September 1970 - which shows the time of the flight together with the type of aircraft to be used, and satisfies himself that he will be able to keep an appointment he has made provided the aircraft leaves at the scheduled time and is of the type shown on the printed time table, but subsequently finds that a different type of aircraft is to be used? </para>

          <para>The purchaser of a ticket is not usually informed of any change of aircraft when he produces his ticket for seat allocation as this is done when he is called to board the aircraft.

Will the Minister request Trans Australia Airlines to follow its printed timetable, or at least ask TAA to use a little business acumen and inform intending travellers of changes in the types of aircraft when passengers present their tickets for seat allocation so that appointments could be changed, possibly by telephone? Does the Minister consider that the monopoly given to TAA and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd for interstate air travel permits both airlines to give less consideration to passengers than they would if a third airline were permitted to have access to interstate routes? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator's question is a long one. He asked what redress a passenger has if his flight is altered and he is not advised prior to boarding the aircraft. I have often heard it said - I recommend this to intending passengers - that people should read the great quantity of fine print that is on the back of each ticket issued by the airlines. From time to time this is worthy of study. The honourable senator made some remarks about Trans-Australia Airlines and snide business behaviour. I take exception to those remarks. I do not think that could fairly be said about TAA. I think it is a good airline and it is doing its best. The honourable senator asked whether the introduction of a third airline would mean that everybody would be a great deal better off. The honourable senator is entitled to express that view. My view is that the introduction of a third airline would send all three broke. If the honourable senator has specific details of a complaint, either on his own behalf or on behalf of his friends, and if he directs the complaint to me I will take it up with the airline concerned. </para>

The Minister for Health has informed me that the conclusions and recommendations of the Senate select committees on air and water pollution were partly the reason for his convening the inter-departmental conference on the environment. These conclusions and recommendations have been noted by both the conference and the working party in the course of their deliberations. The honourable senator also asked me, as I recall his question, which departments were represented at the conference. They were: Education and Science, Externa] Affairs, Civil Aviation, Health, Interior, Primary Industry, Labour and National Service, National Development, Shipping and Transport, Supply and the Prime Minister's Department. The National Capital Development Commission and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation were also represented. </para>

          <para>The conference held its inaugural meeting under the chairmanship of the Director-General of Health on 16th July 1970. At this meeting the establishment of an inter-departmental working party was resolved and the terms of reference of the working party were to inquire into and advise the conference on the most appropriate methods of approach for the national resolution of the problems of the Australian environment. A report on the formulation of a Commonwealth and national policy on the environment has been prepared by the working party and will be considered by the conference when it reconvenes on 1st October, which is today. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Bearing in mind that a direct confrontation between the Commonwealth and Victoria cannot benefit the Commonwealth,  that State or the Australian people., will the Government seek an immediate conference with State Premiers to discuss and resolve the the issues raised by the refusal of the Victorian Government on legal .and. constitutional grounds, to pay pay-roll tax and also to examine the problems of ownership of coastal mineral and other deposits? </para>

              <para>- Docs the honourable senator want me to answer the question? As I have informed the Senate previously, technical and scientific officers of the Department of Defence and the Department of Air, are monitoring both in the United States of America and in Australia the testing programme of this aircraft. I would like to remind .the Senate and the honourable senator who asked the question that when the Fraser mission visited the United States in April the United States Secretary of Defence agreed to meet the specified operational and technical requirements which we believe are necessary if this aircraft is to perform a strike role in the Royal Australian Air Force. The structural integrity programme of the aircraft has not been completed so far to the satisfaction of these assurances, despite what the honourable senator said. In addition, it was agreed that the 24 F111C aircraft which Australia was getting would not be accepted until they had. been processed through a modification programme which it was planned would commence in luly 1972. Honourable senators will recall that on previous occasions I have referred to the wing carry through box. It is to be replaced in this modification programme. These aircraft are therefore unacceptable to the RAAF at present. </para>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a statement in the 'Australian' of today's date attributed to United States Senate Republican Leader Scott that the present Administration has been eminently successful in winding down the war in Vietnam and in assuring the American  people that America's involvement in this tragic venture is quickly coming to an end, as well as his prediction that a major favourable announcement will be made by  President  Nixon in the next few weeks? Is there some responsible person in Australia to tell the people of Australia that Australia's involvement in this tragic venture is quickly coming to an end? </para>

            <para>- Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate recall my raising in this place on a previous occasion the matter of the various kinds of financial assistance which are given by some overseas governments to contractors to allow those contractors to gain orders for the supply of equipment in Australia? Is the Government concerned that in some instances, whilst contract quotations offered by local and overseas suppliers may at first inspection appear to be competitive, the advantages offered by some overseas suppliers when backed financially by their governments allow the offer of holidays from repayment, deferment of the incidence of interest and extremely long terms for repayment? Can the Minister indicate whether such financial facilities are available in Australia for Australian based manufacturers? Does the Government intend to take any action in this important matter, or is it confident that existing private financial facilities or those of existing government instrumentalities are adequate for the needs of Australian manufacturers? </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONThe honourable senator's question is based on what could be a changing situation from contract to contract and from country to country, with various complexities as to what assistance other countries might give in the promotion of their export industries as compared with the assistance given by the Australian Government. Quite obviously it would be necessary to study each case individually in order to give an intelligent answer to the question. I think it is sufficient for me to say that in more recent times, as the honourable senator knows and as the Senate as a whole will be aware, Australia has moved into the area of giving special assistance to Australian industries to enable them to compete in export markets. Various governments provide assistance in different ways. These are early days in relation to this issue. But this is certainly not a situation in respect of which one could stand up at question time and, without notice, give a full exposition on the subject. There will be an opportunity for the honourable senator in the debates that are to come, particularly in the debate on the Estimates, to raise this matter and to get a considered reply to his question. The honourable senator should not despair. Australia does give significant help to its export industries. Whether that assistance compares less favourably or more favourably with assistance given by other countries is a matter of detail on which I would have to get a considered reply for the honourable senator. </para>

My own Department has issued a tentative home building code which has been sent to ali the States and all interested people. We have asked for comments from those who have received this code because we believe it is very important, particularly with respect to the cost of houses. I am aware from conversations which I have had concerning this matter that there are considerable differences in costings which this code could affect. 1 have not yet been informed of all the comments that have come in. This matter is under very keen consideration by my Department. We await the comments that will come from those who have received the code. Then further consideration will be given to it. </para>

              <para>- lt is true, as the Leader of the Opposition says, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roland</inline> Wilson did make a statement in which I understand there was some reference to the classic question of interest rates, f think one would need to look at the statement in its complete context before one could draw the conclusions that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to draw from it. The whole question of interest rates is a matter of Government policy. A whole series of economists would argue on the principle of higher interest rates or the principle of lower interest rates. History has shown that when faced with an economic crisis the Labor Government in the United Kingdom, attempted to abate the problems of the economy by manipulation of the interest rate. </para>

          <para>I believe the moving of the interest rate is not a matter in relation to which arbitrary conclusions can be drawn, as the honourable senator has chosen to do. I do not challenge his right to do it; I challenge his judgment and the comments he has made in relation to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roland</inline> Wilson. The fixing of interest rates is a matter of Government policy as it relates to the well being of the people of Australia. </para>

Because the amplifiers do not meet the specifications of the Australian Army they are presently stored in the United States Army Stores Depot. Can the equipment be modified to meet Army requirements? If so, why have the amplifiers been in the stores for over 12 months? Who is responsible for this situation? Does it result: from incorrect specifications being set down by Australian purchasing bodies, or from faulty manufacture in the United States? </para>

          <para>It is my understanding that in the Northern Territory rural land made available for leasing or for closer settlement is usually in an area where land surveys have been carried out by the Division of Land Research of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. In areas having closer settlement potential, the Primary Industries Branch of the Northern Territory administration carries out additional thorough soil surveys before blocks are designed. Plans for closer settlement go before the Northern Territory Agricultural Development Advisory Committee for consideration prior to release. Both the C.S.I.R.O. and the Northern Territory Administration have representatives on the Committee. </para>
          <para>I am informed that it is usual practice for detailed soil studies in any area to be made by the State or Territory authority concerned rather than by C.S.I.R.O. Should C.S.I.R.O. be approached by a Government authority or Department to assist in land evaluation, it would be prepared to consider what assistance it might be able to give. </para>

              <para>Is it a fact that because of the Government's current shipbuilding and shipping policy, the Queensland shipyard at Evans Deakin and Co.

              <para>Has the Minister instructed the Australian Shipbuilding Board to restrict R. W. Miller and Co.

              <para>Is it a fact that Broken Hill Pty Ltd are at present building a 62,000 ton deadweight crude oil tanker for R. W. Miller and Co. Pty Ltd, and that great economies can be effected in the building of the second tanker which will be a sistership; if so, does this mean that unless the Minister allows Millers to call tenders as originally requested- for three tankers from the same plans and specifications- it is almost impossiblefor Evans Deakin to lender competitively. </para>

              <para>Did the Minister withhold the calling of tenders on behalf of Millers to allow Caltex Oil Australia Ply Ltd to build ahead of them; if so, (a) was the reason due to a concern for overtonnage, (b) docs over-tonnage only react against Millers, as it did in 1966 when the overseas oil companies achieved their objective of over- tonnaging Millers partly off the coast because the refinery companies insisted on employing their own tankers, (c) did this mean that Millers were left without cargoes to the extent that they were compelled to sell overseas the first Australian-flag tanker, namely Millers Canopus, at scrap value and that the remaining two tankers were only able to obtain 60 per cent employment, (d) was the over-tonnage mentioned above caused by the Departments acceptance of the refinery companies' assessment of coastal tanker requirements being 11 as against Millers' of 9 efficiently employed, and was Millers' assessment proved to be correct. </para>

              <para>Will the Minister give an undertaking that his Department will not accept the assessment given by overseas-owned refinery companies and does he not agree that to accept their assessment would again enable them to over-tonnage the coast and force Millers, which is independently operated to be over-tonnagedoff the coast which would, in turn, mean that the Government would subsidise useless tonnage. </para>

              <para>Since the Minister has agreed to Millers having 2 large crude oil tankers built and to Ampol Petroleum Ltd employing 1 large Australian built tanker, would it not be in the best interests of all concerned to allow Millers and Ampol, the 2 Australian companies, to operate between them the number of Australian built tankers required, say a total of 5, for at least a period of 10 years. </para>

            <para>Studies made in 1969 suggested that nuclear power could be an important and economical supplement to our other sources of power in the late 1970s and thereafter, lt is known that the cost of energy from the Jervis Bay Plant in the initial stages of its production will be above the costs of the new large conventional stations operating in New South Wales. The economics of the project however are not the major criteria. The Government wishes Australia to obtain experience in ordering, commissioning and operating nuclear power stations and also wishes to assist in establishing a nuclear industry so that Australia will be in a favourable position to adopt fast breeder reactors when they become commercially available. </para>
            <para>The Minister for National Development recently undertook in another place to provide a full and detailed statement when the choice is made for the Jervis Bay project. The statement amongst other things will provide estimates of costs of production of electricity from the nuclear stations and conventional stations. </para>
