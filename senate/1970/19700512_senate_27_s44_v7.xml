            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Have representatives of Tasmanian Newsagents Pty Ltd approached the Postmaster-General requesting him to give favourable consideration to granting a 21/2% commission on the sale of postage stamps? Is the Minister aware that stamps are sold by newsagencies at no profit whatsoever to the retailer? Is the Minister aware that the practice of selling stamps by news-agents is becoming more and more popular with the public? Is the Postmaster-General aware that in line with Government policy numerous small post offices are closing down and consequently the sale of postage stamps to the public through other outlets is becoming more necessary? If the Minister agrees with the request for the21/2% commission by Tasmanian Newsagents Pty Ltd, will he advise the secretary of that organisation forthwith? </para>

            <para>-  lt will be remembered that last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked this question and I had an interest in it myself. 1 have endeavoured to obtain some information for the honourable senator which I hope will answer his present scries of questions. L assume that the honourable senator is referring to the prosecution of David Charles Hannagan, Peter Oxford and Philipe Dor. The fines imposed were as follows: Oxford, $600; Hannagan, $100; Dor, $900. Oxford was given by the court 6 months to pay the fine and no payment has been made to this date. Hannagan was allowed 3 months to pay and has so far deposited $30. Dor was dealt with only yesterday, 1 1th May, and was given 2 weeks to pay the fine. No payment has been made to date. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Dors visa has not been terminated. However, his permit to stay in Australia has now expired and he is legally a prohibited immigrant. Australia has not, at diplomatic level, sought the co-operation of the appropriate authorities in Holland in relation to the illegal export of Australian birds to that country. The difficulty in this area is that concerted action by overseas governments and police is possible only if the country concerned has legislation prohibiting the import of Australian fauna. 1 am advised that no such legislation exists in Holland, other than for the exclusion of domestic fowls. However the Department of Customs and Excise maintains close liaison with Dutch customs authorities on this subject and assistance on this basis is often forthcoming. That is all the information that I have available to me at the present time, but if the honourable senator requires more information perhaps we could have a discussion or I could write a letter to the authorities and see if I can get any more information for him. </para>

            <para>- The question asked by the honourable senator is most appropriate because members of the ELDO council were in Australia last week and in fact visited Parliament House. J had an opportunity to talk to the  President  and to the Secretary-General of the Organisation. Some time ago I informed the Senate of the transfer from the Woomera Range to French Guiana of the ELDO projects because of geographical factors and the intention to have equatorial firings as distinct from the type of firings we have had from the Woomera establishment. I have also indicated in the Senate in response to questions without notice or by written reply that with the current firing the ELDO programmes at Woomera will cease. It is expected that that firing will take place some time in June or early July. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Certain negotiations are currently going on with the ELDO establishments in relation to Australia's acquiring the properties in the Woomera establishment. Further, because of the other activities in the Woomera complex, or close by the Woomera complex, certain of the establishments will be used and it may well be that this will help the employment situation. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator asked whether it is our intention to remain as a member of ELDO. Yes, it is our intention to remain as a member of ELDO and of ESRO - the European Space Research Organisation - because we believe that Australia in its other activities, for instance, in its joint project, its National Aeronautics and Space Administration establishments and in its other undertakings, has a very real capability and real technical know-how in the field of outer space and in the matter of firings and the steps that may be taken in the various sciences as a result of the firings. I do not think the honourable senator raised any other point. </para>

              <para>- That matter will arise but it must bc recognised that some of the staff of ELDO, a project which involves a number of other nations, are technical people who have come to Australia for the purpose of the ELDO firings. Apart from that, I believe that we have some know-how and some capability. As to the other point the honourable senator raised, at our conference last week I mentioned this very issue as to whether, apart altogether from the direct firing there could not be some function, some role, or some purpose for Australia in relation to which our Woomera Range could be used. This is just another reason why we are remaining in the ELDO programme. We think we have the potential. </para>

            <para>- I presume that the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry is aware that the United States of America has put a ban on the import of mutton from Australia. Would the Minister agree that Australian standards of hygiene in the killing and processing of mutton for export are very high and equal to world standards, and have proved to be so in the past? If so, is the United Slates ban on the acceptance of further consignments of Australian mutton really a method of imposing a quota on Australian imports of mutton? </para>

            <para>- I would agree that Australia's standards of hygiene are probably the highest in the world. In regard to the latter part of the honourable senators question, I made some inquiries from the Department of Primary Industry this morning and was informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> was told by the United States Secretary for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hardoin</inline> that there was deep concern at the high rejection rate of Australian mutton. Almost 1,000,000 lb had been rejected in the middle of April indicating that much of the mutton shipped by Australia was not meeting United States standards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hardoin</inline> said that there was severe criticism by Congress and the Senate and warned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> that it would probably be necessary for him to take some action. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> sent the Secretary of his Department to Washington to confer on the problem. The Secretary subsequently reported that it was inevitable that there would be a decision to place a temporary ban on the import of mutton from Australia until the general standards of hygiene and of mutton inspection in Australia came up to the United States standards. This announcement was made yesterday in Washington. The United States decision is that mutton produced in Australian meatworks after 15th May will not be eligible for export to America. Mutton packed before 15th May will not be affected. This restriction will remain in effect until the United States authorities are satisfied that Australian procedures comply with American standards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> has convened a meeting of the Meat Industry Advisory Committee in Canberra this Thursday to discuss the whole position. </para>

Because of the request by the Australia-United KingdomEurope Shipping Conference for a <inline font-style="italic">7i%</inline> increase in the rate of freight, which seems to contradict the assurance given to the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes that freight rates would be held following the introduction of containerised cargoes, is the Minister aware of the concern being expressed by  some members of the Australia to Europe Shippers Association about whom the Commonwealth Government is supporting when it represents shipowners and shippers' interests? </para>

            <para>- I think I should say in answer to that question, which will have to be directed in its generality to the department concerned, that J share with the honourable senator his concern at any prospect of an increase in shipping freight rates for Australian exports, more particularly in this instance the ones to which he referred - from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe. I am not as aware of the concern expressed as he obviously is, but I will direct to the Minister his question and his concern and ask that inquiries be made and that a considered reply be given to him, representing as he does a body of opinion in the primary industries which will have concern about his matter, as 1 myself do. </para>

              <para>- 1 answered a lot of questions about the Moratorium last Thursday and I am quite willing to answer a lot of questions about it today. But I am not prepared to answer interjections while answering questions, lt is an old gag to ask questions and then to muddy the waters by interjections so that the answers cannot be given. I believe that if anything came out of the Moratorium as far as this Parliament is concerned, it is the fact that supporters of the Government drew attention to the responsibility for peaceful conduct by the people involved in it. I well recall that I was one of those people who contributed to an appeal to everybody taking part in the demonstrations to conduct their dissent in an orderly fashion. What is more to the point, 1 think I was invited to do so by an honourable senator opposite and I readily responded and made the appeal that anybody who chose to dissent should do so within the framework of the law. </para>

I now ask again, on 12th May, whether the Minister for Health will call a meeting of State Ministers for Health with a view to conducting u thorough examination of the critical situation in the nursing profession.

              <para>- 1 am very sure that the Federal Minister for Health and State Ministers for Health are concerned about any problems arising in the nursing field. However, I do not think I would suggest at the moment to the Federal Minister for Health that he call a meeting of State Ministers because he is in regular conference with those Ministers on matters pertaining to their departments. I will place the honourable senator's question before the Minister and if any further information is available in reply to it T will get that information for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- This is a fairly wide question but nevertheless is a very important one. I think it should be recognised in the first place that Australia provides a tremendous amount, in proportion to its population and size, in the fields of research and development in technology, both in outer space and in deep space communications. The fact that the ELDO programme is coming to a conclusion in Australia has been foreseen for considerable time and, as I have said, it is due to the fact that the ELDO nations wish to do their launching on a equatorial basis. We are not geographically placed to enable launchings to be made from Australia. That is one of the prime reasons for the move to French Guiana. The proposed move is not associated with Australia's development in the sciences or technology of outer space, nor with the applications that stem from it in the navigational or meteorological areas. No matter what 'ology' is named, it comes within the study of these things. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are involved, for instance, in project Mallard' with other nations involving a communications system for the defence forces. We are involved with the United Nations in joint programmes involving a whole series of studies. In addition there are various studies going on at Woomera and at Salisbury, which is a back-up establishment for Woomera. We are involved probably more than any other country in the NASA programme, which is a long term programme which will continue. Talking about going to the moon is one thing, but comparatively that journey is quite insignificant in terms of deep space. The moon is 240,000 miles away, but there is talk of getting out 30 million miles and having transit stations along the way. Question lime is hardly the appropriate time for me to give a deep studied answer to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, lt is sufficient to say that in the short run our continued role in this field is assured. However. I would like to spread my answer and give a considered reply in depth for the advantage of honourable senators and indeed for Australia at large so that all may know just what a significant part we are playing. We have in Australia a great deal of technical know-how and are developing defence know-how and this particular role will continue. </para>

            <para>- I think the first thing to say is that the Prime Minister went to Japan at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Japan to visit Expo 70. While he was there he had an audience with the Emperor, which was the prime purpose of his visit and which was an historical event. There was no secret about it. I believe it was a very successful visit by our Prime Minister to Japan. It is true that the Minister foi- Primary Industry visited Japan where he had discussions on a variety of matters. It is equally true that he visited Canada where he had discussions on matters concerning his portfolio. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that the honourable senator has been reading too much of the rumour columns in the Press. I really do not think that the honourable senator should start drawing conclusions about the relationship of one nation with another on matters of trade which are a result of visits of the importance of those of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry. These things do not work that way. Questions of trade are of tremendous importance. They are matters to be discussed in depth. Many Government officials are present at these discussions and reports emanate from them. As to the honourable senator's reference to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry having the wool pulled over their eyes, f suggest that the honourable senator needs to be careful that the wool is not pulled over his eyes. </para>

I cannot inform the Senate at this stage when the airports mentioned by the honourable senator will receive consideration for the installation of air-conditioning facilities, but I will endeavour to find out the programme that is proposed for this work, and any other relevant facts, and let the honourable senator have them. </para>

              <para>- We have some Communist intervention. I. will repeat my question, ls it a fact that during the recent Moratorium day march members of the Australian public and of certain political parties were seen proudly carrying and marching under the Vietcong or North Vietnamese flags? How does the Government view such action? Does the Government consider this action to be insignificant? How docs the Government salve its conscious when it introduces laws which require its citizens to fight and possibly to die in battle against the forces of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese and yet takes no action to rid the community of such subversive activity as I have mentioned? </para>

            <para>-  I want to assure the honourable senator and the Senate that I did not witness the procession or marches on Moratorium day at all. I can rely only on what happened outside Parliament House in Canberra, from a very limited observation, and on what was shown on television. I do not think there would be any dispute that Vietcong and North Vietnamese flags were in evidence at various marches. Therefore, anybody who chose to march must have accepted that Vietcong and North Vietnamese flags were part of the march. Why such people choose to march and to march with an awareness of the state in which the world is today, with Australian troops in Vietnam, always has bewildered me. I am sure it has completely bewildered hundreds of thousands - the vast majority of Australian people - who find such action completely incompatible with their sense of the rightness of things. 1 am not here to answer questions on morality or to give judgments on the morality of human beings. I know where my loyalties lie. I know where the loyalties of the great mass of the Australian people lie. If people choose to act in complete conflict with those loyalties, that is their responsibility. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks whether I am aware of the consequences of the loss of our mutton export market in terms of the unemployment which may result. 1 am not aware of the precise figures, but I do not challenge the figures which the honourable senator has given. I would agree that it is a serious matter. Any loss of employment is a very serious matter. It is bad to have a large number of people unemployed. It is equally grave to lose an export market because Australia is a country which relies on its primary production. Despite our tremendous development in the mineral field we are still very dependent on our export markets for our primary products for our security, progress and development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it is axiomatic that the Australian Government - particularly the Minister for Trade and Industry - will be making every effort to ensure that, if possible, Australia maintains its share of the market. 1 accept the honourable senator's question. I shall refer it to the Minister for Trade and Industry. However, I am quite convinced that he will be already doing everything within his capacity and the capacity of the Government to try to preserve our export market in this field. </para>

            <para>-  I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. 1 refer to the very strict conditions which are applied in regard to the type of cattle suitable for the meat trade in the United States of America. Does the Minister not consider that the existing State laws in New South Wales, notably the tick regulations, are applied in a discriminatory manner against the meat works of F. J. Walker Pty Ltd at Byron Bay? Is it not a fact that meat works in the northern part of New South Wales, notably Tenterfield, are given greater flexibility in the procuring of cattle from across the Queensland border? ls it not also a fact that if these regulations were applied more consistently the work force at Walker's meat works at Byron Bay would have more stable employment? </para>

            <para>- Some time ago the honourable senator indicated to me his interest in this matter. I have obtained the following information: Because of the incidence of tick fever in cattle in Queensland, the New South Wales Government does not permit Queensland cattle to enter the tick quarantine area of New South Wales. The only exception is pedigree cattle which have originated in tick free areas of Queensland and which have undergone tests to ensure that they are not carrying tick fever organisms. Byron Bay is in the tick quarantine area whereas Tenterfield is not. Cattle carrying tick fever organisms which enter areas outside the New South Wales tick quarantine area in a tick free condition cannot transmit the disease in that area. However, if the cattle picked up ticks in a tick quarantine area these ticks could become infected and their progeny could transmit tick fever. As the restrictions imposed by New South Wales are intended to prevent the introduction of tick fever into the tick quarantine area there would appear to be no basis on which the Commonwealth could intercede. </para>

            <para>- -My question, which also concerns a health matter, is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. Does the Minister agree that the illegal import and export of birds is a social crime and is potentially extremely dangerous to health and commerce? Does he agree that this racket has been going on for years and that it is highly organised, with principals and couriers? Does he agree that so far only the couriers, the little people involved, have been caught? As the Department of Customs and Excise seems to be wholly incapable of stamping out this practice, will the Minister suggest to the Minister for Customs and Excise that he should enlist the aid of the Commonwealth Police Force so that the principals can be located and the racket smashed? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has directed 4 questions to me in my capacity as representative of the Minister for Customs and Excise. The first three are of the 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' type of question. I do not propose to answer those except to say that I share the concern of all members of the Australian community about any method by which disease might be brought into the country. To my recollection no cases have been brought to attention of birds being imported - that is feathered birds. </para>

I shall certainly direct the suggestion contained in the honourable senator's last question to the Minister for Customs and Excise and suggest that every endeavour be made to stamp out this practice. If it is true that there arc people involved who have not been caught 1 will suggest that every effort be made to catch them. I cannot go further than that at this stage. </para>

              <para>The income tax legislation provides that the assessable income of a taxpayer shall include the value to him of all benefits, including the use of premises or quarters, given or granted in rela-tion to any employment or services rendered by him. The provision applies uniformly throughout Australia. The amount to be included in assessable income is based on the rental value of the premises less the amount, if any, the employee is required to pay. The rental value of any particular premises is a question of fact to bc decided in the light of local conditions. In practice the value to the taxpayer of premises provided is calculated on a conservative basis and appropriate reductions arc made where the premises are substandard or there are . other factors which would have a bearing on the normal rental value. </para>

              <para>There is no indication that rural workers are being taxed on unreal rental values of premises provided. If a taxpayer considers that the value placed on the premises is excessive, a review will be made by the Commission of Taxation if full details are furnished. The question of exempting rural workers from tax on the value of premises provided would involve far reaching consequences if employees in other industries continued to be taxed on similar benefits. However, arrangements have been made for the matter to receive further consideration when the .1970-71 Budget is being prepared. </para>

The Minister has now informed me that he has received representations from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures concerning the erection of flats for the housing of newly arrived migrants in Geelong. This question has been and is currently under examination and the Chambers representations arc being fully considered. lt is expected that a decision will be made shortly. </para>

            <para>- On 9th April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> asked me a question without notice concerning the exemption of certain rural producers from the recent increase in trading bank lending rates. In particular, he asked whether there is likely to be any resistance by banking institutions lo the lending of money to the primary industry sector. I indicated that I would refer the matter to the Treasurer. The Treasurer has now provided me with the following information: lt has been a long-standing policy of the Government that the trading banks should give preferential treatment to rural producers, both in regard to the availability of finance and the interest rale charged. This policy is well understood by the trading banks which have given the Reserve Bank of Australia frequent assurances that the traditional preference is being maintained. </para>

            <para>- On 8th April 1970 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> asked me the following question: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <para>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report published1 by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations which slates, amongst other things, that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is seeking to impose selfcensorship on the evening news programmes of commercial television stations and that commercial television stations have raised strong objections thereto. Does the Government condone censorship by any Government instrumentality or by a'ny commercial television station of any news programmes? If so, what types of news censorship does it condone Will the Government advise the Broadcasting Control Board that Australian citizens are entitled to be fully and widely informed on all aspects of international a'nd national events and that it has no right to impose its form of censorship on any news programme? </para>
        <para class="block">The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply: </para>
        <para>My attention was drawn to a report by the General Manager of FACTS and I sought information from the.  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. He has advised me as follows: </para>
        <para>The Board's Television Programme Standards contain certain provisions regarding the televising of programmes between 4.30 <inline font-style="italic">p.m.</inline> and 7.30 p.m. - these require the exercise of special care and discretion to ensure that material televised during this period is not unsuitable for young viewers. These provisions have been in the Standards since they were first drawn up in 1956, and are similar to those in the Code of National Association of Broadcasters in the United States, and to the policy of the Independent Television Authority as expressed by Lord Hill, the former  Chairman  of the Authority, which regulates the programmes of commercial television stations in the United Kingdom. </para>
        <para>In the course of a revision of the Standards, prior to reprinting, the Board decided not only to print the caution, as at present, in the section relating to family and children's programmes, but to repeat it in the special section of the Standards dealing with news. The matter is, then, an application of long-established principles in the Board's Television Programme Standards and it is also consistent with rulings by the Board over a considerable period. For example, in its 18th Annual Report, for the year ended June 30th, 1966, the Board' said, "There is no wish to restrict the presentation of important news items, but the Board has stressed the importance of discretion in the selection of illustrations, particularly during news programmes which occur at times whe'n the audience may be expected to include large numbers of children and young people". It is quite incorrect to construe the matter as involving censorship and it is therefore not necessary to reply to the other parts of the Honourable Senator's question.' </para>

              <para>The income lux law provides that the assessable income of  a  taxpayer shall include profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any property acquired by him for the purpose of profit making by sale. There is also a complementary provision which allows deductions for losses sustained in similar circumstances. The question to be decided in each case depends upon the particular facts and any taxpayer who has  any  doubt as to his position is advised to submit full details to the Commissioner of Taxation. Assessments on such profits are issued only after the matter has been thoroughly examined at a senior level within the Commonwealth Taxation Office and, in the event of a dispute arising, the taxpayer may have the matter reviewed by an independent tribunal. </para>

              <para>The possibility of taxing such profits on an arbitrary rule based on the length of time the property is held has been considered but it has been found on examination that the proposal raises complex issues and could, in certain circumstances, produce anomalies. Nevertheless, the question of amending the law along these lines will receive further consideration. </para>

              <para>and (2) Variations in the per capita cost of providing homes for aged persons, as shown in the monthly publication of grants, may be due to a number of factors. For example, lower costs may be achieved by: a favourable tendering climate; intelligent use of lowercost materials; more modest local government requirements in some areas; sharing of some facilities; and the absence of a land component where a project comprises extensions to an existing home. </para>
            </item>

          <para>Higher cost levels, on the other hand, may be due to such factors as: an unfavourable tendering climate at the time; a high land component; construction of larger units suitable for either single people or married couples; use of superior materials and finishes; scarcity of materials, or high transport costs, in some areas. </para>
          <para>In many cases combinations of the abovementioned factors compensate for each other and most organisations are found to be able to provide accommodation within the upper cost limits imposed for subsidy purposes, which at present are $6,600 for a single unit and $9,000 for a double unit. </para>
          <para>It is not considered necessary or desirable to enforce a uniform standard of accommodation, but where the costperhead exceeds the aforementioned figures, the excess cost must be borne entirely by the organisation. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary authority for additional expenditure in 1969-70 amounting to $34,087,000 on various items relating to capital works and services, payments to or for the States and certain other services. Although additional appropriations of $25. 8m are sought for capital works and services it is expected that because of savings of about $8. 6m in other similar appropriations in Appropriation Act (No. 2) of 1969-70, the cash requirement over the Budget estimate of $536.7m will be about $17.2m. The major requirements are $2m for a repayable advance to the Papua and New Guinea Administration for construction of the township at Arawa in connection with the Bougainville copper project, $3m advance to the Papua and New Guinea Administration for Budget equalisation purposes, $1.6m for acquisition of sites and buildings, $1.4m for loans to co-operative building societies in the Australian Capital Territory, $3.9m advance to the Northern Territory Housing Commission which will be offset to the extent of about $3.4m because of savings in a similar appropriation,$1.1m for the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power project, $4m for payment to the Post Office Trust Account and $5m for buildings and works. </para>
          <para>Additional appropriations of$8.1m are sought for payments to or for the States, including $7m for drought assistance to Queensland. It is expected that there will be savings of about $0.6m in other similar appropriations in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1969-70. The additional appropriations sought for other services amount to $212,000 which includes a grant of $150,000 to the South Pacific Games (1969) Trust. As I have said this Bill seeks additional appropriations of $34,087,000. However because of savings in expenditure under other appropriations in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1969-70, it is expected that the total expenditure will exceed the amount appropriated in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1969-70 by about $24.9m. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>-I do not apologise for using this unusual method to introduce a subject because it is rather urgent and rather important. It is a matter which is causing a considerable amount of anxiety among the whole medical profession. [ am not referring to the National Health Bill but to a drug called Intal'. This is a new drug for the prevention of asthma in young people and also to help those who have already been on corticosteroid but who are now getting worse. It is an expensive drug. On two or three occasions when I have asked whether any drug has been taken off the list because of cost the Department of Health has said no. It is expensive and costs $9.50. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Those honourable senators who have witnessed a patient suffering from asthma will realise what a distressing condition it is and the distress that it causes parents. They would agree that any charge for a drug that can prevent or relieve asthma is well worth while. Apart from the fact that it has been said that if we allowed Intal to be a free drug our health bill would go up by millions, nevertheless I point out that fewer people suffer from asthma than the number suffering from hypertension. The drugs for hypertension can cost anything up to $10.27 for 100 tablets, whereas the 50 spine-caps for Intal required cost $9.50 only. So there is a drug already available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is dearer and which is used more frequently than Intal. </para>
          <para>I know that this matter is difficult for honourable senators to understand, so 1 shall have to ask the Senate to excuse me if I explain that there are 3 types of drugs available under our pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Firstly there are the general benefit drugs which any doctor can prescribe if they are listed in the little holy bible that the Department of Health issues to us. If a drug is listed there we can order it for any condition we like. Then there are certain drugs called 'specified purpose' drugs which are to be used by doctors for specified purposes only. In prescribing those drugs a doctor has to put the magical letters 'SP' after them on a prescription to show the Government that he has thought about prescribing the drug and that he, as a conscientious doctor, believes that this drug is the one suitable for this specified purpose. </para>

              <para>- Specified purpose. Then there is the group of drugs which requires a special authority, that is, drugs for which, if one wants to use them, one must obtain the consent of the Department of Health through its director in the State in which one is practising. Many of us do not believe that there should be even these 3 categories because the drug which the doctor believes is the one to be used in the best interests of the patient is the drug that he should order irrespective of what the Department of Health thinks. We have heard so much ranting and raving about the National Health Bill and the fact that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> has only the welfare of the patient in mind, but we do not hear from anybody that the Minister will do nothing about the Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee and its actions and that he will do nothing to try to help the very patients about whom he talks so glibly. The Minister says that he proposes to help these people under a Bill which in fact does nothing to help them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Doctors throughout Australia are very indignant about this matter because a ludicrous position arises regarding the 3 categories of drugs. For the last few years, if a doctor wanted to order cortisone, he found that it was not a general benefit drug, it was not a specified purpose drug, but that it was a special authority drug. Suddenly today it is a general benefit drug. There is no rhyme or reason for this. The same comment applies to a drug called tetracycline. There are more people suffering from infectious diseases which require the use of tetracycline than there are people suffering from asthma. Tetracycline has always been on what is called the specified purposes list; that is, doctors use the magical symbols 'SP' when prescribing it. But even the Department of Health has realised the futility of using this symbol because today, after saying for so many years that we had to use the drug for specified purposes, the Department now says that we do not need to do so. In fact, we can use the drug for any purpose that we think fit. </para>
          <para>The whole crux of the matter is that it is the doctor who knows what is in the best interests of the patient, not the Department of Health. I blame every honourable senator in this chamber for allowing bureaucracy to rise to such power that we cannot get drugs without having to fill out a form which consists of 4 pages and which requires all details concerning the patient. It would take longer to fill in the form that it would to examine and treat the patient. Having filled in the form, the doctor then sends it down to the doctor who represents the Director-General of Health in the State in which the doctor is living, and then this doctor sitting in his office, in Hobart in my case, or in Sydney in other cases, decides what drug that patient, whom he has never seen or examined, should receive. He decides whether the doctor who filled in the form has the right to treat his patient with Intal or not. Can anything be more absurd? Would any honourable senator agree to that if one of their children was affected? I know that every honourable senator would say no, he would not agree with it, but honourable senators allow this situation to continue. </para>
          <para>Intal is only 1 drug. J have got up in this chamber on many occasions and criticised the Department of Health's method of the control of drugs. Here we have an officer of the Department who is not even a specialist officer. In fact, probably he has less knowledge than the general practitioner who sent in the request. Many officers in the Department of Health are drop-outs from general practice. They have reached a certain level of incompetence. I am not saying that of all officers in the Department. </para>

              <para>-  I am coming on to this. I have said that the only person who should decide whether a drug should be used or not is the general practitioner or the specialist concerned with the case. If the Government wants to provide for the use of the drug for a specific purpose, noone would quibble with that because the Government sets out in its holy bible of pharmaceutical benefits the 2 ways in which the drug can be used. If the drug was made a special purposes item instead of a special authority item, no-one would grumble about that; it would be a fair thing. </para>

          <para>This has only just happened. I know of only I case in which a patient was referred to a specialist and that specialist, after having gone into the whole history of the patient and having examined the patient, decided that Intal should be used. But what happened? The request came down to- -I will not lose my temper - an unintelligent officer in the Department of Health, sitting in Hobart, who wrote back and said that he disapproved of the use of the drug. Where are we getting to? Time and again we hear Ministers get up in this chamber and say that the Minister for Health is doing his best for the patient. Is the matter to which 1 have referred the best thing for the patient? How many honourable senators agree with the policy? No one of them. I know that if one of their children had asthma and if fatal was the only treatment for it, they would demand it, so why does not the Government allow the use of it? If a doctor wants to use Intal, he has to fill in this form, send it down to Hobart and hope for the best that some nit-wit down there, who has less knowledge than the doctor prescribing the drug, approves of it. </para>
          <para>Why do we go on with this? We allow it to go on and we do nothing about it. We sit on our tails and just allow this thing to go on because we are so apathetic'. This does not affect us, so why worry about it? But it does affect people. It is affecting thousands of people in Australia. A lot of them are young people - children and young teenagers. It also affects many asthmatics in the older age groups. Some honourable senators may become asthmatics, although up to the present time I have not seen such a tendency in them. There are a lot of other diseases that I have noted among them, but asthma is not apparent. No-one in this chamber at the moment suffers from asthma. But if any honourable senator were to suffer from it. would he pat up with this position? Of course he would not. </para>

              <para>have taken up the time of the Senate because I want this anomaly corrected. 1 do not care whether it costs $5ra or $10m. 1 have not got the figures, but I should imagine that it is costing much more to use one of the hypertensive drugs. But that is not the point. If the drug Intal is going to be on the pharmaceutical benefits list, it should be used at the discretion of the doctor who is treating the patient. Nobody else should have any say in it. That is why 1 have raised this matter today. </para>

            <para>- I think it is appropriate, when the Supply Bill is being discussed, to raise a number of subjects that probably need to be exposed to the public gaze. I want to direct my contribution to the plight of Aboriginals in this country. As members of the Government parties would know, I have raised this matter on 2 or 3 occasions during this session. One of the great problems with which we are faced is due to the fact that various States have discrimatory laws against people who are non-white. Probably the laws were not intended that way originally, but that is how they are now operating. The plight of Aboriginals was brought into public focus fairly clearly during the Captain Cook bi-centenary celebrations. In some areas Aboriginals and Aboriginal descendants have refrained from participating in the celebrations because, in their words, Captain Cook brought no wellbeing to their tribes or to their people. In one instance petitions were presented which showed that some 700 tribes had gone out of existence. Regrettably, this is the general picture throughout Australia, but it applies particularly to Queensland and, perhaps with greater emphasis to the far northern areas of that State, to the Northern Territory and to Western Australia. </para>

          <para>I have before me a document which contains the signatures of people from various areas who are appealing against the Queensland Act. Shortly I shall seek leave to have the names of the people incorporated in Hansard. The people who have signed this document come from New Mapoon, Umagic, Bamaga, Cowal Creek, Tamoy Town, Navy Hill, St Pauls, Badu Island, Kubin, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island, Red Island Point, Yorke Island, Darnley Island, Stephen Island, Townsville, Mareeba, Herberton, Kuranda, Bibookra, Brisbane, Cherbourg, Wondai, Rannes and Murgon. I am not sure how many names are incorporated in this document, but obviously they are not set out in the proper petition form. 1 seek leave of the Senate to have the names and addresses of the people who have signed this document incorporated in Hansard. </para>

              <para>- I will not detain the Senate for any great length of time. I hope that the plea of these people who have requested that the Queensland Act be abolished is taken into consideration particularly when the material for the Budget Session is being presented. I realise that money left over from the appropriation for last year amounted to approximately $1,300,000. If application is made for additional money to help the unemployed, for educational grants, or for housing and allied problems, great difficulty in obtaining these grants is experienced. I appeal to the Government, if it is still in power when the </para>

I think that it is very unfair to the honourable senator who had resumed his seat. I suggest that rather than have a donnybrook on this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> should be permitted again to seek leave to incorporate the material in Hansard.

If the occupant of the Chair states erroneously that leave is granted, it is for the person who objects to take objection then and there and, if necessary, to the point of moving a motion of dissent from the ruling. The way the Senate deals with its affairs is that if it is apparent an error has been made it is corrected there and then. Strictly speaking a motion of dissent from the ruling of the Chair is required unless there is general leave to alter the position. If the error is obvious the Senate usually acts upon the matter there and then. </para>

It does not seem right in regard to a matter such as this - the honourable senator concerned having already acted accordingly - that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> should be allowed to wait and then to take advantage of this point. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> had acted earlier <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> would have had other options open to him after leave had been refused to him to have some material incorporated in Hansard. If leave is refused to an honourable senator to have something incorporated in Hansard he is entitled to go ahead and read it. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> would have acted in a different manner from the way in which he acted if leave had been refused. I suggest that in all fairness the leave which was granted to him should not be withdrawn. </para>

              <para>- 1 rise to debate the point of order, in doing so I am not curtailing the debate in any way. We are still debating the motion for the first reading of the Bill. I was not present when this incident occurred. Therefore, I cannot make any judgment on it. But I do accept the fact that had leave been refused to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> he would have been able to continue his speech and read the names that he wanted to record in Hansard. It is equally true that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> had sat down, another  speaker  could have risen and, without leave being granted to incorporate the material in Hansard, read the matter. I am not going to reflect on the ruling of the Chair, I am interested only in getting on with the job. For that reason, I should think that a simple solution would be to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> as in the course of making his speech.

              <para>- I regret that, such a course should be adopted. It is obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is launching an attack and engaging in personalities in view of his defeat last week on the Vietnam Moratorium issue. The government of this country has been held up for 2 weeks while supporters of the Government Parties have pursued a vendetta against the people engaged in the Moratorium. However, because Government supporters did not achieve the results they hoped for - violence in the streets and bloodshed - they are again going to hold up the government of the country. Delaying tactics are being adopted. 1 do not care if the Senate has to sit through July to the Budget session without a recess; I am anxious to see that this country is properly governed. Because of the handicaps which are being placed on the government of the country by, unfortunately, a fairly large number of the Government's supporters and a small number of Ministers the people of Australia are not going to get the democracy to which they are entitled. I feel that I have answered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> objections. Therefore, 1 shall proceed to read the names and addresses of the several hundred people who, like members of the Australian Labor Party and most Australians, seek the justice to which they are entitled.

          <para>- I desire to speak to this motion. Without seeking to be personally offensive, I think it is an impertinence that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> should move a motion and not give any reason why he moves it. I would think that a motion of this character would require some words of explanation or some words of support. I appreciate Ihi circumstances in which this position has come about. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> sought leave to incorporate in Hansard what he described as a list of 500 names of people who supported a petition. I refused leave as is my right as a senator. I refused leave because I believe it is an abuse of Hansard and the procedures of this House to write into Hansard in the form proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> the names of individuals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has various alternatives open to him if he desires to bring before the Senate the names of certain people. He has the right to proceed by way of petition which is the way most honourable senators proceed when they have the names of a great number of people who support a particular proposition, and the presentation of petitions is the first business of the Senate every day during the session. But that was something <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> chose not to do. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If he was unable to present the petition he had the authority when he had documents in front of him with names attached to them to seek leave of the Senate to table them. That is a procedure which I have seen honourable senators avail themselves of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> chose not to do that. He sought leave to incorporate in Hansard the names of people. As part of his speech he had already read out what these people were supporting - the text of the petition. The view which I have taken and which f think ought to commend itself to the Senate is that the addition of names of individuals adds nothing to  a  parliamentary record of debate. It is for that reason that I refused leave. If the Senate  is  concerned about its own procedure and the standing of its records of parliamentary debate I urge honourable senators not to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- Incorporated. As I see the situation, there will be a vote. If the Government resists the motion and wins the vote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> will be entitled to say: That is that. On the other hand, if the Government loses the vote the papers will be incorporated. J therefore think that a vote is a simple and quick way to get a result. </para>

          <para>- in reply - Whatever the rights or wrongs of the matter may be and whatever may be the wisdom of having names incorporated in Hansard, that is all beside the point. It is obvious to everyone that they are going to go in. If they have to be read they will go into the record. I suggest that they be incorporated in the record instead of being read out one by one. That is the common sense thing to do especially in the light of what has happened. </para>

            <para>- I take the opportunity on the motion Ibr the first reading of a money Bill to bring up those questions that are occupying my mind. I regret very much the attempt, ;is we have just seen, to get around the procedures of this Senate by someone exercising a right, which would appear to be a stupid right when the alternative  available to the  speaker  is less painful. A question that is worrying me and which I want to ventilate with a view to some rectification being made is the position <inline font-style="italic">o?</inline> the Australian Government and Australian Government instrumentalities, particularly the Army, in the present war in Vietnam, and the attempt of the Government to defeat any opposition to the war. I wish to refer especially to the question asked today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in which he referred to the pride of walking behind Vietcong flags. My interjection on that occasion was that there was a world wide demonstration against America, not a demonstration against the Vietcong, and that there was greater respect throughout the world today for the Vietcong flag than there was for the American flag. </para>

              <para>- Whether it is despicable or not, it is factual; it is real. When sections of the peace loving public of Australia sought to demonstrate their support for Australia's withdrawal from Vietnam there was an attempt by those in the Government to belittle and to try to discredit the demonstration, as 1 said at the time, by creating an atmosphere of violence in the hope that there would be violence. </para>

          <para>Approximately a month ago a citizen of South Australia, one Mark Posa Secretary of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, got front page publicity in the Adelaide Advertiser' because he claimed that he knew that molotov cocktails were being manufactured in South Australia for use when the violent Moratorium demonstration was to take place. The fact that molotov cocktails are being manufactured in Australia for use in a demonstration must alarm any law enforcement authority. Justifiably, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> asked in the Senate whether an investigation would be held into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Posa's</inline> claim. An investigation was never more needed than an investigation into the claim made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Posa</inline> which, he stated, was based on information in his possession. He said that he knew where the molotov cocktails were being manufactured. Obviously the investigation had to be hurried so that the bombs would not be used last weekend. Either those who were detected making the bombs, as a result of the information tendered by one Mark Posa, should have been brought to trial and prosecuted for unlawfully assembling bombs for use in a demonstration, or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> should have exposed this man who obtained publicity by creating an emotional feeling of fear in relation to the demonstration. </para>
          <para>The Moratorium, the event at which the molotov cocktails were to be used, has come and gone but we have not yet received any information about the investigation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> asked the Attorney-General to make. It would appear that the Government supported the plan to instil fear into the people for the purpose of causing violence during the demonstration to discredit it. Fortunately the demonstration showed that there is tremendous support for those who are opposed to Australia's involvement in Vietnam. </para>

              <para>- It was the biggest demonstration on any political question, but apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> does not know the difference between a political question and a football match. I can assure him that there is a difference. It is only that they appear to be the same by reason of the attitude in this Senate. Nevertheless, this was the biggest demonstration on any political question that Adelaide has ever seen. In Adelaide on Friday night the banners of the Moratorium were torn by people who turned out to be soldiers stationed at Woodside in South Australia who were on leave at the time. Prior to the tearing of the banners a group of the soldiers assembled in the corner bar of the South Australian Hotel opposite Parliament House in Adelaide. The Secretary of the Seamens Union in South Australia and another seaman, both wearing Moratorium badges, joined the group which was drinking at the South Australian Hotel, exchanged beers with them and had quite a cordial conversation. They gathered that the soldiers were from Woodside. The soldiers showed no opposition to those w.ho were wearing Moratorium badges. Suddenly someone put his head inside the door and said: 'Come on boys', and the boys said: There is the sergeant. We have to go now.' </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>After leaving the bar they assembled on the footpath and the sergeant spoke to them. They went across the road to Parliament House and commenced to tear down banners. They became involved wilh others who were trying to stop them. Obviously there was some pre-arranged plan to be followed by the soldiers who had been cordial towards the demonstration. When 5 of them were arrested by the Adelaide police the Army authorities at Woodside next day stopped further leave and to avoid police court proceedings the men were dealt with by the Army. The Press reported that certain of them were fined. The interesting thing is that no sergeant was fined as a result of the Army investigation or trial of the offenders on that night, and it was the sergeant who had called the lads out of the South Australian Hotel to do their duty across the road. </para>
          <para>On the Saturday after the Moratorium I and five or six others went into the South Australian Hotel - the corner bar again - and we saw 2 young chaps, 1 wearing a Moratorium badge and the other wearing the badge of the Returned Services League. They joined us, the one wearing the Moratorium badge to be with his friends in the assembly and the other to apologise for hurling abuse at the procession as it went by. The one who apologised for hurling abuse felt justified insofar as he had been to Vietnam on 2 occasions as a volunteer fighting with the Australian forces. These 2 young men came to be together because the second young man had been to Vietnam on 1 occasion as a conscript and had been in the same unit as the one who had volunteered to serve in Vietnam. During discussion we asked the young man how he could support the Vietnam campaign knowing the horrors and terrors in Vietnam.  His  reply was: 'Well, it is of no use criticising the soldiers. If you were there and there were half a dozen Vietnamese around and your mate was shot, you would not wait to ask who had the gun and had fired the shot, would you?' 1 said: 'Do you mean to say that you simply mow down the lot?: He said: 'Well, anyone would do it'. I asked: What if there were women and children?' He answered: 'Women and children in Vietnam fire as many guns as soldiers do'. 1 said: 'You are nol meaning to tell me that innocent people get mowed down by Australian forces?' He replied: Those are the circumstances of Vietnam. Take another occasion. There is a curfew and no-one should be out after dark. You see a figure slinking across the paddy fields and you do not wait to see whether he has a gun. He should not be there.' I asked: 'What if i; is a young Vietnamese going to court his girlfriend? What happens then?' He replied: Some of them have had ammunition strapped on their back'. I said: 'Have all of them?' He answered: 'No, but some of them have. They should not be out.' I asked: Do you discover whether they have ammunition after they are dead?' He replied: What would you do in Australia if they broke the law?' 1 said: 'Possibly try them and gaol them or fine them'. I turned to the other chap and asked: 'Do you agree that Australian soldiers have ever been in an event such as that at My Lai?' He replied: 1 can assure you that they have'. 1 said: 'Where?' He said:  '1  am not going to tell you'. He went on to say: 'In my final briefings in Canberra, before I went to Vietnam, 1 was asked: "If you rounded up, say, 30 prisoners of war, there was a possibility of their escaping and because you were in only a small patrol you could not control them, what would you do?" My reply was: "You want to me to answer Shoot them' but I would not be prepared to shoot them". I was given duties in Vietnam that never necessitated my shooting anyone.' </para>
          <para>These are the statements of 2 mcn who came back from Vietnam. One claimed that he did things in the circumstances in Vietnam which would not be done otherwise. He happened to be the son of a former  president  of a sub-branch of the Labor Party. I knew his father well. These are very harsh and very severe statements. What </para>
          <para class="block">I am suggesting is that this situation calls for some inquiry. The names of those 2 chaps and the names of my 5 companions, who are well respected and high officials of the trade union movement in South Australia and who witnessed this conversation, are available for any inquiry that is appointed to find out whether these are the actions of Australian soldiers in Vietnam. This information is available to any inquiry that is appointed to find out what questions are asked of those who are sent to Vietnam by the Australian Military Forces. </para>
          <para>This is a question that must occupy everyone's mind. We do not get much detail. I have given the. statements of 2 men who were in Vietnam. They can be verified. They are not isolated statements. I am prepared to supply to any inquiry other than an Army inquiry the names of the 2 men who made the statements. I am confident that they would support their statements before any inquiry. I ask that we have an inquiry into this matter. It is a question of Australia's name being dragged down throughout Asia as a result of our participation in Vietnam. Whatever was the result of the Moratorium, it demonstrated that not only in South Australia but in Australia - South Australia is one of the smaller States and one of the most apathetic States in any demonstration - there is a huge mass of public opinion opposed to Australia's involvement in Vietnam and to the National Service Act. </para>

              <para>-  I take no responsibility for any thoughts <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> may have. They would be beyond even the greatest psychiatrist. The point is that the demonstration throughout the whole of Australia was a demonstration to show, among other things that people are opposed to Australia's involvement in Vietnam. But there is now a very big section of the community that is prepared to demonstrate its loyalty to particular causes. </para>

          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> says, with this agitation comes an impression more favourable to the Vietcong than to those who are inflicting the suffering and misery upon the innocent Vietnamese people. This is a natural sequence. No-one hopes that we will support anyone who is causing the death of Australians at the present time. But this Government by involvement and conscription is more responsible for the death of any Australian in Vietnam than any member of the Vietcong ever was. Therefore, there is just as much credit in carrying a Vietnamese flag as in wearing a Liberal Party badge at the present time, if people are apportioning blame. The Government would be unwise to refuse to take heed of the demonstration last week because it will not stop with Vietnam. At the present time we have created a force that could break up the whole institution and the whole organisation that people are trying to hang on to. I have put before the Senate the facts as given to me and the statement as given to me. It is not some anonymous statement. The names and all can be supplied. I. ask for a full inquiry into the information that I received last Saturday. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to speak on the motion for the first reading of this Bill. Probably the most important thing that has happened on the Australian scene in the last week has been the Moratorium march. I would like to congratulate those who took part in it for being able to bring about, in the main, a non-violent result. I believe that they should be congratulated for that outcome. I imagine that this will not be the last of similar marches. I only hope that the efforts of the Government as well as the Opposition and those who take part will be directed towards seeing that Australia has non-violent expressions of opinion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that 2 matters have come out of the debate and the march. Firstly, I pay great attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has suggested to the people of this community that if there is a law to which they find objection they should be free to break that law. This point has been debated in the House of Representatives. I am afraid that I am not aware of how many members of the Opposition support that suggestion. If ever a more abhorrent suggestion was made by one who purports to be a law maker in this country, I have not heard it. I suggest that those members of the Opposition who have been vocal in expressing their attitude towards the march and other matters in the last 3 or 4 days should make their position clear and say how they view that attitude of the supposed Victorian leader of the Moratorium. I know of nothing more abhorrent. 1 know that the criticism of the whole of the Australian public should be levelled at an individual who suggests that type of philosophy on the Australian scene. </para>
          <para>As 1 understand the position, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was one of the people who put themselves forward as contenders for the leadership of the Labor Party prior to the last election. If he. as a potential leader, and those in his Party who follow him suggest that laws that they may make should be entirely disregarded by people who have an objection to those laws, they certainly intend, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> suggested, to bring anarchy to the Australian scene. </para>

I suggest to the honourable senator that he does not believe that one little bit. I. think he believes that the law must be supported.

              <para>- The honourable senator is following another line, lt would be interesting to hear the views of various senators on the subject I have raised. I object to the Vietcong flag being carried in our streets and I ask the Government to lake some action. The Government sets a standard through the provisions of the National Service Act. That legislation was brought in because this is a threat to the preservation of Australia. We need defence forces. In the last Budget about $1 ,100m was set aside for defence purposes, the major part of it to be spent in defending those countries in South East Asia which are being infiltrated. The statements by honourable senators opposite fill mc with horror, lt is not simply a case of our fighting in South Vietnam or in any other country. We are attempting to defend South Vietnam against the thrusts of another country. </para>

If our policy is to have an army and a National Service Act which calls on some young men in the community to go overseas to support the defence of this country, I do not believe that we can stand for people marching in the streets behind the Vietcong flag. Undoubtedly many people marched without even knowing what the flag was. They followed blindly down Bourke Street while the march was on. But there were individuals who intentionally carried the Vietcong Bag and the flag of North Vietnam. They were aligned with those people who held high the flag bearing the hammer and sickle. They marched down the main street of Melbourne in what was supposed to be a peace march. It was not a peace march but a march supporting the opposition to what this country stands for. </para>

When a bearded youth in a university holds up the Vietcong flag on the campus and has some sort of discussion there, or even burns an effigy of somebody, we may laugh it off. The purpose of my question today was to discover the attitude of the Federal Government to the matter I have raised. Is it laughing off the fact that we have in our community people marching in the streets openly carrying the flag of the people we are opposing in war?

              <para>- The point has been raised that the continuous use of the word subversive' in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has been offensive. I heard it used several times and allowed it to pass. However, I feel that a completely unparliamentary statement has been made. You have in front of you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, a</inline> book containing expressions that have had to be withdrawn. In recent days honourable senators have had to withdraw expressions very much less offensive than the one that has just been used. The general aim is to add to the order of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> did not speak to the point of order but tried to add to the offence by repeating the word 'subversive'. Are we not in a situation that <inline font-style="italic">somebody</inline> objects to a certain flag? Several flags which are not illegal have been carried in such marches. These flags are not illegal and therefore there seems to be some sort of challenge to the Government there. But the point is that offence has been taken at the use of the word 'subversive' which is a pretty serious word. </para>

One must naturally roam over those areas which  I  have suggested have a subversive content in this present debate.  I  was attempting to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that if there is a foreign flag, the flag of a country with which we are at war, or to all intents and purposes at war- </para>

              <para>- 1 rise to order. The way that these matters are dealt with is that an honourable senator takes objection to the use of some word and the objection is dealt with in a summary way. If an honourable senator is given an opportunity to canvass the whole matter, to go into the ins and outs of whether a person is a liar, is dishonest and so on, he worsens and aggravates the offence. That is what is being done here. 1 submit that the correct course in dealing with a point of order is to decide one way or the other whether an honourable senator should be required to withdraw a remark. Depending on how you determine that it is open to others to agree with your ruling or to dissent from it, but the matter should be dealt with by you in a summary way on a point as clear as this where there is a suggestion that an honourable senator is subversive. </para>

What  I  said is that in world opinion today the Vietcong flag has a greater respectability than the American flag.  I  further said that as the deaths of our lads is the result more of a decision of this Government than of a decision of the Vietcong, the Vietcong flag must have greater respectability than the flag of the Liberal Party. That is being patriotic; that is not being subversive. Therefore  I  ask for a withdrawal of the reference to my subversion. </para>

              <para>- 1 withdraw the word 'subversive'.  I  was using it in relation to those who would carry or who would be pleased to carry the Vietcong or North Vietnamese flags.  I  am pleased that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> is in the chamber because although  I  do not doubt that he was listening in his room to what was being said,  I  was making a demand on this Government - on the Prime Minister and on the leaders of the parties which form the Government - that it must take action to ensure that the Australian community is not subverted. If we as a Government genuinely believe in the principles to which we adhere regarding the freedom of some communities in the world, then we cannot allow in this community individuals, who are subversive to our Australian cause, to carry openly flags or standards of countries with which we are at war at this moment. </para>

          <para>I make one other point. I ask that the attention of honourable senators be directed to further insidious activities in the community.I ask whether any honourable senator happened to view the 'Four Corners' programme on Saturday night? If I may place on that programme the interpretation which I and others placed on it, there was an intention by those responsible for the programme perhaps to compare the Moratorium Campaign and the activities of those who stood behind it with the activities of the Returned Services League. The comperes of the 'Four Corners' programme introduced some lad in the programme in order to instil into the minds of the viewing public the fact that he compared Anzac Day marches with all the glorification of war, although he certainly did not support that attitude. If that person holds the view that Anzac Day marches and the activities of the RSL are a glorification of war, then surely he must be the one person in the community who holds that view. I am pleased to hear that honourable senators opposite do not come in on such a comment. </para>

              <para>- I would say it was subversive if I could read into the honourable senator's mind what I believe is there. I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> the opportunity to express himself. The 3 points I have made in my remarks to the Senate are: Firstly, I query the comments made by some supposed law makers in this Parliament, that they view the breaking of a law which some people may think is wrong as the right of those people. 1 then draw attention to the fact that there is subversion in our community, and that the Government will need to take some action if we allow people to carry with pride the flags of those countries with which we are at war at the present time. If honourable senators opposite are proud to march under those flags, I believe that type of activity is subversive. I ask that the Government should take some action regarding it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Although such action is, perhaps, considered comical when it is taken in the grounds of a university, it certainly is a most serious matter if we, as a government, allow such subversive action as the raising of the standard of an enemy power and the carrying of it down the main streets of Australia when we arc directing lads to war under the National Service Act and when we are spending so much of this country's resources$1,100m in the last Budget in an attempt to preserve the defence of this country. I ask the Government to take some action, pretty swiftly, to see that this activity is prohibited. If the Government takes any notice of my comments at all, I believe that in the future it should ensure that the community is not divided by some who suggest that their respect for the honour of Australia is so great that they have forgotten to bring an Australian flag to a march, and that instead they have brought the North Vietnamese or Vietcong flag. This was not a peace march; it was a march of war, and it will divide the Australian community. </para>

But may I in fairness make the comment that the type of speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in the terms that he used freely and without control lead me to take a similar approach and to use similar terms? The Moratorium proved to be not one of violence, lt proved to be a massive demonstration throughout Australia against the Government's actions. If the word 'subversion' is to be used, it should be used against the Government because it has subverted the Australian attitude to world affairs, lt has been guilty of a double standard not only in South East Asia but also in China and in other parts of the world. We have been guilty of supporting governments which ought not to have been supported. We have been guilty of supporting dictatorial regimes which ought not to have been supported. We have been guilty of supporting men who have subjected their countries to military dictatorship and whom we should not have supported. On one occasion we invited onto the floor of the Senate the  Speaker  of the South Korean Parliament. He was responsible for deliberately destroying democracy in South Korea. </para>

I withdraw, but I cannot withdraw the overall comment that time and time again the Government has been guilty of supporting those who have been the true enemies not only of Australia but also of democracy in general and of peace. What right has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> to speak of the National Service Act? What right has he to call upon the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> to do something about the so-called subversion by the carrying of Vietcong flags? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has the power in his own Party room to suggest amendments to the National Service Act to make certain that no young man in this country is sent to gaol for 2 years because he considers the war to be unjust and because he refuses to go to South Vietnam and kill because this Government says so. What right has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> then, to call upon this Government, when he has the power to speak within his own Party room to change the attitude of this Government? What right has he to accuse honourable senators on this side of subversion? To me, those words which he used are the words of a dissembler. If he looks up the meaning of that word he might seek the withdrawal of that also. The pressures within this country which seek peace - and all we seek is peace- </para>

            <para>- I beg your pardon. May 1 point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> that the carrying of the Vietcong flag, which he considers to be subversive and a crime, is not a subversive aci? If it were subversion and a crime it would be within the power of one of his own Ministers to take action. He must know in his heart - and so must Ministers know - that this is no illegal act. This is no subversive act because we have never indicated that we were in a state of war with North Vietnam or with the Vietcong. British ships carrying the British flag go into the port of Haiphong in North Vietnam. They supply goods to North Vietnam. Does the honourable senator suggest that this is a subversive act? Is this a subversive act on the part of  Her  Majesty's Government? It is not, because we are not at war with Vietnam and we do not have the courage to declare that we are at war because we know that the war in Vietnam is an illegal war and an illegal intervention on our part. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>What right has the honourable senator to state that an act by a student in carrying a Vietcong flag is one that ought to attract the attention of the Government? He knows that the Government cannot take any action. It has no power under which it can take action. All that he can do, as has been done by other members of the Government, is to cast aspersions on those who support peace and perhaps support North Vietnam's attitude. They can cast aspersions on such people, but they do not have the courage to take any action and are determined not to take any action. </para><para>If one looks at the situation carefully, no matter what the Government does, it shows a double standard. I pointed out here, by way of question, that we have a double standard which imposes a sentence of 2 years without parole on a lad who refuses to kill and a sentence of 3 years with parole on the young man who murders, by strangulation and by mutilation, a young person. In this community we have a double standard. 1 have pointed out that we have traded not only with Communist China but also with North Vietnam. I have pointed out that when we ceased to trade direct with North Vietnam our goods went to Communist China and from Communist China into North Vietnam. Time and time again I have pointed out the hypocrisy of the acts of this Government. I refuse to take offence when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> uses against me the term subversion'. </para></speech>

            <para>- I am brought into this debate by the extraordinary statements which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> to the effect that they find greater respectability in the Vietcong and, presumably, North Vietnamese flags than in the flag of the United States of America. Presumably they are proud to march in a demonstration in which these flags are carried. 1 think that we should calmly but quickly examine what these flags stand for. For my authority I take statements which have been made by the leaders of North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front. Before doing so I wish to make only 2 comments regarding the extraordinary speech we have just heard. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline>attacked the Australian Government and, by inference, the Government of the United Slates of America for what he regards as an extension of the war into Cambodia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> spoke with great heat about double standards. I think it is always unwise for members of the Opposition to talk about moral standards because it is an established fact which has not been denied that for years North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops have illegally and immorally occupied large areas of Cambodia. They have no legal or moral right to be there. If honourable senators opposite are going to talk about moral standards and double standards then I think I should point out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that 1 have never heard one word of criticism or one attack in this Senate by any member of the Australian Labor Party on North Vietnam for its acts of aggression against Cambodia. However, when the United States launches attack after attack on the sanctuaries - on main supply routes and supply bases - the action becomes one of aggression. I do not think that honourable senators opposite should talk about moral standards. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline>also referred to the Australian Government's support of the enemies of democracy. Let us have a look at the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong, whom he said he supports, to see what their democracies are like. We hear a lot about the supporters of peace. A short while ago as a little exercise I took out some of the statements emanating from the National Liberation Front and North Vietnam. Let us see what they think about peace.

          <para class="block">However,  I  think we should have a look at the actions of the Vietcong in South Vietnam since  1956.  There is a good reason why I have taken it from  1956.  From  1954  to  1956  the North Vietnamese leaders, led by Truong Chinh and Ho Chi Minh, were engaged in the pleasant Communist pastime of liquidating all political opponents. At that time - under the guise of land reforms-some  100,000  North Vietnamese were murdered and the families of the victims were left to starve. The principle adopted was that it is better to execute  10  innocent people than to allow  1  enemy to escape. Many more were tortured.  I  repeat that the children of those who were regarded as enemies of the state were left to starve. So much horror was aroused by this purge that General Giap, the Minister for Defence, admitted in October  1956  that the terror had become too widespread. He did not apologise for the terror; he said that it had become too widespread. He admitted that too many innocent people were executed, that torture had become an every day occurrence and that the innocent children of parents wrongly classified as land lords had starved to death. We are now told that some people are happy to march behind the flag of this regime. </para>
          <para>I  do not want to say very much more. However the North Vietnamese villagers will recall how they were compelled to denounce and torture one another, to sever all family ties and to supress all human feeling. This is a deliberate policy which is designed to pulverise the nerves of all people who resist Communism in North Vietnam. The same Truong Chinh said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The aim of the present revolution is that the entire people should thoroughly absorb the Socialist ideology, that this should abandon their previous outlooks on life and on the world and replace it with the Marxist viewpoint. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We are told today that some people are proud to march behind the flag of this regime and that its flag and the flag of the Vietcong receive. more respect in the world than the flag of the United States of America. </para>
          <para>I conclude by reminding the Senate that in  1960-61,  long before the United States was involved,  6,000  South Vietnamese village leaders, teachers, medical personnel, people who exercised some authority, were murdered. Six thousand were abducted. In the years  1956  to  1967  at least  27,600  South Vietnamese village leaders, teachers, and so on were murdered or kidnapped by the Vietcong. The same Vietcong went to extraordinary lengths to emphasise that the killings were calculated acts of terror. They left on the bodies notes warning others what to expect if they refused to co-operate. Briefly, this is the record from Communist sources as to their aims and objectives.  I  leave it to the Senate and people outside to judge whose flag has more respect in the world. </para>

            <para>- I  had no intention of entering this debate, but I feel there are some areas of this matter, which has become the major question before the Senate, that have not been covered. These questions should be covered if this matter is to be discussed thoroughly.  I  think, first of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> should be answered. He endeavoured to make a comparison - it was a very poor one - between what happened in South Korea and what is going on in South East Asia. I suggest to him he should get his historical facts in their proper perspective before he starts to condemn the Government of South Korea. The Government of South Korea exists because its integrity was preserved by the action of the United Nations in appealing to the governments affiliated with the United Nations to take action to protect the integrity of the people of South Korea.  I  do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> belonged to the Australian Labor Party as long ago as that, but that body was a party to the protection of the people of South Korea. The trade union movement of this country debated the issue of South Korea and in its wisdom or otherwise decided that the cause of the people of South Korea was a cause which should be protected; so too did supporters of the Government, which means it was a unanimous decision.  I  cannot speak for the Party to which  I  belong at the moment because at that time  I  was a member of the Australian Labor Party of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> now proudly claims to be a member. But the fact that emerges is that we were all unanimous about South Korea. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> says that the war in South Vietnam is an illegal war and he seeks to draw a comparison with what happened in South Korea.  I  suggest that he is right. The incident in South Korea was not different from the incident in Vietnam today,  lt  is a continuation of the same struggle. This is the crux of the situation which causes honourable senators on my right - although on the left of the political spectrum - to make the same mistake about South Vietnam as they made about South Korea. They are trying to isolate the incident in Vietnam as though it is something happening in the world which has never happened before. Of course it has happened before, and it is happening all over the world. It is persisting, lt is the march of those who favour a dictatorial philosophy of Communism as against those who favour a democratic spirit. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> and members of the Australian Labor Party make the same error when they become confused as to what loyalty they owe to Australia itself. lt matters very little to me as an Australian whether we are technically at war in South Vietnam. Those who march under the Vietcong flag are killing Australian soldiers. Whether we are like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who has a viewpoint different from mine is beside the point: the important point is the loyalty which we owe to this country. When a government., rightly or wrongly, makes a decision which involves my compatriots, my fellow Australians, in bearing arms in fighting for this country ] feel - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> who is trying to interject, can speak for himself - that irrespective of whatever point of view I might hold, I owe a loyalty to these men. I do not subvert them in the military action they are forced to take. I am prepared to admit that even the men in the front line may have some qualifications and doubts but they do not express their doubts by stabbing one another in the back. There would not be one person in this political forum who does not know the extent to which propaganda can destroy the morale of troops in the front line. </para>

              <para>- 1  will answer that question, as to why we do not bring the troops back, in  a  moment. Honourable senators are over eager when they require information from me. Let me take my own time. 1 will come to that point. The fact of the matter is: To whom do we owe loyalty? As a political forum of trained politicians, do we not know the value of propaganda? Would any honourable senator reasonably say that the photographs of the Moratorium Campaign marchers in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra, supporting the Vietcong, have not already gone to the source from which they will do the most damage to our soldiers and assist those who are endeavouring to kill them? The photographs will encourage those who are endeavouring lo kill our soldiers to persevere in spite of their military reverses, lt will be said in the propaganda sheets where these photographs will be displayed: 'Look, you are really being supported by masses of people back in Australia who are slabbing their own soldiers in the back. Here are the photographs illustrating the march not for peace but in favour of the Vietcong which took place in Melbourne.1 Do not accept me as an authority. Accept <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline> He went on television on Sunday night and admitted that there were only Vietcong flags, Red flags with a hammer and sickle on them, some black flags, and the North Vietnam flag. There was not one Australian flag. What would be the result of the display of this propaganda? </para>

          <para>The Labor Parly would not miss such a glorious opportunity, if it were able to exhibit material with as good political prospects in its favour. Does the Labor Party think thai the Communists in Haiphong or Peking are any less able in the arena of political propaganda than it is? This is what the Moratorium Campaign did. Whatever may have been the tragedy of it politically for a recognised political party in this country, the Australian Labor Party, the Moratorium was a tremendous victory for the Communist Party in this country. It could not have won this victory in its own right without the assistance of well-meaning people who were misguided. They may not have been misguided had it not been for the active support of a responsible political party such as the part)' to which 1 once belonged - the Australian Labor Party, lt is said that some supporters of the Liberal Party were involved. They may have been for all I know or for all anyone else knows. Everybody knows that there were people in  this Moratorium Campaign who had personal views on this question which differed from the views held by others. It is not really a party political question as far as politics in this country are concerned. </para>
          <para>These people start off on the wrong premise. They think that South Vietnam is an isolated incident not related to the war in Korea and not related to what happened in Malaya when Australian and British troops had to go in and protect the civilian population of that country from the murderous activities of the terrorists there who were prompted by the Communists. They think it is not related in any way to the coup which was  nearly  successful in Indonesia. Those people who isolate their thinking to the one particular problem as far as Vietnam is concerned and say that this is something that is happening quite irrespective of what else is going on in the world can be misled on the whole question as the Labor Party - or some members of it - is misled in thinking that this can be technically argued on the basis of what is happening in South Vietnam as the Australian Labor Party inevitably argues it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> today made the classic blunder of making the attack that he made on the Government of South Korea, showing that whatever may be said publicly by the Labor Party some of its members are well aware that the whole situation as far as the East is concerned, and so far as the whole of the world is concerned, is a battle of 2  ideologies. They are beginning to stand on one side and other people in this democracy of ours stand on the other. </para>
          <para>I believe that I must help <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who is keen and eager to know why we do not end the slaughter and create peace by bringing home our troops. Let us have a look at the validity of the argument. Let us relate it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges'</inline> proposition about Korea. Since the war in Korea ended in 1952 - 18  years ago - America has sustained over  50,000  troops there. Does the honourable senator suggest that in Korea - even  18  years after the war has ended - if the troops were returned to America tomorrow there would be peace? There would be the greatest blood bath that one could possibly imagine in Korea and yet you would take the risk - you the pacifists, you the ones who march behind not the flag of the dove of peace but the Vietcong flag - of sending them home from </para>
          <para class="block">Korea. You would leave the Koreans to face the results of your irresponsible actions. </para>
          <para>There are other people who think more widely and more deeply and who recognise the fact of life that if the troops of America - which does not want to have them there - were extracted from South Korea tomorrow there would be just the same blood bath in South Korea as there would be in South Vietnam if the troops were withdrawn from there before a situation is created in which the South Vietnamese, with a minimum of assistance, can look after themselves. Labor Party senators know - they have quoted Denis Warner and others who have written about it - of the tremendous slaughter that would take place in South Vietnam of those who oppose the Communist cause if the troops were withdrawn. They have seen the practical examples in Czechoslovakia and they have led resolutions here in this Senate expressing their sympathy for the people of Czechoslovakia for what has happened to them. But seeing the iron fist that is prepared to crush anybody who deviates from the line I suggest that we should get back to where Australians owe their loyalty. I say that any Australian who wants to stand up and say: 1 am loyal to this country and this flag' should be ashamed to stand behind a flag - whether we are technically at war or not - under which those who kill our fellow Australians march. On that point I say that the alleged Moratorium for peace condemned itself. It became not a demonstration for peace at all but a demonstration in favour of the aggressors in Vietnam. </para>

              <para>- I notice the cackle. I want to state my view if the honourable senator does not mind. The position is that the Parliament of this country supporting the Government has required compulsory service of its youth and has voted the money of the public to support the engagement in South Vietnam. Those armed forces are  there in conflict with the enemy and that enemy carries the Vietcong flag. Anybody in Australia who takes protection, as a resident of this country, from the defence that is given by its armed forces there has a duty to support them. Anybody who subverts those armed forces is a traitor and is guilty of treachery and subversion of the most abhorrent kind, not only in the eyes of the men whose duly it is to hold the line tonight, not only in the eyes of their relatives, but also in the eyes of every decent Australian. If there is any legislator who cannot bring himself to the degree of conviction as to his undivided loyally to the armed forces which the democratic, freely elected Government of this country compels in part and organises in another part to engage in that conflict - if there is any legislator who cannot bring himself to the degree of conviction that his duty is to support them, he is wanting then those elemental human qualities of judgment and character which alone can create the defence of this country. As for the Vietcong flag, honourable senators might be reminded that in 1967 this Parliament passed a statute which outlawed and made illegal the sending of money, goods, services or financial assistance to any of the following: the Government of the country known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; the body known as Dang Lao Dong Vietnam or as the Communist Party of North Vietnam. </para>

Those who carry the Vietcong flag in South Vietnam are the people who are perpetrating the atrocities and the carrying out the guerilla warfare against the South Vietnamese people to whom my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> referred.

I say that because most of us were greatly impressed with the demonstrations which were held in all capital cities during the past weekend. Everyone must have been impressed because Government senators who now have very carefully twisted the argument to something about Vietcong flags, in some cases have applauded the convenors and organisers of the Moratorium following their observance of the demonstrations. In all cases there was a marked restraint by the organisers. There was no violence, and even those who took no part in the marches but watched the demonstrations on television must have been struck by the careful discipline which had been occasioned, I suppose, by the debates within the country about the need to avoid violence, and because of the wide acceptance of peaceful demonstration. Let us face the facts. The people who are now trying very carefully to divert this argument to one about the national liberation forces &lt;bd the nag were the people who, during the debates in the Senate last week, accepted the principle that there was a right to protest against the Government's policies on matters of defence. </para>

              <para>- Let me come to it. The Moratorium was a demonstration by a large group of Australian people, not just members of the Communist Party or a small percentage of people who support the Vietcong. I accept that in Australia there are some who support the Vietcong but the fact is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has said, that the carrying of a Vietcong flag in Australia is not an illegal act. If it is, the Government should do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has challenged the Government to do. </para>

              <para>- Let me develop my argument and then see whether it makes sense. I do not like seeing demonstrations and I would not take part in a peace demonstration willingly when there was a Vietcong flag ahead of me, but if someone ahead of me in a peace procession hoisted a National Liberation Front flag I would not take any action to get him out because I could not and 1 would not use force. The convenors of the Moratorium decided that the demonstrations should be peaceful. They were. Unlike last week, the issue in the Senate today is not the Moratorium, the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and from Indo-China or the repeal of the National Service Act. The issue that honourable senators opposite have raised today is that in some cases people hoisted Vietcong flags in the processions and some action should be taken. If honourable senators opposite want to take action, let them do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> hits done - consider the position properly. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Moratorium has started, lt will not lessen, lt will grow as it has grown in America. Any belief that a military solution in Vietnam is possible is based on false premises, lt will not succeed. ! think everyone recognises that it has been proved conclusively day after day that that will not happen. If there is to be any stability in Vietnam or in Cambodia it will have to come from the people themselves through political stability. Let me remind the Senate, because we all forget this in the heat of argument, that basically the Geneva Accords of 1954 proposed elections over the whole of Vietnam in 1956. Unfortunately the <inline font-style="italic">position</inline> politically was never canvassed properly and it reached the stage at which military intervention became the way to strengthen the position of North Vietnam and of South Vietnam. The fact is that we have a great military intervention which, instead of succeeding, is becoming larger and larger and more dangerous. </para>
          <para>In Australia today our Government is speaking with 2 voices. On the one hand it applauds the intervention by America in Cambodia an action which, incidentally, has been condemned by the United States Senate Committee as recently as yesterday; and on the other hand, the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> is urging upon the countries which will attend the conference in Indonesia the need to set up inspection in Cambodia and Vietnam if that is found to be necessary. So we have 2 movements. We are saying, on the one hand, that military expansion is a good thing and, on the other hand, we are trying to temper that by saying that the real solution lies in inspection to restrain escalation of the war and so on. Sooner or later we in this country must ask ourselves whether we can expect peace to be established in Vietnam and in Indo-China in the way in which we are supporting it. All of the evidence points to the fact that no military solution is possible. The real solution will be found by the Australian Government doing what the people are doing today - urging that it be realised that peace is the major question and that governments in South Vietnam and elsewhere should be commissioned to think about establishing peace by largely political means. </para>
          <para>My position is the same as it was when I visited Vietnam in 1964. At that time the then Government of South Vietnam certainly was not even a partly elected government; it was a government of changing military juntas. The Government of South Vietnam still has basically the same defects as it had then. It does not represent all the people in South Vietnam. It has not the stability that would be required for it to take any competent national action. For that reason and because of the interest of the Vietnamese people in the National Liberation Front in areas of South Vietnam that the NLF has controlled for up to 15 years, the Government cannot cope with the situation and is relying on its friends - the United States and ourselves - to hold the position by military means, which finally we will find will be incomplete and unsatisfactory. </para>
          <para>So the mission of the people who demonstrated in Australia over the weekend was to raise this very important question and the associated- </para>

              <para>- I do not disown that proposition. It may be true, as somebody said, that the demonstrators included members of the Australian Nazi party who are now becoming active in some of the demonstrations. Among the demonstrators were people who said that they did not support the National Liberation Front. There were also people who said: 'We are against the Moratorium'. But broadly speaking, as everybody knows, the great mass of the people who went along were concerned about the issues about which I am talking now; that is, the real issues about peace. </para>

          <para>If any lesson is to be learnt from the Moratorium, surely it is that a large body of Australian people are now most concerned about this matter and intend to take peaceful measures to persuade the Government to change its orientation and its fixation on military solutions. In my view those things will never prove successful. In addition, the demonstrators included many people who object to the method of raising the armies of Australia. That is the lesson. It is not the sidetracking arguments that some people- </para>

              <para>- Yes, but the honourable senator was not in the place where I was. I followed him; so perhaps we can call it square. The situation was  -  I think this can be believed - that the  President  of the NLF was in residence in Kamphong Cham in Cambodia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline> was doing his own things .there, and I was doing mine. Let us leave it at that. It is nice to feel that after a fairly solid day of abuse we can generate a little mirth in this place. But what I suggest to senators in the Opposition, 1 hope without any nastiness or violence, is that perhaps we could have shortened this war if they, with other people, had done something about trying to remove the menace in Cambodia earlier. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. The honourable senator is entitled to his view, and I am entitled to mine. I express mine here in the place of government. When I hear references to the Vietcong flag being more highly regarded than the United States flag in some parts of the world, it seems to me that such remarks are better not made, when we are dealing with our allies and we have been very proud in past wars to fight alongside them and to work with them under their flag and our flag. I do not think such remarks really do anything except show a contempt for a brave people. Anybody who has had the experience of standing in the Arlington cemetery in Washington and seeing the graves of hundreds of thousands of American veterans who fought in foreign wars for which really they did not have to leave their country will believe, I am sure, as I do, that such remarks are beneath contempt. </para>

            <para>- This debate has touched on the matter of a number of Vietcong flags being produced at the Moratorium demonstrations last Friday. But that is only a side issue that could be likened to the production by somebody of a Japanese or German flag. The other day a German flag bearing a swastika was raised outside this House. We cannot control the people who do that and who display similar idiosyncrasies at demonstrations. It is their own business if they want to express their freedom to raise some sort of flag. We are not responsible for those persons. In my home town the other day young people were jumping up and down on the footpaths and shouting out slogans as we marched by. They were exercising a prerogative just as we were, but the difference was that we had the permission of the police to march. We had a police escort and were orderly. </para>

          <para>Those young people chose their way to demonstrate against us. We did not get hot under the collar because they displayed offensive slogans. I do not know whether they carried particular flags such as the green flag of Ireland, or flags bearing such emblems as the Italian bundle of slicks, the German swastika, or the rising sun of the Japanese. All those were symbols in the past. There is no need to get hot under the collar when the words 'patriotism' and 'nationalism' or similar words arc used to make people get excited. </para>
          <para>The issue that we might well discuss today involves statements made in this Parliament before last Friday that have been proved by time to have been completely false and misleading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> today referred to <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Cavanagh</inline> and other subversive senators'. He was made to withdraw that particular statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> might choose to carry a Chinese flag, as he really should as a member of the Australian Country Party. He should carry a Chinese flag in the streets in order to honour the people who are maintaining many of his Country Party farming colleagues in a state of solvency. But for the wheat being sold by Australia to China our wheat stabilisation scheme would be in a very sorry plight. We would excuse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> if he and the Leader of the Australian Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> and other members of the Australian Country Party were to hold a special celebration day to pay honour to the people who are purchasing so much of our wheat. </para>
          <para>Indirectly, of course, those people are assisting North Vietnam and people who could be classified under the present standards by which war is not declared. If it suits you, and if you do not like another nation's philosophy, and if you have control of the industrial and military complex that is astride the world today, centred in the United States, you just go to war. I am certain that the presidents of the United States, such as former  President  Johnson and present  President  Nixon, are not in control of the machinery of government in that nation.  1  believe that the military and industrial leaders of the United States are the only people who can gain physically and financially from the war. They have a vested interest in the continuation of wars. There would be no war if the United States Government was influenced by peace seeking people, but there would be an enormous repercussion on the United States economy, which would bc thrown into a state almost of major depression. Present unemployment in the United States stands at about  4  million. Throughout the world millions of United Slates troops are scattered. This is a very expensive charge on the taxpayers of the United States. </para>

              <para>- At the suspension of the sitting I was pointing out that it had appeared as though the United States of America had become severely divided within itself. Although  President  Nixon claims that the United States is the strongest, the greatest and the most powerful nation in the world, a nation which is divided to the extent that the United States is divided, I would suggest, creates a precedent the like of which has never been understood or realised before in a nation of such strength. If we look down the history of countries which have embarked upon a policy simitar to that of the United Slates we see that they have had a united purpose behind them which has taken them to a point where either they have met total destruction, as happened to the dictatorships of Germany and Italy or. wilh the support of their own people and their allies who have been prepared to go to the last ditch, to fight to the last man on the beaches, and so on, have become victorious. But here we see a situation in which the United States is fast losing its credibility in the light of what is claimed by the  President. </para>

              <para>- Yes, in Launceston. The flag of protest has been carried through the world. The United States Administration must realise that every time there is a demonstration against the United Slates in the national capital of that country, throughout the world United States credibility and status is reduced. We heard the news only a few moments ago that a committee of the United Slates Senate has voted 9 to I against the supply of funds for United States troops fighting in Cambodia after 1st. July. That must humiliate the  President  of the United States. If we suggest that the United States Hag is losing some of its popularity throughout the world we are accused of being subversive and of being all kinds of nasty people. Yet in the United States the defence committee of the Senate did not arrive at its decision with a small majority of perhaps 6 to 4 but arrived at it with a majority of 9 to I - almost <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> unanimous decision. That highly esteemed committee of the Senate deemed fit to vole against the supply of finance for American troops. This is a fantatsic situation, us a result of which surely the Administration of Australia must realise that within the United States there is something very much amiss. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>This brings me back to the point that I was making before the suspension of the sitting. The situation has become out of hand because the industrial and military people of the United States have taken the administration out of the hands of the Parliament and virtually out of the President's hands. The  President  is a prisoner of a system more pernicious, more subtle, more insidious, more undemocratic and more suicidal nationally than any system that has been evolved in the Western world. The military industrial complex of Germany had as a background the Krupp empire with all the militarism of the Prussians, lt had as the ideal historical background this long training of the German people towards the belief thai they were a superior race, the Herrenvolk. </para>
          <para class="block">There was the brainwashing, over generations that they were the superior race. They were brainwashed to believe that the Jews must be annihilated so that they could get back to that beautiful, clear Aryan strain of people who would lead the world. This was the philosophy of the Nazi Germans. </para>
          <para>All the tricks and techniques of the Germans have been followed holus-bolus by this complex in the United States and there is no doubt that it has lost nothing in its interpretation of the philosophy. Many millions of dollars profit are being made through the perpetuation of war and wherever it is occurring throughout the world the smutty finger of the industrialists and militarists of the United States can be found. They are pouring troops into other countries for the profits that can be gained, but they are doing it under the guise of stopping the thrust of Communism. </para>

              <para>- I wish to get back to the point that I was making. Wherever we look throughout the world we find this hoary old myth of Communism which has absolutely hypnotised people everywhere. It is likened to the great octopus, the tentacles of which will suck people into Communism. This great bogey has been built up, but why? Wherever it exists the power of the United States can be directed towards it. This helps the military and industrial economy of the United States to get rid of its surplus arms. It is a means of settling unemployment in the United States. Without the need for vast industrial armament industries, the like of which the world has never known, not only would there be the present rate of unemployment in the United States but also there would be an unemployment rate more than twice the existing rate. But because of the number engaged in these industries to supply countries, not only where the United States has military representation and a substantial number of troops but also other countries, their unemployment rate is reduced. They would have enormous problems if they were not able to export armaments. They have reached the stage now where they are putting up to the Australian Government that our inspection of mutton is insufficient. There has been some suggestion of lymphonitis or some other complaint with our mutton, but this is just another American hypocrisy prompted by the mutton lobby in the United States. </para>

              <para>- It is a fact that they import our bulls because hamburgers in the United States are almost the staple diet of the average American. Because of the inflation in the United States the average American cannot afford to buy the choice cuts of beef. As an alternative the Americans buy all our old boners, our old drought stricken stock and our old bulls. This is a fact. American people have told me that the demand for Australian second and third grade beef is fantastic in the United States. </para>

          <para>I want to get back to the subject which illustrates the hypocrisy of the propaganda machine. It comes back again to the question of how big is the lie. This is the Hitlerian philosophy: Tell them the big lie and repeat it and you will get people to believe it. This is why we have been sucked into this war in Vietnam. In the first place we were lied to about the agreements that had been made. The Vietnamese people were doublecrossed over the Geneva Convention. I do not think the United States ever wanted to see that agreement work so that there would be an election, within 2 years. At that time President Eisenhower of the United States said that if an election were to be held within 2 years 80% of Ho Chi Minh's supporters would vote for unification and would vote for a government suitable to them. Then there have been other incidents along the way. and the propaganda machine has been directed at the Australian people through our own news media. There was the Gulf of Tonkin incident. When history is written this will prove to have been the greatest doublecross that was ever put over in the war of propaganda. In the Gulf of Tonkin incident people with sampans - and we have never seen or heard of any North Vietnamese war vessel which is bigger than a sampan- </para>

              <para>- They fired on the American Navy to the extent not only that the Navy had to shoot the sampans out of the water, but also that the armed forces of the United States had to be committed to Vietnam. If we ever survive the present trend in world affairs, when the history of this war is written we will find that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was the focal point on which the United States was talked into being committed to the Vietnam war by the military and industrial complex advisers and also by the secret organisation, the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a supranational organisation, which combines the American military, spy and intelligence systems. There is not one honourable senator opposite who would not believe and would not understand what I am saying when I speak of the power of the CIA throughout the world. Wherever people assemble there is this subtle, insidious influence of the CIA. Bat, nevertheless, this is the nature of modern affairs and modern warfare. </para>

          <para>Then we come to the next phase of the big lie and the big doublecross. We saw the withdrawal of  President  Johnson to Texas, the subsequent Presidential election and then the propaganda machine which said: 'We will not widen this war. We will withdraw our troops.' The United States has withdrawn its troops, but into Cambodia. What a doublecross that has turned out to be. They have withdrawn their troops into Cambodia instead of withdrawing them back to America, which was the promise made to the people of the United States. Throughout the length and breadth of the United States people are so frustrated and annoyed at having been told this great lie and given this great doublecross, that they are coming out into the streets to demonstrate. Students are demonstrating on their campuses. This is making the American Administration so bewildered that it is starting to panic. It is starting to turn gunfire on to the students in the universities. This is an indication of a nation divided within itself, a nation in panic. We are trying to show honourable senators opposite that they have been caught up in this. </para>

We are living in a fools paradise if we do not face the facts to which I have referred tonight. History alone will prove whether what I have said is right or wrong, because the mass media are censored at their very source of information. There is a screening of information coming through to us, and one can see this by reading some of the American magazines. One will see articles in American magazines which will give part of the truth. On the other hand one will see unanimity amongst practically the whole of the Australian Press which gives people a one-sided, biased line which, in my view, is biased for the purpose of keeping the Australian people under a cloud and ill-informed. </para>

              <para>- And in Adelaide members of the Army were taken off the streets. In the demonstration outside the Senate we saw these National Socialists openly parading themselves, supporting the Government policy. I saw them with a Vietcong flag.I do not know where they got it from. One of the demonstrators took it over, exploded a cracker inside of it and carried it along burning. The point I am making is that if he had a Vietcong flag, why did not honourable senators opposite accuse him of being subversive? It  is  because anyone, I suggest, can obtain a Vietcong flag. Then there is another point about the word 'Vietcong'. This word seems to be exclusively for Australians, because I saw a film recently which showed an American soldier who had captured a Vietcong, and the soldier had the Vietcong quivering in a corner while he was saying: You VC, you VC, you VC. He was not saying 'Vietcong'. The poor devil had never heard an American speak before let alone know what a VC meant. He probably thought it meant the Victoria Cross. </para>

              <para>- Yes, or Vince Gair. He got the V.C. at Wee Waa. The point I make is that the flags which honourable members opposite said were so subversive were home made flags. Anybody could display them if they wanted to. This is the very point that honourable senators opposite forget. Why should not people go out in the streets and demonstrate? The Ustashi have demonstrated. I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> is not here to tell us about the little dissident groups who wave their flags any time they want to. I remember having a rather heated discussion with the late, respected and esteemed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Shane</inline> Paltridge about a Gestapo group leading the Returned Services League march on Anzac Day in Western Australia.

              <para>- I withdraw and apologise. I believe the whole debate will be a continuing one because the future of this nation is involved. The war is one of the thresholds and one of the watersheds of history. In my view, it will be the last of the brush fire wars. China has the thermonuclear bomb and guided missiles. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Great Britain, the United States of America and France have a proliferation of thermonuclear weapons. They are coming to a flashpoint and the final war could quite easily come out of this. I believe that the Moratorium, or whatever honourable senators opposite like to call it, showed that now is a time for peace, a time for withdrawal, a time for contemplation and a time to reconsider where man is headed. If man is heading towards the final war, it will bring about not only his own destruction but the destruction of the fabric of the earth's surface, which is within man's control at present. I believe that time is shorter than we think. We will be making this decision sooner than we think. We should not go on willy-nilly widening the war or thinking of entering a new country to go through the whole process of murdering and burning innocent people because one fellow has a particular ideology and we have to get rid of it. This is the method on which the Government works. Wherever an opposing ideology raises its head, the Government has to break the head even if it kills 9 innocent people9 civilians to get the one. The 9 are expendable. That is the attitude that we, as a Christian nation, are supporting in South East Asia. Whatever the enemy does and whatever the Nuremberg trials found in their final analyses the responsibility for the actions of a government fall back not only on the individual who has to make the decision but also on the men who directed such action. In the past judgment has been passed on those who directed such operations. </para>

          <para>If the war continues in the way in which it is going, it is my firm belief that the hopes of the world that, through the United Nations, some measure of compromise to stop this mad rush towards oblivion can be reached will be dashed. I believe that the more the war is expanded and the more examples we give of entering new countries, whatever the excuse may be, the closer comes that day of retribution for all of us. I hope that debates such as this will make Government senators and people outside the Parliament realise that all is not as bright as it looks. The Government is following a line of brute force because it has control temporarily of the military machine. It has tried all the subterfuges through its 20 years of government. It has used every ploy or trick to retain power. It has used fear always fear and the big lie. If such actions have been successful, the Government can crow about the result. The Government has followed a policy which, in my view, is a disastrous one for the future not only of Australia and South East Asia but of the rest of the world. Prior to our involvement in Vietnam and in the South East Asian conflict we held a position of esteem in the eyes of small countries and we helped them get around the table to thrash our their problems. Instead of having that position we have been reduced now to being one of the participants in one of the worst and one of the ugliest wars recorded in modern history. I believe that the sooner the Government answers this world-wide move, this great upsurge of dissent and protest that is increasing throughout the world, and realises before it is too late that it has been following the wrong path a destructive one from a psychological point of view the better it will be for mankind. </para>

            <para>- by leave - In making this statement, I should explain that where the wordI is used, it means the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The statement is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My purpose tonight is to report on the results of the recent mission which I led to the United States of America to discuss with Secretary Laird and his  Deputy  Secretary Packard and other Defence officials, problems concerning F111 aircraft and the need for Australia to get into its inventory a strike bomber. Honourable members will recall that subsequent to discussions I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> L. McLucas, the Under Secretary of the United States Department of the Air Force, in December last year and taking account of further unanimous advice provided to mc by the members of the July 1969 Bland Mission to the United States; the Government decided and 1 announced on 5th December that we were sufficiently satisfied that we had protection in regard to the wing carry through box problem and that we would be reactivating our 24 FI 1 1C aircraft with a view to bringing them to Australia at an early date. </para>
          <para>As honourable members know, the crash of an FI IIA aircraft on 22nd December revealed a whole new problem area based on the behaviour under stress of D6ac steel which is used extensively and critically in the aircraft. This additional and major problem, made it necessary in our judgement, to reconsider our whole approach to the project and to look for the renegotiation of certain fundamental aspects of our agreements with the <inline font-style="italic">United</inline> States concerning our purchase of 24 FI 1 1 C aircraft. As a result, 1 was directed by the Government to pursue these questions in direct negotiation with the United States Administration. My discussions were wide ranging and, in addition to Secretary Laird and his Deputy Secretary Packard, 1 and members of my delegation negotiated with Department of Air Force Secretary Seamans, the United States Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan, Lieutenant General Glasser and other officials. As a result of these discussions I was able to reach certain agreements with Secretary Laird, and I am tabling the Agreed Minute signed jointly by Secretary Laird and myself. This Agreed Minute as it will be tabled is incomplete only in respect of certain operational and technical criteria which are classified and cannot be disclosed. </para>
          <para>In the course of my remarks tonight 1 will seek to describe the problems surrounding the FI II programme, the nature of the decisions the Government has so far made, and their consequences for Australia. J will also seek to describe the role that we believe a strike bomber needs to be able to fill. I will mention the importance that we attach to that role and the importance, in consequence, that we attach to the development of an adequate strike capability for the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
          <para>Implications of the Memorandum of Understanding and Technical Arrangement </para>
          <para>I want  to  begin by referring to the original Memorandum  of  Understanding signed in October 1963 and the associated Technical Arrangement signed in June 1964. These 2 documents are amongst those which were tabled in this Parliament in September, 1968. Honourable members who studied these documents closely will be aware that their broad intention was that the United States Air Force should specify to the contractor, and control the development of, an aircraft with a very high operational capability. At that time we were confident that the aircraft would satisfy Australia's requirements because those requirements were fully encompassed by the capability then being pursued by the United States Air Force. Honourable members will also see that the practical effect of these documents was that, taken together, they gave the United States the overriding authority to modify or downgrade the aircraft's specifications if for some reason it felt that it became necessary or unavoidable. It followed that, when the United States authorities did this, Australia was bound to accept any aircraft delivered in accordance with such downgraded specification, provided of course similar aircraft were accepted by the United States Air Force. </para>
          <para>In other words these 2 documents gave Australia no assurance against degradation of performance. When the documents were first signed, the RAAF felt there was a negligible risk in saying that planes suitable for USAF would be acceptable to Australia. It had confidence in the ability of the United States - with its unsurpassed achievements in aeronautical science and technology - lo translate the design concept into an aircraft of uniquely high performance entirely suitable for Australia's needs. No other aircraft embodies such highly developed and proven technological equipment to ensure the delivery of its weapons precisely on target day or night; and there is no other aircraft which can equal the Fill in its designed ability to carry a heavy weapon load over such a wide radius of action and penetrate the most sophisticated enemy defences under any weather conditions. </para>
          <para>The manufacturer encountered a series of problems, of which honourable members are aware, and this experience has given the RAAF cause for concern that the performance may be so downgraded that the aircraft would not be able to perform strike missions with the load, range and penetration called for by our Chiefs of Staff. The design was a venture - as all great technological advances require - into new fields of aircraft design and novel material applications and new aspects of metallurgy. </para>
          <para>As honourable members well know, problems were encountered which set the development back and there are today doubts as to the ultimate form that the technological solution will take and, most importantly for the RAAF, there are doubts about the timetable in which these solutions might be found and satisfactory aircraft actually delivered. Events have demonstrated that the difficulties encountered were greater than expected and led to a downgrading in performance. In addition, there was a further major financial implication in the original documents. Australia was given no financial protection in the event of the aircraft failing to reach the performance capability needed by Australia. The United States view has been that both governments went into the development of this new aircraft together and that we should each be responsible for our own investment. This would mean, of course, that if Australia for any reason was unable to take delivery of its FI 1 1 aircraft, we could lose our total investment. Our acceptance of this position would have confirmed our obligations to those documents and would have stated that the limit of the responsibilities of each party extended only to its own respective investment and to its agreed obligations. In short, if General Dynamics failed to produce an effective aircraft, we would lose our Australian expenditure without remedy beyond any which the United States could pursue on behalf of both of us with the company. This then was the Australian position and the extent of our rights as they existed prior to my visit to the United States. </para>

          <page.no>1339</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>These weaknesses would never have become an issue but for the technical problems and shortfalls in manufacturing performance that are plaguing the project. These problems are generally fairly well known to honourable members but I will mention them briefly. I should first remind honourable members that although the Australian aircraft designated F111C differs from the USAF FI IIA in having longer wings and a strengthened undercarriage, it is otherwise identical. By far the greater part of the whole Fill fleet is still grounded for safety reasons following the disastrous accident that occurred on 22nd December last year when a wing broke off a USAF F111A in flight during rocketry training. The only aircraft flying now are engaged on experimental work and they are flying to restricted stress manoeuvres. </para>
        <para>There are 3 main problem areas. The first concerns the question of getting our aircraft to the full 100% flight envelope. Until the structural integrity programme of static and fatigue tests due for completion about mid-1971 demonstrates that the strength of the aircraft is adequate to sustain full flight manoeuvre loads with the required fatigue life expectancy, the flight envelope will be restricted so as not to exceed 80% of full performance. With this restriction, the performance is inadequate to meet our requirements. The second problem arises from continuing difficulties with the design and proving of the wing carry through box. Thirdly, there are the difficulties being experienced in the use of D6ac steel. The D6ac steel problem, which overshadows all others at this time, was brought to the fore as a result of the December crash. The D6ac steel is used in 15 critical components of the aircraft and in many others which are subject to less stress. Unless these problems are solved, the aircraft will be unacceptable to Australia as a result of the present shortfalls in performance and doubts about structural reliability. The aircraft is at the moment quite unacceptable to Australia and to the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
        <para>The United States Air Force experts proposed a limited recovery or rehabilitation programme for our aircraft, aimed at an early date for the aircraft to be flown to Australia. This required a decision by 1st May 1970, with commencement of the programme on the 1st July 1970. However, our own scientific and technical advisers are firmly of the opinion that the proof and non-destructive testing techniques proposed are not yet sufficiently advanced to enable recovery proposals to be accepted by us as a basis for a firm acceptance commitment. 1 have every confidence in their judgment and indeed, after the discussions which 1 and my mission conducted., it was determined that there were strong arguments for our FI 1 1 C's remaining in the United States, not only until the problems of the D6ac steel are overcome., but until all static, fatigue and flight tests and modifications resulting therefrom have been completed. In summary then, there are major technical problems associated with the FI MC aircraft which are as yet unresolved, and for which there was little possibility of financial redress under the conditions established in the Memorandum of Understanding and the Technical Arrangement. </para>

          <title>Need for Strike Aircraft</title>
          <page.no>1340</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Before proceeding further, I want to remind the House about the role of this aircraft, and the philosophy lying behind ils purchase. There have been some who have said that as there is no obvious and immediate threat, an aircraft of this kind is no longer needed. I think this is a naive view. The whole purpose of defence preparedness is to establish circumstances in which you will not have to go to war; to provide a capability which will do much to help achieve stability in your own region. You do not wait until you have a specific target before you equip your air force with a strike bomber capability. It is the Government's view, and this is strongly supported by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, that an air strike and reconnaissance capability is an essential element of a balanced defence force for Australia. Firstly, counter air operations are a critical element of any aitdefence capability; they counter the threat at its source by attacks on air bases, aircraft on the ground, and support installations. This reduces the task of the defensive elements of the air defence system. </para>
        <para>Secondly, a strike capability allows us to wrest the initiative in the air war from the enemy, and forces him to divert resources from offensive to defensive operations. Thirdly, the ability of modern strike aircraft to deliver significant weapon loads on deep penetration missions, wilh relative immunity from even the most sophisticated defences, gives them the offensive capability which is an essential requirement of effective deterrent forces. Any sustained attack against Australia or ils Territories would have to he supported over sea lines of communication and through ports and base areas. The possibility that ports and base areas could bc interdicted by a strike force would be a significant deterrent to any foreign power considering such an attack. In addition to their ability to attack enemy forces on land or at sea, strike aircraft can carry heavy weapon loads over short ranges. This makes them a valuable adjunct to the capability of the Royal Australian Air Force to carry out tactical air operations such as air interdiction in support of of the land battle. The last decade has demonstrated the rapidity with which threats can change. The lead time involved in acquisition of aircraft and in reestablishing the skills inherent in bomber operations is such that we cannot wait until the threat arises before we act to meet it. We have to anticipate it as far as we can. Furthermore the British withdrawal from South East Asia, and the United States reappraisal, give added weight to our need for a strike force which would also enable us to make a greater contribution to our regional security strategy should this be necessary. </para>
        <para>The lead-time involved in re-introducing such a force, assuming suitable aircraft are available, is such that its provision cannot bc left until the threat arises. The last decade has demonstrated the rapidity with which threats can change, and it will be obvious that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom forces from South East Asia will do nothing to improve the stability and security in the region. It is also less likely that a United Kingdom bomber force would be stationed in Singapore in the future. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Against this background, my three main objectives were: </para>
        <para>Firstly, to persuade the United States that there were minimum performance criteria below which the aircraft would not be acceptable to Australia; secondly, to have it accepted by the United States that in the event of the aircraft not reaching these performance criteria, Australia should not lose its full investment in the project; and thirdly, to open options for the Australian Government concerning our need to equip the RAAF with a strike bomber capability. </para>

          <title>Minimum Performance Criteria</title>
          <page.no>1341</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Speaking to the first objective, I sought to persuade the United States Administration that Australia needed for strategic reasons an aircraft with a strike capability which was related to our physical environment; that we had no alternative capacity as had the United States; that what was good enough for the United States Air Force could well be unacceptable to Australia because of our particular requirements. We needed the right combination of range and carrying and penetration capacity. I reminded the United States that when we originally ordered this aircraft, the British had a significant strike capability stationed in Singapore. It is a. capability that will no longer be committed to the region and I argued that this made it all the more important for this gap in Australia's weapon systems to be adequately overcome. Persistent argument along these lines by the Mission during the visit to Washington has now, I am pleased to report, for the first time achieved agreement on the operational and technical assurances that will be required on delivery of the F111C aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force. If the aircraft do not reach these minimum operational and technical criteria, the aircraft will be unacceptable to Australia and the United States has accepted this. </para>
        <para>The United States Defense Department now understands that to meet our strategic need, it is essential that we have an aircraft that meets a minimum range requirement with a specified weapons load and with performance and operational systems that ensure penetration to targets; an aircraft that has structural integrity and proven strength for all required manoeuvres and that before delivery will be brought up to date with all agreed changes to equipment. These assurances include the need for a solution to the current D6ac steel problem and replacement of the wing carry through box with a new design. These understandings have been incorporated in the newly achieved agreement with the United States to which I have already referred, and it is fundamental in our subsequent negotiations on the project It is an agreement that provides protection to our Air Force; it provides a guarantee that if we ultimately do get delivery of the F111C it will be an aircraft that fully meets our requirements. This agreement is thus a major advance, a protection and improvement on the original Memorandum of Understanding and its associated Technical Arrangement. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Let me now deal with our second objective regarding financial responsibility in the event that the F111C does not meet our agreed performance criteria. As I have already indicated, the United States position has been that Australia and the United States went into this project together as partners and that we must share the consequences, good or bad, of the project. I could not accept this proposition nor the proposition that the limit of the responsibility of each partner extended only to its own respective investment and to its agreed obligations. I reminded the United States Government of our acute dissatisfaction in Australia with the project, and said that Australia did not consider that our order of 24 aircraft created a joint project in any real sense; that, on the contrary, this was essentially a United States project in design, in management, supervision of standards of fabrications and construction and contractual arrangements. In addition, I put the view that the Memorandum of Understanding and Technical Arrangement have not been fulfilled as would have been reasonably expected by two allied governments with acknowledged common interests and engaged in mutual defence assistance. I said that the reduction in the US purchases from 1,500 to a little over 500 had had a significant impact on the total programme and on the price of the aircraft, and could produce in the event of the collapse of the project through failure to solve design and manufacturing problems, financial consequences of major importance requiring special consideration between the governments. The reduction in the programme had also a significant impact on the price and availability of F111C to meet attrition and reconnaissance purposes if Australia so required. </para>
        <para>In the result, it was agreed with the US Administration that we could cancel our order within 3 months and receive a partial reimbursement, but this would be subject to the approval of Congress because special legislation would be required. More importantly, however, it was also agreed that should we not cancel at this stage and proceed, but the aircraft does not eventually achieve our now agreed performance criteria, the United States will be prepared to buy back the F111Cs subject to two conditions. These are that the Fill series aircraft are being used actively in the United States Air Force inventory, and that the approval of Congress is obtained. If we do not cancel now, and if it is later demonstrated that the F111C aircraft meets our operational and technical criteria, we should be obliged to accept them, and this of course we would be most willing to do. These agreements, which are included in the Agreed Minute, constitute an obligation by the United States Administration under certain circumstances to buy back the aircraft. </para>
        <para>There was no agreement on the financial arrangements that would ensue if the total project failed and the Fill is of no use to either Government, and we agreed to differ on that point. My advisers, however, told me that they think it unlikely that the aircraft will not be actively used by the United States Air Force. Thus, two specific alternatives have been opened for the Australian Government: first, the United States has given us the absolute right to cancel the FI 1 1C aircraft within 3 months and second, we may cancel the F111C aircraft in the event that the agreed technical and performance criteria needed by the RAAF are not achieved. </para>
        <para class="block">Buy-back Arrangements </para>
        <para>If the Government takes either of these alternatives the buy-back figure would be between $US130m and $US150m. Now, honourable members may argue that this figure should be higher, but we need to have regard to the realities of the situation. We need to have regard to the fact that the Original Memorandum of Understanding and the associated Technical Arrangement, tabled in this House, did not give us a right to get a single dollar back if the aircraft did not meet our requirements. We have in the place of nothing, arranged a sum negotiable between $US130m and $US150m. This is a significant advance. I should say something about how this figure was reached. And this aspect is important in assessing US Department of Defence expectancy in getting a measure of this kind through the United States Congress. We were advised that if the United States had  to  buy these aircraft back, they would probably want to convert them to the new FI 1. 1 F model. They have taken the cost of buying back our aircraft and the cost of conversion to the 'F' model, and this works out at roughly the figure that they would have to pay in buying new F1 1 1F aircraft. This means that the total cost of conversion of our 24 F111Cs to American FI 1 1 Fs, would be about the same to the United States as if they bought the aircraft originally ordered as 'F' models. </para>

        <para>In November of 1969 Cabinet approved a total of $US300m for the strike version of the 24 F111Cs. On all the information so far available to us, if we do ultimately get delivery of these aircraft the cost should be within that upper limit. Of this total, work involving $US252m has so far been formally authorised. We would, however, have some additional obligations beyond that. To the maximum extent possible, further authorisations will be withheld until we are in a position to make firm decisions whether or not the aircraft will meet our requirements. Thus, in the event of cancellation the full commitment could be somewhat less than the $US300m, but I am not able to give the House a precise calculation as to how much less than that total figure. It would be against this sum that we would receive a reimbursement of between $US130m and $US150m from the agreed buy-back arrangements. </para>
        <para class="block">Recovery Programme 1 want to indicate in greater detail some of the problems involved in the recovery programmes for this aircraft I have already mentioned that there are three basic problems. The first concerns the question of getting our aircraft to 100% of our now agreed flight envelope. The second concerns the wing carry through box - of which you have heard much on previous occasions - and the third concerns the D6ac steel. I want now to deal in more depth with the first and third of these problems.  100% Flight Envelope </para>
        <para>I have already mentioned that the successful completion of static, fatigue and flight tests scheduled at this stage to be completed by the middle of 1971 will be crucial in demonstrating whether or not the aircraft will ever reach 100% flight envelope with the required fatigue life. In consequence, it will be about the end of 1971 before we will be able to establish some confidence that the aircraft will perform as we require. However, it could be significantly later than that, lt is our opinion that it will only be after our aircraft have been through the USAF Inspection and Repair as Necessary, or IRAN, programme in the United States that we can expect them to be capable of 100% flight envelope and ready for full operational use. We would need to be confident that the IRAN programme was going to achieve this objective before entering our aircraft. The process is one of disassembly, detailed inspection and testing, including non-destructive testing of structural members and then reconditioning and refurbishing. In particular this programme for the FU1C would need to include the installation of such new parts and modifications which the various test programmes have shown to be necessary to bring the aircraft to the required performance. The function of the IRAN programme is to ensure that the aircraft is in an airworthy condition in its operational role. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Let me now detail the problems concerning the D6ac sted. The present USAF plan for the recovery of its aircraft combines a low temperature proof loading test with non-destructive inspection or NDI. Of the aircraft concerned about 100 will have been through this process by September 1970. The first aircraft will enter the programme in May 1970 and the last should be returned to the USAF by August 1971. It is expected that USAF aircraft surviving this programme will be released for a restricted period flying in conditions up to 80% of the full flight envelope. It should be noted that there are marked differences in interpretation of the scientific data between the United States and Australian scientific advisers. In short, the differences concern the methods of inspection and of evaluation of the D6ac steel. To have any certainty concerning the structural integrity of this aircraft, it will be necessary to measure under field conditions cracks in the D6ac steel of the order of less than l/20th of an inch. Even cracks of less than <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of an inch could lead to a catastrophic failure. </para>

        <para class="block">Cancel F111C Purchase within 3  Months  and do not replace it with another Strike Aircraft </para>
        <para>I would like to restate and emphasise that it is the Government's view, strongly supported by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, that an air strike force is an essential element of a balanced defence force for Australia. Without a strike force, we could not carry out effective counter air operations against aircraft on the ground, air bases and supporting installations. Counter air operations are a critical element in any air defence capability. An air strike force has deterrent value. The United Kingdom deterrent force will have gone from South East Asia. The last decade demonstrated the rapidity with which threats can change. The lead-time involved in reintroducing an aircraft, assuming one is available, into actual operational readiness could be several years from the decision date. </para>
        <para>If we chose  to  cancel now, we could expect, under the terms of the Agreed Minute, to be paid for our aircraft and spares something between $USI30m and $US150m. We would cut our risk of loss. But our 24 aircraft sold to the United States and representing a financial loss might later be proved capable of our full performance requirement and we would have no strike aircraft. The Government has decided against this course of action for two specific reasons.  We  need the strike bomber capability in the Australian Force structure. Without it our policies will lack credibility. Secondly, if the F111 is ultimately proved, the RAAF continue to say that it best meets Australian requirements. </para>

        <para class="block">Cancel F111C Purchase within 3 Months under Buy-Back and Replace it with Phantom F4E Aircraft plus Reconnaissance and Tanker Aircraft </para>
        <para>The Government does not believe  that the  possibility of  the  FI 1 1 failing  to  achieve our flight envelope is  so  remote that we should adopt this course at this time. If such a decision was taken,  we  would  be  saying that the likely delay in getting the F111C, that is a minimum delay of about  3 years  and possibly more, is unacceptable; that the chances of the F111 coming good  are  remote and that we must have a different strike aircraft. This course would enable us to get an effective strike bomber capability into the RAAF inventory in about a year. We would however again face the possibility, as in Option 1, that F111 aircraft might later be proved capable of flying to our full performance requirement, while we had acquired at a higher price an inferior aircraft to the F111C. Financially we could under this option, expect to get back between $US130m and $US150m. However, the total cost of a force of 40 F4Es, 8 RF4Es and 8 tankers, which the RAAF estimate to be a force broadly equivalent to the F111C force, would be to the order of $US414m. To this would have to be added the loss on the F111. It is clear that for this option we would have to pay substantially more than to stay on our present course, even though some part of the tanker cost could be attributed to the later need to replace Hercules transports. </para>

        <para>Storage of F111Cs and Awaiting IRAN </para>
        <para>We could put the FI I1Cs into long term storage and await the results of the investigations into the D6ac steel and the results of the static, fatigue and proof testing which alone will indicate whether our aircraft will reach 100% of our required flight envelope. The advantages of leaving our aircraft in the United States until after they had been through the FRAN programme are in the Government's view overwhelming. In the first place we cannot' for many engineering reasons connected with the use of the [&gt;6ac steel accept the aircraft until the proof testing and the NDI testing have been completed. The earliest that there may be better understanding of these problems is in September this year, lt is likely to be later. More significant, however, is the fact that it is not until December 1971 at the earliest that we would be able to make a decision concerning the likely ability of our aircraft to reach 100% of our required performance. I have again indicated it could he much later. </para>
        <para>If we made a decision to accept the aircraft before we knew that they would reach 100% of, the flight envelope, we would have sold the pass on a major advance achieved by the mission, namely acceptance by the United States of minimum performance for the Australian aircraft, giving us a right to cancel the aircraft under a buyback arrangement if it does not reach that performance. This right must be preserved. It can only be preserved if we refuse to accept the aircraft until we know that it will reach Australian strategic requirements. There is this other subsidiary factor: If we did make a decision to accept the aircraft later this year presuming that the </para>
        <para class="block">D6ac steel problems had been overcome we would still be taking the aircraft in the faith that they would reach their full performance envelope. We would get delivery of them in the latter part of 1971, but because they would not have been through the IRAN programme they would not be able to fly lo their full flight envelope. They would not be fully operational. It would be necessary, therefore, to begin returning them to the United States in late 1972 for the IRAN programme which includes the fitting of new parts and modifications to enable them to achieve fully operational status. </para>
        <para>The Government believes it would be quite unsatisfactory and unacceptable to have new aircraft in Australia for such a short time and have to return them to the United States for a major modification programme; especially so, since for that short time the aircraft would not be fully operational. The approach of storing our FI MC and awaiting IRAN as outlined in this option has the potential of providing the cheapest solution to our problems. Also this approach has the potential of providing the Royal Australian Air Force with the opportunity lo acquire aircraft which it firmly believes will still be the best one for our particular role. ft is, however, a course that involves very considerable delay and, as a result of this, it is one that leads to other problems which the Government has had to examine. In talking of delay we need to have in mind that all the dates which have been mentioned concerning the possible time of decisions and concerning the IRAN programme and ultimate delivery are subject to slippage. But at the best it would look like getting FI 1 1C aircraft fully operational some time in 1974. And we at the same time need to have in mind the possibility that the aircraft may still fail. We would be unlikely to bc able to make that judgment before lute 1971. </para>
        <para>The Government is clearly concerned about this delay, but if we are ultimately to take delivery of the F111C aircraft, in view of ali the facts, there is no alternative but to accept it. And thus it has made the decision to leave our aircraft in the United States until all the technical and scientific problems have been overcome and until we know that our aircraft will reach their full flight envelope. I reiterate that this decision has been made possible because of 2 of the advances achieved by the mission: Firstly, the agreed performance envelope which gives us the option of cancelling if the aircraft do not meet that envelope; and, secondly, because the buyback arrangements apply not only to present cancellation but to cancellation at a later date if our performance is not reached. </para>

        <para>Storage and Awaiting IRAN and Acquiring an Interim Aircraft </para>
        <para>Because of the delay, however, I felt it necessary to probe the United States on the possibility of leasing an interim aircraft. The United States has offered us up to 24 new F4E aircraft to fill the gap. While the Government is disposed to accept this offer, its decision will depend very largely on the time during which the Phantom F4E could be in operation in Australia and be effective as a strike force. On the basis of information given us by the United States Air Force we could take delivery of the F4E aircraft towards the latter part of this year and they would become operational between March and July 1971. </para>
        <para>The Government has therefore asked the Royal Australian Air Force as a matter of urgency to send an expert evaluation team to the United States to examine the offer of an interim force of F4Es in greater detail, and I am pleased to report that the team, headed by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, left on Sunday, 10th May. The RAAF evaluation team will concentrate on matters of substance associated with the interim force of 18 to 24 F4Es. Its task would include a careful examination and refinement by negotiation of all costs; the likely date of delivery arid the time when they will become operational; detailed arrangements for air crew and ground staff training including initial and continuation in-flight refuelling and the availability of spare parts and special equipment on loan from the USAF. </para>
        <para>I mentioned the time scale in which we might be able to get an interim force into operation. I would like to draw the House's attention to the other end of the time scale, when the Phantom force might be phased out and replaced by the F111C, and this will be a matter also for further investigation by the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
        <para class="block">Providing the Fill programme goes well, we should be able to make a judgment by the end of next year at the earliest whether or not the aircraft will ultimately be suitable to us. Since we believe it is desirable that some USAF aircraft go through the IRAN programme before ours, we could envisage ours entering the IRAN programme in January 1973 at the earliest. We would get delivery of the last aircraft late in 1963 and they would become operational in 1 974. There would be a phase in period in which some Phantoms would be operating while the F111C force was building up. If this time scale prevailed Phantoms would be operating up to about July 1973, which would be for over 2 years at the minimum. Of course, if the F111C aircraft failed to meet our performance criteria, we would need to keep the Phantoms and convert them into the permanent force. The United States Air Force estimates that the cost of leasing 24 F4Es for 2 years would be a total of $US39m. This is the preliminary estimate provided lo us by the United States Air Force. It is one of the significant matters to be examined in detail by the RAAF evaluation team. </para>
        <para>In summary, therefore, before making a firm and final decision on the suitability of the Phantom, we want the Royal Australian Air Force evaluation team to examine in greater detail and advise us on all the matters above which I have roughly outlined on the basis of United States Air Force advice to us. I will also be pursuing with the United States arrangements which might be necessary if more permanent tanker support is required. We would also need to be convinced that the Phantom force could be rapidly expanded to the full requirement of 48 aircraft if the FI 1 1Cs fail. </para>
        <para class="block">Phantom F4E as an Interim Aircraft </para>
        <para>It should be noted that the Phantom F4E is the aircraft recommended by the Royal Australian Air Force as an interim force and it is also the aircraft recommended by the Royal Australian Air Force if the F111C ultimately fails to reach our performance criteria. However, the RAAF would much prefer the F111C if that aircraft is ultimately proved, because of its much greater range, its independence of tanker support and its ability to drop its weapon load accurately in daylight, in night, or in cloud. The Phantom can drop <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> weapon load with comparable accuracy if it can see the target, but its blind performance is markedly inferior to that of the F111. In addition, of course, its range is much less than that of the F111. And if we were restricted in the use of airfields in Australia tanker support would be essential. The aircraft, however, would be capable of deployment to and operation from airfields in Singapore and Malaysia and with the availability of those airfields, would have a most useful range. </para>
        <para>While I make no great point of it, I should indicate that the United States has undertaken to provide tanker support for training purposes and in other circumstances if appropriate. The United States Department of Defense has also assured us that it will assist us in the acquisition of additional quantities of F4E aircraft and tankers should these be required. In short, much greater range without tanker support and a superior blind bombing capability, originally led the RAAF to select the F111 over the F4C. It should not be overlooked however that while there are many points in favour of the F111C compared to the F4E the latter aircraft is a proven machine and much valuable experience has been established in its favour. </para>
        <para>I summarise the foregoing as follows: Firstly, my negotiations with the United States Secretary of Defense have produced a more satisfactory distribution of responsibility between Australia and the United States in this project: and they have given us assurances that we did not previously have.

            <para>- I have listened with interest to the debates on Vietnam that have recently taken place in the Senate and have been amazed at the amount of silly talk that they have contained. It has been surprising to me that affairs should be conducted in this Parliament in the way that this debate has proceeded on what is deemed to be a Supply Bill. I am just a simple minded person who thinks of things in simple terms. Some of the things that have been said in this chamber today and were said here last week just could not be comprehended by anybody with a sense of logic. At times I have wondered what honourable senators have been talking about. For instance, we have heard a lot of talk about the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign from people who say: 'We want peace'. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have heard it said that the American and Australian troops should get out of Vietnam. That is the sort of talk that has gone on in this debate. I say that it is time we got back to the basic points of this situation. Who is trying to kid whom? Americans are accused of being warlike Fascists by people who say that our troops are not in Vietnam by right. To the people who claim that they want peace I say that it is quite easy to get peace if both sides agree. The people who are so determined to have peace should go to those people who really can give them peace. They are the members of the Vietcong and the Communists of North Vietnam. </para>

              <para>-  More than one country has been divided in recent times. I am a teetotaller, but when somebody tells me that we are the aggressors, and after listening to some other arguments that have been advanced here, I wonder whether I can really be sober. Those arguments put forward by honourable senators opposite carry no weight whatsoever. Those ideas are absolute stupidity and contain no logic or fact. In simple terms, American and Australian troops are in Vietnam not because they are the aggressors but because they have been called in to help to defend people who are being ill-treated in a state of war by people who are the aggressors. </para>

              <para>-  If that fact is denied it would make one wonder what credence can be given to any argument the honourable senator has tendered in this debate. It is a fact, and we are there trying to help people to defend their own country. Is there anything wrong with that? Members of the Labor Party in years gone by held themselves out as great supporters of democracy. They said that they believed in democracy. Not only do I believe in democracy but I also practise it wherever possible. If honourable senators opposite believe in democracy they should practise it. The people of South Vietnam are asking for help to be safe from the invaders of their country. </para>

              <para>-  If you do not know, you should know that the Australian troops are there to help the Vietnamese people. Gory stories are told about the terrible Americans and terrible Australians. It is said that those Australians are a terrible lot who are there fighting for democracy and to keep people in their own country. But what do we hear from honourable senators opposite about the atrocities which the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese inflict on the people of South Vietnam? What about the atrocities that they have inflicted on the people of Cambodia? I challenge honourable senators opposite to deny that Cambodia is a country which has tried to remain neutral and at peace. But what has happened? The Communists of North Vietnam have marched down into that country and used it as a base from which to transport materials in order to fight the people of South Vietnam. </para>

          <para>If any member of the Opposition tries to tell me that we are the aggressors I begin to wonder at the basis of the Opposition's arguments. They have no logical base whatever. I challenge any honourable senator opposite to say whether this is not something of which democracy should be proud. We are there helping people to maintain themselves in their homeland. When we hear of the atrocities that are being inflicted on these people by the Communist element it makes one believe thai the Labor Party would want to stir itself to do something to defend these people. 1 cannot understand what has happened to the Labor Party. At one time it called itself a party of humanitarian character, a party that believed in true democracy. What has gone wrong with it? I think it has gone off the track because it has become carried away by these people and will not believe that they can do anything wrong, even when they butcher, slaughter and torture innocent people. It is time thai members of the Labor Party woke up. I believe that the people of Australia will not have them in government while they talk like this. If I were the public relations officer for the Liberal Party and Country Party, if I could not put this talk from the Labor Party to our advantage so that we would win an election I would eat my hat. </para>

              <para>- I am not a rejected backbencher. 1 have been here since 1949. I have sat in the Party room and I have said lo the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> that 1 am not interested in the Ministry. I have represented Queensland since 1949 and I have done what lots of people in this chamber have not been prepared to do; I have voted according to my conscience, even if it meant that I was to be thrown out of the Parliament, lt is to the credit of the Liberal Party that we have the freedom to express our conscience, and it is to the credit of the Labor Party that 1 have been re-endorsed time after time. Only about 3 months ago when it was last thought that 1 was being written off I was again endorsed for the forthcoming Senate election as No. 1 on the Queensland Senate ticket. No-one in this chamber is able to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has not been game to express his opinion and to cany his opinion to a vote according to his conscience. The Senate knows full well that I say what I believe, and I want to say now that I believe that our people, in joining in and helping to defend the people of Vietnam, are doing a humanitarian job. They are opposing people who are far from humanitarian in their attitude to the people of that country. </para>

          <para>I was pleased when the United States saw fit to stop fighting the battle with one arm behind its back, when it went into Cambodia to attack the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. I believe that was one of the best things that could have happened for democracy. The North Vietnamese have their supply lines in Cambodia and their forces are being fed through Cambodia in order to keep the battle going. Now thai the Americans have taken on the North Vietnamese in the Cambodian region we find a complete change in the fighting on this front. I hope that this action will go on until the North Vietnamese are routed completely. If the North Vietnamese are knocked back completely I feel that peace can come to that area. That must have been the desire of these people for a long time. </para>
          <para>There has been a cry today about the tremendous crowds that turned up for the demonstrations last week. In Melbourne there were about 15,000 to 20.000 people in the streets, but many of them were children. We cannot count the bystanders at the side of the street as being part of the crowd of demonstrators. If <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> had been shopping in the streets of Melbourne I could not. be counted as one of the demonstrators We hear talk about the crowd that was present. Melbourne had the biggest crowd. But even a decent football match in Melbourne would attract many more people than that. It would not be of any great concern to us in north Queensland that a few thousand people turned out to see a football match in Victoria. When we boil it all down, throughout the whole country how many people turned out for this demons! ration when you take into account the number of children who were present and the number of people of the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Labor Party who seized the opportunity to make a display for political purposes? When you find out the number of people who had feelings on this subject and who turned out for the demonstration you find that there were not many at all. 1 do not get carried away by the reports of the number at the demonstrations. Some pressmen will play up the figures. Some have suggested that as many as 100.000 people were present, but the actual number was much less. It must have been disappointing to honourable senators opposite because they wanted it to be a display that would carry them along on a political wave such as they have tried to achieve in the past. As one who has some political nouse and is able to tell how elections generally will go, let me say to honourable senators opposite that they are the best people in the world to keep themselves out of office. They have been very successful at keeping themselves out of office. Does the Senate remember the election when John Kennedy was shot? At that time the then Prime Minister was knocking at the knees about getting back into office, but what was the Labor Party doing? lt was knocking the North West Cape installation and our boys fighting for democracy in Malaysia. When Kennedy was shot by a Communist the Labor Party shot its bolt and had no possibility of getting in. I am not merely saying this after the event; I told members of the Labor Party and lots of other people that it would happen. </para>

Consider the next election when the Labor Party had an opportunity of getting into office. What did it do? Its members shot their mouths off against conscription. I remind honourable senators opposite that I told their leader before he went out on this platform that if he did so he would be a gone coon. </para>

              <para>-  No, but I am saying now that I said to him: 'You will be a gone coon.' He said: 'Oh, no! Mothers are against conscription.' I said: 'No. The great bulk of the people of Australia want the insurance policy that America will be by their side whenever they need assistance.' What happened then? The Labor Party came back almost decimated, at a time when it had had a wonderful opportunity. In view of the loyalty of the people of this country, their belief in standing up for democracy and for the freedom of individuals in this and other countries, if the Labor Party comes out with this sort of thing again it will be decimated again and the opportunity that it might have had will be gone to the moon. </para>

              <para>-  Our Party has a sense of public relations and good political nouse. Honourable senators opposite are giving my Party a wonderful opportunity to come back with greatly increased numbers. We, as Australians, have people fighting in Vietnam in the name of this country. Never at any time does everybody agree with everything that a government does, and naturally in a war, or in a conflict such as that in Vietnam, there are always some people who say. 'We do not agree with what the Government is doing.' But there is this basic thought in most people's minds: If you are in a thing from a national point of view, you are in it.' The good sense and loyalty of the Australian people will make them say: 'They are our boys over there. We have to remain loyal to them. We cannot shoot them in the back, because they are our people.' The average Australian has strength of character and loyalty, and if he feels that any Party or any group will shoot our own boys in the back - whether by disloyal actions or the attitudes which have been expressed in recent times - he wilt ensure that that Party will be given the right answer at the next election. Honourable senators opposite speak about the Americans and say that they should not be in Vietnam. 1 saw some of the placards. </para>

Honourable senators opposite talk about the Americans and they say that they should not be up there in Vietnam and that they should be sent home. The placards 1 saw called them mercenaries, brutal people, butchers, murderers and so on. lt. is a marvellous thing to see to whom people will appeal when they need something. I recall that during the last war when the Labor Parly was in office and John Curtin was Prime Minister he made an appeal when this country was desperately in need of assistance. To whom did John Curtin appeal for help? lt was to the great United States. </para>

          <para class="block">Prime Minister, but a Labor Prime Minister who called to the United States for help. If this country needed assistance again, if it were ever attacked by any country again, to whom do you think Australia would appeal? lt would be the United States. I am convinced that the average Australian believes in his own mind that the greatest insurance policy which any Australian government can give this country is by cooperating and working with the United Slates in the fight for freedom and liberty not only in this country but in other countries which need our assistance, lt staggers me to hear honourable senators opposite who are failing in what their Party has stood for over the years - the love of democracy and the belief that we should help the underdog and those people who need help - now talk as they have done tonight. Surely the people of South Vietnam deserve the help and assistance of all those who love and believe in democracy and the right and opportunity for everybody to live in the way he desires. 1 hope that this issue in Vietnam will continue until the Vietcong, the North Vietnamese and the Communists will be so crushed that the flower of liberty will blossom and grow much greater and much better than ever before in the South East Asian area. I am proud to be associated wilh a Government which stands up for these rights. I only hope that the leaders of this Government, instead of sitting back and taking a defensive attitude, will take more of the offensive in this political fight and show the Australian people that what is being done is the right thing for the preservation of liberty and democracy. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>WHEELDON  (Western Australia) [9.46J - 1 think that members of the Australian Labor Party appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood's</inline> contribution. It was a sincere contribution. We know very well that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> would very much like (o sec the present Government defeated and the Australian Labor Party elected to office. He has been doing his very best to give us some advice as to how we should accomplish this end. He has found it necessary to include a little bit of the usual oratory which <inline font-style="italic">members</inline> of the Liberal Party are expected to engage in on these occasions, but 1 do not think that we should allow ourselves to lose sight of the basic objective of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood's</inline> contribution tonight, and that is, to suggest to us how we should defeat the present Government. </para>
          <para>He has suggested to us that if we were to oppose the war in Vietnam this would take the heat off us and we would be able to concentrate on the Government's follies which he mentioned in passing, without referring to them specifically, and having done so we would be able to get  rid  of the Government and therefore satisfy him. I think that several years ago there may possibly have been some validity in this argument. There is no question that when troops were first sent to Vietnam, the </para>
          <para>Old  argument about 'my country right or wrong' carried some weight with the majority of the Australian people  and  that those who were opposed to the war were accused of sabotaging in some way the war effort, of stabbing our boys in the back, and we were losing some votes at that time. 1 do not believe that this is the case at the present time. I believe that, just as in the United States of America at this time, the majority of the Australian people are opposed lo Australia's participation in the Vietnam war. </para>
          <para>It is no use comparing the crowds at the Moratorium demonstrations with the crowds at a football match. They should be compared with crowds at any other political meeting. The Australian people have shown that they are opposed to Australia's participation in the Vietnam war by the greatest series of political demonstrations which have been seen in this country for decades and which took place over the past few days in support of the cessation of Australia's participation in the Vietnam war. If one felt that there were votes to be gained and offices to be won by supporting the war in Vietnam, and that even if one felt it was wrong that would be a reason for supporting it, I do not believe that the Labor Party came into existence merely to acquire jobs for people who were looking for them. The Labor Party came into existence in order to advocate policies, whether those policies are popular or unpopular. Policies which we once held to, which were unpopular and which were derided by our opponents have now been accepted even by the most reactionary members of the Liberal and Country Parties, not because they would accept these policies if they thought that they could get away wilh opposing them, but because they know that the great bulk of Australian people have come now to support those policies. </para>
          <para>Apart from the advice that he gave us, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> said a couple of things about the nature of the war in Vietnam and Cambodia about which I should like to comment. One of them was that he hoped that American forces would remain inside Cambodia until the time when they had won a complete victory over the forces of the North Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. I am afraid that his hopes are doomed to be dashed in this matter because even the  President  of the United States has said that the United States intends to withdraw its troops from Cambodia approximately 7 weeks from now at the latest. The United States has no intention of staying inside Cambodia for any long period - certainly not until such time as the Government and people of North Vietnam have been defeated. </para>
          <para>The other argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> raised - an argument which we have heard frequently - was the argument concerning the insurance policy which we were supposed to be obtaining from the United States of America by sending forces into Vietnam; the old argument has been that if we were to do something for the United States now the United States would be so impressed by our 3 battalions of conscripts that whether or not its national interests appeared to demand it the United States would come to our rescue at some time in the future. When this argument was put forward first it was pointed out that it was palpable nonsense, that the United States would come to our assistance only if it believed that it was in its national interest to do so, and that it would not come to our interest in some future conflict if it did not believe this to be the case. The  President  of the United States, the United States Administration and every national leader in the United States have made it clear that, whatever the outcome of the present conflict in Indo-China may be, the United States does not intend to participate in future conflicts of this nature in Asia. The very cheap insurance policy whereby we hoped to obtain the support of all the armed forces of the United States of America by sending a couple of battalions of conscripts to Vietnam has been cancelled already by the insurer before anybody has made any demand for the payment of damages. The United States has made it perfectly clear that in no wars of this nature in future will it become involved in South East Asia. </para>
          <para>I believe that what members of the Government parties have said about the Moratorium has reflected very ill on all the members of the Government parties. They have agitated constantly - some of them in particular, but I do not include all of them - in order to insult, deride and abuse the Australian Labor Party and other people, including the Jesuit priest who was the  Chairman  of the Moratorium rally in Perth, members of a large number of religious denominations and all kinds of non-political people who have had the courage to come forward and say that they are opposed to the Vietnam war. I was very disappointed when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> indulged in such tactics. Normally in the past, he, unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> has not engaged in such tactics. I would not include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> in the same category as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> by a kind of guilt by association process except that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> happens to belong to the same political party as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> Except for that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> bears no resemblance to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> made reference to the carrying of Vietcong flags, the clear implication being that because certain persons taking part in the Moratorium demonstration carried Vietcong flags, therefore, the members of the Australian Labor Party who supported the Moratorium supported the Vietcong also. A number of people would support the Vietcong. I personally, I do not deny, do support the Vietcong because  1  believe that the Vietcong represents the great mass of the South Vietnamese people. I make no apology for this. I do say that a great number of people - a majority of the people who took part in the Moratorium - do not agree with me on this. They would rather see some other cessation of the hostilities in Vietnam. They merely asked for the withdrawal of Australian troops so that peace could be attained. </para>
          <para>If anybody accuses me of being around when somebody was carrying a Vietcong flag, I will not apologise. I will not withdraw. I will not say that I was not there. I will not say that I would have left the </para>

          <para class="block">march if I had seen the Vietcong flag being carried. I did see some people carrying Vietcong flags and  1  did not withdraw from the march. In saying that, however, I do not come here as an advocate of the Vietcong. My support for the Vietcong is a purely theoretical support. My attitude  to  the war in Vietnam is that whales er happens inside Vietnam is a matter for settlement by the Vietnamese people and that what is happening in Indo-China is no business of the Australian people, the Australian Army or the Australian Government. Young Australians should not be conscripted to be sent to Indo-China to be killed. My policy as far as Australia and Vietnam are concerned is that Australia should not be intervening in that country. If people, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> feel strongly about our involvement and want to fight there - people who have heard the call to arms and who believe that people ought to be getting fired at and killed in Vietnam - they should go there. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said that he had enlisted in some force to fight in Vietnam,  1  would say that clearly he had the courage of his convictions. Although I disagree with him, I could not object to his doing this. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> wanted to fight there, as I think he does -  1  am sure he would like to fight there but apparently something is inhibiting him from going - I would not condemn him for doing this because he would at least be showing that he was prepared to make the same sacrifice as those persons whom he has voted to send there and get killed. </para>
          <para>I want to raise another matter referred lo by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline> He mentioned what he described as the 'invasion of Cambodia' by the Vietcong. He condemned those members of the Australian Labor Party who are opposed to the American intervention in Cambodia. It is one thing to say: 'I disagree with Labor senators who are opposed to the American intervention in Cambodia,' but it was another thing when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> said that not only did he disagree with us but that in fact we were subversives, we were traitors and we were dishonourable people - an allegation which we have never made against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> but one which, by implication, he was clearly making against us. </para>

If it is to be said that because members of the Australian Labor Party are opposed to the American intervention in Cambodia we are treacherous and we are subversive, the Government will have to concede that a majority of the members of the United States Senate also are treacherous and subversive because the viewpoint of the Australian Labor Party - the viewpoint of honourable senators sitting in opposition in this chamber - on the American intervention in Cambodia is the same as the viewpoint of a majority of members of the United States Senate. </para>

All I am saying is that the point could be made with equal logic as the point which says that because we are associated with certain people in opposing the Moratorium we are the same as those people. </para>
          <para>However, my purpose in rising was to raise another matter. It is a <inline font-style="italic">matter</inline> which 1 raised this afternoon by way of a question. We are told - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> repeated it tonight - that we are fighting in Vietnam and we are supporting the invasion of Cambodia by troops of the United States of America because we stand for freedom. If freedom means anything it means the free dissemination of ideas, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement. The question I asked this afternoon was on another episode in the series of refusals of visas to persons to enter Australia. The man to whom I am referring is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel,</inline> an author and scholar from Belgium who is well known throughout the world. He has been refused permission to enter Australia. He was to be in Australia for a period of 5 days, during which he was to deliver some lectures at a Socialist scholars' conference to be held in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel,</inline> who is a Belgian Marxist, is the author of a very serious study of Marxist thought entitled Marxist Economic Theory'. In 1967 he wrote 'The Formation of Marxist Economic Thought'. In 1968 he wrote a book entitled 'Europe Versus America'. Both books have been reviewed by serious critics throughout the world. I know that a number of the more hill-billy - I will withdraw that word and substitute the expression 'less erudite' - supporters of the Government Parties- </para>

I think it should be pointed out that Herr Willy Brandt, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany is a Marxist, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Bruno</inline> Kreisky, the Chancellor of Austria, is also a Marxist. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> will do his own bit of smearing later on and I do not want- </para>

They are Marxist Social Democratic parties. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel</inline> has lectured and travelled extensively in Britain, France, India, Italy and Ceylon. In fact, he has travelled and lectured extensively all over the world. He visits Britain regularly. In March and April of this year he lectured at 12 universities in Britain. In 1968 he visited the United States of America where he lectured at 33 universities and colleges. </para>
          <para>In 1969 he applied for a visa to re-enter the United States in order to give another series of lectures, but his visa was refused when objection was taken by the United States Justice Department. 1 know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> will now think that if the United States has refused him a visa we should do the same. 1 think I should go on to say that the Justice Department was criticised by the State Department for the ban it applied. The State Department dissociated itself from the refusal by the Justice Department to issue a visa to him. It was condemned by a number of organisations and newspapers, including the New York 'Times'. I know that probably <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Sholl would think that it is owned by Jews and therefore it is responsible for this trouble. The Justice Department was condemned by the New York 'Times' as well as by Professor J. K. Galbraith, who, I remind those honourable senators who are aware and tell those honourable senators who were not aware previously, was the United States Ambassador to India under  President  Kennedy. In fact, in order to get around the ban, a debate was arranged between Professor Galbraith and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel.</inline> They were not even on the same side. They were placed against each other. The debate was shown on an international hook-up. </para>

He was coming here to lecture on a scholarly subject to a group of scholars interested in the problems of Marxism, problems of Socialism and problems of the Labour movement.

I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> finds what 1 am saying funny.

              <para>- I am not retreating from any statement whatsoever. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has the opportunity to speak later I would like him to point out where I have retreated. 1 assure him that I have not retreated from any statement. One thing which can be said about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is that he has never retreated from Vietcong forces in Vietnam because he has never been there to see them. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel</inline> was coming to Australia in order to engage in a discussion over a period of 5 days - to deliver lectures for 5 days - but he has been refused permission to enter this country. The only interpretation which can be put on this refusal is that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel</inline> has been refused entry into this country because this Government is afraid of the free dissemination of ideas. The same sort of tactic was adopted by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> when he referred to the Moratorium demonstrators as pack raping bikies or whatever it was. The use of the same sort of tactic was adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> with his stories about molotov cocktails being manufactured in Adelaide. The same unsubstantiated stories have been told with a completely careless disregard for whom they may hurt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is just as careless of the reputations of his fair, fellow Australians as he is of the lives of those Australians whom he votes to send to Vietnam. He will do anything to gain some publicity for himself. He will discredit his opponents in order to get that job which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> now occupies and which he tried unsuccessfully to obtain today only to find that even the Australian Democratic Labor Party left the Senate in order to avoid the disagreeable duty of having to vote for something for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was responsible. </para>

              <para>- I repeat, they turned out in their hundreds of thousands, and identified themselves with the Moratorium movement despite all the slanders. This was a case purely of intimidation. But in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel,</inline> there is no need to engage in any intimidation. All that is needed is to refuse to issue a document to a person who travels backwards and forwards to and from the United Kingdom where he lectures. There can be no purpose in refusing a visa to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mandel</inline> other than to inhibit free discussion in this country, to stop the discussion of ideas which do not agree with those of this Government. This is what is done by people who parade as supporters of democracy. They say that their purpose in sending conscripts to be killed in Vietnam is to save democracy, but their democracy consists of refusing to allow scholarly discussion, serious discussion relating to the Labor movement, to take place in Australia. This is what they understand by democracy: That we should be a society in which a man who is able to travel freely in Europe, whose books are available throughout the world, should be denied the opportunity to enter this country. This is the democracy that these people stand for. This is the kind of democracy which I and the Australian Labor Party repudiate. </para>

            <para>-  I had no intention of rising to speak on this Bill until I listened to the debate this afternoon and this evening. I was pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> given the opportunity to make a personal explanation and I would like to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> for his democratic approach and at the same time condemn <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> for his undemocratic approach in again denying freedom of speech. The reason I come into this debate is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> this afternoon implied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and others went out of their way to provoke and incite violence in the Moratorium demonstrations held on 8th, 9th and 10th May. This was a complete and utter distortion of fact. Concern was felt by many honourable senators on this side of the chamber as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> and also by members of the Democratic Labor Party, that violence might erupt, and it was thought that the people of Australia should have this fact pointed out to them, lt was thought that particularly those participating in the demonstration should be told that they must exercise complete restraint to make sure that people and property would not be endangered or damaged in any way. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>also said that there were some returned soldiers who interjected and tried to provoke some of the marchers in the Moratorium demonstration in Adelaide. This was reported in the Press. But why did these young men, wearing the returned soldier's ribbons of the Vietnam campaign, see fit to try to take away from some of the marchers Vietcong flags and other banners that indicated support for the Vietcong, the very enemy against whom these young men had been fighting? One young returned soldier said, according to the Press report: 'lt is all very well for these people to march down the streets carrying these banners and flags, but I have been up there. I have fought against the supporters of this flag. 1 have seen comrades shot by those supporters. Then I return to my own country and see people marching and shouting and carrying these flags and banners. Am 1 expected to stand here peacefully and see these people go by? I have seen bullets coming from people carrying these same flags in the country in which 1 served my own country of Australia'. So 1 pose the question again: Why did these young men see fit to provoke some of these marchers in the Moratorium demonstration? Probably all young people and a great bulk of the elderly people of this country would know the name of Normie Rowe. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator would not know him. I would not expect the honourable senator to know him because this young man - is a good Australian. Normie Rowe is one of the top pop singers in Australia, a young lad with a terrific future. He was in England getting right to the top of the entertainment world when he came back to this country. Whilst he was back here he was called up for service in the Army.  His  name came up in the ballot. I feel privileged and particularly proud to know Normie Rowe because 1 think he is one of the finest young Australians I will ever have the opportunity and privilege of knowing. This young man was willing to sacrifice his career in the entertainment world which is a very risky one. He was at the pinnacle or close to it and be went to serve in Vietnam. He has come home and he has nothing but praise for what his comrades have done in Vietnam and for the cause that the Australians, Americans and others are fighting for. </para>

          <para>He said: T wish that some of these people who protest could go and see the good' - I emphasise the word 'good' - 'that my comrades and others have done, not just for the cause of democracy in keeping a foreign enemy out of this country but in helping the reconstruction and development and the opportunity for freedom and advancement for these people.1 Here is a young man who has been willing and prepared to sacrifice not only his career but, if necessary, his life and when he comes back he is prepared to stand up and say these things. Not only has this young man said these things to me but also he has seen fit to tell the world. He has said this on television. He can feel proud of his service and we can feel proud of him and others like him who not only are very proud to have served this country but also are convinced that what they did was right. They are proud to tell the people of Australia that the cause for which they fought was right. </para>
          <para>But 1 want to go further. Much has been said about the Moratorium and the hundreds and hundreds of thousands who marched. I challenge the accuracy of that expression, which was used tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon. Senator Cavanagh</inline> referred to the great success in South Australia. Let us look at these figures factually and on an arithmetical basis. On Friday afternoon - they picked the time of 5 o'clock when they could do the utmost damage and inconvenience the most people - about 2,000 people marched. But it was announced on Friday night: 'Let us not worry about this. Tomorrow is the big day. This is when the numbers will be out. We are going to have 20,000 marching.' the next day they had 5,000. I had the good fortune to have the Saturday afternoon off and I went to a football match in a suburb at which there were 8,000 people. All that the Moratorium organisers could raise was 5,000 people. I do commend those who were in control of this march. 1 must say that in all fairness; I speak about Adelaide. There was some violence on the Friday. </para>

              <para>-  That is the one sort of remark that 1 am not prepared to accept. Neither .1, nor any of my colleagues nor any fair, decent Australian would wish for any violence whatsover in any campaign of this kind. In regard to numbers we have heard from Sentaor Wheeldon a lot about these hundreds of thousands of people. I would like to refer to the meeting that was held in Canberra the other day. My estimate was that there were 300 to 400 people there. 1 also asked members of the Press and others how many they thought were there and many said that there could have been 300 or 400. Some sections of the Press came out with a figure of 1,500 to 2,000 which is something like 5 to 5i times more than were there. So one of these days I am expecting to pick up a newspaper and see that Australia's population stands not at around 12£ million but at about 62 million people. This would be the same distortion of facts. </para>

          <para>I believe the police estimates which differed slightly from the numbers given by the organisers of the Moratorium. Accepting the numbers that t the police have given in various areas all I want to say is this: </para>
          <para class="block">When these numbers are tallied up and related to the population of - Australia it will be found that this Moratorium was a very, very minimal thing as far as numbers were concerned and would have been on a numerical basis a great disappointment to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and the other organisers. 1 make no bones about this because they did not get the numbers they expected. The tragedy of the Moratorium is that a great number of those who marched in many ways would have been innocent of the reasons why there was a Moratorium and a march. There were many people who were and are opposed to war. All of us are opposed to war. There were many school children. I asked school children who were wearing Moratorium badges why they were doing this and they said: 'Because 1 am opposed to war'. They could not go past this, and this is one of the tragedies. The Moratorium gained a lot of support from people who were innocent of many of the tragic facts of the Moratorium itself. Statements were made by the Communist leaders during the French occupation of Indo-China. Ho Chi Minh himself said: 'We will not have to win this war with a frontal military attack. We can play this along with guerilla warfare and other methods. We keep just pinpricking here and there all over the place and by subversive means we can win this war in Paris.' The same thing has been said about the Vietnam war: 'Let us not worry about frontal attacks. By subversive means we can win this war in Washington.' </para>
          <para>Now, what is this Moratorium doing in reality other than assisting the Communist cause of subverting the cause of freedom and democracy and the development of self-government in South Vietnam? This is the great tragedy that is taking place at the present time. We have heard so much from the Opposition and from some of the leaders and organisers of the Moratorium about the atrocities of the Vietnam war, the atrocities that are being committed by the Americans and by our troops. Have we once heard any comment about the atrocities committed by the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese? Have we heard anything about the atrocities committed during the Tet offensive? Have we heard any comment about the atrocities committed during the invasion of Laos by the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong? Have we heard any comment about the Vietcong trying to take over Cambodia? No, not a word. But the moment the Americans go into Cambodia there is a great outcry from the Opposition and screams of 'invasion', tragedy', 'atrocities'. What has been going on in Cambodia for a long time? How many deaths in South Vietnam were being caused by the foothold that the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese had in Cambodia itself? How much longer would the war go on in Vietnam if the Vietcong were allowed to continue their invasion and domination of Cambodia? </para>
