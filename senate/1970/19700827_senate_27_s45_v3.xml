          <para>We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30% of the average weekly male earnings all states plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with the A.C.T.U. policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Pensioners&#39; Federation and by so doing give a reasonably moderate pension. </para>

The Postmaster-General, when informed of this yesterday after a question had been asked in the Senate, immediately instructed that it be cancelled as an operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> inquired as to the reasons for the telephone conversations being recorded. The Postmaster-General indicated that the conversations were recorded for a genuine purpose, authorised by the Director of Posts and Telegraphs in South Australia, the purpose being to ensure that proper selling techniques were used by officers of the Department when inquiries are made regarding new installations or varying the installation of telephones. The conversations were recorded in an endeavour by the Department to ensure that people who answered this type of inquiry answered it to the best advantage of the Department. As I have informed the Senate, the Postmaster-General immediately instructed that the operation should be cancelled. He informed the House this morning, in answer to a question about this matter, that this practice that had been carried out in South Australia would not be repeated. </para>

As the private hospitals in Queensland recently increased their fees to approximately $200 a week and as the maximum benefit payable by hospital benefit funds is approximately $100 a week and the Commonwealth Government since 1958 has paid only $14 a week, will the Minister give urgent, serious and favourable consideration to increasing the Commonwealth daily payment to a more reasonable level than $2 a day?

            <para>- As everybody knows, it is true that towards the end of the last financial year particular measures were taken with regard to finance and that as a result a smaller amount was made available for lending for the construction of houses. I shall give the situation as it is today. During the June quarter there was a small decline in the level of home building activity. The number of dwellings commenced was down by 7% compared with the March quarter when the number of dwellings being commenced reached the near record rate of more than 140,000 per annum. Because of the exceptionally high volume of work in progress at the beginning of the June quarter, the decline in home building activity and employment was very much less than <inline font-style="italic">7%.</inline> The decline occurred in May and June. It was due largely, as I said in my opening comment, to the tightening of the overall availablity of finance and to the rise in interest rates. The change in the monetary situation during the June quarter caused an intensification of the customary seasonal decline in the activities of the permanent building societies. The number and value of loans they approved fell substantially. However, other institutional lenders, especially trading and savings banks and life offices, maintained a high rate of lending for housing. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <para>I deal now with the figures for the current quarter. The number of dwellings to be commenced in the current quarter is likely to be little different from the number commenced in the June quarter, although there may be a further decline in New South Wales. However I expect the level of home building activity throughout most of Australia to be rising again within a month or two. As all honourable senators are aware, the Reserve Bank has asked the trading banks and life assurance companies to maintain the volume of their housing loans in the current quarter. It has also been announced that the savings banks will be making a substantial increase in their lending for housing. The rate of housing loans approved by permanent building societies is also rising and I expect this rise to accelerate. I think it would be interesting, particularly to my Western Australian colleagues, to note that in the past few weeks the number of new loans approved by .the permanent building societies in Western Australia, where the decline has been most severe, is now up to 80% or more of the very high rate at which they were approving loans in the March quarter this year. So I come back to the point I made earlier, that I have every reason to expect building activity to be rising during the December quarter although I accept that there was a decline during the June quarter. </para>

            <para>- I am obliged to the honourable senator for drawing my attention to this part of the statement that I made to the Senate. He refers to a phrase since the introduction of the Commonwealth scholarships scheme in 1951&#39; as being ambiguous and which without further explanation, he says, is likely to mislead. The fact is that associated with the war time organisation of industry the Labor Government, I think as early as 1942, restricted the admissions to universities and at the same time provided scholarships for people to attend universities. Following the war, as part of the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme, the Government made scholarships available. Those 2 schemes are not referred to in the Commonwealth scholarships scheme of 1951 and it is there that the unfortunate and regrettable ambiguity occurs. I want to make it plain that the Labor Government that preceded us and went out of office in 1949 did have Commonwealth scholarship schemes such as 1 have mentioned. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator speaks of an 18 months delay. I was certainly not aware of any delay as long as that. In fact I had thought that the delays were not in excess of 4 weeks. I say this only as a quick answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question. But I shall certainly take the matter up with the Postmaster-General. If there is any particular case the honourable senator can refer to I will certainly place it before the Postmaster-General. </para>

Has the Minister seen a report in today&#39;s &#39;Australian&#39; that evidence is mounting swiftly in the United States of America that  President  Nixon and his critics no longer disagree about even the timetable for full disengagement from Vietnam, which is to be completed by the end of next year? Is the Australian Government so obsessed with its stubbornness over Vietnam that it is unable to announce our timetable for disengagement and withdrawal in clear and positive terms? Should we not be now working <inline font-style="italic">out</inline> the extent of assistance that Australia is prepared to give South Vietnam when our military commitment is terminated? </para>

The circumstances of Australia&#39;s participation and involvement in Vietnam are clearly defined. Government policy is clearly defined. We have a programme in relation to our troops and commitment there. Statements have been made in relation to the movement of those troops. I do not see any point in developing the question further. This is a debating point. In fact, the whole matter was canvassed and debated in another place yesterday. The Government&#39;s policy in relation to the matter is quite clearly denned. </para>

          <para class="block">Dealing with the first part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, yes, I have seen a reference to the open letter to which the honourable senator referred. This again is an expression of view by certain people in relation to the problems in South East Asia, notably in Cambodia. I think it is quite important as an expression of view. As to the reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> I can rely only upon what I have read. I have in fact read - and nobody has challenged the statement - that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> did invite certain people from the countries concerned to come to Australia as a part of the Moratorium Campaign and matters associated with it. I think it would be deplorable if we encouraged those people to come here having regard to the fact that we have an Australian involvement in Vietnam. It would be a complete affront, having in mind the policy of the Government in this matter, to those men of ours, and also women in certain fields, who are in the South East Asian area representing Australia and who are confronted by enemies from North Vietnam. To talk of bringing people here from North Vietnam when we have our own troops in Vietnam is quite shameful. It would do irreparable damage to those people who have accepted the situation of being in Vietnam as part of an Australian force. </para>

          <para class="block">During the last 2 days I replied to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline> about radioactive fallout. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> now raises the question and I notice that during the recess he spoke in terms of fallout in the Atherton Tableland. At that time I felt an obligation to obtain some information because his comments did not seem to me to be consistent with what I believed to be -the position. In reply to the honourable senator&#39;s specific question concerning the Atherton Tableland, I can say that the comments I made concerning radioactive fallout in Australia from the current French tests apply equally in that area to other parts. This would have to be related to the answer I gave yesterday. The Atherton Tableland is included in the monitoring programme of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee but, as I mentioned earlier, it is no: possible at this stage to provide any information concerning radioactive fallout from the latest French tests because the data is not complete. I will go back to the statement I made. It is in Hansard and I will try to paraphrase it. It says, in effect, that the investigations that were made by the 2 authorities which are set up to watch this matter show, as a result of monitoring, that there has not been any appreciable increase and, indeed, there has been a significant decrease. </para>

            <para>- The question asked by the honourable senator enables me to state the position with regard to the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to education. At the present time the Commonwealth has not been invited nor has it decided to enter upon direct assistance for primary education,  rt  will be remembered that the Commonwealth has assisted by substantial votes the increase of teachers, thereby enabling a greater number of teachers to be available in the schools. During the last triennium the Government devoted S24m to that purpose and it is proceeding in the next 3 years to appropriate S30m for teacher training colleges. It is also important to be reminded that since the Commonwealth has been assisting education in other fields it has enabled, together with the State&#39;s own efforts, a reduction of the teacherpupil ratio from about 32 pupils per teacher in the early 1950s to 26 last year. I remind honourable senators that I attached to my statement to the Senate on the subject of Commonwealth education about 2 weeks ago a statistical table, but stated in another way the position can be expressed by saying that in 1962 the number of classes of more than 40 pupils in the primary schools represented 35.6% of the pupils attending. Today the classes exceeding 40 pupils have been reduced to 8.7%. It is necessary for me to add only that in addition to these very sound votes of great increases that the Commonwealth has made, due to the policy of increasing State grants, the States by their own efforts over the last 10 years have increased their expenditure on education from $325m ten years ago to $898m this year. In relation to their budgets that represents a great increase in the percentage of appropriation and not merely an increase in the amount. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Housing, and in doing so I refer to the Minister&#39;s answer to a question asked of her by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood. The Minister said that the number of dwellings to be commenced in the current quarter is likely to be a little on the increase from the number commenced in the June quarter, although there might be a further decline in New South Wales. Can the Minister explain why there is likely to be a further decline in the number of dwellings commenced in New South Wales when it appears that there is likely to be an increase in other States? Can anything be done to divert the millions of dollars being spent on large multi-storey office complexes into essential homes and modern hospitals to meet the urgent needs of ordinary people? </para>

              <para>- I repeat what I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood, that during the June quarter there was a small decline in the level of home building activity in that the number of dwellings commenced was down by 7% as compared with the March quarter. I say again that in that quarter, the March quarter, dwellings were being commenced at a near record rate of more than 140,000 per annum. Because of the exceptionally high volume of work in progress at the beginning of the June quarter, the decline in home building activity and employment was very much less than 7%. I think it is known that the decline which occurred in May and June was due largely to the tightening of the overall availability of finance and after this quarter, as I have said, I believe there will be an upturn. Already we are seeing an increased amount of money being made available for housing. Even in the Press this morning I read that in New South Wales housing loans by permanent building societies rose by 200% in July. This shows that more money is being made available and that we will see a rise in housing activity. I believe that before the end of the year we will see a marked improvement in the housing situation. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Yesterday I asked the Minister to take up with the Postmaster-General the need to pay 25c in order to have a guarantee of delivery in Sydney within 24 hours of a letter posted in Canberra before 9.30 a.m. I point out that Sydney is only an hour&#39;s travelling time from Canberra by air. Has the Minister seen an article in today&#39;s New South Wales morning Press stating that a priority mail service costing 10c per letter was introduced on 10 July and already 10,000 articles a week are being handled successfully under this scheme? Anticipating that the Postmaster-General will tell the Senate of this scheme in answer to the question I asked yesterday concerning the 25c requirement, I ask: Will the Minister ask the Postmaster-General whether he will ensure that members of the Post Office staff are fully informed of the various costs of the differing services available so that people will not be asked to pay 25c for a service that can be obtained for 10c and the staff will be able to explain that the 25c charge is for a personal messenger delivery at the city of destination? </para>

              <para>- My understanding of this matter is that yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> asked me a question concerning the amount that was charged to have a faster delivery of mail. As I understand her question, she is informing me again that information concerning what the rates were was not given to her, that she was informed of only one rate, namely 25c, and she now finds that another rate of 10c is also available. My understanding is that an information card or sheet concerning these rates for priority deliveries is available at all post offices. I suggest that the honourable senator should see whether she can obtain one. But I certainly will take the matter up with the Postmaster-General, putting her case before him and endeavouring to see what information is available and to obtain that for her. </para>

Acknowledging that he is aware of the history of Australian external financial aid to less developed countries, I ask: Is he aware that, according to preliminary figures, obtained from the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Australia ranked among the first 3 countries in the world in 1969 in terms of net flow of official aid? Is he aware that until recently Australia had provided all its official aid in grant form? What is the area of official aid that now prohibits Australia from claiming that all its official aid is in grant form? </para>

              <para>- It is true, as the honourable senator has suggested in his question, that Australia has a magnificent record in giving aid to less developed countries both in the form of direct aid and in the form of special tariff arrangements we have entered into with respect to underdeveloped countries. It is equally true that we rank among the first 3 countries in the world in terms of our contributions in an overall sense. But the question really requires a documented answer because it would be necessary to show in a reply prepared by the Department the categories of aid, the form it takes and the countries to which it is directed. If the honourable senator puts his question on the notice paper I will obtain a completely comprehensive answer which may well be of tremendous value to us in any subsequent debates that we may have. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the ministerial statement which he made on Tuesday this week and which he said might answer my question on the proposed nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. The statement was with reference to radioactive fallout. My question related to radioactive waste, which is a rather different matter. I ask: Will radioactive waste be produced by this plant, as is generally the case? By &#39;radioactive waste&#39; I mean the usual production of plutonium, which is radioactive, from uranium, and the possible radioactive pollution of cooling sea water. </para>

This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> asked a question which is obviously related to the answers I gave previously.

By way of explanation I would like to say that this week a blind man was conducted round Parliament House while explanations and descriptions given to him were recorded on a tape recorder for later study and reflection. This tour of Canberra was the last leg of a long journey around Australia undertaken by this courageous blind man. He was alone because airline officers were not able to guarantee him that his guide dog could accompany him throughout the long journey. I ask: Is it a fact that Ansett Airlines of Australia certainly, and possibly Trans-Australia Airlines, provide a free passage to a guide dog accompanying its blind master if he is travelling first class, with certain requirements for safety, convenience and hygiene in respect of other passengers? As many courageous blind people desirous of such a service could not afford a first class fare, will the Minister take up with the internal airlines the possibility of extending this generous service to a blind person travelling tourist class? </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry aware that the South Australian Egg Board has to transport some of its eggs to other States for the purpose of pulping - a very costly process - because its own pulping plant does not meet the required health standards? Will the Minister confer with the Government with a view to having reconsidered the request of the South Australian Egg Board for a loan to build a new pulping plant? This request was previously rejected. If a loan is granted, the Egg Board will be able to build its own pulping plant, thereby saving the extra cost involved in processing eggs interstate. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for Air, refers to complaints by servicemen, including the current public complaint by Flight Lieutenant  Refeld,  that allowances paid to servicemen transferred from Melbourne to Canberra and other locations are less than those paid to members of the Commonwealth Public Service. I ask the Minister: As it is evident that members of the Royal Australian Air Force and of the other Services are being unfairly treated in respect of allowances, including rent allowances, and other payments as compared with people in private industry and that these  disabilities must be adding to the complaints of servicemen which are causing them to leave the Services, will the Minister take action in his own Department to correct the position and also to refer the complaints to the Ministers who are responsible for the other Services? </para>

            <para>- I think the honourable senator would realise that when I first took over this portfolio I expressed concern about the rate of allowances paid to those engaged in the particular Service for which I am responsible. I referred in one instance to flying allowances. I can say to the honourable senator that 1 was in the crew room at the Butterworth Air Force base when I announced an increase in flying allowances. In some cases it was almost a 100% increase. If any honourable senator had been there with me at the time he would have noticed the favourable reaction I received when I made the announcement. There was an atmosphere of almost complete jubilation. But since that time a great amount of misconception has arisen about flying allowances and I think that the matter is getting out of hand. </para>

              <para>- I have not said that. A committee has been examining the question of the rates of pay and conditions applying in the Services. For a long time the representatives on this committee have been studying the rates of pay and allowances paid to members of all the Services. The Air Force is represented on this committee by the head of my Department. The committee has made a number of recommendations which are presently being examined. Some of them, such as the increase in flying allowances, have been accepted by the Government. Other recommendations are about to be examined by the Government, and no doubt in due course further announcements will be made. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. The Minister is no doubt aware of the growing public consciousness of the need for plans for mitigation of the effects of natural disasters, such as floods, fires and cyclones, and the need to gather information for scientific research into the subject. Will the Minister for the Interior, as head of the Division of National Mapping, have a photographic survey made of the flood areas in Tasmania while they are flooded so that the fullest background information relating to this costly flood, and similar floods that occur in the State, could be available for study and evaluation for flood mitigation planning in the future? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator directs a question to me as Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. It is concerned with natural disasters and the gathering of information in order to try to have plans laid ahead for the control of such natural disasters. He has referred to the floods in Tasmania. I am sure that every honourable senator sympathises with the Tasmanians and hopes that something can be done to alleviate their position and to help them. The Division of National Mapping is within the Department of National Development, but fortunately, as I also represent the Minister for National Development, I can direct the honourable senator&#39;s inquiry to the Department of National Development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think I should say to the honourable senator that the Division of National Mapping is a very forward looking and progressive division. One of the great romances in Australia has been the national mapping work carried out by the Division. It is well worthy of study. I think the honourable senator would find that the Division of National Mapping had most of the data necessary for evaluating the Tasmanian problems. Nonetheless, I will have inquiries made for the honourable senator to ascertain whether this information has been made available to the Tasmanian authorities which are, in some areas, the responsible authorities for natural disaster control in that State. </para>

            <para>- Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware that at a ladies Liberal Party meeting this week Justice Roma Mitchell, Australia&#39;s only female judge and a most distinguished feminist, warned that because of the continual increase in the cost of living all women in the very near future would have to .work to provide a second income? Might I say that this certainly is a grim picture for the future. Will the Government institute an investigation into this matter in order to stop this vicious increase in prices and, if need be, introduce price control on essential everyday commodities thereby trying to give some protection to parents with young families where the wife is unable to take an extra job, to pensioners and to those on fixed incomes? </para>

          <para class="block">I do not agree. The honourable senator should not try to tie the judge to a contribution she made at a political party rally. Quite obviously, as a guest  speaker  she could have been speaking in a completely detached way. As to the second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, 1 point out that what the States do in relation to price control is a matter within the constitutional responsibility of the States. Unless the States exercise their prerogative to implement price control, that is outside the province of the Commonwealth. The third thing I say to the honourable senator is that he is drawing a very long bow when he tries to tie to the subject matter of his question something that was said by a guest  speaker  at a political function. </para>

            <para>- Although the statement lacks any element of novelty,  I  shall be pleased to obtain it to &#34;glean from it such new information as  I  can. This morning  I  have already troubled the Senate to listen to statistics which show that over the last decade the increase in expenditure on education has been striking indeed and a very great achievement on the part of governments. Nevertheless there still remains a lot to be done, but it is quite unavailing to describe the situation in teacher education in catch terms such as &#39;crisis&#39;. We should identify need and then not only supply the money but supply the knowledge and work that will solve the problem. </para>

            <para>- My question is again directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Minister will recall that a few moments ago he drew my attention to a statement that he made on 25th August regarding nuclear fallout and invited me to ask another question if 1 were not satisfied with his answer. I am not satisfied with the reply. I now ask the Minister whether he can supply the Parliament with exact and up to date details of the measurement of the following nuclear fallout elements: Caesium 137, strontium 90 and iodine 131? Can measurements be given for the following areas: Launceston, Tasmania and the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland? </para>

I  will certainly include the matter he has raised in the matters for consideration.

The Minister answered me about the numbers, but not the increase in costs, so  I  would like to ask her: Do the figures released by the Commonwealth Statistician yesterday show that 15,000 new houses and flats were approved in July 1969 at a cost of $249m whereas in July 1970 11,100 were approved at a cost of $255m? Can the Minister inform the Senate whether these figures are correct and, if they are, what is the reason for the great disparity in the 2 cost figures? </para>

We do know that there have been increased costs in housing and that people today are building better standard and larger houses. All these are matters which are concerned with figures for costs in the housing field. We should also recall that the amount of money that is paid for land comes into the overall picture of housing costs. I shall be pleased to get some detailed replies to the matters raised. </para>

              <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has misunderstood or misheard me. This is not intentional, 1 know. First of all I said that during the June quarter there was a small decline in the level of home building. Then I referred to the rate of commencements during the March quarter which reached the record rate of almost 140,000 dwellings per annum. I then went on to say: </para>

            <para>The number of dwellings to be commenced in the current quarter is likely to be little different from the number commenced in the June quarter although there may be a further decline in New South Wales. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is the point the honourable senator took. He stated that I said, as I understood him, that the number of dwellings to be commenced in the current quarter was to be increased. I want to make it perfectly clear that what I said was: </para>

            <para>The number of dwellings to be commenced in the current quarter is likely to be little different from the number commenced in the June quarter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I then went on, after referring to New South Wales - and I will come back to this later - to say that I believe that after this quarter we will see, as a result of the money that is going into housing, the numbers rising and a trend towards an increase in the housing figures. Then the honourable senator referred to my comment that there may be a further decline in New South Wales. Let me explain to the honourable senator - and, of course, he knows this - that there is more than one stage in a housing programme. There is the stage of applying for a loan, then that of obtaining the required money; then we have the approvals figure, then the commencements figure and finally the figure for completions. I remind the honourable senator, as I thought I had already done, that the decline in the number of housing loans made and dwellings approved for construction in the June quarter would almost certainly result in a further decline in commencements in the current quarter. This is because of the decrease in housing loans. The States most affected are Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland during the period about which I was speaking in discussing the decline in housing loans and dwellings approved for construction, that is, the June quarter. But now I say that we will shortly be seeing an increase in housing figures because of the amount of money which is being made available for housing loans. What 1 said to the honourable senator this morning was that a newspaper article disclosed that a report issued by the Permanent Building Societies Association Ltd in Sydney yesterday showed that New South Wales housing loans rose by 200% in July. This, of course, must affect the commencements in New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- Some time ago, I think in response to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> I gave a pattern of what would possibly happen with the staff at Woomera and Salisbury. It was thought a component would be absorbed through the Service. I know of no change to the reply 1 gave then. As to the workload at Woomera, the curtailing or the closing down of the European Launcher Development Organisation programme is the loss of a very valuable client. Let us acknowledge that. But it should be understood that the workload at Woomera is still significant. Australia has an agreement with the United Kingdom in relation to a joint project and that will continue for a number of years. Other proposals, some classified but most not classified, are in process. All in all the position at Woomera has not changed since I gave the honourable senator an answer some time ago. If he wants the answer updated I will be happy to have that done for him. </para>

By way of preface I illustrate my dilemma and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> by referring to the labourers in the vineyard in biblical days. We know some of them started work at 6 in the morning and worked until 6 at night in the heat. They received 2d a day. The other workers started at 4 o&#39;clock in the cool of the evening and they also received 2d a day. I respectfully put to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> question time started shortly after 11 a.m. and it was 11.45 a.m. before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> or myself received a call. When my Leader asked a question and two or three other honourable senators and myself stood up I noticed you made pencil notations. Do you list the people who from the start stood up seeking to ask a question, or does this not have any interest at all? I do not mind but I have a sense of grievance as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> and as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> yesterday. I would just like to know the ground rules. I do not object. I respect you. But I would like to know. </para>

            <para>- There is quite a simple explanation. In calling honourable senators from the Opposition side I call the Leader of the Opposition first. If the Whip has a question to ask I am duty bound to call him because he may be asking a question for his Party. The honourable senator raised the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer.</inline> I think any sensible person would agree that I would not respond to the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> was trying to attract my attention. I would be foolish if I did. As far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> and yourself are concerned, if your Party is agreeable I will give you priority all the time. 1 will even put you ahead of your Leader. But let me tell you this: It is simple enough to be critical. You stand up and look very fiercely at me to make sure that I have seen you. Of course I have seen you. But 1 also see other other honourable senators who have not asked a question. You are a prolific questioner, and good for you. But other honourable senators have rights just as you have and I try to distribute those rights as much as I possibly can. With the incapacity from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is suffering, I try to give him an early call to save him the embarrassment of repeatedly standing up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> you receive a good share of question calls. I think you should be the last to complain. </para>

On the test estimates which can be made at the present time it is anticipated that the proposed provision of S60m will be adequate to meet the demands for loans in this financial year. Action is therefore being taken to eliminate the existing waiting time for loans to purchase dwelling houses. </para>

I draw the attention of the Minister to a great deal of speculation and the views of a number of aviation writers who have put forward this proposition. Is it proposed, as rumoured, to lease or purchase the recommended manufacturers tanker aircraft or a substitute tanker aircraft? </para>

            <para>- There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether we should have tanker aircraft with the Phantoms. On the flight out from America, under the lease arrangements a tanker will be coming with the aircraft. With regard to our own position in Australia, we are studying the tanker situation at present. The aircraft mentioned by writers are the KC135 and the CI 41, but these aircraft are no longer being manufactured. Consequently, at present we are looking at the situation to see whether we can have an aircraft to serve the dual role of transport cum tanker. The aircraft which we are considering is the Boeing 707-320, but until my Department has carried out a thorough examination we will not know what the situation is. Many aviation writers are overlooking the fact that our Phantoms will have external tanks which will give them a very much greater range than the writers are stating in their articles. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is it correct that the landing charges for overseas aircraft in Australia are much higher than those at overseas airports? For a Boeing 707 are these charges roughly of the order of SI, 005 for Sydney as against S591 for London, $388 for Tokyo, S391 for Hong Kong.. S30 at John F. Kennedy Airport. S49 for San Francisco and $34 for Los Angeles? Is it estimated that the landing charge for a Boeing 747 at Sydney will be approximately $2,342, and is it proposed that that charge will be increased by 10% if the new charges go through as forecast in the Budget papers? Can we compare that charge with $1,324 for London, $946 for Tokyo, $926 for Hong Kong, $174 for John F. Kennedy, $130 for San Francisco and $90 for Los Angeles? Will the Minister agree that it is in the interests of our international trade and commerce and the promotion of tourism in Australia to reduce the costs of travel to Australia? Is it especially important for Australia, as the most isolated continent on earth, to see to it that we do everything to remove unnecessary burdens and costs because of the cost of communication and travel to and from Australia? In the light of that, will the Minister tell us how the Government justifies these great charges or, better, will the Minister start afresh to consider the sense of these charges in the light not merely of paying for the costs of installations but also of Australia&#39;s position in the world in trade and commerce and in regard to improving our communications with other countries? </para>

            <para>- That is an extremely long question. I do not want to ask that it be put on the Notice Paper; so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> if you and the Senate will bear with me, I will endeavour to answer the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> although I could not write them down. I am aware of the figures he has quoted because Pan-American World Airways was good enough to let us have a copy of the letter which it wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and which contained these figures. So, if there are some slight variations when I refer to some figures later on, he will understand that it is because our calculations of what the figures will be do not square entirely with some of the calculations made by Pan-American. The Boeing 747 situation is an estimated situation at the moment, and it is being studied. So these are theoretical calculations, not actual figures. 1 have some very great reservations about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> request to me to agree with his general propositions. They will come out as I go along. I believe that the Senate and the Australian community are entitled to have this information. Every year the Government reviews air navigation charges, lt does so in the light of a policy of moving gradually towards a position in which the costs of civil aviation facilities attributable to commercial aviation are being more fully recovered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As announced by the Treasurer  -  I might say, with my full support - the Budget brought down recently provides for a further increase of 1.0%. In looking at this matter, the Government did not overlook the value of international and domestic air services in the development of the economy, in tourism and in trade. But it has to balance with this other factors in the interests of the Australian people. One aspect that is taken into account is the extent to which the general taxpayer of Australia is called upon to meet the cost of aviation facilities. The total estimated operating costs of the Department of Civil Aviation in 1969-70 were approximately $75ra and its revenues were only $20m. So, the Australian community - .the taxpayers in the broad - have lo find for aviation purposes, apart from the other demands on them, something of the order of $55m. </para>
          <para>It is perfectly true - we accept this - that Australian air navigation charges are on the high side. But we have some problems that other countries do not have, such as geographical size, terrain and economic development leading to differences in the levels of aviation facilities provided and the volume of air traffic that uses those facilities. We need to remember that the number of movements at airports such as the John F. Kennedy Airport is 3,000 or 4,000 a day, whereas the number of movements at our airports is very much less than that. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Widely varying circumstances, therefore, determine the charges that have to be levied by governments. I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> for raising this matter. I know that he does so in the general public interest, and I am replying to the Senate in the same sense. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The 1.0% increase announced recently, according to our calculations will mean a charge for a Boeing 707 in and out of Sydney of about $988. We agree that this is probably one of the highest single charges in the world for comparable aircraft. But there are other countries that impose a number of charges, such as passenger charges and fuel charges, which can be shown to be roughly comparable in total with the single Australian charge. The United Kingdom charge for a Boeing 707, on our calculations, is $676 - not the $591 shown in the letter. Charges in the United States vary very considerably from airport to airport. So. comparisons of this character, both on the figures supplied by PanAmerican and our own figures, are not always that valid because there are factors that make the comparisons not on common ground. </para>
          <para>Lel me also say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that our own international carrier, Qantas Airways Lid, is taking about 42% of the movements in and out of Australia, so that the Australian user of Qantas makes his own contribution to that extent. As far as we can tell, the effect on tourism may be measured in this way: The additional cost brought about by a 10% increase in Australian air navigation charges represents less than one-fifth of 1% of the relevant international airline operating costs. On the average aircraft load of passengers, it represents 50c per passenger. Therefore, it is difficult for us to see that we are, in effect, delimiting tourist opportunities. Equally, as a Department we are confronted all the time with increasing demands from international air carriers - particularly those of the United States of America  -  to fly into Australia, lt does not therefore appear to us that the charges have inhibited Australian opportunities in aviation in any sense at all. </para>
          <para>T am quite well aware of the fact that there has been a substantial American lobby in Australia arguing vociferously against our air navigation charges. But the Senate will appreciate, as will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> that my job is to look after the Australian public interest in the first place, and that is what we seek to do. We believe that our facilities are of a very high order. They are  very costly to establish. The total cost at Tullamarine, including the cost to the State Government of building the freeway, was about $81m. We think it is fair that the international user of the services should pay something towards their cost. It is admitted that it is a high cost, but after all, it is a free country and we expect that the operators who want to come here will share the burden that is imposed on the Australian community to support those services. </para>

          <para>We would like to point out that we have been unable to give an unqualified audit report regarding the accuracy and reliability of the accounting records kept by the club and the attached financial statements. This matter should be treated by the Executive Committee and members of the club as extremely serious and we trust that immediate action will be taken by members to rectify this position along the lines we have suggested. Our examination has revealed that the accounting books, particularly the cash receipts book, have not been properly kept. In many cases no receipts have been issued for cash received and entries have not been recorded in the cash receipts book. Although we do not intend to criticise any particular person, we trust that the members will appreciate the fact that without these basic recording entries we are unable to prepare accurate financial statements. </para>

              <para>- The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has had an opportunity to examine the draft regulations which have been submitted to the Executive Council. It agrees that these overcome all objections the Committee had to the original amendments. Honourable senators may recall that on 19 August when this matter was debated, I said on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood, Chairman</inline> of the Committee, that the draft regulations which met the objections of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee had been submitted to the Executive Council for consideration on 20 August and it was anticipated that the normal course of events would follow. I subsequently learned that circumstances arose to prevent consideration of the matter at last Thursday&#39;s meeting. In view of the Minister&#39;s assurance that amendments have been submitted to the Executive Council - and I believe that the Executive Council dealt with the matter as recently as today - in the absence and at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> I withdraw notice of motion No.l Business of the Senate, standing in his name. </para>

              <para>- Time limits are imposed under the Act for notices of motion to be given. Let us take the simple position of this being the last day. This point has arisen before. I think it is important that if a notice is disallowed, it ought to be on the basis that any other senator who would want to move on the matter during the course of the day would be able to do so, because there are special provisions. </para>

              <para>- If this notice of motion is withdrawn, as I understand the way the statute operates and as it was discussed on an earlier occasion, the time for notices of motion having passed there would be no opportunity for any other senator to invoke the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. I do not anticipate that anyone will in this case. There has been discussion on the merits of how these matters are conducted, but it seems to me quite unfortunate that it should be left to the last day. I do not know whether leave is necessary for it to be withdrawn, but it ought to be on the basis that if any honourable senator does desire to give notice today, even though the time for giving notice of motion is past he ought to be able to do so. Otherwise, by taking this course the Senate is depriving itself of the power to disallow a regulation if it is so minded. </para>

          <para>I think we need to pay some attention to how this ought to be dealt with so that we do not have the position in which the rights of an individual senator might be prejudiced. I am not referring to this particular subject matter. I do not regard the existing practice as being satisfactory, and I suggest, with respect, that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee consider a procedure whereby, if a notice of motion is withdrawn, it is done in a way which will give ample opportunity to any other senator to invoke the procedures for disallowance under the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>

            <para>- by leave - It is proposed that the Senate will rise at 4.30 this afternoon. It is planned that we will deal with 2 short Bills listed on the notice paper. I hope then to ask for leave of the Senate to raise some matters relating to the conduct of the Senate, including days and hours of sitting. Possibly I will do that after luch, Other matters I have in mind are the length of speeches, urgency motions, and the incorporation in Hansard of answers to questions. We may even get to the stage of discussing procedures in relation to petitions. After we have dealt with the 2 Bills on the notice paper, that is, the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Bill and the Book Bounty Bill which, I gather, will not be opposed by the Opposition parties, it is envisaged that this afternoon we will move on to discuss the conduct of our own affairs. 1 understand that the debate will take place on non-party lines and that a free vote will be taken. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I suggest that the motion be modified in the way that I have indicated. The view is that there ought to be better representation as between the 2 Houses: that there should be equality as between the 2 Houses. The Government would still appoint the  chairman  of the committee. There would be a  chairman,  as Ls proposed, from Government parties in the House of Representatives. He would have a casting vote as well as a deliberative vote. The representation would be more consonant with the position as between the Houses and the Senate and between the various parties in this chamber, in that 2 senators would come from the Government side. 2 would come from the Opposition side and 1 would come from the Democratic Labor Party. It would not alter the balance on the committee by adding 2 further senators  -  1 from the Government side and 1 from the Opposition side. I do not need to go into the merits of the matter because they have been discussed elsewhere. We are in favour of the topic being investigated. I suggest the amendment as a modification. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> this Bill is the culmination of some years of discussion which has been going on between the United Kingdom , Government and the Australian Government. It arises from the fact - a geophysical fact, actually - that . the best place for viewing all sections of the sky is in the Southern Hemisphere, not too near the Equator and not too near the Antartic Circle. The position in New South Wales which has been chosen as the site for this telescope is admirably suited for a number of reasons. Cloud cover and air pollution are minimal. The site is quite outstanding for a number of reasons. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The construction of this telescope will give Australia a further impetus to carry on work in the scientific and astronomical world. Australia already has achieved outstanding results not only with optical telescope work but also in radio astronomy. I think it is well known that even with our smaller optical telescopes we have been able to achieve some outstanding results in the search of the heavens. We are well in the forefront of research work which has been carried on with radio telescopes. So it is with considerable pleasure that I have to announce that the Opposition believes we have reached the stage when the agreement for the construction and operation of this telescope can be ratified in this Bill. It will be to the benefit not only to Australian scientific circles but also to research which is being carried on in astronomical circles throughout the world. </para>
          <para>It is intended to build a 150 inch telescope. It will be quite a large telescope - comparable with the 200 inch telescope at Mount Palomar, which is the largest in the world. It will have a resolution factor which will enable it to be used to considerable advantage for research into the Milky Way and matters pertaining thereto. The Bill also empowers the setting up of a board which will be sited in Canberra. It will control and be responsible for the operation and maintenance of this telescope. I believe that the original intention was that 3 members of the board would be appointed by the Commonwealth Government and that 3 members would be appointed by the United Kingdom Government. Those members will have full responsibility for carrying on at this stage the operation, maintenance and general conduct of the telescope. The Opposition believes that the setting up of the telescope will be a very good example of cooperative arrangement between the United Kingdom Government and the Commonwealth Government. We have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. We will give it a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that we do not oppose this Bill. Nevertheless, I believe that some observations should be made in the interests of the people of Australia and of the printing industry. This bounty is not entirely satisfactory. However, I do not criticise the Government for introducing the Bill. The Government believes that this is the best way to attack the problem. It certainly will assist. Nevertheless, other measures and other means of assisting the industry could have been employed to the advantage of the Government and the industry. In that regard I mention books, copy or material sent to overseas countries to be printed. We believe that the success that this Bill will achieve by the provision of a bounty could have been achieved if a tax were placed on the film or the material sent overseas. As a result Australians would not be paying a bounty on the product, but the employer or the individual who sent the material overseas would be required to pay the tax. I offer that suggestion, as I have done previously, to the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest that it would be a particularly good idea if the Minister brought into consultation the unions and the employers to ascertain whether the printing industry is being geared tq the 1970s. Quite frankly, 1 have seen adopted within the industry practices that have operated for many years. It is not only the small printer who is adopting these out of date measures; the big printers are in a similar category. 1 question whether the industry is gearing itself to the requirements of the 1970s. 1 believe that fruitful discussions could be held if the unions, the employers associations and the Minister were to meet on this aspect. The matter is not just one for the present. Apprentices are coming into the industry. They are being trained in methods that were employed when I first served my apprenticeship. These methods are not adopted in other areas of the printing industry. Consequently a lad serves his 4-year or 5-year apprenticeship and is trained in methods that are not successful in 1970. lt is true that those methods were successful when I served my apprenticeship, but they are not successful with the modern trends in printing. 1 seriously offer that suggestion to the Minister. 1 also believe that the Government should take into consideration its position in relation to books printed overseas for Government departments. I have raised this matter before. I have had no reply from the Minister. One example is a publication, issued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which was printed overseas and could have been printed in Australia. The situation is a most serious one. It is a serious matter when private employers are sending material overseas to be printed, but I suggest with respect that the situation is even more serious when the Government allows work, which could and should be done in Australia, to go overseas. 1 have also questioned the late arrival of copies of Hansard. I have not had the opportunity for some time to see what takes place at the Government Printing Officer in Canberra, but it appears to me that something is wrong when copies of Hansard are not available to members of Parliament for perusal. </para>

              <para>- No, not the daily Hansard. I mean Hansard in book form. I again raise the issue on this broad basis. Something must be wrong somewhere else, as well as at the Government Printing Office. Copies of the National Service Act cannot be bought anywhere. If people want to obtain copies of that Act to ascertain their obligations or entitlements, copies should be available. Recently when I tried to buy a copy I found there was none available. I had to get photostat copies of the Act from the Records Office. I also tried unsuccessfully to buy a copy of the consolidated Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Surely copies of these Acts should be available for distribution. </para>

Perhaps that is stretching the matter a little. Nevertheless, the fact remains that these publications are important documents. They are important to the people, particularly those who are involved in spheres in which the Acts operate. Copies should be readily available for the general public. I hope that the Minister will bring into consultation with him the unions and the employers to ensure that the industry is gearing itself for the 1970s. </para>

I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliners</inline> point was well made and has implications beyond what he said. This </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Bill of course is to assist by providing a bounty for printers who print books in Australia for State or Commonwealth governments. In the absence of such a bounty that printing is done outside. First of all that is bad, in one sense, in that a modern nation like Australia should attempt to command in available numbers all the available technical skills. After all the presentation of the publications of a nation in the modern world of communication is of great importance and significance. Nations can be known for the level and standard of their various presentations or of their manufactures just as some nations are known for their manufacture of pottery or glassware. It is to be regretted if inferior publications were to emerge from Australia because of the absence of skilled staff to present them. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline>said that the Commonwealth Government printery is obviously well behind in ils work and the reason for that undoubtedly would be a shortage of trained manpower. We will continue in that unfortunate condition unless we stimulate the printing industry generally and provide it with work on an economic basis which will attract employment and attract apprentices to the industry. Therefore I would regard this measure as having 2 purposes. First, it will assist Australian publishers, Secondly, it will expand employment and training opportunities for young men in Australia interested in printing and ultimately will help to relieve the tremendous shortage of technicians which has the consequences to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> has referred. On behalf of the Democratic Labor Party I welcome this Bill. We support it. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> has indicated that the Opposition supports this measure and 1 agree with what he has said. 1 am a little concerned with one aspect of the Bill; that is that we see the necessity for extending the book bounty to cover work done on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States while excluding the work done by the Commonwealth or the States. This will inevitably mean that it will be more economic to get printing done on behalf of the Commonwealth or States than it would be to have it done by the Commonwealth or States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">This is an important matter that ought to be further considered by the Government. </para>
          <para>Whilst we welcome the step forward that has been taken we point out that this Bill discriminates strongly against Commonwealth and State printeries. This effect ought to be considered because those printeries are extremely important establishments. We need not go into arguments about public and private enterprise. We know that we need Commonwealth and State printeries. We need them as much as we need transport facilities run by the States and the Commonwealth. There is no real difference of opinion between us on that. I would ask that the implications of this Bill be studied; otherwise we will inevitably have a drive towards taking away the work from those Commonwealth and State printeries. </para>
          <para>Next may 1 say that I believe that the efficiency of this industry in Australia needs to be improved. A few years ago we had a committee known as the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Papers and Government Publications. I was a member of that Committee, as were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey.</inline> The honourable member for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Erwin)</inline> was the  Chairman.  The name of the other member from this chamber on it evades me for the moment. We found that the printing industry in this country could certainly do with some great improvement. There was an absence of specialised persons, the creative artists to design the work in the industry. There were virtually no typographers, as they were called. There was apparently a complete dearth of them in this country. This was extraordinary. Those in charge of the printing industry were apparently not undertaking the improvement of the industry as a whole with which one would think any great industry would be concerned. That is on the private side. </para>
          <para>In relation to Government publications <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> referred to some difficulty in getting copies of some Acts. The Committee to which I referred was set up by the unanimous vote of both Houses in order to deal with this very problem. Dissatisfaction was so great that the Committee was set tip. The Committee&#39;s conclusions were endorsed by the Cabinet. I understand that an announcement was made that every recommendation was agreed to with one minor exception relating to the standard size of paper. The Cabinet&#39;s decision on this matter was agreed to informally by the Committee. The informal agreement of the Committee was endorsed by the Cabinet so one might say that everything was endorsed by the Government. This Committee of both Houses was set up by a unanimous vote and presented a unanimous report. One would think that the executive authorities would have seen to it that its recommendations were carried out. They have not been carried out. </para>

              <para>- I am saying that the bound final copies of the last sittings should be in our hands. This is a comparatively simple matter to do. In 1969 I could not get a bound copy of the 1967 Acts of this Parliament, let alone the 1968 ones. I tried without success to get a bound copy from the Government Printing Office. Of course it was not available in Sydney. Finally in desperation I approached the head of the Public Service Board to see if anything could be done, but the impasse in printing seems to be so great that not even the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board could possibly do anything to get the work of the Commonwealth Government printery up to date. We are among the first to be supplied with bound copies of Acts, but it is now August 1970 and we have not received the bound copy of the 1969 Commonwealth Acts. We do not even have the 1968 ones. This is not satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> for that information. I am pleased to know that is so. I would still like to see our bound Acts and bound Hansards available within a reasonable time, in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee which were endorsed by the Government. Generally the printing industry is composed of highly skilled persons of whom we are proud. We would like to see improvement in this industry so that it can compete effectively with printing industries overseas. The bounty is a step towards protecting the industry but ought not be looked upon as a solution to all its problems. It ought to become more efficient, and that requires efficiency at all levels. There ought to be efficiency in management. We ought to have the best skills, the best techniques and so on. There ought to be no feather-bedding either in management or in labour. I do not think that anyone would tolerate inefficient practices in industry at any level. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>We would like to see increased productivity and to see the benefits of that flow not only to the community by having the printing done here but also in better wages and conditions for those who are working in a highly skilled trade. This industry is extremely important to us for the reasons mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> including the presentation of Australia overseas and the provision of employment. We must remember that the emphasis in Australia is turning away extremely rapidly from not only the primary industries but also the heavy secondary industries and towards the service industries of which printing is really one. Printing does not mean merely the production of goods; it is really a service industry, and more and more employment opportunities and activities in trade and commerce will be in such areas. We cannot afford to fall behind other countries. This bounty ought to be looked upon as an opportunity for the industry to get itself into gear. It should be looked on as something that is temporary. The industry should look not to bounties but to improving its efficiency and being able to compete through superior organisation and superior skills. We hope and trust that our printing industry will be an example to the rest of the world and that we may look forward to other countries having their books printed, here instead of us having our books printed overseas. I therefore commend the Bill to the Senate but I would ask that the other feature of the exclusion of the Commonwealth and the Slates be looked at. </para>

            <para>-  in reply - Although we are eating into our lunch hour at a fairly fast rate the Senate is entitled to consideration of some of the excellent suggestions that have come forward in this very brief debate. I know that the Opposition accepts the Bill and, as I said, it offered some suggestions which will certainly go forward to the Minister. I appreciate the comments made by all honourable senators, and in particular those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> who speaks from a lifetime of experience in the printing and book publishing trades. All I want to say to the honourable senator without taking up too much of his time is that my own experience in industry prior to coming here was that there is tremendous benefit in management and the people who work in an industry getting together on the common problems of the industry. That view has certainly always had my support and always will. The comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner, Senator Byrne</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> will be communicated to the responsible Ministers. One or two brief points should be made. The printing of Hansard is fundamentally a matter which comes under the responsibility of the Treasurer and not of the Minister for Customs and Excise, but I will see that the comments about delays in the printing of Hansard are sent forward. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The printing of publications overseas for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been due in the past to lower costs, but the proposed amendment should help to overcome this problem. The question of costs and labour, etc, in the printing industry will be and. I believe, is being studied by the Tariff Board. I understand that the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is that the exclusion of Commonwealth and State publications from the bounty perhaps reduces the chances of the industry becoming big enough to get itself perhaps into a stronger position. As I understand it, it is a capital intensive industry. It is true that it is one of the industries on the tertiary side that Australia is well qualified to conduct on the most modern and up to date scale with all the new devices of computer typesetting and the very latest techniques that can properly be brought in and are things which properly, this being a capital intensive industry, we as a country with high living standards can perhaps develop more effectively than some other countries. Accordingly I accept the various views put forward and thank honourable senators for them. They will be put forward to the appropriate Minister. I would also express the gratitude of the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> for the passage of the Bill without opposition although with those observations. </para>

              <para>- I need to make some preliminary comments on this matter. This is rather an historical occasion for the Senate as we will be debating a proposition relating to the sitting days of the Senate. In this type of debate it is understood that we will have a completely open and free discussion and we are not bound by the decision of any Party Caucus or by Party barriers. Each one of us will express his own view in an attempt to reach a decision on the sittings of the Senate. In that context it is necessary for somebody to act as the guinea pig. Since I am the Leader of the Government in the Senate I propose to move a motion and speak to it. Naturally it will be open to the leaders of the other parties to exercise their priorities to speak if they want to do so. Then every honourable senator can speak for himself about the matter. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>I shall go a little beyond the motion relating to the sittings of the Senate to forecast for honourable senators where we go after we deal with the first item. I have in mind that, if not this afternoon, certainly next week, we should continue by arrangement our discussion in relation to the management of the Senate. I hope to bring forward for open and frank discussion the question of the limitation of times of speeches, the procedure for urgency motions, the possibility of the incorporation of questions on notice in Hansard and possibly the procedure for looking at and handling petitions. That is for the future. At the moment I direct the attention of honourable senators to the question of sittings of the Senate. I move: </para>
          <motion>
            <para>That the Senate agrees, in principle, that the sittings of the Senate should be on the basis of two weeks of sitting followed by one week&#39;s adjournment, with the actual sitting days to be decided upon by the Senate, as the occasion arises. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I have asked my staff to run off copies of the motion and I will circulate them as quickly as I can. I shall hand the copy I have to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> because I feel I can speak to the motion without having it in front of me. It is envisaged that when we come back after the present cycle of the 3 weeks sitting we then have a week off because of our commitment to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The Parliament will then go into a new period of sittings in October. It is intended that commencing with that series of sittings in October the procedure I have suggested should be adopted. For the purpose of description I shall call it the 3 weeks cycle. I think that is an easy way to describe what is being talked about. To an extent this proposal is geared to a decision which has already been taken in another place to adopt a 3 weeks cycle commencing with the October sittings. The only difference between what I am proposing and what has been decided in the other place is that the other place has agreed to a 3 weeks cycle - that is sitting for 2 weeks and having a week off - with the days of sitting declared as Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of one week and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. In my proposal I have suggested the Senate should adopt the cycle of 2 weeks sitting and 1 week oil but that we should not commit ourselves to the days of sitting. The reason I have put that proposal is that we have 60 senators as distinct from the House of Representatives which has 125 members. Inferentially we should be able to dispose of our work which, in the main, comes from the other place in a far more restricted period. </para>
          <para>The most important aspect is that if honourable senators adopt the 3 weeks cycle, with the 2 weeks sitting, we have to bear in mind that in our own right as senators we have evolved a committee system - a process of considering matters by the committee method. We have select committees and quite a number are in existence. Notice of motion was given this morning for the establishment of another select committee. We also have our obligations in relation to joint statutory committees. Today I put down a resolution to embark upon another joint select committee. The debate on whether there should be more honourable senators on that committee has been adjourned but nevertheless it is another commitment for the Senate. In addition we have resolved to embark upon a standing committee system which envisages 7 standing committees. Subjects will be referred to them from the Senate in session. </para>
          <para>I have to speak for myself because I am the fellow who is putting this proposal. I believe complete justification exists for us not to bind ourselves in this cycle to sitting on the Friday or the Monday. I certainly envisage that during that period when we are sitting in the cycle it may well be that we could do considerable committee work either on the Friday of one week or the Monday of the next week. All this proposal does is to suggest that we link ourselves with the other House to the extent that we agree to this proposed cycle of the 3 weeks sittings; that is, agree in principle but not necessarily endorse that we sit as a Senate on the Friday or the Monday. At all times I have in mind that we would have work to do in committee fields if we chose to do it and, in the circumstances, if it is the will of the Senate, we might elect to sit on the Friday or the Monday. That will be a matter for a decision of the Senate when the appropriate time comes. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONNo. In the normal circumstances we have a provision for sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I do not propose to alter that at all unless the Senate took a decision that, for some reason, it wanted it altered. Our justification for not following the House of Representatives to the ultimate in this 3 weeks cycle conceptis because it is envisaged that on those Fridays and Mondays we may be doing committee work. That will be a judgment of the committees when the lime comes. There are tremendous advantages iri our being in the same 3 weeks cycle because we belong to political parties and party discussions will take place in those parties while the Parliament is in session. Therefore if we are in the same cycle as the House of Representatives we will not incommode ourselves in relation to such things as party meetings, sub-committees of party meetings and things of that nature. I suggest that there is good reason why we should follow the House of Representatives in the 3 weeks cycle principle without necessarily committing ourselves to Monday and Friday sittings. I think 1 have covered the matter widely enough for everybody to have an understanding of how the system would function. I would merely say in conclusion: Let the <inline font-style="italic">Senate</inline> speak and say what it wants. </para>

              <para>- Yes, that the Senate should agree in principle that the sittings of the Senate should be on the basis of 2 weeks of sitting followed by I week&#39;s adjournment. I suggest that we should in common sense agree to this because we have raised in this chamber  -  I spoke on this earlier in the year - a proposal to sit more days, lt was suggested that we sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday followed by Monday, Tuesday. Wednesday and Thursday. We had some discussion of that. 1 believe that eventually we got to the point where we could not really proceed with the proposal because it would have put us out of gear with the House of Representatives, m the way that these things work the proposal has now come up through the House of Representatives where it has been adopted in principle. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> think that in common sense we should agree lo that. Otherwise we will be out of gear. I assume that there would he fairly general agreement on that point. There may not be agreement, but I imagine that that is the sense of the Senate. </para>

          <para>As to the remainder of the motion, that the actual sitting days be decided by the Senate as the occasion arises, I do not know. I am still of the view that we should sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday followed bv Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday and Thursday. If (here <inline font-style="italic">is a</inline> marked difference of opinion on this aspect of the motion 1 would suggest, with respect to the Leader of the Government, that a very happy way of dealing with the matter would be to subdivide the motion and to deal with the first part of the motion, on which I think there would be almost unanimous agreement, and then deal separately with the other part of the motion. </para>

              <para>-  Some honourable senators may say that they want a cycle of 2 weeks on and 1 week off but others may say that this should be decided when the time arrives. Others may say that they want the matter settled beforehand. However, 1 believe that there would be a consensus on the cycle proposed. I suggest that we might very easily dispose of the matter relating to the 3 weeks cycle. I believe that it is always better to separate the matter upon which agreement can be reached. If we can agree on that it would be an easy matter to dispose of. </para>

If we break the motion into 2 parts we are in the difficulty that some senators may want to vote for the first part if they believe that the second part will be binding in relation to Fridays and Mondays. That is why 1 proposed the motion in its present form. </para>

              <para>- I understand that. We may find out the feeling on this as the debate proceeds, but it is my thought that it might be preferable first to adopt the 3 weeks cycle. Frankly I would rather see us accept as our sitting days the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and Friday followed by the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and then, if we did not want to sit on a paticular night, we could agree not to sit on that night. I think that would be a more satisfactory arrangement. </para>

              <para>- I do not know about the honourable senator&#39;s Party, but I can tell him that my Party is a very democratic body. If the honourable senator has the impression that in some way these things are decided by me in an arbitrary fashion he needs to be better informed because it is a very mistaken impression. Only so much rein is given in this peculiarly democratic position where all are peers and all are .equals. Although one might be the spokesman, if he starts to make suggestions which are out of accord with the wishes of his fellows he will soon learn differently, as I have had occasion to learn in the past. This is a matter for an entirely free debate. My suggestion is that we should stipulate the sitting days. I do not know whether at this stage we need a formal amendment, but I propose, if it will help to elucidate the matter, that we deal with the two parts separately and determine first the sitting days. </para>

              <para>-  I think we should establish times for sittings of the Senate, and sittings of the Committees would fit into those times. I do not regard sittings of committees as in some way an alien matter. It seems to me that if we decided that select committees should sit on a Friday instead of the Senate sitting as a whole Senate or as a Committee of the Whole, that would be entirely appropriate. But 1 hope that at some stage we will adopt a more realistic approach to the times of sitting. If honourable senators want to know how my mind is working on this whole matter, although it is not entirely on this subject, let me say that I would like to see the Senate operating in this way: We would sit on committees in the mornings on days on which we were not having party or Cabinet meetings- </para>

              <para>- lt is true that this is not strictly relevant to this motion; but, if honourable senators want to hear my views on this, I will give them. Then I would like to see the Senate sitting from 2 p.m. until about 7 p.m., when it would stop. I do not think it is reasonable that any body of men such as ourselves should start, as we do, at 9 a.m. - whether in party, executive or Cabinet meetings or elsewhere - and then sit here until 11 or 12 o&#39;clock at night. I do not think that is sensible. If we were to start at 9 a.m. and finish at about 7 p.m., 1 think it would be more healthy and more efficient. That is my view, it would enable us to attend to committee work in the mornings, when there were party or Cabinet meetings. If we needed extra days, such as the Mondays or Fridays, we could use them for committee work. I am not dogmatic about this, but it seems to me to be a reasonable way in which the Senate could work. I do not think the present setup is sensible al all. We inherited it, and we should realise that there is nothing sacrosanct about it and try now to evolve reasonable sitting days and times suited to our needs. That is what I have in mind, but I have not a closed mind on it by any means. </para>

            <para>- I believe that it is desirable that matters such as this be discussed and settled in an atmosphere of co-operation. I rise merely to say that the members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party have been told that they may vote freely on all the issues that are to come up for decision, as, I understand, is the case with other senators; but all the members of my Party agree with what is set out in this proposal. We see nothing wrong with it. We believe that it is a good idea to say that the actual sitting days shall be decided as the occasion arises, because we are entering a period in which we will be experimenting with committees. In these circumstances it is a good idea to leave a decision on the days of sitting as open as possible. For that reason, whilst we members of the Democratic Labor Party have no desire to obstruct any co-operation that may be felt desirable, we believe that this proposal is the right way to deal with the matter and we are prepared to vote for it. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) &#91;2.40&#93;  -  I wish to raise a matter that I believe is built into the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson).</inline> I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> standing in his place here in the Senate, say that the validities and virtues of the Senate should be preserved. I found myself on that occasion, as I find myself today, of the same opinion. I wish to remind honourable senators of how this matter has crept into the Senate underneath the doors, as it were. Let me remind honourable senators of what happened. </para>
          <para>It was agreed in the House of Representatives - since it seems to be the fashion these days, I will not use the traditional expression - that the Standing Orders Committee of that House should sit and examine the problem, as the House saw it, that related to the sitting days, times and periods of the House. On that Committee sat the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> Then last week the report of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives was brought before the House, as I understand it, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and it was debated for 3 days. The House of Representatives then came to the conclusion that the proposed cycle that we have before us today was the method by which that House should sit and conduct its business. </para>
          <para>There are 2 interesting points to observe from that. One is that the matter was referred to the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, which produced a report. The other is that the House then decided that that was the way it wished to have its sittings. In this process there was one significant parliamentary and constitutional point that was advanced, maintained and sustained, and that was that the House should refer to its appropriate committee a full examination of the problem that apparently arose and caused the Standing Orders Committee of the House to sit and report. </para>
          <para>It is conclusive, on the experience I have had in the last week, that in this context the House of Representatives paid no regard whatsoever to the Senate. It did not consider in any way what were the problems that confronted the Senate. It just moved to adopt the proposal. Now, sneaking underneath the doors of the Senate comes this motion which the Senate has not had enough time to look at. I have been a soldier and I have been a politician. As a soldier, I have a good look at the ground over which I am to advance because, as likely as not, it is filled with mines. As a politician, I know that there are many booby traps unless these matters are fully examined. </para>
          <para>I consider that, at the very least, any proposal that related to the conduct of the business of the Senate should have been discussed between the managers of the 2 Houses at some level or should have been the subject of some expression of opinion by the Senate as a result of which our Standing Orders Committee could have examined this matter par i passu with the examination by the House of Representatives. But it is now brought into the Senate as a whole with very little warning, and we are expected to embark upon a process of changing the sittings of the Senate to conform with decisions that have already been taken in another place. The problems that are involved are not yet fully discerned. At this stage I will not say anything further, except to indicate that the matters that will flow from this motion, if it is carried, will be examined by me at least in some depth before we reach final conclusions on the matters that are buried inside this motion. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator POYSER</inline>(Victoria) 12.441-1 support with some reservations the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson. I have some misgivings in relation to the situation outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> because the Senate has a freedom that does not exist in another place in relation to normal debates, question time and other matters. 1 can visualise, that if we reach the stage where we are sitting 3 days a week for 2 weeks and then not sitting for a week, we will be sitting for far fewer hours than we are now. I expected that any system to be introduced would give us a number of sitting hours at least equal to those operating at present, and would involve less travelling for senators, particularly for those who live in the States furtherest from the capital. We should introduce more sanity into our sitting arrangements. Now I find that we are discussing a system of sitting for 3 days in each of 2 weeks and then adjourning for the third week, accompanied by a move to restrict question time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has indicated a desire to curtail our present privileges in respect of questions on notice. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I for one would not support cutting down our present privileges. If we desire to use the time, it is available to us to speak for longer periods. I can visualise a return to the situation that exists in another place, where a time limit of half an hour instead of an hour is imposed. Should that method be introduced here I could visualise that the guillotine, which has been rarely used in my time in the Senate, would be used more frequently to enable the Senate to get through the business. Under the new system we would be sitting far fewer days, if flexibility was retained and the numbers in the Senate were great enough to force an adjournment on Thursday nights. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first that I heard of the proposal was at a meeting in the Senate Club Room called by the Labor Party. Our aim was to introduce more sanity into our sitting hours. It was proposed that members stay in Canberra over the weekend, perhaps using that time for party committee work, and not necessarily for parliamentary committee work. If it were to be used for parliamentary committee work that would be an imposition on the staff that I would not care to support. We now sit on 3 days for each of 3 weeks and then have off a period of about 10 days. If we are to have off a period of 12 days after sitting for 2 weeks our present privileges will have to be cut if we are to get through the business of this House. </para>

              <para>- Certainly. We will rise on the Thursday night instead of on the Friday night. Senators who live in the closer States to Canberra will be home early Friday morning, while others will be home a little later. We will not then return to Canberra until the following Tuesday week. This is the general proposal. We will be sitting far fewer hours than we sit now. This involves a tremendous danger because in the Senate we will have to cut our speaking times to suit the sitting hours. I appreciate that there are members who are willing to leave this place the day after they arrive here if it is possible to do so. I want to see that the privileges we now enjoy are not cut back. </para>

          <para>I understand that in the early days of the Senate no limitation whatever was placed on the length of speeches and that a filibuster could take place on a matter of principle. That situation no longer obtains in the Senate. Perhaps it is a move for the better, perhaps for the worse. Let us not make today a decision that on some future occasion will limit this House to a continuous sitting period of only 3 days a week until the last fortnight of the session when we will be sitting 4 days a week, and around the clock. Associated with a system like this there has to be a real attempt by the Government to bring business before the Senate, in the early stages of the session. Unfortunately I was not able to attend here in the last week of the last session when the Senate sat for greatly extended hours. We on this side of the chamber and many Government members have often pleaded for action to be taken in respect of the method of presentation&#39; of business in this Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps so, but there is also the danger I have suggested, of a cutting back of our privileges in association with it. Last session Bills were introduced in the House of Representatives which did not see the light of day in the Senate until 6 or 7 weeks, later although in the early stages of the session we could have handled those Bills without any trouble. 1 agree with the principles that have been laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson. I would like the Senate to have an opportunity to vote also on the days of sitting but my first thought is to ensure that our rights to speak, at question time particularly, and our other rights will not be interfered with in order to tailor the business of the Senate to the times that members want to sit. That is my only fear. I think we are now approaching with more sanity the problems of travelling that face members coming from Queensland and Western Australia, for instance, but let us not make that approach at the expense of cutting back, our privileges. </para>

            <para>- I wish to put my individual view with regard to the proposal. I would hope that my position in this matter has been well known for the last 12 or 15 years. I am strongly in favour of the proposal and I shall briefly state my reasons. As to the travelling of senators from outlying places and States, the travelling effort today is altogether incommensurate with the time spent on a weekly basis here in Canberra. Further, the cost of travelling must be reduced if the proposed system is adopted; that is to say, a 3 weeks cycle instead of a 4 weeks cycle. If I were to come to Canberra for 2 weeks, interrupted only by a Saturday and Sunday, I would usually stay here over the weekend and therefore would continuously consider parliamentary matters over those 2 weeks without interruption by electoral matters or matters pertaining to business other than Parliament. I think that is a great opportunity for added efficiency in this area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also believe that to go home for 2 weekends and 1 week, with the knowledge that that would recur regularly, would give an opportunity to plan electoral work, and also a degree of leisure at home on a much better basis than applies at present, whereby we try to travel over the weekends. The House of Representatives has now considered this matter after great resistance over a number of years, lt was not considered in any degree surreptitiously, secretly or suddenly. The House of Representatives took this matter on to the floor of the House and decided on a vote of its members. </para>

              <para>-  It was decided on an open vote of members by 66 ayes to 39 noes. I think we should recognise that we are merely one of two Houses. It is of the utmost importance for the proper operation of Parliament that in the mechanics of consultation of each other&#39;s view and considering each other&#39;s Bills and proposals, from the point of view of sittings we ought to be available to each other as nearly as possible on  a  basis of conformity. I am dealing with the question from the point of view of times of sitting. One has to reflect only upon the advantage which would be gained, if we were to sit during the same weeks as the House of Representatives sat, from the point of view of party consultations and joint committee discussions - whether they be party committees or parliamentary committees. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Then there is the further fact that the Parliament can operate only with the aid of the services that are available - the broadcasting, dining and other staff services which are available to us and without which we would be infinitely less able to discharge our duties. If we are going to allow for the practicable, mechanical arrangements of those services which are provided by the various members of the staff, I would think that, unless there is some real reason in principle for us to disagree with this proposed new cycle, the only practical course would be for us to join with the other House in the arrangements which it has made for times of sitting. </para>
          <para>That brings me to the only other point that I wish to make and it is in answer to the argument advanced  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser.</inline> He expressed concern about loss of privileges. That is  a  concern which I completely share with him, and I will join with him la any effort to maintain the privileges and opportunities of this chamber to debate matters and to reach decisions upon them effectively. But the reason why the last 2 lines were inserted in the motion, as 1 interpret it, was so that honourable senators could vote upon the proposal for a 3 weeks cycle in substitution for the 4 weeks cycle without prejudice in any way to the days upon which we would sit and the hours during which we would sit. </para>

              <para>- I hope that it will always be a numbers game in any house of parliament. I think that the simple counting of numbers of elected personnel should be the decisive factor in any house of parliament, subject, of course, to a lot of limitations. But all I am saying is that, having listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> I believe it is the very concern that he expressed which prompted whoever drafted this motion to include those cautionary words, to remind us that the adoption of the 3 weeks cycle instead of the 4 weeks cycle would not in any way prejudice or inhibit us with regard to the days upon which we sat or the hours during which we sat. I think that, for the purposes of clarity of debate, there is great advantage and logic in keeping the question of days and hours of sitting for inclusion in a. subsequent motion so that it can be decided as a separate matter. </para>

            <para>-  I want to be very brief in making a few observations which I think will be pertinent and will help honourable senators in making decisions about the proposals we are discussing. At the outset I indicate that I am in complete agreement with the idea of a 3 weeks cycle. I think it is a sensible proposal. In coming to the question as to what we are to do during the 2 weeks sitting of the Senate, I am mindful of the fact that in comparatively recent times this chamber - and it stands quite apart from the other chamber in this respect - has undertaken a tremendous amount of committee work; very much more than the other place has undertaken. This is the way I see the system operating in the future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am not too sure of the connotation, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> has referred to the question of privileges. The very fact that one is taking part in the deliberations of the Commonwealth Parliament is, I suggest, in itself a privilege, and one does not lose any privileges merely by sitting in one form or another. The problem, as I see it, is that so many demands are being made upon the time of honourable senators. At the moment the Senate is not the sort of efficient chamber that it ought to be. The resources of the 60 honourable senators in this chamber are not being used in a way that would lead to the best parliamentary performance. 1 have found, from my own experience in committees, that the work of this chamber can be very much enhanced and greatly advanced by the sort of committee work that is being undertaken at the present time. I should imagine that in this circumstance there would not be a need for the sitting of the Senate or the Committee of the whole beyond the range of sittings which we are presently undertaking. But I see a great need to accommodate, within the total spread of hours in a week, the committees which should be sitting during this period. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It might even require cutting down the sitting hours of the Senate itself. I think that this was implied, if not suggested straight out, in earlier observations by an honourable senator. I believe it could be well argued that the type of work that is being done in committees will lead to an expedition of the business of the Senate itself. In other words, we would reach decisions on the very important issues with which we were dealing in the committee areas and the recommendations or the results of our deliberations in the committee areas would in turn find their way into this chamber and would lead to a quicker dispatch of the business of the Senate in the particular areas which had been the responsibility of the committees. I suggest that the work of committees of review - for instance the Estimates Committees and the other committees that have been proposed in quite recent days - could lead to a diminution of the number of hours that have been taken in the past to deal with the Estimates - they have been dealt with in a rather messy, sloppy way - and with some of the other matters which are of concern to us. 1 do not see any great problem regarding compatibility between the sittings of the Senate and the sittings of committees. In fact, as I perhaps conveyed in my earlier comments, I see a very great deal of merit in what has been happening in the committee areas. 1 am one who would prefer to sit on a committee and get right down to the very heart of the issue which we are considering. If 7 or 8 honourable senators were appointed to each committee, we could have 7 committees sitting at the one time. At the moment committees are not permitted by the Standing Orders to sit during the sittings of the Senate. Therefore, there is a slowing up rather than a speeding up in the business of the Senate. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I just make these points which I think ought to be taken into account if we are to move completely into this committee area. It is a very novel proposal. We have not yet ascertained the full extent of the work that can be undertaken by committees. 1 do not think that we have by any means probed the complete depth of the worthwhile contribution that committees can make to the affairs of the Senate. As time goes on I think we will find that this area of the Senate&#39;s activities will be broadened and that great benefits will flow from it, particularly if we are able to match committee needs with the physical resources of this Parliament - that is, in terms of committee rooms, staff and so on. I cannot see any possible loss of privilege merely because we sit not as a Senate but as committees. lt is a great privilege to sit in any area of the deliberations of this chamber and there is no diminution in the privileges or opportunities available to honourable senators when they are sitting on committees. I should imagine that from time to time reports will come into this chamber as a consequence of the work of the committees and the Senate will have a better basis of understanding and knowledge of particular areas because they have been fully probed and exploited by the committees. I make those observations to assist honourable senators to come to some kind of determination as to what ought to happen. </para>

            <para>- I hope the Senate will agree to the motion as put. 1 do not believe that the matter has been slipped under the door hurriedly to try to force us to follow what the House of Representatives wants. This idea has been canvassed very freely for the last 15 years, to my knowledge. Perhaps the powers that be in the various parties who have communications with their colleagues in the House of Representatives heard that the House was to discuss this matter and that it was to be discussed by the Senate and perhaps they could have tipped us the wink before the decision was made. To me, it makes no difference. I want to point out to the Senate why I think we would be well advised to accept this motion. If we defeat the motion and maintain our present cycle of sittings - that is, 3 weeks on and 1 week off - and if the House of Representatives adopts the new procedures, I believe we will find that one or both Houses of Parliament will be sitting for at least 3 days in every week of the sessional period. That will mean that in each cycle the Senate will have a week when it is sitting on its own and later in the cycle will come the week when the House of Representatives will be sitting on its own. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As Chairman of a joint select committee of the Parliament, I believe that that will make the calling of sittings of joint select committees very difficult; whereas if both Houses were sitting in uniformity so far as the weeks of sitting go, these joint select committees could programme their meetings and get on with their work. The motion leaves it to us to decide later what days in each of the 2 weeks we will sit, if we adopt the new cycle. My only request in that respect is that we do not leave that too much in a state of airy-fairy indecision because chairmen of committees have to programme the work of their committees; they have to alert their members and witnesses have to bc on call. It is this indecision, which is demonstrated by our not meeting tonight or on Fridays when it was proposed that we might, that is killing the effective organisation of the work of committees. I believe that it is for the good of the Parliament - and that means its members - that wc adopt the same cycle as the House of Representatives. It would be very hard on the staff if one House of the Parliament was to be in session for every week of the sessional period. 1 do not know what the listeners to the broadcasts of the proceedings would think. If we adopt the same cycle as the House of Representatives at least the listeners will get a week off in which to enjoy the programmes that would be broadcast normally if the proceedings of Parliament were not being broadcast. </para>

That is important. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> following a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> seized upon the final words of the motion: </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I want to link those words with the experience that I suppose nearly every honourable senator has had when he has assumed a position on one of the various standing committees; his home-based secretary has had to do a lot more work. It is very easy to talk about the dignity of honourable senators, but I think we have to realise that the back bench senators particularly do not have a massive staff of research officers. Most of their secretaries delve into a lot of fields for them. I do not think there is one honourable senator here today who has not some subject to which he gives a lot of time. The result is that he is able to make a positive contribution to a committee. That has been the hallmark of the success of the committees. </para>
          <para>I emphasise the extra work that is performed by the secretaries of back bench senators. I can do no better than quote a remarkable speech made in another place by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> He made the point that a secretary of a back bencher is not on any particular overtime rate. I am not envious of the staffs of the Ministers; I never have been. I admire the loyal staffs that Ministers have. I take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> up on this aspect. I know his energy.  His  staff would be here and he would achieve a lot. However, if some of us stayed here over a weekend, we would have a backlog of work in our offices. Our secretaries are in Sydney. They are not here. What is the alternative? Do we impose upon the staff of our leaders or on the staff of the Whip? They have their work to do. I direct those comments to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson).</inline> It is quite obvious that with the Estimates committees and with the standing committees, if we meet from Tuesday to Friday one week and from Monday to Thursday the following week, the Mondays and Fridays of the alternate weeks will be occupied with committee work. This would be quite satisfactory. </para>
          <para>That brings me to this point: In this fortnightly cycle, obviously some interstate members will stay here in Canberra but others will go back to Melbourne or Sydney. What will be the situation of an honourable senator who wishes to interview a particular segment of the trade union movement or an immigration group? He will want to see them and prepare submissions and material. What happens when he comes back here to attend a vital Estimates committee meeting. I make that appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson. I say in advance that it is not impossible for the Federal Parliamentary Officers to roster a duty girl for typing on Saturdays. I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> agrees with me. Our secretaries have a lot of work to do now. I would be in a more receptive mood in regard to these proposals if their work load were eased. That is only one facet of the proposed new cycle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> and myself - and I think this goes for back bench Liberal senators - took umbrage and approached the Department of the Interior. We had one of these multipurpose weekends when we were representing our leaders at various functions and then we had to return to our offices to do Party work. We wanted certain parking facilities. The point I make is that no two people approach a matter in exactly the same way. I am interested to see that our secretaries do not have to work harder than they do now. </para>

              <para>- No, it is not intended that we sit on Saturdays. The Minister has missed my point. If we are here for 5 days in one week and 5 days in the next week, our secretaries will have to work harder. Our secretaries are not like the staffs of Ministers&#39;, they do not get penalty rates for working at weekends. That is the point I make. We talk about the gap between the developed and underdeveloped countries. That is what is happening here between the back benchers and the Ministers. I have repeated my point. The Government tried to put it over us with regard to facilities for parking cars. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> will agree. The only reason we were given that privilege was because I deliberately parked in Martin Place, was issued with a summons and sent it to the Minister for the Interior. I soon got action. If the Government wants this cycle, it should, not pass the buck. There should not be this inequality between privileges for Ministers and privileges for ourselves. I am not envious, but I want efficiency. It is all very well to talk about attending meetings of committees. I think I have made the point loud and clear. I repeat it. This gap is widening. As a trade unionist, I will not give my secretary any additional work - as was stated by the honourable member for Newcastle - by giving her weekend work. The Ministers will have the privilege of their staffs doing donkey work for them. I want the same privilege. </para>

            <para>- The proposal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has put forward greatly attracts me. I believe I am expressing the views of my fellow Country Party senators when I say that the proposition attracts them also. The basic proposal is for the Senate to sit for 2 weeks and have 1 week supposedly for work in the electorate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack mentioned, this to an extent will bring the Senate into line with the House of Representatives. Over the period 1 have been here the Senate has sat 3 days a week for 3 weeks and then had a week up. I have found that that arrangement has fitted in pretty well with my programme. Perhaps I have become used to it. Under that arrangement I am able to enjoy some private life as well as carry out some electoral work and attend adequately to my Senate work. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To me the proposition that has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson gives no great thought to what is to occur in the future. Perhaps the wording of the motion indicates that at some future time we will determine what days we will sit. Honourable senators may decide that we should sit approximately the same total of hours we have been sitting in the past. I do not know whether we need to cut our hours of sitting by half and perhaps set aside the balance of the time for the very important Senate committee work in which many senators are involved. But it would seem to me that a businesslike decision would be to sit somewhere near the same total of hours as before. The proposition that the new arrangement will not come into operation until October indicates to me that we will have very little experience of it before the Senate rises for the Senate election. T imagine that by then we will have had experience of only one 3 weeks cycle or possibly two, under the new arrangements. </para>

              <para>- That is a point with which I shall deal. I feel that the Leader of the Government in the Senate would be required to tell at least his Party, as he has done on similar matters on other occasions and certainly during the last sessional period, that it is imperative that we break away from a 3 days a week sitting and sit on Friday. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack that prior to the forthcoming election it will be necessary to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday- and Friday of one week and then sit on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. </para>

There is very good reason for falling into line with the House of Representatives. We must consider the Hansard staff and other ancillary staff associated with the running of the Senate.

I refer to the activities of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack.

I know that in another place the members are facing an amendment to their hours of sitting. Already the Public Accounts Committee, which is a joint statutory committee which I hope will never be eliminated from these Houses of Parliament, finds that it will not be able to get a time slot in which to sit unless it sits on Monday, which would mean that senators who live a great distance from Canberra, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> would have to start to move from their homes either on Saturday or on Sunday. There has been a suggestion that the House of Representatives should commence on the Tuesday afternoon and make Tuesday morning available for committee work. I am not a member of the Public Works Committee but I have some idea of the type of work it does. I would be interested to know when that Committee intends to sit when the Parliament is sitting for 4 days a week. </para>

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition says that it is a proposal of his Party but I see it as a political matter and an immediate challenge to our standing committees.  His  proposition was thrown into this House in an attempt to get these standing committees into action and to get honourable senators involved in them. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> would care to indicate how many months or how many years the references which he proposed to be made to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare would keep that Committee occupied. The only thing I mention is that I doubt whether much thought has been given to the proposition of sitting for 2 weeks and having 1 week off and what will be the consequent developments in the running of the Senate. I foresee the last week of each 3 weeks cycle being taken up by the various other activities of the Senate. I predict that when this 3 weeks cycle is adopted, as I imagine it will be, we will be required to sit 4 days a week to deal with Government business. 1 agree fully with the comments that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. It would be better to see a programme laid down as to what we will be involved in before we commit ourselves to these new arrangements. As I mention, the general proposition greatly attracts me. I would be most appreciative of the opportunity to sit in Canberra for 2 weeks and then have a week in my own electorate, Victoria. On this basis 1 believe that the other Country Party senators have given some acceptance to that particular line of thought. </para>

            <para>-  I take the opportunity, as a free vote will be available on this question, to express some opinions and to indicate how I intend to vote. Let me outline the origin of this proposal. Last session <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> introduced a proposal that we should operate on a 2 weeks basis, that we should work for 2 weeks in a 4 weeks cycle. This was based on the belief that the House of Representatives would continue to work a 4 weeks cycle and that it would be convenient for us to operate along similar lines. The plan was to sit on Friday afternoon and Friday evening of the first week of the 2 sitting weeks, and then sit also from the Monday morning in the second week. In this way it was suggested that we would sit more hours in 2 weeks than we had been sitting in 3, It was also stated that it was logical, in order to cut down on travelling, to operate on the basis of 2 sitting weeks in a 4 weeks cycle. The proposal involved our sitting for just as many hours in this chamber while having twice as long at home, and we would have had to undertake 2 journeys instead of 3 in every 4 weeks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives considered this question in relation to that House and submitted a report embodying a proposal which seems to be entirely different from the one that was earlier submitted to the Senate. The proposal for the House of Representatives is now for a sitting of 2 weeks followed by a recess of 1 week. It is proposed that the House will rise at about 4.30 or 5 p.m. on the Friday of the first week and meet again at 2 o&#39;clock on Monday of the second week. It is said that this will involve somewhat longer hours than the House is sitting at present. But lt appears from the intention to rise at about 4.30 p.m. on Friday and not to meet until 2 p.m. on Monday that the members of the House of Representatives intend to return borne over that week-end. That was not the intention of the proposal that was originally submitted to this Senate. We were told that we would remain here over the week-end, that we would work intensively for 2 weeks and then have 2 weeks in our various States. </para>
          <para>I quite agreed with the proposal which involved having no less time in this Senate for the purpose of debate while at the same time having a longer period in our respective States. But let us look at the proposal that is now before us, which is for 2 weeks of sitting in a 3 weeks cycle. First let me take a period of 12 consecutive weeks, which is something like our normal sitting time in a session. We find that the new proposal will give us only 1 additional week in our respective States in that 12 weeks period. One might question whether the new proposal will really reduce travelling time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> has shown how the proposal would work in actual sitting days over a 16 weeks period. At present we sit for 36 days in 16 weeks, whereas the new proposal would mean our sitting for only 33 days in that period. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline>made a very important contribution to this debate. I agree that in changing sitting days and hours we must be very careful not to interfere with the rights and privileges of senators. This is not the first occasion on which suggestions have been made for the restriction of speaking times, restriction of questions, or restrictions in other directions aimed at making it easier to get in and out of this place. We must remember that this is a public forum. This is a place where senators who have grievances may debate them and seek to obtain answers to their questions. We should do nothing as a Parliament to reduce the opportunity of senators to use this as a public forum. I have been very much in support of the committee system. I have accepted the standing committees as bodies that would be regular in their operation, so that on any occasion on which we thought a Bill could be better dealt with by a committee we could refer it to a standing committee, and that committee could query persons other than Ministers on how particular parts of the legislation would operate. But now we have had put to us a proposal for standing committees to investigate estimates, and I am very doubtful whether 1 should now support a committee system. If any such system interferes with my opportunities as a senator to rise and question publicly a Minister on expenditure for which he is responsible then I could not support such a system. </para>
          <para>There is another important question to be considered. Before we agree to any alteration of the sitting hours we must know the ultimate repercussions that such an alteration will have. This is a fear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack entertains. The House of Representatives referred the matter to its Standing Orders Committee which brought down a report containing a full suggested programme which the House could adopt in part or in globo. Before we agree to the 3 weeks cycle we must be clear on what may ultimately arise from it. I have already mentioned that over a period of 16 weeks we will be sitting only 33 days instead of 36 days as at present. Does this mean that there is some desire to curtail the rights and privileges of senators? </para>
          <para>I do not agree with those who say that we must give first consideration to the staff. The staff are employed for the purpose of assisting members. Members are not appointed for the purpose of thinking of the convenience of the staff. </para>

              <para>- What 1 am saying is that the staff are appointed for the assistance of members. They are appointed to meet the requirements of members. If the hours of work of members are such that the duties the staff are called upon to work are unreasonable or outside a standard code that might be established by arbitration, then it is the Government&#39;s responsibility to meet, either by extra payment to the staff or the appointment of additional staff, the requirements of members. lt is not for members to meet the requirements of the staff. The main question for us to decide is what is best for the nation in our attendances in this Parliament and that is what I am asking honourable senators to consider today. </para>

          <para>We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the House of Representatives has decided on certain hours and certain days of sitting, and perhaps we may have to fall somewhat into line with that other place. But the fact is that the House of Representatives made its decision with a full understanding of the whole proposal - sitting days, sitting hours, speaking times and so on; a complete regulation of their activities in the House. We are trying to decide all these matters piecemeal. I agree that whatever decision we make on sitting hours the Senate must retain the right at all times to say when it will sit. I do not think it would be feasible to agree on any alteration of principle without a complete plan and proposal setting out how the system would work. 1 strongly recommend to those who may have the power in this House that the whole question be taken up with the Standing Orders Committee. A complete report could be brought down and honourable senators should have the right of a free vote on the various questions. We would have the whole programme of the activities of the Senate before us. We could decide on all activities and not one aspect only. </para>

              <para>- As I see it the question is open now because it is specified in the motion that the Senate will decide on the days of sitting. I feel tempted to move the adjournment of this matter which has been brought before the Senate because I think it is ill-considered. When the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> stood up he said he would make time available in the coming week to discuss other matters associated with the sittings of the Senate, such as the hours of sitting and other ancillary matters. Before one can give proper consideration to the problems mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> I believe one must know the whole programme. It has been brought here in a piecemeal way. We are asked to commit ourselves to a cycle of 3 weeks instead of a cycle of 4 weeks without knowing what hours we are going to sit and the time limit on speeches. We do not know whether any privileges will be cut down. I think this is only making a hotchpotch of the system. I speak with a little experience because for the past few years I have had only 1 weekly break from this Parliament and I have had only about 2 Fridays away from this Parliament when I have not been working on a committee. Even during the short recess which has just occurred I had to come to Canberra for 2 weeks to sit on a committee. So the whole question of how long one works and what work committees will do is bound up in the one problem. At this stage I think it would be unwise for the Senate to decide what the activities of the Senate will be in the future. I know it is within the hands of this Senate at any time to change things but I think most of us are conservative by nature and we resist change. It is evident amongst some honourable senators who have spoken that there is a resistance to change. </para>

          <para>I support the 3 weeks cycle but I want to know more about the hours of sitting, the times of sitting, what is going to happen with committees and whether we are going to sit 3 days in each week and have the Fridays and Mondays for committee work. The committee of which I am  a  member proposes to sit over the weekends to try to get rid of the work facing it. The Senate has a proposal before it for 5 Estimates committees and 7 standing committees. By the commencement of the first session of the Parliament in 1971 a report must be presented to the Senate. At the present time 2 reports are coming up. I do not think it would make a great deal of difference if the Leader of the Government in the Senate were to withdraw this motion at this time and come forward with a detailed programme for honourable senators to look at. They would then know exactly what they were confronted with, what privileges they were going to gain, what privileges they were going to lose and what demands were going to be made upon their time. At the present time if honourable senators from Western Australia want to get any work done they have to work their staff mostly during a weekend. If the Senate sits on Thursday nights it is midday Friday before one gets home and one has to leave one&#39;s home at 11 o&#39;clock on Monday morning to come back here. Honourable senators are in a very awkward position in trying to get any home work done. This is not so with honourable senators from the States of Victoria and New South Wales. They have things made a little hit easier. I have said it before and I will say it again: This Parliament is built around New South Wales and Victoria with little consideration for the outlying States. I do not even feel like voting upon this proposition without having before me a full programme showing what the responsibilities and obligations of honourable senators will be. If the vote is taken I shall support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I support what has been proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I think the discussion which has taken place since the motion was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson proves the point he made. He did not advocate any reduction in the length of speaking times for honourable senators. This point has been raised by a number of honourable senators and they are entitled to fear, I suggest, that there could be some reduction in the activities of the Senate itself. I agree with honourable senators that this should not take place. I think it ought to be clear in everybody&#39;s mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> did not propose this. He said it by interjection. I certainly would not support his amendment if he had proposed this. I think everybody who has spoken has subscribed to the idea of a 3 weeks cycle, but the inclusion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> in the motion of the expression that the Senate should fix its own times - 1 do not suggest it was done &#91;or this purpose - has raised the query in the minds of honourable senators that the proposal may be to shorten the time of Senate sittings. In fact, the length of sittings would be shortened by a small amount if we were to adopt the cycle that is proposed and retain our present sitting hours. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Condon</inline> Byrne has pointed out we would, in fact, be devoting a shorter time to the sittings of the Senate than we are under present arrangements. </para>

              <para>- 1 have checked it, and the proposition is correct. Over a period of 16 weeks we are now sitting for 36 days and with the same sitting times in the 3 weeks cycle we would be sitting for 33 days. Obviously 1 would not be in accord with maintaining the same number of hours in the 3-week cycle. Nobody has said he is against the 3-week cycle because the advantages are so evident to everybody. If one has 2 weeks of work in the Parliament and a week in the electorate and this is co-ordinated with the sittings of the House of Representatives, there is no question that it is a lot better than the arrangement we have now. lt is clear everybody accepts that. The proposition ought to be dealt with separately because I, too, like other honourable senators, have some reservations about determining the hours of sitting of the Senate under the cycle and about the place of certain standing and other committees in the system if we widely adopt the system of committees which has been proposed by the Opposition and the Government. It concerns me that we may be reaching the position where there will be fewer sitting hours of the Senate and more meetings of the committees. The argument has been advanced that the work of the committees is just as important as the work of the Senate. I think honourable senators who are afraid about the limitation of the Senate sitting time have good reason for their concern. I agree with what has been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and I suggest that we deal with the matter separately because it is a very complicated matter. </para>

              <para>- Yes. If &#39;as the occasion arises&#39; were taken out and the Senate determined the resolution, when the matter of a sitting came up for consideration it could be dealt with simply by the Senate fixing the dmes. The words &#39;as the occasion arises&#39; suggest to some honourable senators that there might be some dickering with the hours. It seems to me to be evident that honourable senators support the principle of the 3 weeks cycle, but some honourable senators have expressed the fear that there may be fewer sitting hours for the Senate. I also have that fear. Nevertheless 1 think that is a matter to be resolved separately because there are other complicated issues related to it, including the one mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> about not sitting on some nights. </para>

            <para>- Obviously certain things are emerging with great clarity in the course of this discussion. Some of the matters which have arisen are complex. There is an area of speculation and an area of pragmatism. We accept as a pragmatic situation that the flow of legislation is not from this place to the House of Representatives but from the House of Representatives to this chamber, in the main. Much as we might like to speak of the independence of the Senate, and it is an independent body in a constitutional sense, the actual work flow comes from the other place. As a matter of fact the House of Representatives has determined a new time schedule and, whether we like it or not, we are now in the position where we must have cognisance of that and accommodate ourselves to it so far as is consistent with the independence of the Senate. That, I believe, is why the Senate is of the opinion that we should accommodate ourselves to a cycle of 3 weeks. There remains only the question of whether we should specify more particularly than that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> original proposition was for a specification of the actual sitting days. </para>

          <para class="block">The Senate is in a position of complete fluidity so far as its sitting arrangements are concerned; We have all sorts of new arrangements. We have a plethora of committees and new time schedules which are fairly acceptable to the Senate have been proposed. I think that the worst thing that we could do would be to determine at this stage a new schedule of sitting days. I think the proper thing for us to do is to accept the cycle of 3 weeks and to pursue the existing time schedule of 3 days for each of the 2 weeks until the Senate other&#39; wise determines. </para>

              <para>- I agree. The original suggestion was exactly that, that we should accept the 3 weeks cycle and that the actual sitting days then be decided upon by the Senate as the occasion arises. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has suggested that the words *as the occasion arises&#39; might be deleted so that we can achieve a concurrence on the principle. I do not disagree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> proposes, but what will be the effect of the removal of those words? Does it mean that in a month&#39;s time or in a fortnight&#39;s time the Senate will lay down finally for all time the sitting days, or does it mean that from day to day the Senate will determine when it will sit in the next week and in the week following that? </para>

              <para>- If you took out the words &#39;as the occasion arises&#39; it would simply mean that when we began the cycle we would put down what we call our sessional orders, which would establish the days on which we were going to sit. If I had any influence on it we would not be laying down the sitting times for the remaining days of the week but would be laying down times as we have done by sessional order since time immemorial. An alteration of those times would require an alteration of the sessional order. </para>

              <para>- I rise to order. We have before us a resolution moved by the Leader of the Government and an amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, in addition to which there are half a dozen other amendments. I refer to standing order 139 which states that every amendment must be relevant to the question to which it is proposed to be made. I suggest that we comply with that standing order instead of having about 18 people moving amendments while an honourable senator is speaking. </para>

            <para>- I want to pass a few remarks on this matter. 1 say at the outset that I think it is a matter of regret that all this confusion has crept in. I was under the impression that the resolution before the Senate was that the Senate agrees in principle that the sittings of the Senate should be on the basis of 2 weeks of sitting followed by 1 week&#39;s adjournment, with the actual sitting days to be decided upon by the Senate, as the occasion arises. I was under the impression also that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> had moved for the deletion of the words &#39;with the actual sitting days to be decided upon by the Senate, as the occasion arises.&#39; I understand that subsequently his amendment was amended by agreement across the chamber so that his proposal was that the last 4 words only would be deleted. </para>

              <para>- I shall state my views and say exactly where I stand on this. I shall support the original resolution down to the words &#39;by 1 week&#39;s adjournment&#39;, but 1 do not support the remainder of the motion. I am sick and tired of the flexibility of sitting hours that we have in this chamber. Last Thursday there were about 70 different ideas of when the Senate would rise. In my case, as in the case of senators from Western Australia and other distant areas, if I want to make any sort of commitment I am in no position to do so because we do not know until the last night, or even the last hour, when we will leave Canberra. I want to see  -  I believe that this is ultimately what it will boil down to - a situation in which we can dispose of this confusion, in which we can sit down and work out the times of sitting. The people of Australia who send us to this place expect us to come here and work. In many instances we do not come here and work because we are in a state of utter confusion. 1 would like to see us sit from Monday to Thursday of one week and from Tuesday to Friday of the following week, so that we would have 4 full sitting days each week. I do not want to see any of the privileges withdrawn. 1 do not want to see us in a situation in which question time in this chamber is reduced. I do not want to see the privilege of discussing General Business and the equivalent of Grievance Day taken away from us. Nor do I want to see the right to speak on the motion for the adjournment taken away. 1 believe that concurrently with setting the sitting hours we should make other arrangements so that, as far as possible, we know when these 4-day sittings will be, if we decide on them, and we will have a period in our own States during which we can carry out commitments that we enter into in advance. At the moment, very rarely when the Senate rises arc we able to say with complete certainty that we will resume on a certain day. The present Budget session of the Parliament commenced a week late. What caused that 1 would not know. But many of us had made commitments earlier in the year on the basis that the Budget session would commence a week earlier than it actually did. So, we then had to rehash our commitments and those sorts of things. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is a tendency for some people to say that the committee system will not work in this chamber. The use of the committee system is one of the best things that have happened in the Australian Parliament, lt is up to every one of us to help it to get off the ground. The Senate select committees that have operated in the last 2 or 3 years have done a good job, in the main. But, again in the main, they have been hamstrung and handicapped by the fact that there is insufficient staff. The Clerks of the Senate are completely overworked. The Library is understaffed. In other words, we are living in the jet age in 1970 and we are trying to run the Parliament on a horse and buggy system. We have not been able to catch up with the developments of this century. The obligation is on us to do something about this situation. The obligation is on us as members of the Opposition and on honourable senators opposite as members of the Government parties to see that the Parliament works in the best interests of everybody in this country. We must be prepared to take a good look at ourselves. We must not keep on dividing on party lines because we do not like the colour of each other&#39;s hair. I am talking now not on a policy matter but on a matter that concerns the proper operation of this chamber and the tasks that should properly be before it as a responsible section of the Parliament of this country. </para>
          <para>I refer now to a matter that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> namely, the problem that arises when one goes back to one&#39;s office at the end of the week&#39;s sitting. When I leave here on Friday and go to my home town, I have only Saturday and Sunday on which I can work in my office. It is unfair for the secretary of any member of the Parliament to be asked to spend her weekend working on jobs that could be done much more expeditiously and much better in other circumstances. This is another matter that we should be considering. So I hope that after we have decided the basic question of the days on which we will sit there will be enough people in this Parliament who have a national outlook and who will be prepared to look at the staff situation. </para>
          <para>I know that the point has been made that there is not enough accommodation here. Why is there not enough accommodation? Why has not the accommodation grown with the increase in population? Why has it not grown with the increase in the duties and tasks set before us as parliamentarians? This comes right back to here. </para>
          <para class="block">The reason is that we have not been able to look forward and we are frightened that somebody outside will criticise us on the basis that the expenditure on the Parliament is too high. No member of the public will criticise any parliamentarian while he is doing his job for his party and for the Parliament. The only time we are criticised is when we are not doing our job- not when we are doing it. </para>
          <para>Nobody will give a tinker&#39;s cuss if a member of Parliament, provided he has the necessary work in front of him, has a staff of 3 or 4 people. The people will not worry one iota about it. But they do worry when their letters are not dealt with because of insufficient staff. The letters could refer to an urgent social services case, an urgent immigration case, any other domestic matter or perhaps a matter of national importance. I have 4 or 5 radio broadcasts that I have to make - purely as a parliamentarian. They have nothing to do with election campaigns. But I have not the time or the staff to be able to make them. So, for God&#39;s sake let us have a look at this aspect of the matter, too. Let us look at the job of the parliamentarian on a national basis. </para>
          <para>These are the sorts of things about which we should be worried. These things would be of far greater advantage to the member of Parliament than any increase in parliamentary salary or any increase in electorate allowance. He wants to do his job and live like a normal human being, with the opportunity to finish work at 5 or 6 o&#39;clock in the evening and, if he is in Canberra, to have a decent meal and come back to the evening session of the Parliament or, if he is in his electorate, to go home and enjoy the company of his family. That is also the right of every staff member. If there is insufficient staff, either at the parliamentary level or at the members level, the staff has to be increased. </para>
          <para>If overtime has to be worked, it should not be excessive. Clerks here have to stay until 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning and report for work at 9 o&#39;clock the same morning. This sort of thing should never occur under any circumstances. A reasonable amount of overtime is all right. In certain circumstances a fair amount of overtime is all right, provided that the proper award rates are paid. But a member&#39;s secretary does not receive any overtime payment at all because her salary carries a so-called loading that is supposed to cover all of her work outside of normal office hours. How ridiculous can you get? </para>
          <para>Because of the amount of work that goes through my office. 1 have even been challenged by the Minister concerned on the basis that my telephone bill is too big. All I say is that it will continue to be big while using the telephone is the only way I can overcome problems. If I have to make lengthy trunk line calls, I propose to continue to make them. If my secretary has no time to write adequate letters I will use urgent telegrams, because I believe that the people who put me into this Parliament are more important than I am and more important than the Government is. They will receive service as long as I can physically and humanly give it to them. When we are fixing sitting hours - I have stated my views on that matter clearly - for God&#39;s sake let us look at all these other things, too. Do not let this continue to be a horse and buggy Parliament in the jet age of the 1970s. </para>

              <para>- Yes. 1 understand that by general agreement the words &#39;as the occasion arises&#39; are to be deleted. As I understand the position, the way the actual days are decided upon by the Senate is that at the commencement of each session the Leader of the Government puts down a motion for what I think are known as sessional orders. He moves that the Senate meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at stated times. If we approved of the motion only down to the word &#39;adjournment&#39; - I do approve of this motion - it would mean that the present sessional orders - namely, that we sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week at certain times - would apply to the 3-week cycle. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But I think that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson is attempting to do here is to say that if we agree to the 3-week cycle we will look at the sessional orders. That can be done in any event; but the second part of the motion is an indication that the sessional orders can be looked at. As I understand the position, a sessional order is not sacrosanct. What can happen is what occasionally happens and what will happen today. The sessional order states that we will sit until 6 o&#39;clock tonight, although we all know that the sitting is suspended at 5.4S p.m. if we sit that late, and then come back at 8 p.m. and sit until 10.30 p.m. But we know that, by agreement, at about 4.30 p.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson will move that the Senate adjourn until 3 p.m. next Tuesday. </para>
          <para>We know also that when the question is put by the  President  in accordance with the sessional order, at 10.30 p.m. or II p.m., occasionally it is negatived and the Senate continues the debate. As a matter of practice, if we were to proceed to 10.30 tonight there would be nothing to prevent any senator moving that the Senate adjourn in accordance with the sessional order and resume at 9.30 tomorrow morning, lt is clear that the sessional orders are not completely and absolutely binding because at any stage the Senate may amend them to suit its purposes. In my view - and I could be wrong - the sessional orders simply spell out the proposed sitting days and times for the balance of the session and they may be amended according to the will of the Senate as we proceed. </para>
          <para>For that reason I believe that the words in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson&#39;s motion should remain and the actual sitting days would then be decided by the Senate. All I understand those words to mean is that the Sessional Orders which we have at present will be reviewed. They will remain as they are or they will be amended. For the reasons I have stated I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson provided that the words &#39;as the occasion arises&#39; are deleted. </para>

            <para>-I do not intend to detain the Senate for very long. However, I think I should say that the motion is delightfully vague and I am not keen on vague motions or decisions. I like to know where we stand. If the motion simply stated that the Senate agrees in principle that the sittings should be on the basis of 2 weeks of sitting followed by 1 week&#39;s adjournment, I would know where we stood. But the motion also contains these words: &#39;with the actual sitting days to be decided upon by the Senate, as the occasion arises.&#39; </para>

              <para>- He will accede to your request, within reason, so long as it is covered by the forms of the Senate. If the position is as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> I see nothing wrong with it. I do not think any honourable senator wants to dodge any work, even the young senators. I say this with the greatest respect: If the work is to be done here, we will do it. I recognise how difficult things become at the end of a session. I am not sticking up for the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> any more than I would stick up for anyone else in that position in the future. He will find it tremendously hard to spread the business more evenly, because there are only 5 Ministers in the Senate and 21 Ministers in the other place. If the motion is to be understood as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> explained it, and I believe it is, I see nothing wrong with it. </para>

I reassure him that my understanding of the position is as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has described it. I ask for leave to amend my motion.
