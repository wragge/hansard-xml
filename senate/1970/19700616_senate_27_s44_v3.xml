I draw the attention of the Minister - I know this has been done previously - to the justice of this request and point out that dog powder and similar animal requisites are tax free.

In response to the question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald,</inline> as the honourable senator knows the Government gives consideration to various matters prior to the Budget session. The representations made by the honourable senator in relation to sales tax are among the questions very carefully examined at the time of preparation of each Budget when the Government pays particular attention to sales tax on certain items. All that I can hope to do and what I shall certainly do is to direct the honourable senator's request to the Treasurer so that he may have regard, when framing the Budget, to the cosmetic lines mentioned by the honourable senator </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister representing the Attorney-General noticed that 5 cases against Tasmanian fishermen for breaches of fishing regulations have been adjourned pending the hearing of a test case before the High Court in which the right of the Tasmanian Government to make regulations concerning off-shore administration is being challenged by the Tasmanian Fishermen's Union? Does this not indicate how important it is that the legal control of the waters in question be decided? Has the Minister noted the invitation of the Fishermen's Union to the Commonwealth Government to share in the costs of the case? Would such action not be another way of achieving the same result as that sought by the Commonwealth in its offshore legislation as to who has the legal control of the waters in question? </para>

            <para>- My attention has not been directed to the news of the litigation to which the honourable senator refers, lt hardly seems to be appropriate, therefore, for me  10  comment upon the matter. The only comment I do make is that fisheries outside the territorial limits - I think that is the expression used - are expressly referred lo as being within the Commonwealth's power under the Constitution. Having regard to the ambiguity of that expression, the subject matter of fisheries might not be an appropriate one to use to test the full sovereignty of the area of the continental shelf and the territorial waters. </para>

              <para>- My attention was drawn to a comment in the newspaper concerning the family to which the honourable senator refers. 1 have some information on the matter. British subjects of European descent have always been able to travel to Australia without prior permission on presentation of valid British passports. Ronald Biggs and his wife managed to obtain passports issued by the British passport office in names other than their own. The manner in which the passports were obtained is the subject of continuing inquiries. </para>

          <para>The honourable senator referred to a report concerning a man who recently came here with his brother's wife and two children as British assisted migrants. The woman successfully posed as the man's wife throughout the careful procedure associated with the granting of assisted passages. The 2 children were put forward as the man's own children. The man's real marriage certificate was produced. The man and woman and her two children travelled to Australia with the type of document of identity normally used by assisted migrants. The question of what further action can and should be taken is being carefully examined from the legal and other aspects. The Department of Immigration, like the passport and immigration authorities of other countries, is continuously studying means of preventing malpractice in the issue of passport and Other matters, lt is necessary however to avoid subjecting the great majority of innocent travellers to unreasonable precautions and inconvenience for the sake of increasing marginally the chances of detecting the malpractice of a few. </para>

            <para>- 1 ask the Minister representing the Treasurer whether his attention has been drawn to the joint survey of industrial trends over the last 3 months made by the Bank of New South Wales, and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, which reveals a slackening in the production of engineering and build.ng materials in New South Wales and South Australia particularly. Is it a fact that past experience has shown the South Australian economy, which is heavily dependent on the motor vehicle, house appliance and building industries, to be particularly adversely affected by this sort of trend? Will close attention be paid to the South Australian economic barometer in these vital matters as the determinant of national economic financial policy? </para>

            <para>- 1 think this is a question that properly belongs, as the honourable senator says, to the Minister for the Interior who sits in another place. I know, from what I have read, that there is a crisis in the hospital situation in Canberra and that it relates to the nurses who are nol satisfied with the remuneration they are gelling. All I know, other than this, is that I watched a television programme yesterday, or the day before, in which the  Chairman  of the Canberra Hospital Board, who has a lot of knowledge in this matter, said quite clearly that this had to be resolved bv the arbitration system, and could only properly be so resolved. Beyond that I have no further information. This evening I will direct the question in writing to the Department concerned, because the. other place, as honourable senators know, has now risen. </para>

            <para>- This morning 1 heard a news report about this matter. I asked a question of the Department of Shipping and Transport in order that \ might have some information to supply to the Senate. The information that I have so far is that the Liberian vessel "Serfois' accidentally spilled about I ton of oil while berthing at Townsville. Investigations at dawn on Monday showed that a south-west wind during the night had blown the oil on to the beaches at Cleveland Bay and Magnetic Island. The incident is described as minor hy representatives of the Queensland Department of Harbours and Marine. The only other comment that I would like to make for my own part is that I think it will be agreed that such an incident within the harbour is probably a matter for the Townsville Harbour Board which, as a board, reports in the first instance to the State Government. Nonetheless, I am sure that the Commonwealth </para>

The provisions of our legislation are infinitely more liberal than the provisions that were available to conscientious objectors in previous wars. At present the Government thinks that the basis upon which a conscientious objector is entitled to exemption is well expressed in the legislation. </para>

As the honourable senator knows and as the Senate generally knows, there is a shift of the work load at Avalon to some extent.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Does the Federal Government have to approve a rise or fall in air passenger fares? Is it a fact that the Federal Government has received an application for increased air passenger fares from the 2 major domestic airlines? Is one of the reasons given for the increase the higher landing charges required by the Department of Civil Aviation? If the Government has a stated policy that the airlines must gradually meet the cost of aerodrome facilities, does the Government really mean that the people who use airline services must eventually pay for facilities which originally must have been provided through taxation? </para>

            <para>- It is rather difficult to remember all those points or even to write them down as they are stated. First of all, the Government does have to approve a rise or fall in air passenger charges and associated air freight charges. lt is true that about 10 to 12 days ago the Department of Civil Aviation received applications from the 2 trunk line operators - Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and Trans-Australia Airlines - for increases in air passenger fares. Lt is equally true that the Department has instructions from me that it is to examine such applications with extreme care, to ask all the appropriate questions, to search out al! the facts and in due course, having done so. to make a recommendation. The Department is in the process of making such a searching inquiry. I have not yet received a recommendation. I; is equally true that, as a result of a decision made a long time ago, there has been an endeavour, by imposing landing charges, to recover as far as is possible and as is sensible some of the costs associated with civil aviation. This is designed to recoup some of the costs of airport facilities. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that the balance of the question should be directed to the Department by being put on the notice paper, lt is a long question and 1 am anxious that it be answered in full. Le/ mc make the additional comment that aviation in Australia, in the domestic and international fields, is growing at the rate of about <inline font-style="italic">\5%</inline> per annum, which is a much faster growth rate than in the Australian economy as a whole. So the demand that is imposed on resources by aviation has to be taken quite seriously because aviation is doubling about every 5 or 6 years. This necessarily means that quite a large burden is placed on the Australian community in supporting the facilities to support aviation in this country. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator's question starts by asking whether statements reported in a Saigon newspaper, presumably, are correct. I do not know whether they are, and I am certain that nobody in Australia would vouch for them at question time in the fashion in which I am asked to do. Any conclusion that the honourable senator draws from the article is a matter for his own judgment. But the position in relation to Australia's participation in Vietnam is well known. The Government's policy in relation to our troop commitment there is quite clear. I do nol think there is anything to be added. I do not think the question creates any new situation in relation to the matters involved. </para>

          <para class="block">The question which the honourable senator poses bristles with contention, of course, as I suppose it is calculated to do. In truth, I have nothing to add to what I said to him last week in response to a question that he asked in relation to the responsibility of all Ministers of the Crown to act with complete propriety. When Ministers hold shares, it always must be established in my judgment - I was expressing a personal view, and I repeat it - that quite clearly they in fact could not be interested in shareholdings in any matter which related in particular to government in the sense that they would need to declare their interest. </para>
          <para>Having said all those things, I still do not believe that a member of Parliament or a Minister of the Crown loses his right as a citizen to do these things. I do not believe that he has to say: 'Although I have worked hard, and by being diligent and careful as a citizen I have saved some money, and my wife has saved some money also, we are to be denied the right to buy some shares in an honourable, honest and open way'. For that reason, I am afraid that I cannot subscribe to the views that are inferences from the question asked by the honourable senator. </para>
          <para>I have not bought shares for many years. This matter does not concern me. But the fact is that I still believe that everybody, including any senator, has the right to invest his or her savings- </para>

          <para class="block">The fact that he becomes a Minister does not mean that he has to go and live in a tent on his own and take no part in community life. Is there any sin in a man buying shares? Is there any sin in a man buying a house? Is there any sin in a man buying something to try to better himself? The qualification that 1 have made - and I repeat that it is a personal qualification - is that a man must act with complete propriety. He must act realising that what he does will be open to scrutiny. He must at all times be certain that he has no interest in a company which has dealings with him in his particular portfolio; for instance, he has to be certain that he will not have to make a judgment in relation to a company in which he might have a share investment. That is the criterion which I personally would apply, and I am sure it is the criterion which all the men whom I know in public life would apply. For that reason I do not respond any further to the honourable senator's question. </para>

Of course, I refer to the case  of  the honourable John Galbally? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator's question refers to the right of freedom of speech of a member of parliament. I would have thought that any Minister in this place would be unworthy of his salt or his salary if he were not prepared to expound his view regarding the right of freedom of speech of a member of parliament. Freedom of speech is one of the fundamental rights which the Constitution confers upon a member of parliament. Obviously it would be completely subversive of his duty to represent the community - the duty which a member of parliament undertakes when he is elected to parliament - if his right of freedom of speech were to be restricted or .subordinated by a party caucus or junta, unelected by the people. </para>

              <para>- t  wish the Leader of the Opposition would allow me the courtesy of replying to his question without repeatedly interjecting  in  a manner which seems to be designed by yapping to confuse my answer. I was about to say that 1 have no doubt that it is well known to the Leader of the Opposition that before any member of the Ministry accepts office he has to take an oath nol to reveal the counsel given before the Ministry and the Government of the day arrive at their decisions, lt has always been my understanding as a private member of the Parliament thai the Constitution imposed upon me a duty to question whenever I thought it was needful for mc to do so propositions put before the Parliament by the Government. However, to long as I am a member of the Government I am bound by the constitutional principle that the Ministry acts as one unit for the purpose of strong government in putting before the Parliament its final decision. It seems to be the envy of the Leader of the Opposition that the members of the Australian Labor Party, including the honourable senators who sit behind him are not able to vote according to their beliefs but that they are bound by a rule that the majority decision of Caucus decides their manner of voting in the Parliament. Honourable senators opposite seem to envy the proper independence and freedom which honourable senators on this side of the chamber enjoy enabling the distinguished members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition Senate team and I to vote according to our judgment. </para>

          <para class="block">The retail price of petroleum is, as was indicated in an answer which was given in this chamber last week, to a degree the responsibility of the Department of Customs' and Excise insofar as it administers the question of the intake of indigenous crude. Therefore, any questions in relation to this matter should be directed to the Minister for Customs and Excise or his representative in this chamber. I am sure it is known to everybody that in order to lake advantage of the duly concession which is given the companies have to use a certain percentage of the indigenous crude oil which is discovered and won in Australia. That has an influence upon the price, lt is also true that South Australia has price fixing in relation to the retail price of petroleum and that the other States, which have the balance of the responsibility, are influenced by the extent to which the price is varied by the Prices </para>
          <para class="block">Commissioner in South Australia. I suggest that all I have said goes to demonstrate that it is not an easy problem to which the honourable senator has referred. If he studies the Hansard reports of the week before last he will gain a better picture of the procedures adopted in relation to fixing the price of petroleum. </para>

            <para>- I should be surprised if at this time I could take all those statements exactly as read. However I can assure the honourable senator that when the Senate rises it is my intention to try to look at some terminals and airports, and Gladstone is one of them. I know from previous communications from other honourable senators that because of the expansion of Gladstone there is a need for quite considerable updating of facilities. I ant concerned to learn that the fire control measures are not. in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> view, all that they should be. He can be assured that I will direct a query to the Department this afternoon about them. </para>

Am 1 to gather from an answer to a previous question that the Government is not prepared to set up a committee lo investigate the desirability of members of Parliament declaring their interests'.' ls he aware that the House of Commons in 1969 found it necessary to set up such an inquiry because of the growing conflict between a member's private interests and his public duties? In view of this does the Leader of the Government believe that it is necessary for this Parliament to establish firm guidelines for members of the Parliament in this regard? </para>

      <quote>
        <para>The Commonwealth Government's position with regard to receipts duty was explained in my Second Reading Speech when introducing the States Receipts Duties (Administration) Bill 1970. As requested by the States, the proposed Commonwealth legislation, which applies only to business receipts, will have retrospective application to 18th November 1969. There are special provisions in the proposed legislation relating to a transitional period commencing on 13th November1969 and ending on a date to be proclaimed. The general effect of these special provisions is that liability to receipts duty on receipts during the transitional period will be determined by reference to the receipts duties laws of the States in force, whether validly or invalidly, during that period. As the proposed Commonwealth legislation does not relate to the period prior to 18th November 1969,I am not in a position to comment on any questions arising in respect of that prior period and I do not consider it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to initiate discussions with the States on such questions. </para>

              <para>On the evidence available to me, 1 am unable to say whether the number of deformed babies being born in areas of Vietnam where defoliants have been used is different from the Vietnamese national average. Despite an overseas report that relatively large doses of 2,4,5-T can cause foetal deformity in mice, there is, as far as I am aware, no conclusive evidence of a causal link between 2.4,5-T (or, for that matter, any other chemical defoliant) and foetal deformity in humans.

The survey, which has examined some hundreds of thousands of records of births since1960, has not so far uncovered any substantial evidence to prove a relationship between defoliant chemicals and abnornal birt hs in Vietnam. Defoliant chemicals were first used in any quantity in Vietnam in late 1962. The defoliation programme increased in size up to 1967. The number of abnormal births in Vietnam has decreased since 1965. </para>

            <para>The honourable senator's quotation is from Article 10 of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Declaration is nol a treaty but was embodied in Resolution 1904 (XVIII) which has the recommendatory effect of a General Assembly resolution. It does not recommend that Member States should cease trade with South Africa and it is the Government's view that such action would be unlikely lo influence South Africa's domestic policies but would cause hardship to all the communities of South Africa. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Government's position wilh regard to receipts duty was explained in my Second Reading Speech when introducing the States Receipts Duties (Administration) Bill 1970. As requested by the States, the proposed Commonwealth legislation, which applies only to business receipts, will have retrospective application to 18th November 1969. There are special provisions in the proposed legislation relating to  a  transitional period commencing on 18th November 1969 and ending on a date to be proclaimed. The general effect of these special provisions is that liability to receipts duty on receipts during the transitional period will be determined by reference to the receipts duties laws of the States in force, whether validly or invalidly, during that period. As the proposed Commonwealth legislation does not relate to the period prior to 18th November 1969, f am not in a position to comment on any questions arising in respect of that prior period. </para>

This is in line with the practice adopted in the Auditor-General's annual report. </para>

            <para>Statements made in articles and correspondence in the Press and a statement made by the  President  of the Student Representative Council suggest that the Government had rejected completely out of hand a request for an increase in student representation. The Minister informs me that this is not a correct statement of the position. A large number of suggested amendments lo the sui lute of the University were pui forward to the Government by the Council of the University. 1 restrict the following remarks to the suggested amendments dealing wilh student representation. The Government decided to bring before the Parliament amendments which would liberalise the conditions on which undergraduate students could go on to the Council, and to increase the representation. In particular it was decided to reduce the age of a person eligible to sit on the Council from 21 years, as it is at present, to 18 years and also eliminate another existing requirement, namely, that a representative of the undergraduates should himself be a graduate. This will permit undergraduates to sit on the Council. It was decided also lo increase the student representation by appointing the  President  of the Students Representative Council ex-officio to the Council of the University in addition to the existing elected member thai the students have. This means that they would have 2 representatives. </para>
            <para>Il is true that in the recommendations of the Council there was a suggestion for a further elected student member. This would have made  a  total of 3. That recommendation was not accepted  by  the Government.  On the other hand  the Minister has emphasised  dial  the strength  of  representation will  depend upon  the calibre  and  quality  of  the representatives  of  the undergraduates and he has  no  reason  to  suppose that the students will not  be very  strongly and well represented on the Council  by  those they elect. </para>

          <para class="block">In 1967, an agreement was reached by a national conference, consisting of representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers' Federation, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service on a scheme for permanent employment in the stevedoring industry. In November 1967 the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was enacted to give the necessary legislative backing to enable the permanency arrangements to operate. They were introduced by this means rather than by amendment of the main Stevedoring Industry Act because the Government had decided that the new arrangement should be subject to a trial period before permanent alterations were made in the legislative arrangements for the industry. Following the enactment of that legislation, permanent employment has been introduced into 7 major ports in Australia. Approximately 80% of all the regular waterside workers in Australia are in these ports and are now employed permanently, either by operational companies for whom they work exclusively or by a holding company set up by the various employers, which supplies labour on a day to day basis to operational companies in order to overcome the peaks and troughs of labour demands. </para>
          <para>The Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was given a limited life and it is due to cease to operate on 1st July next. The Government had hoped that by the end of the original period of operation of the Act to have introduced legislation which would have provided for the future and permanent arrangements in the industry. However, a number of factors have prevented us from doing so. Firstly, the technological changes which are taking place in the industry with the introduction of container ships, unit load ships and roll-on roll-off ships are far from complete. It could be another 2 years before the future structure of the industry becomes reasonably clear and before the permanent level of the work force in the industry can be determined with any precision. Secondly, although only about 20% of the work force is not permanently employed, these workers are spread through a large number of comparatively small ports and there is a need to determine what son of employment arrangements would be most suitable for them and for the industry. Thirdly, while the permanent arrangements have brought considerable benefits to the work force and while the position as to costs in actual stevedoring operations appears to be reasonably satisfactory - a factor which the Government regarded as crucial - the industrial relations situation in the industry has been far from good. Indeed over the past 12 months it has deteriorated to such an extent that the losses in man hours through industrial stoppages are of the same order as in the pre-permanency days. However, a recent agreement on wages and conditions between the employers and the Federation to which the ACTU was a party includes a no-strike clause on these issues for a period of 2 years. Thus, while we hope for and expect a significant improvement in this area, there is a need to see whether it eventuates before making final decisions in relation to the industry. </para>
          <para>Because of these factors the Government has decided that it would be inappropriate and indeed premature to introduce permanent legislation at the present time. A further period is clearly needed to determine whether any major changes are necessary in the present permanency arrangements as a result of 3 or more years of operation and to work out the sort of arrangements that- ought to apply in the future in those ports in which casual employment still operates. For some it is probable that permanent employment arrangements of the type existing in the present permanent ports will be feasible. In the remainder, it is probable that these will not be suitable but it is obviously desirable that some regular form of employment should be introduced. Over the next 2 years it is the Government's hope that suitable arrangements will be devised for all ports in Australia. Despite the Government's decision not to proceed with permanency legislation it was necessary that legislation of some form be introduced before 1st July because of the expiry date of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act. Before determining what form this further temporary legislation should take my colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> decided it- would be desirable to have discussions with ali those who have been closely concerned with the industry m the National Stevedoring Industry Conference to seek their views as to what should be done in the industry. These discussions proved most helpful and showed that there was a great deal of common ground among all the parties as to what might be done in the industry. Although all the suggestions for amendments to the legislation which were put to the Minister could not be accepted, it is believed that what is proposed in this Bill will meet with general approval from all the parties involved in the industry. </para>
          <para>The present Bill has 4 main purposes. Firstly, it extends the period of operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-1968. This is essential as all the arrangements which enable permanent employment to operate devolve from this Act and cease to have effect when the Act's term of life expires. Thus, to enable the permanency arrangements to continue beyond 1st July next, the period of operation of the Act is extended for a further 2 years, that is, until 1st July 1972. This date also coincides closely with the termination date of the agreement reached at the National Conference in relation to permanency. Thus, it is an appropriate time from which changed and permanent legislative arrangements for the industry should operate. The Minister hopes that well before this date, however, he will be in a position to bring before the Parliament proposals for the future permanent arrangements in the industry. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Bill amends the constitution of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. At present the Authority consists of 3 full time members. However, since the introduction of permanent employment there has been a marked diminution in the functions of the Authority. Primarily, this has occurred in the permanent employment ports which, as has been said, account for 80% of the industry's labour force. The functions of allocation of labour and initial discipline, which were major activities of the Authority, have been transferred to the employers. Thus, there is no longer any justification for retaining a full time 3-man Authority in the light of the reduced work load it has to carry. The Bill provides that the functions of the Authority shall, in the future, be exercised by 1 full time functionary who will be called the Director. He will have all the powers and carry out all the functions of the present tripartite Authority. However, the corporate existence of the Authority is not affected. Furthermore, the existing functions of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority are not affected by this legislation. True, further ports may become permanent ports over the next 2 years, but this is simply in accordance with the intention and authority of the temporary provisions Act introduced in 1967. Thus, it is not anticipated that the enactment of this legislation will have any direct effect on the employment position of ASIA staff. However, it would be wrong to imply that the policy which the Government has been following in this industry - namely, of transferring greater responsibility for the management of this industry to the employers - will not ultimately affect the Authority's functions. Over the next 2 years, the Government will be giving detailed consideration to what the permanent role of a statutory authority in this industry should be. It is to be expected that there will be a continuing contraction in the activities of the Authority. It is impossible to say, at this time, the extent of the functions and the number and types of staff that will be required by a statutory authority in the permanent arrangements to be developed in the future. However, we do not expect that any major changes in functions and consequently major alterations in staff levels will take place before this Act expires in 1972. The welfare and future of the staff of the Authority are matters of the utmost importance, and proper provision for any who might bc displaced in whatever permanent arrangements are ultimately developed for the industry should be determined well in advance of any such displacement. My colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service has discussed this very important matter with the Secretary Of the ACTU, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> and the Federal Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union. Following that discussion my colleague made the following statement: </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Thirdly, the Bill provides that the National Stevedoring Industry Conference should be given statutory backing and redesignated the Stevedoring Industry Council. Since 1965, when industrial relationships and work performance in the industry had reached an all time low, the National Stevedoring Industry Conference under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> E. Woodward, Q.C., has worked with a great deal of success to improve the situation in the industry. It has been responsible for negotiating the agreement on permanent employment, overseeing ils implementation and sorting out the many problems that such a major change in employment relationships must inevitably bring in its train. Of course it would be wrong to suggest that the Conference has been successful in all its activities. There have been disappointments and failures, lt would not be an institution comprising ordinary human beings with conflicting interests if it did not have failures. However, there can be no doubt that this Conference, under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodward's</inline> capable chairmanship, has been one of the most successful exercises in co-operation between employers, unions and government in any industry, let alone this most difficult and volatile stevedoring industry, lt has brought about a significant change in employment relationships in the industry and it is largely because of its existence that the introduction of the revolutionary container shipping system to Australia has been possible without the industrial upheavals that have occurred in most other countries. </para>
          <para>As 1 have said, there is a need now to plan for the permanent arrangements which will operate ultimately in the industry. Although the vast majority of waterside workers are now employed permanently, the fact remains that 20% in a large number of small ports are still casually employed and there is a need for schemes for regular employment to be devised for them. The Government's policy in relation to the stevedoring industry is that there should be a continuing effort to make the employment relationships in the industry as near as possible to those in industry generally. This can be done only if there is cooperation from all parties in the industry. The obvious body to undertake the necessary investigations and to advise the Minister on the future of the industry is the National Stevedoring Industry Conference. Furthermore, whatever the final structure of the industry, it will almost certainly include some standing consultative machinery. Therefore it is appropriate now to establish such machinery on a statutory basis so that its status and role can be sufficiently developed before the permanent structure of the industry is decided upon. It is proposed that this body should be called the Stevedoring Industry Council. The Bill provides that it shall be constituted along the same lines as the present National Stevedoring Industry Conference. Its functions, which are primarily to advise the Minister for Labour and National Service on the operation of existing employment arrangements, on the development of new employment arrangements and on such other matters as the Minister might refer to it, are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. Apart from these advisory functions, however, it will have the function of endeavouring to bring about amicable agreement in relation to industrial questions in the industry. It has, over the past 4 years, been doing just this, and this activity is in keeping with the spirit of the recent national agreement on principles for the establishment of dispute settlement procedures. </para>
          <para>Fourthly, the Bill provides for the correction of a number of anomalies that have occurred as a result of the operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provivisions) Act 1967-68. While these anomalies in themselves are small, they have created injustices and the Bill remedies these. Two types of anomaly are involved. The first relates to the payments for annual leave. "Under the permanent employment arrangements, the holding company and operational employers are responsible for the payment of annual leave to their permanent employees. However, in a number of circumstances such an employee may have had a period of casual employment during the leave year for which there is an element in the statutory levy collected by the Authority. It was accepted in introducing the legislation in 1967 that the Authority should reimburse an operational employer or the holding company for any portion of annual leave paid by the company which was attributable to casual employment. However, the legislation did not completely cover all examples of such casual employment; nor did the amendment of 1968. The current Bill now corrects the deficiencies. </para>
          <para>The other anomaly relates to refunds of portion of the levy to employers who employ waterside workers on a permanent basis under special agreements, for example in container terminals, and who under these special arrangements do not use holding company labour nor claim reimbursement of wages from the holding company for the time when their employees are not able to be employed. It has been found that the definition of 'special agreement for weekly hiring' in the earlier legislation does not cover all agreements for employment of this nature and employers covered by some of these agreements have not been able to obtain refunds of the appropriate portion of the levy even though they meet the essential criteria for refunds. The Bill corrects this situation and both in respect of this anomaly and those mentioned earlier the legislation is made retrospective to the introduction of the initial legislation in 1967. The Bill also provides for employers who enter into new agreements of the kind mentioned above to be eligible for a refund of a portion of the levy provided that the Minister is satisfied that such agreements will not adversely affect the general permanent employment scheme in a port and will improve the efficiency of the particular stevedoring operations. </para>
          <para>This legislation merely represents a further development in the process of change in the stevedoring industry which we embarked on in 1965. It is essential that it be enacted now as the present permanent employment arrangements cannot operate beyond 1st July this year unless the Act is extended. It is hoped that, as a result of the recent agreement on wages and conditions, we can look forward to the industrial relations climate being restored to the situation that was achieved in the first 2 years following the establishment of the National Conference. Only such a climate will enable the permanent arrangements for the industry to be worked out in the atmosphere and with the dispassion necessary to ensure their success. The employers and the Federation must realise that the future structure of the industry depends very much on their performance over the next 2 years. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition supports the move  to  provide  finance  for the establishment of  an  irrigation system in  the  Bundaberg area. Later on,  we  will move  an  amendment, not  a  vital amendment but one which expresses the opinion of the Opposition about the amount  of  in format ion which has been provided relative to the proposed expenditure. I wish  to  speak briefly on (his Bill. I have listened to previous debates in the Senate concerning water conservation. All honourable senators recall the extensive debates  onthe  Chowilla Dam and the Dartmouth Dam. Although I did not speak  on those  matters, I agree entirely that  a need  exists  for  water conservation in the southern States especially with the background reservoir  of  the Snowy Mountains - that huge reservoir  of  snow which in effect conserves water for continual  use  throughout the year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If  we  support water conservation in  the  southern States, how much more must  we  supportthe provision  of  moneys for this purpose in the States  to  the north, in particular Queensland which has  a  very heavy fall  of  water which flows  to the sea  but which also  has a  very high evaporation level  that  results in  the  drying up  of  available sources  of  supply  of  water, thus intensifying  the need  for water for irrigation purposes  and  farm development.  For  this reasonthe debate  on  this Bill in another place  was  rather  odd.  Certain Liberal members questioned  the  advisability of providing finance for water conservation.  One  member suggested  that  it would be better to spend money  on  the construction of  the  Sydney Opera House than  onthe  construction  of a  water irrigation scheme  at  Bundaberg.  He  stated  that  a greater number  of  people would obtain pleasure from  the  Opera House than from  a  water irrigation scheme in the Bundaberg area. I find this an astonishing comparison when one considers that in the north water is used for purposes other thanto derive pleasure. It is  a  vital element in the development  of  primary industries over  a  large area. I do not intend to say anything further in this debate because I believe that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> intendsto develop the points I have made and also to move  an  amendment. </para>

          <para class="block">There is  a  particular reason  why the  Opposition  has  moved the amendment. On  a  number of occasions,  not  only in this chamber but in the other place, reference has been made to the fact that there seems to be an aura of secrecy surrounding legislation that is introduced.I refer to the statement in the second reading speech of The Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> Cotton) wherein he said: </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Let us examine that statement for  a  moment. The proposal concerning the Monduran Dam and the Bundaberg irrigation scheme generally was one of the things that came off the top  of  the head of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> when an election was imminent. As 1 said in this chamber only  a  few days ago when speaking to another Bill, Queensland is not averse to accepting grants or loans from the Commonwealth, even if they are thrown up as election gimmicks  or  promises. But we believe that the details  of  the technical evaluation and the cost benefit analysis ought to  be  made available to the Senate. That is the reason why we have moved our amendment. We require this information but we  do  not oppose the Bill. In his second reading speech the Minister slated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In 1967. the Queensland Government submitted to the Commonwealth, for consideration under the original programme, a proposal for an irrigation scheme to serve the Kolan-Burnett area on the north side of the Burnett River ... in September 1969 the Queensland Government announced the allocation of SS.3m for works which were considered particularly urgent . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Senate will recall that when it was first announced that SI 00m would be made available for water conservation purposes, there was great tardiness on the part of the Queensland Government as to which schemes it would submit for consideration. In fact, the first scheme accepted by the Commonwealth Government was probably the Fairbairn Dam in central Queensland. The Childers area, and the Bundaberg area generally, is a particularly dry region. From my own observations there, people would be very lucky if they experienced 1 good season in every four or five years. For the rest of the time, this area has been drought stricken. Sugar cane grows to a height of 6 feet or 7 feet in north Queensland and it has a fairly high commercial content of sugar, but it docs not do as well in the Bundaberg area because of the generally semi-arid nature of the soil and the unseasonal conditions that have occurred in the area over a period of years. So any conservation scheme in the Bundaberg district must be of benefit. </para>
          <para>It is not only the Bundaberg irrigation scheme to which reference has been made for many years. When I first entered this chamber 5 years ago a committee in the Bundaberg area issued a fairly good statement outlining why water conservation ought to be carried out in this locality. The request for the construction of such a water conservation scheme in the Bundaberg area was ignored by the Government of the day and it continued to be ignored until just prior to the last general election. Other proposals which have been submitted for Queensland include the famous Burdekin Dam scheme. Reference has been made to this scheme for so many years that people in the area look upon it as a legend - as being something which is not likely to happen. I make the appeal that when a Commonwealth loan is likely to be made available, information gathered concerning survey, stream measurement and all the preliminary works that are required before a major conservation scheme can be carried out, ought to be placed before the Commonwealth Government well in advance of the requirements for the scheme in a particular area. If it is done on a planned and orderly basis we will reach the stage in Queensland, which is a particularly dry State, where a series of programmes can be evaluated long before loans or grants are made available to carry out the actual construction work. </para>
          <para>The only other thing 1 want to say is again to remind the Senate that in a State which has a long history of drought, not only in the central and western areas but also in the coastal areas, the construction of water conservation schemes ought to be considered more often. An amount of $1 00m is to be provided for national water resources development schemes over a period of 5 years, which is $20m a year. That would scarcely build a decent sized Olympic swimming pool and cannot be looked upon as a suitable yearly allocation to build a major dam. </para>

            <para>- 1 rise to commend the Government for having acceded to the request of the State of Queensland for a grant of up to $ 12.8m. under the national water resources development programme, for the construction of a dam in the Bundaberg region of Queensland. This is a very rich part of Queensland, but of course, it is dependent on decent: rainfalls and a good underground water level. Unfortunately, in recent years people in the Bundaberg region have experienced a succession of droughts. Indeed, I think they have had 2 good seasons in about 7 or 8 years. The underground water level is lower now than it has been at any other time in the history of the region. So if there is an urgent need for water conservation and the construction of a dam anywhere, it is in this part of Queensland. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is true, as has been stated, that over a period of years, there has been great advocacy for a water conservation scheme in the Bundaberg area. Much literature has been disseminated, which has placed the facts of the case for such a scheme before the Queensland Parliament and indeed before members of the national Parliament. People in the Bundaberg region, who are engaged principally in growing sugar cane, have suffered considerably because of the number of droughts in the area. Of course, droughts are not confinedto them. At the present time people in thc western parts of Queensland, in the Longreach. Murraburra and Winton districts, are still in the throes of a drought. It is not only in this year that there has been a drought: these people have endured a succession of droughts over the last few years. I am sure that anybody who knows anything about the country and agricultural areas of Queensland or any other State would fully appreciatethe damaging effect a drough: has on industry in those areas. But when droughts are experienced in successive yearsthe damage is almost irreparable. It takes many years for an area to recover from the effects of successive droughts. </para>
          <para>Contrary to what some people might say about water conservation in Australia, particularly in the dry States of Queensland and South Australia, 1 believe that we cannot spend too much money on it in those areas where there is a water shortage provided it is an economic investment which will be of benefit to the maximum number of people. The reticulation of water and power are indispensable for any Slate or. for that mater any country which wantstodevelop. I think I may have said before that during the period that I was Premier of Queensland a delegation of 3 gentlemen from the World Bank paid a courtesy call on me in the course of which the leader of the delegation said to me: 'I know it is your Cabinet day today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Premier,</inline> and I do not want to take up your time, but I am anxiousto know on what you spend your loan money'. I said: "Outside of what I am required to do in relation to the provision of schools, hospitals and other community essentials, I spend the money on these items in this order - water, power and transport, including road transport. You cannot settle people successfully unless they have a guaranteed water supply. Power is indispensable for the successful and efficient conduct of industry, whether it be primary or secondary. Having produced its product the industry must have road and other transport facilities to get its product to market.'  His  reply to me was: I commend you for your programme. Any government which spends its loan money on projects in that order is spending it on sound lines.'* </para>
          <para>I suppose other areas of Queensland are in need of water conservation projects, too', but projects in the far western parts of Queensland are a different proposition altogether. In this case the Burnett River can be utilised to some extent, but it is a different proposition altogether in the sheep and cattle districts of the western part of the State. However, I am satisfied that this scheme will prove to be a successful one. It will be of great benefit to a large number of the people who live in North and South Burnett areas. I have read with interest their case andit has my sympathy.I trust that the work will be expedited as much as possible and that there will not be any unwarranted delay in the completion of this project so that benefit will be derived from the scheme as early as possible. </para>
          <para>I have no opposition to the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I should have thought that some information along the lines he has suggested in connection with Ibis project would have been included in the second reading speech of the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> who represents the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> inthis chamber. I believe that this information would be available to the Department of National Development. I think it could be taken for granted that this gram would not have been made to the State of Queensland unless a proper technical evaluation and a cost benefit analysis had been made. I do not think that there would be any objection to the Department making available to the Senate the information sought in the amendment. I commend the Government for making a grant of$1 2.8m to the Queensland Government for this water conservation scheme in the South Burnett district of Queensland. </para>

            <para>- Itrust that history will not record that the introduction of this measure was simply another case oftoo little too late'. The combating of droughts which occur in Queensland is something that must be tackled seriously. Indeed, the same could be said about the droughts which occur in other parts of Australia. I do not think it is to the credit of a lot of peoplethat there has been so much procrastination in relation to this scheme. When one bears in mind the loss in sugar production which has been sustained by Bundaberg and its surrounding areas in the last 3 years as a result of drought one can quite readily appreciate that the amount of money involved in this grant could have been spent 3 times over and Australia would still have been in a better position financially than it is at present. Bundaberg and its surrounding areas rely substantially on the sugar which is produced there. The last 3 crushings in this area have been negligible. As a result, all industry and commerce in the area - indeed, in Queensland - have suffered. Had this proposed scheme been embarked upon some years earlier this area would not have suffered the loss which it has suffered. Indeed, the people who live in Bundaberg and its surrounding areas would not have been placed in the disastrous position in which they are placed at present. </para>

          <para>In his second reading speech the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> who represents the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> in this chamber, pointed out that the Queensland Government submitted its original water conservation programme to the Commonwealth for consideration in 1967. However, it was not until 1970 before any final conclusion was reached on the outcome of its proposals. Apparently the Commonwealth Government is not entirely satisfied that it has been provided with the necessary information. Either that is the Commonwealth's attitude or it has procrastinated on the issue because, as I said earlier, this venture was put forward by the Queensland Government in 1967. If the Queensland Government did not provide the Commonwealth Government with the necessary material on which the Commonwealth Government could make a decision then the Queensland Government was at fault. However, if it did make the necessary material available to the Commonwealth, I believe that the Commonwealth must stand condemned for the fact that it has been tardy in introducing a scheme of this nature. </para>

            <para>- It is not my intention to intrude unduly upon the time of the Senate, but 1 feel that it would be less than generous if a number of Queensland senators did not contribute to this debate, firstly to express appreciation of involvement by the Commonwealth in this particular major work for the benefit of the Bundaberg district, Queensland and Australia through the sugar industry; and, secondly, briefly to refer to the tremendous importance and great significance of that industry to Queensland and to the Australian economy. The sugar industry in the eyes of many people in Australia is a pot of gold industry. I think it is always wise that we should try to disillusion those people in respect of the mechanics of the industry. The support price is felt by some people in parts of Australia other than the sugar producing areas to be a great concession by the Australian consumer-taxpayer. It is believed to be support of an industry that is wealthy in its own right and does not warrant such support. </para>

              <para>- He supports the Bill, as all men of intelligence will. The sugar industry gains its economic stability from its sheer efficiency and the magnificent machinery organisation which backs its operation. The International Sugar Agreement has been renegotiated after some years of desuetude. The Commonwealth preference agreement for sugar on the British market is continuing. Explicit contracts have been signed for the sale of sugar to Japan. An amount of sugar is consumed at the Australian home consumption price. All these factors, taken in conjunction with the efficiency of the industry, the mechanics of its operation and the international and national agreements enable the sugar industry to function on a competent level of efficiency and to produce a return to farmers, in general terms. But in no sense is it an extremely wealthy industry. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Sugar farmers in most cases do not have great holdings. They gain a reasonably assured income through hard work and the application of personal industry and technical efficiency. Both of those factors are constantly applied in the industry. As a result, although Australia is a white producing country - that is, it produces at a high level of wages, at the Western standard - we are able to produce sugar for sale on the world market in competition with countries which produce with much lower labour standards. The technical efficiency of the Australian sugar industry is one of the envies of the sugar producing world. </para>
          <para>When a situation arises in which one of the great traditional sugar growing areas such as the Bundaberg district is in considerable difficulty due lo depletion of water resources in an industry that is becoming increasingly competitive but which yet retains its importance and significance as a means of keeping populated great areas of a great State like Queensland, it is timely, prudent and only just that financial assistance should be forthcoming. The proposal for this irrigation and reticulation scheme is firstly to replace the salinating aquifers in the Bundaberg area. This action is most timely and will be productive of results. Its second aim concerns the distribution of surplus waters by irrigation to areas which will not draw ultimately on the aquifers. These 2 concepts are embraced within what we call the Kolan-Burnett-Bundaberg scheme. </para>
          <para>I pause for a moment to comment on one fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse,</inline> who is now in the chamber, shared with me in the deliberations of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution. He is particularly conscious of the great and increasing problem of salination of our water resources. That has been particularly evident in the </para>
          <para class="block">Murray River. We have had tremendous debates in this Parliament on the building of a dam at Chowilla, or alternatively at Dartmouth. As members of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution we looked at this question. </para>
          <para>Similar problems arise in other parts of Australia. This Bill and the information which accompanies it highlight the fact that a similar problem can develop in aquifers in many parts of Australia. The problem is developing in the Bundaberg area where, due to a very bad season, there has been a depletion of the run-ins and the replenishment of aquifers. As a result, and also because of the heavy run-off of water, there is an increasing level of salination. The increasing demand on the aquifers in this area has been due in large measure to the great expansion of the sugar industry which accompanied the presentation and implementation of the Gibbs Report some years ago. Expansion took place to meet the existing and expected world demand. to which the Australian industry has responded. At that stage it involved an increase in the area to be under cane, an increase in the area of assignments, and with a succession of bad seasons and a constantly increasing draw on the aquifer, with a failure to replenish it, there were salination consequences. </para>
          <para>This Bill is not designed merely to assist those people operating in a particular industry. In a sense it is a Bill to contribute to the preservation of very precious resources in Australia which are our natural water aquifers. Whatever its immediate purpose may be, it has dual consequences each of which is extremely valuable to Australia. I think we should remove a misconception that because money is to be spent on this irrigation project a great number of farmers will be induced to expand their acreage and to draw in increasing degrees upon available water supplies, whether subterranean or surface. That is not so. As honourable senators know, the production of sugar is strictly controlled either on a mill peak basis at the mill level, or on a farm peak basis whereby each farm has is farm peak and is required to produce within it, or to produce beyond it at its own economic risk. The area of land on which sugar may be grown is strictly defined, and it is assigned to a mill. This Bill has no intention to increase or to encourage an increase in the actual area of assignments, it would be wrong of the governments of the Commonwealth and of Queensland to come to the financial party by providing this money if it would only serve to aggravate the situation by inducing an increased draw upon those resources because of increased acreage. That is nol and will not be the position. </para>
          <para>The consequences will be that farmers in those areas who are producing substantially by dry farming, and who over the last few years because of recurring intermittent and sometimes continued drought have produced at an economic loss, will be able lo produce their farm peak from an economic area, a smaller area, and therefore to produce at a level which will make it viable within the economic laws of supply and demand. We welcome this Bill. We welcome it for its contribution to the Bundaberg area, to which it will bring new vitality, security and stability for the people in that area, lt is tremendously important in these times of the flight to the cities from thu' land, lt is increasingly important in this vast continent that we retain as far as we can the distribution of our rural population. </para>
          <para>One of the submissions to the Gibbs Committee which greatly affected its recommendations and on which it laid great emphasis concerned the extent to which new growers should be admitted into the industry so that at least there would be a holding level of population in the rural areas governed by the sugar industry. All of these things are important, and I feel that the participation by the Commonwealth in this scheme, which not only gives a new vitality and new encouragement to the people of the area but also indicates the Commonwealth's involvement in the conservation of a great national resource, will strengthen this part of the rural economy and in doing so will strengthen the whole rural economy of Australia. The ultimate scheme will involve the expenditure of much more money than is voted in this Bill because it will involve finally vast reticulation systems, the building of the Monduran Dam - this will be of vast proportions, probably as great as Sydney Harbour in water storage capacity - and generally the reticulation of water and the total replenishment of subterranean sources. </para>
          <para>For those reasons as a Queenslander, and more particularly perhaps as an Australian.  1  welcome the advent of this action by the Commonwealth. I am sure that  1  speak for the people of the Bundaberg district, not only those immediately involved in the growing of sugar but also those involved in the secondary and tertiary industries which flow from the growing of sugar in the area, when I express appreciation to the Government for its involvement in this matter. I am sure that the Australian people as a whole can be grateful for this recognition of the importance of the industry and of the conservation of our natural resources. I support the Bill and also the amendment which has been supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Parly. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator COTTON</inline>(New South Wales Minister for Civil Aviation) 15.27J  -  in reply - An explanatory memorandum was circulated wilh this Bill and one might make some very brief comments from the introduction to that memorandum. This memorandum gives a brief description of the Bundaberg area and of the works to be constructed by the State wilh financial assistance front the Commonwealth in order to provide an assured water supply for irrigation and other purposes. The works for which funds have been allocated by the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments comprise a major storage - the Monduran Dam of 475,000 acre feet storage capacity - 2 tidal barrages and pumping stations and distribution systems lo convey water from the Kolan and Burnett Rivers lo canals centred on Bundaberg in southern Queensland. The regulated river How provided by the main storage and ancillary works has been estimated at about 175,000 acre feet per annum. Water from Monduran Dam on the Kolan River will regulate the flows of both the Kolan and Burnett Rivers, the latter by means of a pumping station and connecting channel. Distribution of water to landholders will by by channel supply or by private pumping from the rivers or channels. </para>
          <para>I think that indicates to all of us the general proposal. If one can say anything about it I think it probably is that the proposal, when consummated, will add to the stability and prosperity of the region. Obviously there is a problem of water drawdown which brings with it the problem of salinity. Equally there is the problem of the fluctuating supply of water which causes, in turn, the problem of fluctuating cane yields. Both situations need to be overcome. This is the first part of a huge national water resources development programme. This is the second such programme. The first programme which involved the expenditure of $50m has been completed, and the second programme which involves the expenditure of$1 00m is due to be taken up over5 years. The work with which we are now dealing is the first work in the second huge programme. Queenslanders will know very well that their State is extremely well placed with rivers and with water flowing into the sea, and that there is a great need for that water to be harnessed. That is what is proposed in this instance. It should be understood that this was requested by the Queensland Government and is an example, one might say again, of the Commonwealth and the States working together in a joint enterprise for the benefit of the Australian people, particularly the people of the region and of Queensland. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline>referred to clause 7 of the Bill. I am assured that this is a standard in Bills of this kind and is related to the proper control of the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. The Queensland Government has accepted this in the past. It causes no administrative problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> dealt with the difficulties of the industry, with which I agree. He referred to the problem of the fluctuating price level of sugar on the world market. He was correct when he said that this is a highly efficient industry and that it has a remarkable performance in the farming end in the breeding of new canes and new strains for high yield, in the manufacturing end and in the refining end. Its yield pattern is extremely high by world standards. I am given to understand that its refining and milling practices are equally high by world standards. However, it is also true that it depends a great deal upon the world market situation, upon the maintenance of the Commonwealth sugar agreement, upon some kind of preferred right of entry to the market in the Commonwealth of Nations and equally, we must <inline font-style="italic">reassure</inline> ourselves once again, it depends a great deal upon the Australian domestic market. </para>
          <para>When we turn to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> proposed amendment we should direct ourselves briefly to the point that is made in the second reading speech to the effect that in the division of constitutional responsibility the assessment, development and control of water resources in the States is primarily a matter for State governments. Equally I am assured that we have to take the viewpoint not only of the Commonwealth Parliament, but also of the State Parliament which asked for this measure and of the region itself which did a lot of work in the preliminary investigations. A single national evaluation could be misleading because of the great regional value of the project. The livelihood of 35,000 people is involved and all factors were taken into account when the decision was made by the Government. The Commonwealth's studies were designed for the purpose of advising Ministers and the quotation of the results of those studies out of context, when one thinks of the broad pattern of all those involved, could be, in the Government's view, misleading. Therefore it is with regret that the Government feels that it cannot accept the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> The Government docs not believe that it is necessary or that it adds anything to the situation. </para>

The scheme was envisaged early in 1968 when the Ministerfor Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> made some suggestions for re-organisation of the dairying industry. Those suggestions were hailed by the dairying industry as a way out of a very serious predicament which had been getting worse for some years. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill but I wish to make some comments about the industry as a whole. The Agreement between Western Australia and the Commonwealth, to which the Bill gives effect, has a number of desirable features but in my opinion and in the opinion of many dairy farmers it does not go far enough. When the scheme wasfirst mentioned by the Minister for Primary Industry the Stale Ministers for Agriculture rather rushed in and drew certain conclusions about the effects of the scheme. Unfortunately I think they arrived at some incorrect conclusions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I vividly remember attending a crowded meeting in Busselton in the first half of 1968 soon after the Minister for Primary Industry made an announcement about the scheme. I have referred to that meeting on other occasions in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nalder,</inline> Western Australian Minister for Agriculture, assuredthe meeting, which consisted of 200 or 300 dairy farmers, that the sum of . $25m which would be made available to reorganise the dairying industry would, in the main, be devoted to development. AlthoughI was only a visitor at the meetingI obtained leave to speak to the dairy farmers.I pointed out that as far as I knew there was no intention to devote the money to be provided under the scheme to expansion of the industry. As far as I could see at that time - subsequent events have proved me right - the money was to be devoted to enabling marginal dairy farmers to leave the industry if they so desired. The land which would then be acquired by the Authority would be available to viable farmers who would be able to take up this land and develop their own properties into bigger and more effective propositions. This was not accepted with any enthusiasm by the meeting. Nevertheless, what I said was correct and it is borne out by the Bill which we have before us. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators appreciate, the intention of the Bill is that a sum of $25m should be made available over a period of 4 years. It would be made available to the States that are willing to en er into the agreement with the Commonwealth on the basisthat is set forward. Ever since the idea was promulgated by the Minister he endeavoured to getthe co-operation of the State Ministers for Agriculture in the scheme. However, he was unsuccessful until fairly recently when the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture intimated that he would be prepared to sign an agreement on this basis.I am still alittle concerned as to whether the Western Australian Minister realises what it is he is signing, because only recently he made a statement that he was opposed to mergers and that he was out to protect the interests of the smaller and marginal dairy farmer on his property.I checked back on this because it appears quite publicly in the Press. I found out that it was not made at any meeting and it was not made in Parliament in Western Australia. The Minister admitted that this was his opinion at the time and the statement was made in responseto a telephone call from the newspaper concerned. Even so I think that he is of the opinion that an agreement between Western Australia and the Commonwealth can be used for development, although there are within it the necessary clauses which only enable the marginal dairy farmer voluntarily to leave his property and have it bought by the Authority if he comes within the definition of the marginal dairy farmer. </para>
          <para>The purposes of the Bill are twofold. They are set out in a very straightforward manner in the Minister's second reading speech which was incorporated in Hansard. First of all, it is to enable low income dairy farmers who voluntarily wish to do so to leave the industry and to receive a fair price for their land and improvements: and, secondly, after the writing off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available to other farmers so that they can build up their properties to a viable family farm level and, where possible, diversify the pattern of land use. Those are 2 very desirable objectives and they are covered quite adequately by this Bill. For the definition of a marginal dairy farm, I would direct the attention of honourable senators to the summary which is in the Minister's second reading speech. He lists the 4 criteria which determine a marginal dairy farm. </para>

              <para>- This is on page 1988. 1 am glad the honourable senator is aware of the argument that I am bringing forward and is following it diligently. As I said, the criteria which determine a marginal dairy farm are - I will not quote them in full but just give the salient features - firstly, it must of course be a rural property; secondly, it must have some minimum number of cows, and the number suggested as a minimum is 20 lactating cows; thirdly, at least half of the gross income of the farm must be derived from the production of milk or cream sold at the manufacturing price; and, fourthly, the farm is not reasonably capable of producing to a level agreed between the Commonwealth and the State, In the case of Western Australia this has been determined as an average of 12,000 lb of butterfat per annum. Those are the main objectives of the Bill and the definition of a marginal form. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I will now turn to the agreement, which is to be read in conjunction with the Bill. This is again spelt out for the benefit of the marginal dairy farmer. On the first page of the agreement in (b) we have set out that under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme dairy farmers may voluntarily dispose of their land and implements to the State at market value and the State may dispose of the land and useful improvements with the object of building up other rural properties to economic levels. Those are the features that I want to take up because I think they are very important.  J  entirely agree with them and I subscribe to them. When the farmer has disposed of his property to the Authority in line with the provisions of the Bill this land with its improvements would be available to any other farmer to purchase. He would be able to purchase it without the value of the improvements that are on it so that we do not have 2 adjacent dairy farms with the capital expenditure for 2 milking plants, milking sheds and such matters being duplicated. Of course, the Bill provides that these improvements could be sold if it were possible for the Authority to get a buyer who would take it al a reasonable figure; otherwise I gather they would remain on the property. </para>
          <para>There is a limitation on the size of the dairy farm which would be in existence after another property had been purchased. The farm we would then have, with the property taken over by the Authority from the marginal dairy farmer, must not exceed twice the minimum size which has been determined for a viable dairy farm in the particular State. I think that I should say that this is not an entirely new scheme, in Western Australia, and I think also in New South Wales, there have been schemes for reconstruction of the dairy industry and endeavours have been made to get dairy farmers out of the difficult situation in which they are finding themselves. These schemes have been successful up to a point. Of course, they have been limited by the amount of finance available. In Western Australia, where we have had a scheme in operation to assist the smaller dairy farms, the State has spent Sim. But of course this is not to be compared with the amount that could be available from the Commonwealth. In this case if no other States come in and subscribe to the Bill it is quite possible - this will probably frighten some of the other States - that the whole $25m could become available to Western Australia over the period of 4 years. It is interesting to note that Tasmania already is seriously entering into negotiations with the Commonwealth to see whether it can be included in the scheme. Although it has some reservations as to the term 'marginal dairy farm', I think in due course these will be ironed out.I believe that New South Wales also is looking at the situation. </para>
          <para>Another point in the Bill which needs to be mentioned in the question whether the amount advanced by the Commonwealth is to be an absolute gift or a loan. The amount to be made available to a State is to be equal to the amount that the State is prepared to contribute. The agreement provides that the State has to agree to pay back 50% of the amount advanced by the Commonwealth, repayment to be made over 46 half-yearly periods, and interest at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">6%</inline> is to be payable on the amount advanced by the Commonwealth. Some of the States will object to having to pay back to the Commonwealth such a large proportion of the amount. Some probably believe that the amount to be advanced is a gift, but of course this is not so. </para>

              <para>- When we rose for dinnerI had stated that in my opinion the Bill and the Agreement were based on the fact that the State would provide a certain amount of money for the takeover of farms and that this amount would be met by a similar contribution from the Commonwealth. The Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> objected to my interpretation and I said right at the death knock that during the dinner break I would determine what I felt the position really was. I have done so. I believe my interpretation is still correct although I do agree that it is probably not what the Minister intended in presenting the Bill. In the second reading speech there is no reference at all to this matter that I have raised, but the Agreement states at page  14:  . . the Commonwealth shall . . . provide financial assistance . . . consisting of - </para>

          <para class="block">That seems to be perfectly straightforward; it is an amount equal to the amounts expended by the authority, which is a State authority. Clause  6 (1.)  of the Bill states: </para>

          <para class="block">So 1 think the interpretation which I am putting on it, although it is perfectly logical and legal, is not what was intended when the Bill was introduced. The Bill should have been more carefully drafted, and perhaps the Minister may be prepared to agree that this should be straightened out. I will not state the terms which I think should be used but it does seem to me that it could be phrased in such a way that it is beyond doubt, because in the final analysis someone will interpret legally what the Bill says and not what is said in the second reading speech or the inferences of the second reading speech. That has explained the Bill. </para>
          <para>I now want to deal quickly in the time left to me with some objections I see to the Bill, because it does not go far enough in its coverage. The first objection that really disturbs me is that when a farmer has acquired the land which has been taken over by the authority and then wants to go ahead and develop it or raise some finance even to pay it off, there is no provision for making such amounts available to him. He will not be provided with the finance to develop this property which has been granted to him because he has the opportunity of making a viable unit of the whole farm. This is one very important thing. Another point that is very important is that we are going to add the now homeless farmer who has sold his property to the list of home seekers somewhere else, probably in the metropolitan area or, hopefully, in a country area where he might retire or find another occupation. He will have to place himself <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the long waiting list of people looking for houses and no effort is made and no encouragement is given in the Bill to the State governments to expand their building programme. </para>
          <para>The third objection is that the Bill does not provide for what could be necessary retraining of the farmer when he has left his dairying property to make him a useful member of the community. This seems to be extremely important; otherwise we will have people with very little knowledge of technology or of a trade moving into the community and not taking up positions where they will be of value to the community. Finally, I do not think that this legislation solves the main problem of the industry, that is, over-production at a time when we have under-consumption. I feel the world could absorb more milk products but we have not solved the problem of distribution. This Bill makes no effort to solve that problem. Although it will take the marginal farmer out of existence, it will not really cut his land out of dairy production if the person taking over the land wishes to continue dairying and has another property he wishes to amalgamate with it. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline>has been watching the position very closely in Victoria, which is creating quite a serious situation through the attitude of the Premier to the development of dairy farms. 1 have some information that was passed on to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> who had to leave the Senate unexpectedly, lt relates to the situation in Victoria and was obtained from the research section of the Library. We find that <inline font-style="italic">Victoria is</inline> endeavouring to develop 2 schemes, the Heytesbury scheme and the Rochester scheme which 1 assume honourable senators have heard quite a deal about. Both these schemes are being developed under the Land Settlement Act 1959 by the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission. These have only developed to a certain degree and there is a tremendous amount of development still to take place. For instance, the Heytesbury scheme will have a total of 117,000 acres and at the present time only 67,000 acres have been developed. So there is still a large amount of dairying land or land which people are being encouraged to turn into dairying land in that area. The land at Rochester was purchased by the Rural Finance and Set.lement: Commission and will eventually incorporate 55 dairy holdings; at the present time there are only 9. They are endeavouring to push this up to the full development stage, which will mean further production for an over-produced market. </para>
          <para>In . my view the situation is extremely serious because of the probable entry of Great Britain into the European Economic Community and also in view of the fact that the European Economic Community is moving into the area which has been considered to be our market. For instance, in Ceylon and Indonesia, where we have had quite considerable sales of butter, we are being beaten because the European Economic Community is now selling butter at §23 per cwt. which is a price that we cannot approach. They are moving imo our traditional field. The amount of butter that is expected will be produced in Australia in the next 12 months will be of the order of 230,000 tons. A considerable surplus will be stored in Australia. The world surplus of butter at the present time is about 600,000 tons, which is more than a year's supply for the world. The European Economic Community has in store over 300,000 tons of those 600.000 tons. It is using every endeavour to dispose of that butter on the world markets by undercutting prices. That is the problem we are up against. </para>

              <para>- It would assist but I do not think it would result in a considerable improvement. It would assist the situation as far as we are concerned but it would not solve the problem. Our problem at the moment, as 1 see it, is that we have to look realistically at the world's butter fat situation. This is what the Government is trying to do in introducing the Bill, hut the Bill is not going to achieve much. That is the difficulty as I see it. The Bill will help by removing from the situation the marginal dairy farmer who is in difficulties, lt will give him a different opportunity in life. To that extent the measure is a good one. lt will help to make a more viable industry in these areas which now consist of small units. 1 could say a lot more on this measure but I do not want to take up more than my share of the time.

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I welcome the Bill before the Senate. 1 hope that honourable senators recognise the tremendous importance of this piece of legislation. The Bill, together with what has been done with regard to quotas on wheat deliveries, marks a new era in the development of farming in Australia. No longer can we look lo an unlimited expansion of primary products to carry the import requirements of this country. That situation has gone on, perhaps for too long. We have been dependent on the products of our farms to a tremendous extent. We have developed the idea that we must continue to export primary products and that the world must take our products. I am afraid that that sort of thinking has come to a sudden halt with a very uncomfortable jolt in the last year or so according to the hard facts of statistics, lt is extremely fortunate that, contemporaneously with this situation regarding our primary products, we in Australia have been fortunate enough to have had our mining wealth developed with a market for our mining products. 1 hope that in time to come we will not develop the same sort of outlook and dependence on mining that we have had with regard to agriculture, lt is a fortunate conjunction of events that the development of our iron ore and nickel has taken place while there is a ready market for those products. There is no certainty that that will continue indefinitely. We need to be warned that Australia's development needs to be a balanced development - balanced in accordance with sound economic principles with regard to the situation in the rest of the world. The Bill attempts to do this in a small way. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have not carried out nearly the amount of research into the solution of our agricultural problems as has been done in Canada, for instance, lt is interesting to note that the latest research publication from Canada a book entitled 'Canadian Agriculture in the 1970s' which I would recommend to anybody who is interested in the subject and which is a very high level research publication, gives 6 main recommendations. The first recommendation is that the surpluses must be controlled and reduced to manageable proportions by reducing production drastically if necessary. Where alternatives exist production resources must be shifted to more promising market opportunities. Where such alternatives cannot be found land and other resources must be retired. In the main the Bill docs follow the lines of that recommendation. 1 would regard the Bill more as a measure of social welfare than of economic amelioration of the present situation. </para>

I am pleased that my own State of Western Australia has been the first to come into line iti agreement with the proposals. The fact that industry in Western Australia has welcomed the suggestion is some assurance that it has been studied and it is felt that there is merit in the proposal. I understand the reluctance in other States to agree to the proposal but I am sure that the benefits will eventually be found to be attractive to the other States when they get around to examining what the Bill really sets out to do. </para>

          <para>The obvious reason for the legislation stems from the tremendous world surplus of butter, a surplus which has been generated through policies of economic nationalism in Europe. On the one hand those policies have provided very high prices for butter and consequently have reduced the consumption per head in those countries. At the same lime the supply has been increased so much that the European Economic Community is embarrassed by the amount of butter produced and is proposing now to slaughter dairy cows in order to bring the problem into manageable limits. The upsurge in production of butter, butter fats and dairy products indicates the tremendous resources of agriculture that are available in the world today. Those who fear world starvation can be reassured by the fact that technological resources and developments in the world today as applied to modern agriculture are capable of meeting the world's food needs. The hard mathematics of the costs in Australia and the declining prices were set out in the Minister's speech. In the last 5 years the equalised return to producers declined from 47.1c per lb of butter fat to an estimated 41.3c per lb in the current year. Over that same period, according to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics index of prices paid, costs have risen by 161%. So that here is a classical example of what is happening in the dairying industry with the so called cost-price squeeze. I am glad that the Minister said: </para>

            <para>In attempting lo counteract this situation, farmers have made strenuous efforts to improve productivity. No matter how measured,  the  results are striking.

          <para class="block">Here 1 should like lo say something about the current concept of the economics of agricultural production in relation lo prices. lt is generally assumed that the way to reduce production in agriculture is to reduce the price of the commodity, but in his speech the Minister said that this is not so. The immediate response of the farmer in this situation is to increase production so that he lowers his unit costs. Inevitably in this situation the Australian fanner has increased production. This was demonstrated without doubt during the depression years when in response to a falling price for wheat the Australian wheat grower in 1931 planted, mostly with horse power, some 18 million acres of wheat - a figure that was equalled only in 1965, and then wilh tractor power. Victoria has never planted as much wheat since as she planted in 1931, nor has South Australia reached its total of that year, lt is nonsense to say that the only way to reduce production in this situation is  10  lower the offering prices. </para>
          <para>When I was a student years ago there was a saying current that the best way to train a good, sound classical economist was to get a parrot and teach it to say: 'Supply and demand, supply and demand", j am afraid that some of our economists have not got past that stage: certainly this seems so when we read some of the things they write about agriculture and agricultural production. </para>

              <para>- All right, I will let that pass. One of the doubts I have about the legislation concerns what is to be done with the land that is retired. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline> made this point and this reservation too. If we are going to join the retired land with other dairy farms - and that is envisaged in the Bill - and the combined area of the new farm is more productive and more competitive this will tend to increase the supply of butter rather than to reduce it. We have other alternatives, and I refer again to the alternative set out in the Canadian report - that of diverting to other forms of agriculture. There are not many alternatives for land that is suitable for dairying. Forestry has been mentioned, but I think it is highly dangerous to suggest that isolated areas of land should be devoted to forestry because fires would probably harvest most of it before the isolated forests matured. If we are going to make any considerable move towards beef production, which seems the obvious alternative to land that is suitable for dairying, we can produce the beef, but there are also other tendencies moving people into beef production and it will not be long before beef production in Australia is in the same position as other forms of production. We need to be careful before we direct any strong movement into beef cattle. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I have grave doubts about this measure as one of economic importance, lt will be a help to those farmers who wish to retire from farming and whose units of production are too small, but I do not think it will touch the very small producers because most of them are part-time dairymen. From recently published statistics I have made a calculation of the number of farms with fewer than 20 cows. After excluding those properties that have 1 to 4 cows, which obviously are not economic producers, I found that those properties with 5 to 20 cows represent only 4.7% of the total number of holdings engaging in dairying. As a measure to control surplus production I am afraid that this Bill will have a minimal effect. I am interested also in the basis on which properties will be valued. I wonder how we are going to arrive at the capital value of a property which, in the hands of an owner, has no capital value - in other words a property which is tying him to a job which is producing somewhat less than the basic wage. What is the capital value of this sort of property? We can look at it only in relation to the assumed value it will have in the hands of the person who takes it over. This will be very much a rule of thumb measure. </para>
          <para>I am interested also in the new base line that is set. The standard set at present as a minimum is 12,000 lb of butter fat per annum per farm. This is a rough guide line as to the economic capability of a property to be a livable unit, but the new line drawn is up 25% to 15,000 lb of butter fat. I did a rough calculation, and I suppose a rough calculation is as valid as some of the more sophisticated ones, and if the present movements of prices and costs that have been demonstrated over the last 5 years - that is the fall from 47.1c to 41.3c per lb of butter fat and a rise of <inline font-style="italic">I6i%</inline> in costs - continues it will be only 5 years before the new line of 15,000 lb of butter fat is of no more use than the present line of 12,000 lb. The new line will be no better. On this basis, the new farm has only 5 years before economic movements will have caught up with it. We will have to start again to reconstruct a new level in the industry. There is, to my mind, a desperate urgency to do something that will check either the rise in costs or the fall in prices - or both. If we are to avoid a situation in which the Australian dairy industry fades away, not at a slow rate - the rate is too fast to be comfortable - primary producing countries have to get together on supply management. We cannot have a situation in which people in one form of production - that of basic necessities - are compelled to exist on a lower living standard than the rest of the community does and are compelled to accept conditions that the rest of the community does and are compelled to accept conditions that the rest of the community would not accept but are still expected to carry out an essential part of the economic life of the community, the production of our food requirements. </para>
          <para>While I welcome the Bill as a means of getting out of dairying those people who want to get o.tt and of temporarily at any rate putting more dairy farmers in a situation in which they can live on their properties, unless we do something to correct the present tendencies of increasing costs and falling prices in the primary industries, Australia and Australian agriculture are in for a very difficult time. I do not know that it is any consolation to us to know that agriculture in the rest of the world is in a similar position. I think there is some strength to be gained by knowing that fact, because there is a common interest among primary producing countries. I urge the Government to do everything possible to reach international agreements on production levels and on sharing world markets so that some rationalisation or some common sense can be introduced into world agricultural production. </para>

            <para>- This Bill is a regrettable necessity. That was the view expressed to me by representatives of the dairying industry from all States who took the opportunity to present to me, as representing the Australian Democratic Labor Party, their view of the present situation in the industry and of what should be done in future. They assured me that there was no alternative to this legislation if the dairying industry was to be rehabilitated. For that reason, my Party proposes to support the Bill. The object of the Bill is to phase out - those 2 words phase out' seem to be very familiar these days - of the dairying industry what are called marginal farms. Marginal farms are farms which are not big enough or which do not produce enough to make them a satisfactory economic unit. For the purposes of this scheme a marginal dairy farm is defined as a rural property running more than 20 lactating cows and with not less than half the gross income derived from the production of milk or cream valued at the manufactured price, but being one that has an overall production insufficient to provide a reasonable level of income. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The principle of the legislation is that a marginal dairy farmer wishing to leave the industry would offer his land to an authority in his State and, if the offer were approved, would receive compensation in full as soon as the transaction was completed. The authority would make the land available in whole or in part to another farmer together with the improvements that that farmer indicated would be useful. The land and the useful improvements would be sold to him at a price based on current market values in relation to the proposed use of the land. Before making the land available the authority would ensure that after amalgamation the built-up property would be an economic unit. We know hat many dairy farmers have mixed feelings about this scheme, but its voluntary nature should ensure that only those who want to get out of the industry, or who have to get out of it, will get out of it. How many will get out of it will, I think, depend on their view of the compensation that they will receive. </para>

              <para>-  I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> that there is a good deal of misunderstanding and misconception about what the Bill involves. This measure has been approved by leaders of the dairying industry, including the Australian Dairy Industry Council, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the Federal Dairy Committee. They placed before the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> proposals which they thought should be undertaken in order to tide the industry over its present difficult situation. These proposals embrace immediate action to secure the support of dairy factories and farmers in Victoria and Tasmania for a plan to limit production of milk during 1970 and 1971 with the objective of containing the total Australian production to 220,000 tons of butter and 70,000 tons of cheese. They had in mind that surveys indicated that unless some action were taken to limit the production there would be a considerably increased amount of butter produced and a good deal of this butter could only be made available for sale overseas at unprofitable prices. Members of the Council believe that they have to do this if they arc to save the present underwriting level in the industry. They believe that it is vital to the industry thai the Government should continue to underwrite returns to the producers at 34c lb in 1970 and 1971. </para>

              <para>- The underwriting is the assistance which the Government gives to the industry. Among measures which the Council placed before the Minister were, firstly, a measure for the early passage of the legislation to implement the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme and to buttress the present voluntary equalisation scheme. The second measure was an immediate stop to the development by Slate governments of new farms for dairy production. That was a proposal for definite action to stop the provision of new farms or their development. The third measure was the immediate licensing of all existing dairy farmers, with a provision that no new licences be issued except by agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council. I emphasise that these are measures which the Australian Dairy Industry Council is seeking to have taken but which are not necessarily contained in the Bill. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The fourth measure was the prohibition of the importation of cheese while controls on the production of Australian dairy products were required. The fifth was the introduction by all State governments of legislation to control the production and sale of cooking margarine and imitation milk. The next was a continuation of bounty on exported processed milk products and an extension of the bounty to cover all full cream processed milk products. The last was the provision of devaluation compensation on all dairy products other than butter and cheese. That is a pretty formidable list of proposed measures of assistance for the industry. It Indicates that the Council feels that the industry is in a position in which it needs considerable assistance. </para>
          <para>Why is this action being taken? As other senators have pointed out, it is due to the serious position of overproduction not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. Recently I read an article that referred to a statement by Colin Clark, the well known economist, to the effect that, although Germany had undertaken with considerable success measures for a free economy after the Second World War. measures for a free economy had not been developed in the field of primary production in that country; instead there was a system of subsidies for primary production. He said that, when he asked a leading member of the German Government why these measures for a free economy had been applied to everything except farming, the answer was that there were too many votes involved in the agricultural areas. </para>
          <para>The position is that this system of handouts not only in Germany but also in other parts of the European Economic Community has resulted in a mountain of butter; so much so that 12 months ago a German scientist set to work to examine whether it would be possible to turn some of the butter into stock feed and to feed it back to the cows. That scientific experiment proved a failure, but it indicates the desperation that people abroad feel in the present situation. Most people would say that in such a situation we should look for fresh markets, particularly in areas such as Asia. But it appears that for some reason - hereditary or otherwise - the Asian people are not particularly receptive to proposals to increase their consumption of milk products. They appear to have been used to other kinds of food. As I said before, the prospects for large increased markets in those areas are not good. </para>
          <para>In Australia we also have an extremely serious situation. As I have said, we have had proposals for measures to be taken for the purpose of cutting our production. We have had farmers marches composed, to a large extent, of people who are engaged in the dairy industry and who insist that rising costs and reducing prices are placing them in a more serious position every day. As I said on another occasion, I have received deputations of dairy farmers who insist that unless something is done to help them out of their present situation they may lose their farms. I have heard already of a number who have lost their farms. They include at least 2 who were in such a desperate situation a year or two ago that they borrowed money at the rate of 14%. Some people will say that they were very foolish. But how can we blame a drowning man for clutching at a straw? </para>
          <para>The situation is that the dairy industry in this country has determined to accept this legislation and has agreed to take measures lo restrict production this year and to put a slop to further expansion of dairy farms, lt even proposes that measures be taken for the licensing of farms. Everybody realises that these are measures which would not be undertaken willingly. They are measures which must occasion a great deal of concern among many people engaged in the industry. 1 suppose that their concern is reflected in the difficulty the Commonwealth has experienced in getting the States to take action in accordance wilh these proposals. It appears [hat the areas that will be affected most will be parts of Queensland, northern New South Wales, parts of Western Australia and parts of South Australia. The greatest doubts about the measures appear to have been expressed in Victoria and Tasmania, lt appears to be quite certain that in Victoria doubts have teen expressed about the measures, particularly in regard to the administration and the possible cost. </para>
          <para>However, representatives of the industry no! only in the States that would be affected most btw also in the 2 Slates in which I suggested there were doubts - Victoria and Tasmania - have come to the conclusion that the legislation is a regrettable necessity and that therefore it will have to be passed. The object of the legislation is to ensure the best use of the land by making sure that the units are economic; that is, units that Will provide a reasonable standard of living to those who are operating them. Many people had reservations and doubts about the proposals in the beginning because they feared that they might result in removing many small farmers from the land. 1 was interested to read an article that reported a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> S. Adams, who was described as the  Chairman  of the Federal Dairying Committee. He said that suggestions were being made that one-third of the dairy farmers would have to go. He took up this question and said that, if anybody had to go, in his view it ought to be the 'big boys'. He made some scathing remarks about the 'big boys' who had come into the industry. For example, he referred to them in these words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Also coming in in increasing numbers is the city tax dodger - the doctor, lawyer, etc. who buys land, usually large grazing properties, builds 2 or 3 dairies on  them  with 150 to 200 cows on each. </para>
            <para>He is not concerned wilh the prices his production is knocking down. He gets his reward in lower taxation rating, and to hell wilh the family dairy farmer who is being forced from his chosen way of life. </para>
            <para>The average family unit dairy farmer, unless  he  very soon lakes steps to protect his slums in the industry, is doomed to disappear.  His  farm is usually nol large enough to allow the  increase in production necessary lo meet  the  increase of larger farms. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>One third must go,' they say. Why one third? Because it will take one third if they are  pickedon  one-man-family units lo make <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> big enough dent in our national production lo leave a nice compact cosy industry for the big ones, and the high finance boys. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He said further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Why not peel a bil ofl'  the  lop few  10  secure  the  industry for the  dinkum dairy  farmer*.' </para>
            <para>Even  at today's depressed return I think  that  properly apportioned, there is enough for all real  farmers </para>
            <para>In any case, better one 200-cow tax dodger kept out than four 50-cow  family  units forced out. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He advocated quotas. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Quotas can save  the  family unit because they can be allotted on any basis decided on by the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That: is the opinion of a man who would have a knowledge of the industry, and 1 agree with him. 1 think that one thing that has affected many of us in examining this legislation is the uneasy feeling that this may be one of the first measures towards the elimination of the family farm. I am one who believes that the family farm must be maintained, despite the agricultural experts who say that the key to the future lies in huge collectives such as we see in authoritarian countries. 1 have believed always that the family farm is a way of life. Ii should be maintained even if some sacrifice has to be made in order to do so. If, as he says, quotas are one of the remedies, why not proceed upon the path that has been travelled by the sugar industry and other industries in recent years? This is the path which, unfortunately in some respects, the wheat industry has been compelled to go along in recent years. </para>
          <para>Finally, may I say this: Nobody would suggest that this legislation is the be all and end all of the rehabilitation of the industry. This is not going to be much good to the man who has a farm, who is up against it at the moment but who believes, and has some reason lo believe, that he can make it with a little bit of assistance. I therefore look forward to other measures by the </para>
          <para class="block">Government to help the industry. I mention, for example, the provision of long term loans at low interest rates and the establishment, in some States, of organisations of the farmers' debt adjustment board type for the purpose of assisting the man who is up against it, who is rinding that he cannot get credit, but who would like the opportunity to put his position before such a board and to submit to it that, if he could get reasonable assistance, he could still make a go of his farm. I think that a considerable number of dairy farmers in the community are in that position. They are looking for somewhere to go to get money at reasonable interest rates. They believe that, if they can get that money, they still can make good. It seems to me that this is a problem that the Government has not properly or effectively considered. I believe that it is one of the urgent problems which the Government must undertake. </para>
          <para>As I said before, I regard this legislation as a regrettable necessity. 1 know that it has caused much thought to people engaged in the industry. I know that to many a small farmer it has been provocative of great anxiety and doubt. This is inevitable. But I believe that we can do a number of other things to help the industry. Foremost among them must come those things that are necessary to maintain the family farmer in the industry. </para>

I regret that some other means was not found by which the dairyman, particularly the small dairyman, could have been kept on his holding and in production. I say that I believe that if this country loses its small farmers - if this is the first step in that direction - the whole community loses something that is very worthy and substantial to Australia. That is the reason I regret the necessity for the implementation of such a measure as this. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, I support it. In my view the loan-grant proposition contained in the Bill is a generous offer to the States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This scheme was first mooted 4 years ago. I think that it was about 4 years ago that the States agreed to it in principle. About 2 years ago. an officer of the Department of Primary Industry went around the States interviewing officers of various departments of agriculture with a view to bringing into existence a measure to which they would agree and which could be implemented on a Commonwealth wide basis. When one reads in Hansard that the States have received an assurance against the possibility of losses due to factors beyond their control, it seems strange that the States apparently have been lax in coming forward and in participating - that is, with the one exception, Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is right. The dairying industry is faced with extraordinary conditions. A worldwide glut of dairying products exists. I took note that the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman),</inline> in introducing the Bill, made reference to the possible entry of Great Britain into the Common Market. We have heard that subject referred to for years in this chamber. It looks as though, in the fairly near future, this might well come to pass. The Common Market has a mighty storage of surplus dairy products. Gallup polls show that the British people are substantially opposed to Britain entering the Common Market. Yet, in the current general election campaign, every political party is supporting Britain's entry. So, the people of the United Kingdom are to all intents and purposes disenfranchised as far as having any voice on the subject of Britain's entry into the Common Market is concerned. The electors have no way by which, at the ballot box, they can register a protest against the proposition, which is most serious, which has far reaching consequences for the whole of the Commonwealth and to which, apparently, a great deal of permanence attaches. </para>

              <para>-  He is one who has come out on this subject. But I repeat that although every political party contesting the United Kingdom general election on Thursday is in favour of Britain's entry into the Common Market, gallup polls indicate substantial opposition to such a move. There is no way in which anyone who is opposed to Britain's entry into the Common Market can register a protest against such action at the ballot box on Thursday next. </para>

          <para>Be that as it may, I come from a State where in 2 substantial areas - the northeastern and the north-western portions - the holdings are small. The holdings are from 100 to 200 acres. They were designed in that fashion when cash cropping was a proposition that attracted farmers. 1 recall to mind in my boyhood days seeing farms totally under cultivation for cash crops. One paddock of 5 or 6 acres near the homestead was used to run horses and a cow or two for milking. But cash cropping has gone out. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse,</inline> that it may well be that within 5 years, if costs continue to increase as they have increased and are increasing, the minimum production set down in the agreement will no longer be reasonable. I say further that if costs continue to increase, as they have increased over the past number of years, producers of all description, whether they be great or small, will be faced wilh a difficult position unless there is an improvement in the world export market for primary products. </para>
          <para>Bui to return to the small farms about which I was speaking - and I suppose that a man is nearly always influenced by his own environment - with the passing of cash cropping a lot of the farmers turned to dairying. They installed milking machines and milked a number of dairy cows. In addition to having a dairy herd, they put in a paddock of potatoes, as a sideline which, at times, was a most substantial one, or in latter years they put in a paddock of canning peas or beans, which I have mentioned so often in this chamber. But now the potato industry has been lost to the small dairy farmers, firstly because of the implementation of irrigation on potato farms on the mainland and, secondly, because of excessive costs, particularly of transport, in the Sydney market. The canning pea industry is under threat. At the outset of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement substantial quantities of peas were imported into Australia from New Zealand. This had an adverse effect on these same dairy farmers about whom we are speaking. </para>
          <para>It was with a lot of chagrin that I picked up a Tariff Board report of an inquiry which was conducted into electric shavers. I mention these matters to indicate that all round a fresh conception of Australian primary production has to be taken. The following question was referred to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report:  whether, having regard to the objectives and other provisions of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the inclusion of electric shavers falling within paragraph 85.07. lt of the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1966-&amp;8 in Schedule A of that Agreement would be seriously detrimental to the Australian industry. </para>
          <para class="block">After an exhaustive inquiry the Tariff Board made the following finding: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Tariff Board finds that, having regard to the objectives and other provisions of the Agreement, the inclusion in Schedule A of the goods under reference would be seriously detrimental to the Australian industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A man would not be human if he did not regret the fact that the same or similar consideration was not given to the Australian primary producer when some of his products were included in the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement without reference to any inquiry at all. lt is a matter that makes one think and wonder. No doubt there would be some technical reason given for not conducting such an inquiry, but looking at the matter broadly and fairly, if an exhaustive inquiry is made into a small item like electric shavers and a finding is made that their inclusion in the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement would be seriously detrimental to the Australian industry, surely at the outset greater consideration could have been given to these dairy farmers who are in such distress at the present time. In my area it is correct to say that the position of some farmers is so desperate that although they continue to live on their farms they have taken jobs elsewhere. Some of the farmers have allowed their calves to remain on the cows to be reared in that way as vealers while they have gone out to work. </para>
          <para>There is another factor that affects these small dairy farmers in my part of the country at least. J referred to the fact that many of them put in a paddock of potatoes as a help along the road. But we lost the potato industry. It is a few years now since some honourable senators in this chamber began to speak about the imports of processed potatoes from the United States and Canada. At long last the question was referred to the Tariff Board. To my amazement, when ] read the Board's report I found that the reference was only an investigation into the economic condition of Australian potato processors. </para>

              <para>-  Not into the general industry at all. lt was purely and simply a reference to the Tariff Board to investigate the economic condition of 3 processors in Australia; to determine whether or not they could endure competition, principally from Canada and the United States. As I said, there were 3 processors. Two of them, Frozo Food Co. Pty Ltd and Potato Products (Aus.) Pty Ltd, were very firmly of the opinion that increased duties upon the goods under reference should be granted. The third processor was Gordon Edgell Pty Ltd, who is by far the largest potato processor and whose annual output of potatoes is more than 3 times the combined output of Frozo and Potato Products. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Edgell would not say whether it was in favour of duties being imposed upon the goods under reference. Apparently it was satisfied to continue under the tariff arrangement which existed at that time, lt was a case of '1 am all right, Jack, you can look after yourself. The Tariff Board's report goes on to point out that imports currently supply only abou 10% of the local market. I emphasise the fact that imports currently supply only about 10% of the local market. I wish to point out that when one cannot sell one's product and potatoes are rotting on the farms, as they are during this year, 10% is a lot. The report of the Tariff Board continues: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In my opinion it should have been -  it is apparent that contract prices offered  over  the past few seasons by Edgells associated company, International Canners Pty Ltd, and by the Kraft organisation at Scottsdale, have been sufficiently remunerative to encourage the more progressive growers to use advanced farming methods and to offer more potatoes than the processors have been capable of handling. It is also apparent that there have been more growers wanting contracts  with  these processors than can obtain them. . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Why on earth was the whole ambit of the potato processing industry and, more importantly, the position of the man who does the initial producing not referred to the Tariff Board for its consideration instead of only the economic position of 3 processors? The Tariff Board should have had to decide whether potato growers in Australia arc able to compete with the imported product. I believe that there will have to be a rethinking on the part of the Government in relation to its policies in regard to the primary industries of this country. These things taken by themselves are of comparatively minor importance, but when they are taken at large it can be seen that things remain to be done insofar as the primary producers of Australia are concerned. I regret the contents of this Tariff Board report because it deprives dairy men of another outlet which they are anxious to exploit. Apparently we prefer to import processed potato products from countries with which we have an extremely adverse trading balance than to extend the use of our own product by 10%, which is a considerable percentage. No reference has been made to this important aspect. </para>
          <para>I support the measure under consideration. I regret that there- is no other avenue by which something can be done for the dairying industry. But 1 look askance al this matter. We talk about borderliners and marginal dairy farms. There are marginal farms in all forms of primary production. There are marginal producers among the industrialists. In fact, one will find them in all walks of life, if it were not for the extraordinary conditions through which we are passing it would, as far as I am concerned, be only as a very last resort that I would agree to support a measure such as this. But the mere fact that there will be no coercion, that participation in the scheme is optional and that any man is tree to please himself whether he will take advantage of this proposal and sell his property to his neighbour has influenced me. 1 suppose 1 have had more inquiries about this proposal than any other matter over the past couple of. years. These inquiries have been mainly from farmers wishing to sell their properties to their neighbours. Only a few months ago a man said to me: 'I milk 25 cows. It has caught up with me and I cannot make a do of it. I want to get rid of my property. I cannot increase my herd because I do not have the scope. All I can do is sell out and take a job.' The same thing is happening all over the country. It is happening at a time when considerable sections of the community are demanding and receiving more for their work and services. It is happening at a time when the men who have contributed so much towards the progress and development of Australia are going in the other direction. The time will come when they will be completely caught up with. This proposal is not a remedy; it is only a temporary palliative. When the time comes that these people are completely caught up with the country will be in a bad state indeed. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Bill, it must be very heartening to the dairying industry to hear the support which has been given to it by speakers in this place and in the other place. I believe that the very clear and concise second reading speech of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake- Brockman),</inline> who represents the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> in this chamber, which took up 7 pages of Hansard, summed up the matter. The Minister said:   . . this scheme was formulated at the behest of dairy farmer organisations, lt will help the dairy industry - over 50% of the dairy farmers in Australia could be eligible to participate. lt will go some way towards solving a social problem in the  rural  sector, lt will strengthen the economies in those regions where low income farms are concentrated and in turn  the  national economy. Finally the scheme reinforces the concept of the single-unit family farm as the basis of agriculture in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Air commended the Bill to honourable senators. In anticipation that this scheme of the Commonwealth Government will bring about those aims, I have great pleasure in doing likewise. I certainly compliment the Government for its intentions. I also pay credit to the Minister for Primary Industry for the fact that, although he has gone through trials and tribulations over a number of years, he has been able to bring this legislation into being. Indeed, I see this proposal as the commencement of a farm reconstruction scheme which will be of benefit not only to the dairy industry but also, as previous speakers have mentioned, in particular <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico,</inline> to other areas of primary production. This type of farm reconstruction scheme is something that is required in many areas of rural production at present. The reconstruction scheme proposed for the dairying industry is particularly important in view of the standard of living that the Federal Government apparently is seeking to provide in the Australian community. Today a great deal of money is required to live at a reasonable standard. I hope that not only Western Australia but all the States will embrace the principles of this measure. </para>
          <para>I suggest that a large slice of the responsibility for the late introduction of this Bill does not lie solely with the States. This is perhaps acknowledged by the acceptance by Commonwealth authorities of significant alterations which have occurred in the general Commonwealth and State agreement on this matter. In the time available to me 1 wish to refer to some of the terms of the Commonwealth Agreement with Western Australia, lt is the first agreement and the one on which the Federal Government has entered into the farm reconstruction scheme. 1 believe that the general terms of the Agreement that have been spelt out by honourable senators who have preceded me in this debate have made clear the purpose of the arrangement. However, several points of the Agreement will have to be reviewed by the Federal Government if it is to establish harmonious relations with the other States. I imagine that it is the wish of the Government that all States will enter into the scheme, lt will be of little use unless Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales also agree to the general propositions. I feel that it could be generally said that the Commonwealth is laying too hard on the line its demands in the Agreement, lt appears to me that there could be greater laxity in the spelling out of the terms of the Agreement with Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- We do not have a lot of time to discuss this Bill. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has read the Agreement. 1 have in front of me the specification of an economic unit in the Agreement. If the honourable senator has not had time to read it, I suppose that I had better read it to him. It is a point I wish to refer to and 1 will come to it after I have finished making the point I was making when the honourable senator interjected. At page 2 of the Agreement the Commonwealth spells out that $25m is available, but it does not specify how much is available to any State. The demand in New South Wales or Queensland is well above the demand in Victoria. If 1. were an administrator wishing to take the greatest advantage of the sum of S25m available, I do not suppose that I could go into the scheme more quickly and more inadvisedly than if 1 knew that there was no limit on the amount, available to me. 1 suggest that there is some concern that there may be quick expenditure which could force uneconomic entry into the marginal dairy farm scheme. </para>

              <para>asked me about an economic unit. I say briefly that the specification of an economic unit or an uneconomic unit surely must not be applied very strictly by the State authorities. In each case the expression is tied mainly to the production of butterfat. Whilst it is laid down in the Agreement that annual production of 12,000 lb of butterfat is the maximum production to allow entry of a marginal dairy farm into the scheme, it is stated that a farm producing 15,000 lb of butterfat could perhaps be considered an economic unit. I agree with the comment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> that in view of the rate at which our finance is depreciating, a dairy farmer who today receives annually about $6,000, from sales of butterfat at a price of 40c a lb, and is considered to have an economic unit, very shortly may move out of that category. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>I believe that the strict definition laid down in the Agreement must be varied. The terms relating to an economic or an <inline font-style="italic">uneconomic</inline> unit appear to me to be a little strict, lt is interesting to note that in New </para>
          <para>South Wales today 90% of dairy farms produce less than 15,000 lb of butterfat annually. The technical definition in the Agreement will not do the Agreement any good in my view, at least in respect of encouraging the other States to come forward. </para>

              <para>- I quite agree. The Minister will be interested to note some of the comments about the action to be taken after a farm has been purchased. The restrictions that are placed on the sale of a property must be viewed a second time by a reasonably efficient State authority. At page 7 of the Agreement it is stated: </para>

          <para class="block">Having purchased at the market value operating at the time there is a requirement for the authority immediately to make a notional calculation of the value of the redundant assets. There is no requirement for the State authority to sell at any particular point. Perhaps under a good Socialist government a lot of the properties could be bought up and never returned to farmers. That is not impossible. </para>
          <para>Once it is known that there is a notional valuation, not only of the property itself but also of the assets that are to be written off, there immediately come to the State authority 2 systems of valuation. On one side there may be a wealthy farmer to whom the State authority, in an attempt to gain the best and greatest use of the money, will try to sell at the higher figure. The wealthy farmer may have a son who needs the house so that item is not redundant. On the other side there may be a marginal dairy farmer who wishes to buy at the very lowest figure. As I understand it, the requirement is that the property can be sold only at the lower of the 2 figures. Undoubtedly the valuation of the assets put on by the authority would be known within the area fairly quickly. </para>

              <para>- In my view there are 2 market values. If someone is interested in the redundant structures he may be prepared to pay more money than the going market value for the property alone. A point which must be acknowledged here - it is acknowledged by authorities - is that the confinement of the State authority to selling at the market value of the asset with capital assets written off raises a problem in selling at the greatest efficiency possible. </para>

              <para>- No. In my view 2 market values are created. The point I am putting is this: Suppose you want to purchase a farm and the market value happens to be $100 an acre but that is because the farm contains 1 milking shed, 1 hay shed and 1 house. These are capital assets which are then to be valued and, in fact, written off the value of the property. The farm then becomes an asset valued at perhaps $90 an acre, and that will be known as the going figure for the property. I am putting that the State authority may have a buyer who is willing to pay $100 an acre, but I believe that under the terms of this agreement it will be forced to sell at $90. This is a point which State authorities have mentioned to me could lead them to disagree with the agreement. </para>

              <para>- That is a long question, which 1 could not answer property now. 1 was anxious to mention one or two things that have struck me about the dairy industry. J am appalled at times by the way in which writers, university people and economists refer to the dairy industry. Their remarks would lead the community - indeed many honourable senators - to believe that dairy products are being overproduced. It is something we would all accept. Without going deeply into the matter, let me point out that until 1970 not one dairy product was over-produced in Australia, give or take a little for what might be carried over in a season. 1 know that at 30th June last year it was considered that we would have a great stock of milk powders, but in any business that is likely to occur at any stage. The fact remains that there was no over-production. There is a possibility that in this year for the first time there will be an over-production of butter to the extent of 5,000 tons. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Wright</inline>asked for what export amount the over* production provided. Undoubtedly the export will be what we can sell overseas. I was anxious to make the point which tied in with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus's</inline> comment. Let me come to the point in this way: To me criticism of the dairy industry is abhorrent. Six or 8 months ago 1 was conducting a campaign and some fellow was running around saying that the Government was supporting the industry to the extent of $10Om. That is a straight lie. The amounts that the Commonwealth pays to the industry are quite light. It pays a butter and cheese bounty of $27m, a processed milk products export bounty of $800,000, the sum of $i.lm for research and extension, some $544,000 for trade promotion, publicity and export development and, in this current year, devalution compensation amounting lo $20,840,000. In my view devaluation compensation must be set aside because it is applicable to any industry which can prove that a Government decision adversely affected it. In short, of assistance to the dairy industry amounting to 529,444,000, the bounty payment of $27m has remained sialic for 14 years by request of the industry, and on a rough calculation that bounty payment would be worth about 40% of what it was worth when it was first paid. If one bears in mind that in I96S New Zealand paid a subsidy of $37m to the town milk supply, one can only come to the conclusion that the efficiency of the Australian industry is well founded. </para>

          <para>The various problems which beset the industry have been mentioned. Let me deal with the remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> about the 34c. On 3 successive radio broadcasts I heard the Australian Broadcasting Commission say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said, that this is a payment which is made to the dairy industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the Federal Government will support the industry if the return for butter fat falls below 34c per lb. </para>

              <para>- It does not. lt assists the industry only to the extent that as soon as the price begins to fall to that level the Commonwealth says: 'If the price of butter falls below a certain level we will have to start worrying about our guarantee of 34c per lb.' The Commonwealth has never paid one farthing to the industry on that basis but the guarantee that it has given is very important. </para>

              <para>- Yes. A variety of problems beset the industry and upset the market. We hear of the possibility of the entry of Great Britain into the European Economic Community. Incidentally, over 75% of our total exports go to Britain and the balance is sold to about 60 other countries. The dairy industry does a wonderful job in disposing of its produce. During the Budget debate last year 1 mentioned margarine sales in competition with butter. 1 see advertisements appearing in the Press - no doubt other honourable senators have seen them too - relating to margarine. Despite the fact that all State Ministers responsible for agricultural matters have decided that there shall be a quota on the production of table margarine, the big manufacturers of margarine are pulling on the market with the aid of high powered advertising what they are calling 'table spreads'. In fact this is purely cooking margarine. It is taking a large share of the market despite the fact that by law 90% of it must derive from beef or mutton fat. The processed raw materials cost about 10c per lb. lt is interesting to note that standard cooking margarine retails for about 24c per lb. But this new soft cooking margarine, after undergoing a simple process, retails for a bour 38c or 40c per lb. lt is mainly packed in attractive wrappers and is extremely well advertised. I believe this is one of the main things undermining the dairy industry. </para>

          <para>This product that is being put on the market to compete with butter is artificially flavoured and artificially coloured to give the appearance of butter, lt is not only undermining the butter industry but is also eroding the table margarine industry. I recommend that the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Agricultural Council take steps to bring about some uniformity in State legislation relating to the sale of cooking margarine. Victoria and Tasmania have introduced legislation restricting the sale of certain cooking margarine in their States, but the other States should do likewise. 1 put this proposition lo the Senate some 9 months ago. </para>
          <para>The growth in the sale of this new type of cooking margarine has been terrific. I have figures which show that in 1966-67 a total of 689 tons was sold, whilst in the following year the figures were 6,317 tons, 10,644 tons and 12,500 tons. 1 see this increase in sales as an erosion of the very market we are attempting by this legislation to protect. Despite the fact that these soft cooking margarines are very largely tallow based, the housewife has come to accept them for a number of reasons - their flavour, colouring and packaging, but principally because of the high level of advertising. A fairly high margin of the profit on these articles goes into advertising, and the sale of this product is eroding the Australian market for butter. </para>

              <para>- I do not think they are to any great extent, but undoubtedly the honourable senator would be persuaded by the publicity and he would believe that. 1 hope I have sufficient time to make some comments about the oil seeds industry. A powerful group of organisations, of which the Unilever company, a very large overseas concern, is a member, is able to pour millions of dollars into a campaign suggesting that the butter industry is at loggerheads with some other primary industry. lt has been estimated that for each 1 lb of soft cooking margarine that is sold the Unilever company retains some 7c or 8c for advertising this product. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> as a Western Australian, supports the proposition that someone can invade an established market and take it over with a product that is simply a copy of the traditional product.

I believe it is fortunate in Victoria that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte's legislation banning the use of colouring and flavouring in cooking margarine had the desired effect of keeping this product clear of the Victorian market. There was a danger that because of its attractiveness of quality, looks and taste, it would capture a portion of the butter market. </para>

In New South Wales the Unilever organisation announced that it had spent some §200,000 on advertising Stork cooking margarine during the period from Aprii to August 1969. lt further announced - and this is something I mentioned in the Senate last year - that in Queensland on this brand it would conduct the biggest campaign ever for margarine in that S.ate. lt claimed that within 3 months of the launching of its product it had attained in Victoria 45% of the cooking margarine market and 66% of the market for all cooking spreads. In South Australia it claimed that it had taken 68% of the cooking spreads market and that in New South Wales it had gained 45% of their competitive market. I point this out only because I believe a large monopoly is being formed in the promotion of this product. The fact is that butter's share of the total Australian edible fats market has dropped to an all time low at present of 70.4% . The 2 States which legislated against the colouring and flavouring of cooking margarine retained a very high percentage of butter consumption. In Victoria butter's share of the edible fats market is still 82%, and in Tasmania butter's share is 85%. In Western Australia, which has yet to be fully subjected to the type of advertising campaign that has taken place in other States, butter's share of the market is 82%. 1 would like to compare these figures with those in the States that do not have legislation restricting the colouring and flavouring of cooking margarine. In Queensland butter holds only 63.7% of the edible fats market. In New South Wales it holds 62.2% and in South Australia 63.1%. </para>

          <para>There is at the moment a running battle between margarine manufacturers. They are offering trips overseas as prizes. They are holding baby competitions. Another offer is that the housewife will receive 1 lb free for every 1 lb she buys. 1 pointed out last year how the butter industry had been able to maintain a national responsibility by holding the price of its product at a reasonable level over many years. But this is not so with the other products competing on this critical market. The prices for some products that try to take the place of rural products have increased. For instance, the price of Streets ice cream increased by 25% within the last year. But none of these increases in prices has gone back to the producers who have supplied the raw material. This is a particularly important matter. [ think the Senate needs to look at the fact that whilst the Unilever organisation claimed that its profit decreased by 25% in the last year, in actual fact it remitted overseas - it is a 100% overseas owned concern - an extra Sim in dividends. I appeal to the Senate to recognise this fact. </para>
          <para>I appeal to the State ministers and the Federal Minister responsible for agriculture to look at this matter at the next meeting of the Australian Agricutlural Council with a view to seeing that we support our indigenous industries and that we get support for the Australian market for butter. These new cooking spreads entering the market are attracting exorbitant prices for tallow based products. The housewives who buy them will bc financing a monopoly. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> as a businessman, thinks that there will be a great demand for oil seeds, 1 point out to him as a fair comparison that whilst oil seeds can be bought for about S375 a ton, tallow can be purchased for about SI 43 a ton. If I were a businessman it would be a long while before I would be buying the higher priced product instead of the lower priced and, therefore, the more profitable product for me to use. While we are asking the dairy industry to reconstruct and reduce levels of production to face the very serious consequences of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe we must accept the fact that the domestic market for butter is being seriously eroded. </para>
          <para>These soft cooking margarines, which are mainly tallow based, offer no significant market for Australia's edible vegetable oils. Growers of vegetable oil seeds have been looking forward to a profitable domestic market, but as this is limited, any surplus production will eventually be sold on the highly competitive world market without the high level of public support it may have enjoyed recently. At a recent Tariff Board inquiry into vegetable oils the manager of one Australian oil crushing plant when asked by the Board what prospects there were for exporting Australian oil seed crops - I hope the Senate will forgive me for quoting this - said: 'When that happens we may as well cut our so-and-so throats.' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> who is so interested in tariffs and protection, will say that we need to be very cautious as to the publicity put out by the people I have mentioned regarding the flow of oil seeds onto the market. </para>
          <para>J believe that over the years the dairying industry has proved itself to be probably the most important primary industry Australia has. No other industry will structure towns and decentralise industry and population in the way the dairy industry has. I believe the present measure, originally introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry is a step which must bc accepted by every State. I hope that before the end of the year every State will embrace the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme which has been put forward. .1 believe that this scheme will lead eventually to a proposition whereby not only the wheat industry but in all probability the wool industry will be looking to some form of reconstruction along similar lines. </para>

              <para>- Well, for 10 years the Australian Country Party has been influencing the Government, and the honourable senator has been acting as a very smooth and very polished advocate for the policy of vacillation. He has been virtually selling his own industry down the drain. He said that not one dairy product had been overproduced until the last year or so. Later I will quote in that regard some words of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> The dairy industry has had a direct hand-out of S27m plus the equivalent of about $30m in indirect subsidies through home price support schemes for butter and the very generous $17m a year devaluation compensation which is continuing 3 years after sterling was devalued. Australian dairy farmers are guaranteed 34c per lb average return on exports. </para>

This has resulted in this long period of vacillation in implementing a scheme similar to the McCarthy scheme for the industry. What has actually happened over this period of time is that inefficient farmers have been encouraged to stay in the industry, and they, and the industry generally, have been encouraged to expand production. This is a very serious indictment of any political party which exercises the balance of power in a Government as the Country Party does. For 10 years it has allowed this situation to exist, knowing the position in Victoria and knowing that, even up to this last year, new blocks at Hytesbury were being made available for dairying. </para>

The Australian Labor Party believes that not only has the Government been completely unaware of the consequences of encouraging the inefficient to stay and produce, but also it is expanding the amount of dairy land which is available for production. There are some very serious aspects of this scheme of which I think we should remind ourselves. </para>

              <para>-  A proportion of them must be inefficient, otherwise we would not be implementing the scheme. It means that 40% or so of the industry can bc classified as inefficient because of the existence of smaller units. From what I can gather, amongst dairy farmers 20 lactating cows are not classified as a unit; there have to be 70 or 80 cows for a profitable proposition with the cost of production and the other factors associated with the industry in this day and age. Butter stocks in 10 major producing countries have risen for the fifth year in succession. This is a situation to which we have to face up, because our main exports have been to the European market and particularly the British market. The European Economic Community alone has a butter surplus of around 300,000 tons or little short of half the world's annual trade in butter. The Six have accumulated this surplus through beggar-my-neighbour policies, such as high export subsidies, despite continued representations by Australia and other countries for moderation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We are preparing to subsidise the industry lo the extent of S25m over 4 years and to telescope the inefficient farms. I belive that if wc introduce a policy such as this those people who are encouraged to leave the land should realise their equity to transfer into some other form of employment. I also believe there should be some method of rehabilitation of the displaced persons. There should be either some retraining scheme or some payment for redundancy, such as occurs in other industries on the insistence of the trade union movement. This type of thing could quite well apply to the dairy industry. I believe that in justice such a provision should be included in the overall plan. What we are doing is putting a slicking plaster over an infected wound, so to speak. On the one hand the industry is really being encouraged to use all the modern techniques, all the latest developments in dairy production and on the other hand we are finding that our capacity to export to our traditional customers is declining. This has a cumulative effect which will rebound very strongly against us and will impose a tremendous burden on the consumer in Australia. </para>
          <para>The only other point to which I draw attention is the open ended policy that is inherent. We are trying to make the whole of the industry more efficient. By telescoping the inefficient properties with bigger dairying properies and increasing the production from the previously inefficient area by the use of more efficient equipment, better management and the like, we will have surpluses with which we cannot cope. Immediately facing the industry is a possibility, if not a certainly, of a quota system in which the amount of production per farm will have to be very carefully watched and, in my view, policed. These are consequences of the plan thai we have before us tonight. </para>
          <para>The whole of our economy today is patched up. lt is an economy of expediency and we are finding more and more that it is running into dead ends. Our cost structure is forcing up our prices. We arc automatically excluding ourselves from our traditional markets. On the other hand, wc have a complete inability to cope wilh the terrible situation in which there is poverty amidst plenty. We have shares in milk processing factories in Manila, Thailand and Indonesia, and I understand that wc have plans for extending this policy of assistance into other parts of South East Asia. We can only hope that an expansion of this policy will alleviate the pressure which will inevitably come onto the dairying industry in Australia. The overall purpose of the Bill, which is an attempt to improvise as a temporary measure to relieve the pressure on the inefficient farmer and to get him off the land or into some other form of production or employment is commendable, but it will create many more difficulties. 1 should like to mention the subject raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> who referred to the control and production of cooking margarine. The dairying industry has applied pressure to the margarine industry, which has every right to expand production and to promote its product. The butter factories have been very afraid of increased sales of margarine and particularly of coloured or cooking margarine. Even the cooking margarine is being promoted very strongly. Yet in this situation the price of butter was increased last year by 4c per lb. It is difficult to explain how an industry can continue to increase the price of its commodity and yet be able to put enough pressure on State governments to induce them to prohibit the promotion of margarine. 1 believe that not only is this an injustice to a certain section of the community but also it is only a makeshift measure. Some doctors recommend the use of margarine because of certain ingredients in it and if people wish to purchase margarine they should be able to do so. There should not be restrictions on the sale of margarine in whichever form it is presented. The points that I have mentioned are among the complications that 1 see arising from this whole plan. </para>
          <para>The dairying industry has wailed a long time for this plan to come lo fruition. We believe that it will provide some temporary respite. 1 do not know whether other circumstances will arise to give further relief to the dairying industry, but so far as I can see the plan has been delayed for so long that the industry has been built on a false foundation for a number of years when it was inevitable that a complete reorganisation of this type had to take place. I can only hope that the relief that is to be given will be of some help, but 1 cannot see how $6.25m a year will alford much relief. At present prices of land there will be some very worrying times for some people who may try to pay off their mortgages through the distribution of $6. 25m a year over 4 years making a total of J25m. We have an amendment to move later on. Whether this legislation can bring the relief to the industry that the Country Party is telling the farmers it will, we believe the farmers have been let down very badly by the Government's policy over the last 10 years or more. Now their own chickens are coming home to roost. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about the Country Party chickens that are coming home to roost. I started off laying the blame on the Government for this vacillation and the false foundations on which the industry has been built over the last 10 years or so. lt was inevitable that the coming of the European Economic Community, the restriction of other markets and our rising costs in this country would have been against the interests of the dairy man. For that reason the people of Australia should know that they will be called on to subsidise this industry continuously and that the whole cost structure of the industry is such that there will be a growing charge on the consumer in this country. A commodity such as dairy produce is essential, particularly for children, and the family man will be asked to pay more not only in prices but also in taxation. All the time the Government's policy of imposing these extra charges to pay for the subsidy is increasing the cost of living and so we have a vicious cycle in the community today. It is a worrying situation for everyone. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am sure the Government would not admit that it has itself to blame. If this country had taken a reasonable path in the early days after the last World War and had been prepared to have a measure of control of wages and prices we would have been far ahead of any other country wilh our rich natural resources and we would have been able to make the best use of the gifts this country has. Instead of that we are nol only behind many other parts of the world but the struggle we will have to maintain our standard of living will be greater, particularly for those sections of the community involved in primary production. The exchange rate has been to the farmers' advantage. Many other attempts, such as subsidisation over the years have been made to bolster the primary industries. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> mentioned eather, the wool people are realising their difficulties. We are finding that the man on the land is facing a future of very great uncertainty. All I can hope is that this allocation of S25m will in some way give a bit of hope to the dairying industry. Those honest farmers work hard and have a 7 days a week job. Keeping a dairy farm going is a very exacting task and I hope that this measure will give them the degree of support they deserve. The Government's policy has been imposed on them and has been to their great disadvantage. </para>

            <para>-  I support the principle of the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme, as provided in this legislation. For this reason and because the legislation shows consideration for the well being of the small man 1 wish to address a few words to the bill. This scheme shows understanding and takes a positive approach to the alleviation of the special difficulties being experienced by many small dairy farmers. The proposition provides for 2 situations. It provides for the small farmer who wishes to extend his farm from an uneconomic unit to one which can be made viable. This viability would come through a greater acreage of land and consequent greater production from the holding. The second situation provided for is that which allows for the small farmer who wishes to retire from the industry to do so with reasonable value for his assets and his investment and which enables him to enter another vocation with some cash in hand. If he has to leave his holding through sheer economic distress, he will not be left with only the break-up residual value accruing to him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The most appealing aspect of the legislation is summed up in the closing paragraph of the Minister's second reading speech when he said that the scheme reinforces the concept of the single unit family farm as the basis of agriculture in this country. That is the core and the great merit of the legislation. We hear so often these days that efficiency lies .only in the large unit. I do not believe that that is so, provided that a unit can reach a level of production or turnover that will cover reasonably the costs incidental to running the business. Therefore, given a reasonable gross turnover the efficiency of the small operator can be in excess of that of the huge unit. 1 have in mind that the law of diminishing returns, which has applied in business through centuries, still applies today. I deplore the persistent references to lack of efficiency because units are not of the biggest size. I believe in a unit which will give a good living and the ability to meet all commitments. We can have that sort of unit. Tn the past there were units which were not viably because of inability to extend them to meet a reasonable, modern requirement of greater turnover. There is no compulsion inherent in the legislation, it simply offers the facility to those who wish to act on it either to cease operations as dairy farmers or to extend operations so thai they will be satisfactory business propositions. </para>
          <para>In its essential features this plan ls in accord with the recommendations of the Australian Dairy Industry Council which, in October 1966, submitted proposals to the Government in connection with the renewal of the industry stabilisation plan for 5 years from 1st July 1967. The Dairy Industry Council recommended that, in addition to maintaining the existing measures of Government support for the industry, funds should be provided for distribution in conjunction with the States and grants should be made for the reconstruction of dairy farm units which were uneconomic because of their size. The Government accepted that proposition. I commend it for so doing. I should like to see that principle applied to other areas of rural production. In these proposals there is a lot of humanity and a lot of plain, common business sense. I have pleasure in supporting the legislation. </para>

            <para>- 1 rise to give my support to the Bill. 1 rise primarily to mention one point that has not been made tonight. AH honourable senators have stated very emphatically that this is a voluntary scheme. One thing that should be clarified is that even though it is a voluntary scheme, if anybody does desire to leave his property he will not be compelled to accept an assessed market value for it. He will have the opportunity to accept any value that he thinks will be of benefit to him. If he is offered a higher commercial value than the assessed commercial value he is completely at liberty to accept the higher offer. In questioning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> tonight I tried to get clarification of this point. I am certain that this is right. I have checked through the Bill and I have read the Minister's second reading speech. I thought that this was one point that should be clarified completely. This scheme - and I commend the Government for it - has many virtues, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> has said, and one of its greatest is that it is voluntary. The opportunity is available to those who wish to leave to get the best they can as they leave their properties. </para>

Having said that. I wish to address myself to the general principle that this Bill postulates. 1 was interested to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> deal with the problem of butter and margarine, which he introduced incidentally in the context of his argument, lt crossed my mind that the problem that was engaging his attention was not a novel one. I remember when 1 was a young boy reading of the history of the problems that engaged the wool industry in England and which were solved in part it was thought by passing a Bill which, when enacted, provided that everyone had to be buried in a woollen shroud. I quote that only as an illustration of a government enactment being used to interfere with or temporise with the mechanism of the market. </para>
          <para>The essence of the Bill before the Senate at present relates basically not to the problem of the dairying industry but to the problem of the use of land. 1 speak as a Victorian senator coming as 1 do from a part of Victoria where the problem that is <inline font-style="italic">aroused</inline> by the interest of this Bill has been in existence from time to time for 120 years. In the history of Victoria there have been 3 illustrations of the problem of land tenure that confront us. The first was what is known by social historians as the squatting age. Then there was the breakup in the 1870s of the land tenure system, which was based upon wool and cattle production, and the turning of the system into small units in order to fulfil the social- </para>

          <para class="block">I want to recollect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> as a senator from Victoria, that this has happened 3 or 4 times in Victoria. The problem is one of effective land use in the context of the economic circumstances and the social circumstances that exist at ihi time. If the honourable senator will allow me to continue and does not break the thread of my argument - to use his own phrase - in the 1.890s. after the breaking up of the land in the 1870s and the bank crash of 1892, the land was reconsolidated. In 1919, it was broken up again for soldier settlement. It was reconsolidated because of economic forces and pressures between 1921 and 1939. From 1947 onwards, the land tenure system of Victoria was broken up again, in 1953, when I ended my first appearance in the Senate and when one of these Bills relating to the dairying industry was before the Senate, I made the prophecy that that Bill which related to the equalisation fund would be perhaps the last to be passed. I said that the Australian dairying industry was involved, as were all other elements of Australian primary industry, in the problem of land use. </para>

              <para>remember 2 years ago addressing 800 indignant dairy farmers at Shepparton. I would sooner face a hostile Senate than 800 indignant dairy farmers or 800 indignant farmers of any kind, for that matter. I remember quite clearly staling to the dairy farmers in Shepparton that the Victorian dairy farmers had no worry because they were an efficient section o£ the Australian dairying industry because the land in south-eastern Australia naturally lent itself to dairying. The present Bill deals with the areas of the Australian dairying industry into which, unfortunately, people have been cajoled by the promises of politicians for electoral purposes. They entered into areas where the land could not effectively support a dairying industry in economic terms, as 1 understand it. 1 add, if I may, as a measure of what I believe to be true in terms of personal experience, that on marginal land I have attempted 3 times - backed by what was alleged to be scientific knowledge of land use - to establish dairy farms. I have had 3 attempts and I have lost money on every one of them. I claim at least to know something about dairying, even if I do not know much about politics. </para>

          <para>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that we are involved in this problem of the effective use of land. In cold, economic terms, this is clearly demonstrable in the terms of this Bill.

            <para>-  Although the hour is late and we are coming close to the end of this sessional period, there is a question that I believe is of some importance and should be raised. It concerns matters related to libraries that are provided to a very large extent as a result of the provisions of Commonwealth funds through the Department of Education and Science. Several days ago I raised the question of certain high school libraries being in the position that material had been provided as a result of the provision of Commonwealth funds but, owing to the lack of trained people, this very valuable equipment, particularly audiovisual equipment, is not being used and is going completely to waste in some of these high schools. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The matter to which I wish to refer now does not relate to that point; it relates to the administration of a high school library in the State of New South Wales - the library of the Ibrox Park High School in Leichhardt. I appreciate that the control the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science has over the day to day administration of schools that receive grants from the Commonwealth is very limited insofar as it exists at all. But my submission is that if moneys are made available by the Commonwealth to the States for a particular purpose the Commonwealth ought to exercise supervision or at least give some advice to the States on the way in which the moneys are being spent and what is happening in libraries that have been constituted very largely as the result of the provision of Commonwealth funds. </para>
          <para>There have been some problems in the lbrox Park High School just recently. I do not wish to refer to them at any length. They began shortly before the holding of the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign in Australia on 8th May when the Vice-captain of the school was suspended for wearing a Moratorium badge. Since then there has been a development, which I believe is a very serious one, regarding the free dissemination of information to students. I have a memorandum from the Librarian at the Ibrox Park High School. I would like to read out part of it. She states in her memorandum: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During the fortnight before the Moratorium when many opinions about the matter were being expressed among students and staff at Ibrox Park High School. I, as Teacher/Librarian at the school decided that it was necessary for people taking part in these arguments to be well informed. Thus, on Friday May 1st, I telephoned a book suppliers and asked them to send me material that they had in stock on South East Asia and other topical problem areas in the world. I said we required historical, geographical and political approaches, and that the books should reflect as as many viewpoints as possible. </para>
            <para>On Monday, May 4th, a representative of the Bookshop called with a box of books which they felt met with our requirements. I examined these books and decided to keep them. Later I made a display of this material on a front table in the library and told the senior students that if they wished to borrow any of them for the May holiday, they could do so, but that I would have to make a special lending record of this, as 1 had h.id no lime to accession the books. </para>
            <para>On Tuesday, May 19th, after the May holiday I arranged these books in a group on their own on top of the bookcase containing the set of Encyclopaedia Britannica, so that they were accessible and separate for senior students, and this is where the)' were when 1 left school at 3.40 p.m. that day. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">She goes on to say that during Wednesday, 20th May, when she wished to point out to some students that these books were available, she found that they had disappeared. She reported the loss to the  Deputy  Principal and ultimately to the Principal of the Ibrox Park High School, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith.</inline></para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline>said that the books had been moved, and he felt that they should be moved because this sort of matter which was being discussed was not the sort of matter which ought to be discussed in the school. </para>

              <para>- The teacherlibrarian of the school. Subsequently some books have been retained, but nearly all the books have been returned to the booksellers. The books that have been retained are books which do not appear to express any obvious point of view. They are: 'Indonesia' by G. A. Chatfield; 'Malaya and Its History' by Richard Winselt; 'Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia' by John F. Cady; and 4 o:her books which seem to be geographical surveys of the areas in question. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>A number of more controversial books have been returned to the booksellers. Those books include: The Philippines: Land and People" by Paul F. Cressey; China Today' by H. R. Arthur; Asia in the Modern World' edited by Helen G. Mathew; 'The Far East. A Concise History' by F. C. Jones; 'Vietnam: History Documents and Opinions on a <inline font-weight="bold">Major World</inline> Crisis' edited by Marvin E. Gettleman and published by Penguin Books, a book which is extremely critical of the American and Australian position in the Vietnam war; "A Concise History of East Asia', by C. P. Fitzgerald, a book also critical of this position; and From Yalta to Vietnam', by David Horowitz, again a book critical in this respect. All these books have been returned to the booksellers and arc not available to senior students at this high school. A further book in this category is Mao Tse Tung' by H. R. Arthur, which is published by 'Resource Materials for Asian Studies', in Auckland. However with an excess of zeal one of the books which has been returned is 'Vietnam. An Australian Analysis', by Alan Watt, a former Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department. </para>
          <para>That also was returned and is not available to students at the school. So also was Hansard of the Federal Parliament. It was taken out of the library, apparently on the ground that controversial matters were appearing in Hansard. Hansard has subsequently been returned to the library. </para>
          <para>The fact is that a very large number books concerning a matter of topical interest have been removed from this library. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> as a champion of free speech would be concerned about matters of this type because in the past he has told us how concerned he is by the lack of proper discussion in Communist countries. He would have a very lively interest to see that such things as this do not take place in our country. I am sure that he would not find it amusing if he heard about something like this happening in the Soviet Union, for example. </para>
          <para>The fact is that here are serious students in their final year at high school, aged 17 or 18, wishing to inform themselves on a subject which is of keen topical interest and a subject which might be of very great interest to some of them in the future if this Government is still in office and Australia is still involved in the war in Vietnam, lt might be of interest to them to learn about the country in which they will be conscripted to fight and in which they could be killed. It might be helpful if they were to know something about that country before they were sent there. The books which have been prohibited are not only books that offer a critical analysis of Australia's position in Asia and of Australia's position inside Vietnam in particular but also books  which put forward a view which supports that of the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United States of America in respect of Asia. </para>
          <para>I regard it as outrageous that, if we have an educational system which is meant to equip students to take their part in the world around them and which is meant to equip them to take an interest in serious matters - matters of great concern which are facing them - students are prevented by action of the principal of this school from being able to inform themselves on a subject which, of all matters of foreign affairs, is the one which is of most direct interest to Australians and particularly to Australians of this age - that is, the war in Vietnam. </para>
          <para>I think it is an unconscionable action which has been taken by the principal of this school. T appreciate the limited influence which the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science can have on these matters. But I do submit that if the Commonwealth is to provide money for the provision of libraries in high schools in the various States a responsibility rests with the Commonwealth to see that those libraries are being put to proper purpose and that they are being used in order to educate and equip people to take part in the great controversies and the great issues which are confronting the Australian people. Action such as that which has been taken at this high school is the stifling of free thought; it is the stifling of free inquiry. There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for saying that 17 and 18-year-olds at high school, people who are preparing for matriculation, should be prevented from informing themselves upon such subjects as Australia's role in South-East Asia and Australia's role in Vietnam. I trust that the Minister will cause some action to be taken on this matter. </para>

              <para>- I do not know who was behind the suppression which took place inside this school, but certainly it does not appear that the New South Wales Minister for Education has taken any action of his own volition in order to see that these books are made available at the request of the librarian, who incidentally also in future has to obtain the permission of the subject teacher before she can acquire any new books, which is quite contrary to the normal provisions relating to a school librarian, and she has also been compelled to provide to the principal of the school invoices of all those books which she has purchased over the past year. I do not know what the State Minister for Education has done. I would assume that he has done nothing about the matter as it has received quite a deal of publicity in the State of New South Wales, and for that reason I believe that the Commonwealth Minister should exercise some influence, not so that any particular point of view shall be put forward on this question but at least so that there can be open inquiry and open discussion and the free provision of all the best information available to those students who are interested. </para>

He has taken care to make it ex parte, giving me notice only 2 hours ago simply saying that he was going to refer to a matter concerning libraries receiving Commonwealth assistance. It is greatly to be regretted if publicity has been arranged for a particular incident of this sort without first of all going through the processes of some correspondence to enable the answer to be put on the record. </para>

              <para>- By speaking on the adjournment. 1 have no doubt that the honourable senator will recognise the dictates of fairness which would prompt any ordinary parliamentarian before raising a matter as a complaint of this sort to give the responsible Minister an opportunity to investigate the matter and answer in a responsible way in writing. I say the responsible Minister because it refers to a matter of internal management involving, apparently, a difference of opinion between the principal and the librarian of a school.
