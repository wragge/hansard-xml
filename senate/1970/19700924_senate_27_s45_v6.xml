            <para>- My question to the Leader of the Government concerns the discussions we had recently about the question of the Opposition co-operating with the Government in respect of the order of business in the Senate. Does the Minister not think it rather illogical that he should ask the Opposition to co-operate with the Government in respect of the order of business when the Prime Minister .refuses to disclose the proposed date of the Senate election? If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to point out that nobody will be surprised about the date of the election; it will be either late in November or some time next year. The only people who will be inconvenienced will be those of us in the Senate who are expected to co-operate with the Government in these circumstances, knowing that at any time we may be given 3 weeks' notice that an election is to be held. Legislation will be rushed through and the people of Australia will be inconvenienced because the matters which should be discussed by the Senate will not be given proper consideration. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Is it a fact that the Howard Smith Industries Pty Ltd oil/ bulk ore ship, the MV 'Howard Smith' was taken to Singapore on 14th August 1970 for normal annual survey and repair work? Because this was not an emergency job and could have been performed efficiently at Brisbane does the Minister agree that it represents a by-passing of first class ship repair and docking facilities at Brisbane for Australian flag ships? Does the Minister have any power of direction in this matter especially when Australian ship repair trades are desperately seeking work? </para>

I imagine that I would need to ascertain from the responsible Minister what facilities exist at Brisbane for repair and maintenance and whether or not at the relevant time they were up to capacity or below capacity. As to the powers of the Minister to direct an Australian flag ship to be repaired and maintained by Australian repair facilities I am not able to say, but .1 shall certainly find out for die honourable senator because I understand this is a matter of concern in Queensland. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the Tariff Board report which again implied that the protection afforded secondary industry was too high and also because lack of staff had hampered the Board in conducting a systematic review of tariff needs, will the Government give urgent attention to the necessity to bring the Tariff Board up to effective strength so that a more realistic and up to date application of tariffs, in the interests of the nation, can be implemented? </para>

          <para>I take it that the honourable senator is referring to the annual report of the Tariff Board which was put down in this place yesterday and which was put down by the Minister for Trade and Industry in the other place. To ask one at this point of time to express views about the annual report would be completely unreal. It is a very voluminous document. Very properly the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Government will examine the report. It is not possible at this time to make comments about the views expressed in the report of the Tariff Board. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Civil Aviation. He has stated in this chamber that there have been 2 increases in aviation fares within the last month or 6 weeks. According to what one reads, the first increase of 6 per cent was granted on the basis of rises in wages and the second increase of 3 per cent on the basis of increased charges for aviation fuel or kerosene and the increase of 10 per cent in aviation charges at aerodromes. Will the Minister request his Department to give the Senate more particulars of those increases? I do not think it is good enough for the people of Australia to be told that they have to pay an extra 6 per cent for fares because costs have risen on account of wages. Let us have a look at the wages, at the increased fares and the increase in the number of passengers. I think the Minister should give the country the full story which prompted him to agree to the increases as requested by the internal airlines. </para>

            <para>- That is a perfectly reasonable request and I shall most certainly accede to it. I want to mention just one or two things to the honourable senator. Late last year, towards the end of November, I read in the Press that there was to be an increase in air fares. That was the first I had heard about this. I then directed some attention to the matter and began to study the situation within the Department. At that time it was apparent that there had been no increase in air fares for 3 years and that there had been a substantial increase in the incidence of costs. The general situation was studied and when the airlines applied for an increase in fares we continued that study. The first increase in fares, as far as I am able to recollect without reference to all the departmental papers or departmental officers, was due to increased costs and increased wages granted in the Flight Officers Tribunal over a period and also late last year. The first increase did incorporate a component for what we believed would be an increase in air navigation charges. Subsequently there was a fuel tax increase and the second increase very largely carried that component. But the matter needs to be looked at, as the honourable senator suggested, in some detail on behalf of those who are interested and I shall obtain that detail for him. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government whether he has seen a report in the South Australian Press of a statement made by the  Chairman  of the Moratorium Committee in South Australia that that Committee would attempt to bring the life of the nation to a standstill in transport, factories, offices and education facilities, and that it would use such means as the occupation of city streets for a considerable length of time to achieve that purpose. What are the powers of the Commonwealth Government to prevent such anarchy and subversive actions from taking place and disrupting the every-day lives of the people? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI have not seen the statement to which the honourable senator refers. If the statement was made in the context in which he gave it to us - and I do not for one moment challenge his presentation of it - I would say it was a very wrong and improper statement to make. I think it does no credit to the organisation which made it. As to who is responsible for maintaining law and order and the conduct of the affairs of South Australia, this quite clearly comes within the responsibility of the South Australian Government. One would hope and assume that it would accept the responsibility of seeing that the laws of that State are obeyed and that no organisation, no matter what it is, should be given an opportunity to bring the city, the community and the life of a people to a standstill. In my judgment such action would, as suggested by the honourable senator, go a long way towards complete anarchy. </para>

            <para>- On 19th August, over 5 weeks ago, I asked the Minister for Civil Aviation a question about the site for a second airport for Sydney. The Minister advised me on that day that a committee had been at work on this matter for some time and he expected to have a report from that committee in his hands within a month. I now ask: Can the Minister advise how long this committee has been meeting and who are its members? Also, when will the announcement of the site for the second airport for Sydney be made? </para>

            <para>- 1! said on 19th August that I expected that committee's report within about 1 month. I believe it is on its way to me in final form in the bag today. It will deal with the problem of Sydney's domestic and international air travel. It was set up to evaluate the growth rate and the facilities, to study whether there was a need for an additional airport and, if so, to say approximately when it would be needed, and to indicate a range of possible places where it might be sensible to consider locating it. This has been a very exhaustive study. The committee was set up late in 1968. It met through 1969 and has concentrated very heavily on its work since the end of last year. I think it has met on something like 21 occasions and 16 of those meetings have been held since last December. The work has been done very thoroughly, as far as I can ascrtain. </para>

          <para>I now will have to study this report and submit it to the Government. lit would be my wish and my hope that we will be able to confer actively with the State Government on this matter because it, of course, has a vital interest in the whole problem. Having regard to all those factors I am sure the honourable senator will understand the situation. I shall certainly keep him informed as I am able to do so. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator had expressed his interest in this matter to me and I have obtained information for him. The Rural Reconstruction Board in New South Wales has been operating since 1939, and a similar institution known as the Farmers Relief Board operated between 1933 and 1939. The honourable senator will be aware that the Minister for Primary Industry asked the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to carry out an urgent investigation of the problems of debt reconstruction and farm adjustment in the sheep industry. The Bureau can be expected also, to examine repercussions of debt reconstruction and farm adjustment in the sheep industry on other industries throughout the rural sector. As part of the investigation the Bureau certainly will be considering the kind of approach adopted by the Rural Reconstruction Board in New South Wales as well as the approach adopted by similar institutions in other States. I understand that the Minister expects that the Bureau will be furnishing him with a preliminary report at an early date and that he will report to the Government as soon as possible. Until the Government has had an opportunity to consider the Bureau's report no statement on the Government's future line of action can be made. </para>

            <para>- In addressing my question to the Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities I refer to Press statements following the receipt of the report of the Australian Tourist Commission and the comments of the  Chairman  of the Commission of the fact that if we were to take away the advantages gained from United States R and R travel arrangements in Australia the general advantages to the country by way of tourist earnings would not increase significantly. The  Chairman  also referred to other important matters including the need to advocate promotional and concessional fares and improved facilities within Australia. Finally he pointed to the fact that governments of other countries gave subsidies to promote travel. Has the Minister or the Government considered those matters, or at least come down with some positive recommendations in regard to promotional and concessional travel and subsidies along the lines granted by other governments? </para>

            <para>- I am pleased that it has been understood by the honourable senator and other honourable senators that our record of travel promotion has been assisted to a large degree by the fortuitous visitation to Australia of American personnel on R and R leave. I think we all are indebted to the Commission for its report pointing out that we must not look forward to that as a continuing factor in tourist travel. With regard to the honourable senator's reference to the cost and arrange ments for travel, I remind him that on several occasions over the last 18 months I have referred in this chamber to very purposeful consultations I have had with my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> the Minister for Civil Aviation, and his predecessor with regard to air fares. Air travel brings about 90 per cent of our international passengers to Australia and is by far the most important item in cost of travel. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With regard to the other matter referred to - that is to say, developmental projects - I can assure the honourable senator that the matter has been before the Government at intervals of 6 months. It was before the Government twice last year; one item has been before the Government within the last 4 weeks and another item is at the stage of preparation. As the honourable senator would know, allowing time for consultations with various people, it takes 6 or 8 weeks. But these matters are receiving continuing and purposeful consideration by me and the Government. </para>

            <para>- This is a question of quite some value. I understand that a publication that is coming out this week deals with the future problems of Qantas in maintaining its business in a viable sense. As all honourable senators appreciate, the Australian community has a huge investment in Qantas and that investment is growing very fast. Equally, I think they appreciate, as we have had earlier discussions on this matter, that a large part of that investment has been built up by Qantas retaining its earnings and running a very successful business financially, in borrowing money and paying it back. These are things which I believe the Senate should know and the Australian public, through the Senate, should know. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The problem ahead for Qantas has to be examined in the general environment of civil aviation internationally. The world's airlines now operate more than 2,000 jet aircraft. With the highly stretched versions of contemporary aircraft and even larger capacity Boeing 747s coming into operation, as all honourable senators well know, by the mid-1970s, there will be 7,000, as contrasted with the present 2,000, jet airliners throughout the world. The capacity of the new generations of jets coming up is anything up to 3 times that of current types. Therefore, it is quite apparent to us that excess capacity problems reminiscent of the period following the introduction of jets in the early 1960s are expected to be encountered unless there is a dramatic increase in overall traffic. We will have a responsibility, and a continuing one, to try to ensure that Qantas Airways Ltd, our international carrier, in which we have a huge investment, maintains its business in a viable sense. Without support there would be no chance of it maintaining its international status. Equally, the Government has a great responsibility to ensure that nothing is done to delimit in any way the opportunities of people to travel to and from this country, to build up the tourist trade to and from this country and to encourage the flow of people to and from this country. </para>
          <para>If one looked at Qantas as a business concern one could say that in its existence it has demonstrated marked technical and operating efficiency. It has demonstrated great courtesy and, as people have said to me, there has always been a magic about Qantas as an international airline. It has maintained high international standards. Equally, it has to live in the fare structure of the international airline operators of countries much bigger than we are, with much bigger fleets and more finance. The critical factor for the Australian people and for Qantas is for it to maintain its market share of the routes it flies and to maintain a good passenger-seat ratio. The only way to do that is for Qantas to be as efficient and as capable as it has been in the past and for it to get adequate help from the Australian community and from the Australian Government and, in airline negotiations with countries wishing to fly into this country by various routes, for the government to be watchful that the interests of Australians are being safeguarded in the fullest sense. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has asked quite a proper question, but if he were familiar with the facts of international airline agreements he would not be quite so mystified. There is an agreement as to airline operations between Australia and the United States of America. Australia has such agreements with many countries around the world. This gives us rights to fly into those countries, but they are reciprocal rights. The agreements give those countries rights to fly into Australia. The designation by the United States of a second air carrier to fly from the United States into Australia was perfectly within its province under the terms of its airline agreement with Australia. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Attorney-General aware of the almost Australia-wide campaign of denigration of the police forces of this country? Does he agree that the persistence in this campaign of alleged attacks on unnamed persons by unnamed policemen can result only in an unmerited loss of confidence in the police forces? Does he consider that this is the purpose which certain agitators wish to achieve? Is it a fact that individuals claiming to have been assaulted by members of police forces have an unquestioned right of action against the policemen, concerned, which is an effective remedy available to all citizens? Will the Minister consult with the Attorneys-General of the States with a view to mounting a publicity campaign exposing the dangers of general unspecified attacks on the police of this country? </para>

              <para>- Wait a moment. In the end you will run out when the pressure is on. That has been your form over the years. I cannot see how the question can be in order when referring to the State police because they are under the jurisdiction of the respective State parliaments. Had the questioner referred only to the Commonwealth policy, the matter would have come within the ambit of this Parliament through the responsible Ministers. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, with</inline> great respect, that the honourable senator has asked a muck raking question that has nothing to do with this Parliament or the Ministers in it. If the Ministers in the States want to check on or disregard the complaints of certain people about the police forces, they are quite within their rights. I would submit to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> a question of this nature should not be permitted in this chamber. You know as well as I do, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> the question could not be answered. The State police forces are the responsibility of State Ministers. It is about time questions of this nature were ruled out of order by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline></para>

              <para>- I was about to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> was apparently entirely ignorant of 2  facts when he raised his point of order. Firstly, the police forces in the respective States are under a constitutional duty to preserve law and order in respect of Commonwealth as well as State laws. Secondly, the Moratorium campaign out of which the criticism of the police forces arose was a campaign directed against the policy of the Commonwealth Government in Vietnam. It is of the utmost importance to this Government that its policy in Vietnam be not subverted by people on the peace front overriding and subduing the  police forces which are bound to maintain law and order in any demonstrations against Commonwealth Government policy. For these reasons, I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> question is in order and that, in accordance with my responsibilities under the Federal Constitution, I have a right and an obligation to answer it. </para>

              <para>- It is quite obvious that the Australian Labor Party is, almost to a man, coming to the aid of a propaganda campaign which I would say any reasonable person must accept as being a deliberate attempt to subvert and undermine the efficiency, courage and resolution of the police forces. It is cardinal to the peace, order and good government of this country that the Commonwealth police and the State police discharge fearlessly their constitutional duty to maintain order, especially in cases of public assemblies of people which are calculated to be enraged by provocateurs from the Labor Party and out of which riot and unlawful violence might occur. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> quite rightly and appropriately states that anybody who has a justifiable piece of evidence to show that a member of the police force improperly committed violence to a person or property has a right of action in the courts. My experience in 40 years of legal practice has been that neither judges nor juries are slow to vindicate individual rights if they have been infringed by an undue exercise of police power. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General in this chamber. Is the officer in charge of the Commonwealth Police Force subject to the Executive in respect of tenure of office? Is the Minister aware that in South Australia the Commissioner of Police cannot be removed from office without the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament? Is it a fact that under this system the laws of the State may be interpreted and enforced without political pressure or bias? Is not this system the most desirable for the unbiased enforcement of law and order? If this system does not apply to the Commonwealth Police Force will steps be taken to introduce it? </para>

            <para>- I have not at hand the specific provision which prescribes the tenure of the Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, but the independence of a police force does not depend upon simply the tenure of the commissioner. Every officer, from a constable to the Commissioner, in the Commonwealth Police Force or a State police force has an independent duty established by law to enforce the law and such officer, whether the Commissioner or a constable, is not justified in accepting instructions from any Government to deviate from that duty in any way. The Parliaments of this country put upon the statute book the laws by which every individual in this country is to be guided and, as a corollary of that, the police force is established with a duty, independent of instruction from any political figure whatever, to enforce the law without fear or favour. </para>

          <para class="block">With great respect to the Leader of the Opposition this was not a question but an attempt to get something on the line in a political sense. Everybody here and everybody listening to the broadcast will understand perfectly what it was. It all adds up to some very loose statements about whether I know something about the views of some well known supporters of the Government. Again with great respect to the Leader of the Opposition, he knows that a purely hypothetical question posed in those terms is not in fact a question at all. There are millions of well known supporters of the Government in Australia and the number is growing. The more often we have questions of this nature the greater the number of supporters the Government will have. I think that on reflection the honourable senator will know that it is not a valid question in relation to the responsibility of this Parliament. I am not going to grace it with an answer. </para>

If we accept the threat of civil violence and the necessary counter measures outlined by him and his miniserial colleagues this morning, how does he reconcile that with the presence of armed guards outside the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and several other embassies in Canberra as a direct result of his Government's failure to deal with ultra right wing elements, as personified by the Ustashi, the continuation of the presence of guards being a cost on the Australian taxpayer? There is also the matter of Lesic, who the Government will not gaol but to whom it gave a social service pension. </para>

I have had no consultation with any honourable senator on this side or on the other side of the Senate who has asked a question in this session. As for promoting any such question, I repudiate the idea completely. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> benefit, since these questions were asked I sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Lane's</inline> book 'Australian Constitutional Law' from the Parliamentary Library.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Despite the large number of questions on this subject, I ask: Is it a fact that the only government in Australia to establish an inquiry into all aspects of the Moratorium demonstrations is a 'Labor government - that led by Premier Dunstan - and that all authorities in South Australia, including the South Australian Police Association and spokesmen for the South Australian Police Department, have accepted the proposed royal commission and the terms of the inquiry. In the light of this information, will the Leader of the Government refute the sort of criticism which he has made of all members of the Labor Party, of having been concerned with only one aspect of the Moratorium demonstrations, and acknowledge that what is being done in South Australia is certainly the basis of a proper inquiry which will produce all the facts associated with the South Australian demonstration? </para>

            <para>- The last part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly's</inline> question - that relating to jealousy - is typical. As such, I ignore it. The reference that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made to the appointment of counsel to assist the royal commission in South Australia was a perfectly justifiable political observation. When a royal commission is inquiring into a matter charged with a high political content it is unusual to appoint professional counsel known to be intimately involved in one side of that political issue. It is perfectly proper that a member of the Senate, in the discharge of his duties, should acquaint the public with the political affiliations of people who take professional briefs, with regard to the subject matter of those briefs. </para>

Will the Leader of the Government repudiate any insinuation that the Government would associate itself with any suggestion that counsel, especially Queen's Counsel, would act other than in accordance with the highest tenets of the legal profession? </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it not a fact that the great majority of Australians are law-abiding citizens? As the rights of this silent majority of Australians are being jeopardised by a few radicals and fellow travellers, who apparently are supported by some members of the Opposition, will the Minister ensure that the Government takes steps to protect the rights of the great majority of Australians to go about their lawful pursuits unhindered by this noisy minority. </para>

              <para>- I think I should respond by saying first that I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians are law abiding citizens, and that the vast majority need and want to live within the framework of the laws of the Commonwealth and the States. I believe that anybody who advocates departure from living within the laws of the Commonwealth and the States is, in truth, advocating a form of anarchy. I believe that every government of the Commonwealth and the States will accept its responsibilities. Since the question was directed to me in relation to the Commonwealth I say that the Commonwealth will always accept the responsibility of ensuring that the law abiding citizens of this great country will be protected within the framework of those laws. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, refers to the appeal made by Professor David Armstrong and other members of the Association for Cultural Freedom - all supporters of the Government's war policy in Vietnam - and the call for an inquiry into all the circumstances relating to the disturbances associated with the Sydney Moratorium. Professor Armstrong and his colleages referred to statements made by what they described as unimpeachable sources giving prima facie evidence of unjustified police action against the demonstrators. In view of the latter part of the statement by Professor Armstrong and his colleagues in the Association for Cultural Freedom, and in view of the Minister's earlier answer, does he believe that these people are members of a conspiracy dedicated to discrediting Australian police forces and destroying law and order in this country? </para>

              <para>Admissions to the 3 metropolitan universities in Sydney are controlled by a common admissions centre and applicants for admission to any or all of those universities make a single application in which they may nominate up to eight faculty preferences in respect of any or all of the 3 universities, i.e. a total of up to 24 preferences. The following table shows the number of matriculated applicants who sought enrolment at each university in New South Wales in 1970 and, in the case of the three metropolitan universities, is based on the first preferences of applicants. However, as admissions to the University of New England and the University of Newcastle are in the hands of the inidividual universities, the State total of matriculated applicants shown in the table, 17,090, may include some double counting if applicants for admission to a metropolitan university also applied to the University of New England and/or the University of Newcastle. </para>

Efficiency and economy of funds' operations will thus be reflected in their contribution rates. </para>

Accordingly, where a medical fund holds excess reserves, these reserves will be utilised to the advantage of contributors during the early stages of the operation of the new Health Benefits Plan. </para>

              <para>and (2) Before providing statistical answers to the senator's question I should point out that in' some States there is a common admission centre for a number of universities and applicants for admission to any or all universities concerned make a single application but may nominate up to 8 faculty preferences in respect of up to 3 universities. The figures shown in column (2) of the following table are applications from qualified students to the faculty of their first preference. Column (3) of the table shows the number of qualified applicants who failed to gain entry to the faculty of their first preference. Many of these would have been admitted to another faculty and/or another university. The principal reasons for the inability to become enrolled in the faculty of first preference were the effects of quotas and the applicants' failure to gain the requisite minimum aggregate mark in the Higher School Certificate for entry to the faculty concerned. </para>

            <para>- J wish to refer to the attack which was made yesterday in the Queensland Parliament by the Premier of Queensland upon 2 senators of this chamber, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> The attack has been widely publicised throughout Australia. Both honourable senators are familiar with what was said by the Premier of Queensland about them. On behalf of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, 1 wish to express complete confidence in the integrity and loyalty of both honourable senators. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Both of them have long, distinguished and honourable records in the Labor movement and in the public affairs of this country. The suggestion that the activities of these honourable senators will be subject to surveillance by the Queensland Government is monstrous. The outrage is clear from the admission of the Premier of Queensland that the activities to which he referred did not come within the responsibility of the Queensland Parliament but concerned the political activities of both honourable senators in federal matters. It must cause concern that any citizen, regardless of whether he is a member of Parliament, can be subjected to threat and intimidation calculated to inhibit him in the exercise of his political rights. It is an attack upon the fundamental basis of representative democracy for an honourable senator to be accused, under privilege in a State Parliament, of subversion and disloyalty for engaging in legitimate political activities. I note that no-one in this Senate has endorsed such descriptions; indeed, the honourable senator who spoke on behalf of the Government expressly repudiated such descriptions of the honourable senators. 1 think all honourable senators understand the political motivation for such an attack; it was in retaliation for criticism. The attack is a serious infringement of the rights of the Senate and of those citizens who elected the honourable senators to this chamber. </para>

              <para>- I am not suggesting it is discourtesy, f am suggesting that in the proper conduct of the Senate's business time should be given to the discussion of matters of General Business. The Government has had the opportunity to conduct its legislative programme in such a way as would not entail interference with the rights of honourable senators to discuss the General Business of this chamber. Simply because the Government wishes to hold up legislation and bring it on late so that it has to be rushed through in a day or two does not seem lo us to be a sufficient reason for deciding (hat General Business should be dispensed with. 1 suggest that the Opposition will not support this motion but will oppose it. </para>

            <para>- I want to say a few words about Government Business taking precedence over General Business, because from the time I entered this chamber I have been protesting against the taking away of rights of individual senators. \ think we should guard the rights we have very keenly and see that nothing interferes to take them away from us. At the end of each session it has been necessary to forgo some of those rights, such as conducting debates on General Business and perhaps the incorporation in Hansard of answers to questions on notice. But every time these moves have succeeded in the Senate it has been as a result of a discussion between the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition then holds a meeting with Opposition senators for the purpose of putting the proposals and advising senators how they could somehow assist the Government. I take it from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> remarks today that there has been no discussion on this occasion. Apparently there has been no attempt to seek the cooperation of the Opposition for the purpose of implementing the proposal to forgo General Business, if there is a need to give urgent consideration to some other business. I think this is a discourtesy which we should not accept. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Furthermore, let me point OUt that only on one night a week is it possible for private senators to raise matters of General Business in this chamber. Although it is not in accordance with the Standing Orders, this is because Government Business takes precedence over other business. In fact, General Business is considered by this House on only one night a week. Honourable senators have an opportunity one night a week to bring forward matters of General Business. If we forgo that right then we have no rights as private members of the chamber. I believe we should not forgo that right. If there is an occasion when it is desirable to discuss urgently a matter of Government Business - it should be on rare occasions - whether or not this is done should be as a result of some conference between the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition could then report back to senators so that we could consider the proposal and decide whether or nol we should agree to it. </para>

            <para>- T rise to indicate on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party which 1 lead that we support the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> in his announced programme for this week. We must at all times recognise that Government Business takes precedence over General Business when the circumstances are such as we find today. A very important piece of legislation has to he dealt with, ft is imperative that it be dealt with and decided upon by the Senate. In the event of its being passed it must receive the royal assent for the benefits to be operative from 1st October and for the beneficiaries to receive any additional payments for which the Bill provides. 1 am just as strong a stickler for the rights of members of this chamber as is any other senator. But it is an undeniable fact that the Government - and only the Government - has the prerogative of determining the business sheet in the light of the circumstances as it sees them. It is true that the Leader of any Government will have consultation with the Leader of the Opposition or the leaders of other parties in the chamber with  a  view to arriving at an amicable arrangement. But this Bill must be dealt with and finalised by this chamber before the weekend. in any case, if the Government's plan is given effect the Democratic Labor Party will be making the sacrifice because the first item under the heading of General Business is a motion in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> of the Democratic Labor Party. That motion deals with defence. That is  a  very important matter and one which, as all honourable senators know, has occupied the interest of the Democratic Labor Party since it was first established. We of the Democratic Labor Party put the matter of defence and foreign affairs very high on the list of priorities in our platform. We would very much like to have the opportunity to discuss this important question but 'first things first' is a very good motto. We are prepared to defer the discussion on this motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> until such time as we deal with the more important questions that call for our attention. </para>

              <para>- We will defend Australia and we will discuss this motion when an opportunity offers. I just want to make it clear that my colleagues and I support the Government in its proposal regarding the programme of work for the Senate. It is not of much value to complain about the delay in  a  Bill reaching this chamber. The Leader of the Government in this place is not responsible in any way for the progress of Bills from another place to the Senate. He cannot deal with them until they reach here,  and  I suppose they reach here only after they have been dealt with in the other place. </para>

        </quote><para class="block">The Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources was appointed originally  in  November 1967 and has been reconstituted on 3 occasions since that date.  The  duties with which the Committee has been charged involved a comprehensive consideration of the legislation which was enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament and by the Parliaments of the States, and which is known as the petroleum submerged lands legislation. The legislation was passed by the Senate on the express understanding, to which subsequent effect was given, that the Senate would appoint a select committee to inquire into and  to  report upon its many ramifications. The particular matters in respect of which the Committee was required to report appear in the terms of reference in the various resolutions appointing the Committee. They are as follows: </para><quote>

          <para class="block">The Committee has been meeting regularly  with the exception of the periods between sessions of the Parliament when the Committee ceased to exist. Over a period of almost 3 years it has taken evidence from 84 witnesses, including representatives of Commonwealth and State Government departments, oil companies, unions, contractors engaged in the off-shore oil industry, economists, geologists, marine biologists, lawyers and others. The evidence has related directly to the nature and operation of the provisions of the legislation and has comprehended many facets of the oil industry and the environmental situation in which the industry and the legislative provisions interact. The Committee has met on 139 occasions. The Committee believes that it has received all the evidence necessary to formulate ils final report and is well advanced in the preparation of that report. However, the Committee is aware that there has been introduced into, the House of Representatives a Bill for an Act relating to the territorial sea and certain other waters of the sea and to the continental shelf. In the knowledge that it has received a considerable volume of evidence relating to the legal, constitutional and practical problems raised by the issue of where legislative authority lies in the Australian federation in respect of the off-shore waters and sea-bed adjacent to Australia, the Committee considers that a report on its first term of reference would assist parliamentary and public appreciation of that issue. </para>
          <para>The Committee therefore has prepared and now presents an interim report on whether the consitutional conception underlying the petroleum submerged lands legislation is consistent wilh the proper constitutional responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States. The Senate will recall that the passage of the petroleum submerged lands legislation through the Commonwealth Parliament coincided with the passage through the Parliaments of the States of identical legislation. It was unique legislation. The legislative scheme was the outcome of co-operative effort over a long period, not only of the responsible Ministers of the Commonwealth and the States, but also of officers of the mines departments of the States and of the Commonwealth Department of National Development, and also of the Parliamentary </para>
          <para class="block">Draftsmen of the Commonwealth and the States. Its passage through the Senate was characterised by concern as to whether the Commonwealth was conceding a power which it was not warranted in conceding and as to whether the legislative and administrative scheme was designed lo secure the most effective utilisation of the off-shore petroleum resources. At the heart of the legislation was the lack of resolution of where legislative authority under the Constitution lay with respect to the resources of the sea-bed. The preamble of the legislation discloses the general approach. The relevant parts of that preamble read: </para>
        </quote><quote>
          <para>Whereas the exploration for and the exploitation of the petroleum resources of submerged lands- adjacent to the Australian coast would be encouraged by the adoption of legislative measures applying uniformly to the continental shelf and to the sea-bed and subsoil beneath territorial waters: </para>
          <para> And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, ' without raising questions concerning, and without derogating ' from, their respective constitutional powers, they should cooperate for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of those submerged lands. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">The Bill was then enacted. As a result the Parliament was confronted wilh an agreement between the Premiers of the States and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and joint legislation which was the product of that agreement. The agreement was not ratified by the Parliaments; the agreement was not enforceable in any court of law; the agreement was not amendable except by the unanimous concurrence of all the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government. The joint legislation purported to be an exercise of independent authority by each State Parliament and by the Commonwealth Parliament. Both the Commonwealth and the State Acts were designed to operate separately but to join together in the person of the Designated Authority. The Designated Authority was to be, and in fact in all but one case was, the State Minister for Mines, but he was also a Commonwealth functionary. </para><para>In those circumstances the Committee has expressed a conclusion that there were sound, practical considerations favouring the leaving of the questions unresolved at the point of time when the negotiations commenced, and primary amongst those practical considerations was the common desire to facilitate as rapidly as possible the exploration for and exploitation of the petroleum resources off-shore. This was achieved. It cannot be said in the terms of the legal advice which was open to both the States and the Commonwealth in 1962 to 1964 that there was any derogation of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States in the course they followed. The Committee does not accept that on the opinions and arguments available and canvassed from 1962 to 1964 the case for the Commonwealth being able to assert constitutional authority over the continental shelf was unquestionable; nor was the Commonwealth's case for control over the territorial sea-bed one which it was entitled to assume would be judicially upheld. Equally, the problems of the States in maintaining their claims were not of such little consequence that they could be ignored and, as the States themselves conceded, the amplitude of their claim to powers was such that they required for their complete exercise complementary action by the. Commonwealth. And the Committee states: </para><quote>
          <para>The committee accepts that there was reasonable basis for the Commonwealth and the States to regard the legal uncertainty of their constitutional position as justifying their decision to leave the legal position unresolved. Both the States and the Commonwealth, by proceeding independently and expecting a legal challenge and decision in the High Court, were open to the risk that such claims as they made as to their powers would be wholly or partly rejected. Powerful considerations of self-interest would be expected to operate to enable both Commonwealth and States to retain what powers they believed they had. Additionally, they recognised that any course which involved litigation would involve some delay, would inevitably involve further negotiations, would possibly involve further litigation and, while this was occurring, the off-shore exploration activities may have been jeopardised. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">The Committee was concerned also with the issue of ministerial responsibility which arose in the course of evidence. The Commonwealth Act is an Act which imposes responsibilities upon a Commonwealth Minister. But the responsibility of the Commonwealth Minister is limited to those decisions which, under the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, are matters of Commonwealth responsibility. But many of the decisions which are made under the legislation are matters of State responsibility in respect of which the decisions are made by a State Minister who is also a Commonwealth functionary. In respect of those decisions there is no accountability to the Commonwealth Parliament. Accordingly the Committee's conclusions of which there are four are as follows: </para><list type="decimal">
          <item label="(1)">
            <para>The constitutional conception underlying the legislation is inconsistent with what should be the proper constitutional relationship between the Parliament and the executive. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(2)">
            <para>In the context of broad constitutional responsibilities there is a challenge to the exercise of the functions of Parliament in the conception of uniform legislation drafted by the executive arms of seven Australian Governments being presented to the Parliaments as a fait accompli requiring formal legislative approval. This cannot be regarded as strictly inconsistent with the proper constitutional responsibilities' of the Commonwealth and the Slates as the power always lies with the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the Slates to reject or amend the legislation. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(3)">
            <para>The Committee does not regard the legislation as being inconsistent with the 'proper responsibilities' of the Commonwealth and the States because, as a result of the decision to avoid litigation which would have resolved the matter, it cannot say what is the measure of those proper constitutional responsibilities. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(4)">
            <para>The Committee considers that, notwithstanding the advantages to the national interest which the legislation and its underlying conception has produced, the larger national interest is not served by leaving unresolved and uncertain the extent of State and Commonwealth authority in the territorial sea-bed and the Continental Shelf. </para>
          </item>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I will make my point without developing it. The Australian Labor Party does not accept that the proper course of events is that at 8 o'clock the entry upon general business can be disturbed in this way by the continuance of a debate. We gave leave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to proceed with his matter. We suggest that the proper course is that unless the Senate otherwise orders general business shall be dealt with at 8 o'clock. There is no other order and I suggest that is the proper course of events. If this matter is proceeded with the whole evening will be wasted in a discussion. On the merits of the case I make it clear that we are opposed to the proposition which the Government is putting. By not developing this argument the Opposition is not to be taken as conceding that it is proper for the Government to interrupt the entry upon general business. </para>

              <para>- 1 oppose the proposal submitted by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> because I believe this is one of the moves that will take away many of the privileges about which, over the last 3 weeks, we have warned the Senate. The situation Ls that we are only in the fourth week of this session and already the privilege of general business has been taken away from this House on the pretext that there is urgent business to be passed by the Senate. Perhaps there is urgent business, but the Senate is working only 3 days a week as against the 4 days being worked by the House of Representatives. On the planned sittings of the Estimates Committees, 64i hours will be lost to the Senate. The Senate has to discuss the legislation and other matters associated with the Budget, together wilh other matters on which no doubt the Government will wish to legislate. This is the first week in which legislation emanating from the Budget is before this chamber. </para>

I believe that the test tonight is whether the Senate shall retain </para>

My personal belief is that we are not sitting long enough to deal with all the business that it is necessary for us to consider in this chamber.

              <para>- In my view the present situation is quite clear. The method of handling the Estimates by the committees today was opposed by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. Every honourable senator knows that the purpose in putting proposals before the Senate for the establishment of the committee system was to defeat proposals which had been placed on the notice paper by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> in relation to the setting up of a number of standing committees. On the occasion when those proposals were before the Senate we had the situation that so many Senate committees were to be formed that a ludicrous and silly position was developing. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Now that the committees have been established by a vote of the Senate we have a situation in which 5 of them are meeting, taking the business of the Senate out of this chamber and into rooms in the lower section of this building where there are few facilities for the Press and certainly no facilities to enable the public to listen to the debates. Later it is proposed that we shall have a miniature debate in this place when the Estimates come before us. This miniature debate will be occurring in the place where the major debate should be conducted. If we continue with the proposal to have 64-i hours of sittings by the Estimates Committees and the 40 hours that we have averaged in discussing the Estimates in this place we shall leave no time at all to discuss the important legislation that we will be required to pass before the Senate rises. Tonight we are in the situation where we can vote to retain the privileges that the Senate has or give them away for the remainder of the session. I oppose the resolution and I certainly hope that the Senate will defeat it. </para>

              <para>- The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act in order to adjust certain Post Office charges as outlined by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> in his Budget Speech. The new postal, telegraph and telephone charges will come into force on several dates, but principally on 1st October 1970. This Bill deals with the basic postal charges and the basic telegraph charges. Another Bill will deal with those charges set by regulations and, at the same time, there will be some charges set by administrative action. It is my intention, in this speech, to cover the whole field of charges. The proposed adjustments are detailed in the schedules now available to honourable senators. lt is anticipated that the Post Office trading results for 1970-71 would show a loss of Slim if no adjustment to charges were made. This would result from a postal loss of $3 Om and a telecommunications profit of $19m and is largely the result of increased wages totalling $58m, of which S45m will be a charge against trading operations. In 1970-71 the proposals I am now presenting to the Senate are expected to bring in about $42m and $53m in a full year. There would then be an overall profit of $30m for 1970-71 as a result of an estimated $39m telecommunications profit offset against an estimated $9m postal loss. </para>

          </interjection>
          <para class="block">Telegraph Services </para>
          <para>At the present time, the public telegraph service is operating al a loss estimated at about S5m a year and, notwithstanding the proposed increases, it will continue to run at a loss. The present rate for ordinary telegrams is 36c for the first 12 words and 3c for each additional word. Double the normal rate is charged for urgent telegrams, ft is proposed that an increase of lc per word be made to the basic telegram rate. This will bring the charge for the first 12 words up to 48c, with a 4c charge for each additional word. The urgent telegram rate will be double the new ordinary rate. </para>
          <para>Telephone Services </para>
          <para>Recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office in relation to telephone facilities provided are substantially in excess of the revenue from telephone exchange service rentals. Notwithstanding this and the heavy rises in costs in recent years, exchange service rentals and connection fees have not been adjusted since 1964. It is proposed that the existing rentals be increased throughout by $7 per annum and that the one-third reduction in rentals granted to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners be maintained. </para>
          <para>The service connection fee will be increased by $10 - from $30 to $40 - for new services and by $3 - from .$2 to <inline font-style="italic">$5</inline> - in the case of 'in place' services, that is, those services already in the premises when taken over by the new occupant. Rentals on some other miscellaneous telecommunications facilities are also to be adjusted in the light of the need for such services to provide a better rate of return on investment. Intercommunication equipment and private branch exchanges are typical of these services. Variations to the telecommunications tariffs are expected to bring in additional revenue of some S24m in 1970-71 and $28m in 1971-72. </para>
          <para>Provision  of  Lines  for  Country  Telephone  Subscriber!! </para>
          <para>The Post Office is pressing ahead with the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic equipment as part of its plan to bring the benefits of an automatic telephone service to country subscribers as soon as possible. This makes it necessary to upgrade the private sections of country subscribers' lines to a standard higher than that acceptable for manual exchange working. Late in 1968 the Government decided that it would assist subscribers by making funds available for the upgrading of the private sections of the lines. Subscribers would repay by instalment and interest would be charged at the long term bond rate with minimum annual repayments of $100 plus interest and a maximum period of loan of 10 years, [n addition to this arrangement, normal maintenance is taken over, by the Post Office, of  the  private sections of the lines and subscribers are required only to pay for any necessary main items of replacement materials. In spite of these arrangements, persons in the country who are located well out from their exchanges are finding the cost of these private sections of line to be beyond their means. This is particularly true at the moment when rural communities are facing a period of economic strain. </para>
          <para>The policy has therefore been reexamined by the Government and it has been decided that the Post Office will construct and wholly maintain all subscribers' telephone exhange lines from the appropriate exchange to each subscriber's premises. This will include line plant on each subscriber's property, lt has also been decided that the Post Office will bear a greater proportion of the cost than it has been responsible for in the past. In future the Post Office will meet the whole cost up to a distance of 15 radial miles from the appropriate exchange, irrespective of the route distance of the line. The present policy has the Post Office providing line on a formula basis depending on the extent of development along the route and, on the average, the 'departmental section' of the line has a length of 3i miles. </para>
          <para>Where subscribers are located further than 15 radial miles from the exhange the Post Office will still construct and maintain their exchange lines for the full distance. Beyond the 15 miles radius, however, the subscriber will be required, unconditionally, to pay for the line plant at a standard rate of §40 per radial quarter-mile. In the few cases where contributions are required from subscribers, the Post Office will now be able to quote subscribers immediately on application, without the need to prepare detailed estimates of actual line costs. In accepting responsibility for the full costs of maintaining lines beyond the 15 miles radius, the Post Office will regard such lines as being its property. </para>
          <para>These revised conditions will be extended to the upgrading or reconstruction of private sections of existing subscribers' exchange lines as opportunity permits, particularly in association with the conversion of services to automatic operation. The conditions will also apply retrospectively to subscribers who have either provided or upgraded sections of their lines to full departmental specifications in accordance with the policy introduced on 1st January 1969, as announced on 28th November 1968. The Post Office will be in a position to deal with inquiries very shortly. </para>
          <para class="block">Postal Service  1 will now turn to the postal service, lt has now been 3 years since the last rise in the basic postage rate. The wage rates payable to staff involved in mail work have risen by an average of 29 per cent in the same period. This has had an adverse effect on the postal service, because some 70 per cent of its costs are associated with labour. Since 1959, the basic postage rate will have risen by 45 per cent compared with increases in postal wage rates of 100 per cent. The Post Office has, of course, been able to absorb some of these increases by improved productivity. In 1969-70, for instance, postal staff rose by only 1.1 per cent, to cope with a 6 per cent, increase in business. </para>
          <para>However, with estimated postal losses of SI 9m in 1969-70 and $30m in 1970-71, at current tariffs a general rise is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. It is for this reason that variations in the charges for most postal services are proposed, and at the same time new features are to be introduced with the object of further improving the scope and quality of services available to business and the public generally. These proposed tariffs are expected to bring in $ 18.5m in 1970-71 and S25m in a full year, and thus reduce the estimated postal loss to $9m in 1970-71. Although honourable senators may have seen the statements circulated, setting out in some detail the proposed changes to postal rates, I intend to- briefly refer to the more important of these. </para>
          <para class="block">Letters and Postcards </para>
          <para>The existing rate of 5c for the first ounce will be increased to 6c; for each additional weight step the incremental charge will also be 6c, instead of 4c as at present. This increase will to some extent be offset by the combining of several weight steps to simplify the rate structure, the number of steps being reduced from 7 to 5. This simplified structure is identical to that recently adopted by the Universal Postal Union. </para>
          <para class="block">Other Articles </para>
          <para>The rates for the first and successive weight steps, presently 5c and 4c respectively, will be increased to 6c. By introduction  of  the simplified Universal Postal </para>
          <para class="block">Union structure, the effect will be to reduce the number of weight steps from 5 to 4 by combining the present steps of 8 oz to 12 oz and 12 oz to 16oz. </para>
          <para class="block">Publications Registered at the GPO </para>
          <para>The concessional rates on registered newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk require special attention because of the substantial difference between present concessions and normal printed matter rates and the resulting considerable loss involved. Half the estimated postal loss in 1969-70. about $9m, is lost on 158 million copies posted by the 7,600 registered newspapers and periodicals. Between1/2c and 1c is charged on about 75 million copies, and the overall average revenue is only 1.7c from all newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk. </para>
          <para>These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to manyorganisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. The fostering of a strong publishing and printing industry in Australia is important but this function is not appropriate to the Post Office. Again it is not the role of the Post Office to support religious denominations, charitable bodies, educational, scientific and technical institutions and the like, however desirable helping the activities of these organisations may be. Thus it is proposed to continue the action taken in recent years to reduce the content of the concession. The existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 5c for the first 6 oz and 4c for each additional 6 oz will become 6c for the first 6 oz and 5c for each additional 6 oz. Newspapers and periodicals published by Commonwealth and State government departments and authorities will no longer be eligible for the general and bulk rates of postage for registered publications, but will pay normal printed matter rates. </para>
          <para>Religious, charitable and welfare organisations, publishing registered newspapers and periodicals, consisting mainly of news, information and articles about their activities or about religious, charitable or welfare subjects; similarly educational, scientific, technical and agricultural organisations whose principal object is the dissemination of knowledge, whose publica tions consist mainly of news, information and articles on such subjects, will pay 6c for each 12 oz, on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of1c. This means that a registered newspaper or periodical of the above type weighing up to 2 oz will be only lc postage per article still, compared with 6c at normal printed matter rates. These days lc pays for only 15 seconds of a postman's or mail sorter's time, and any item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. </para>
          <para>Newspapers and periodicals consisting in the main of news, information and articles about country subjects will pay the same rate of 6c for each 12 oz on the total weight of the consignment with a minimum per article charge of lc. Other registered newspapers and periodicals, including those published by professional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisations and associations will pay the following rates: </para>
          <para>For delivery from the office of posting - <inline font-style="italic">11/2c</inline> first 2 oz 1/2c each additional oz. </para>
          <para>For delivery elsewhere - 2c first 2 oz 3/4c each additional oz up to 6 oz 3/4c each additional oz thereafter. </para>
          <para class="block">The registered publications will still enjoy a substantial, though reduced, concession. </para>
          <para>Discussions are being held with the New Zealand Post Office regarding the posting of registered publications to New Zealand at the domestic rates of postage. The Universal Postal Union Convention requires such special arrangements to be agreed to by the country of destination. Also from 1st July 1971, Australia will have to pay New Zealand an amount towards the cost of its internal handling of our mail, just as we in turn will be paid by other countries for our external handling of their mail in those cases where we receive more than we send. The amount payable to New Zealand per lb of mail will not be much more than the bulk rate. There will be a further statement on postings to New Zealand in due course. Similar conditions, which have applied on postings to Fiji will become invalid when Fiji becomes independent. The usual overseas rates will apply to Fiji as there are no logical grounds for treating Fiji differently from other countries in the area. The only other major postal administration still providing a domestic bulk rate for newspapers and periodicals is the United States of America, which incurs an annual loss of millions of dollars on this type of mail. </para>
          <para class="block">Bulk Pre-sorted Mail </para>
          <para>The postage rates for letters, other articles, and registered books posted under the bulk pre-sorted mail service will also be increased and will generally maintain the present relativity, in absolute terms,' with full rates. The Post Office is benefiting from the economies of higher mail volumes and compliance with preparation, pre-sorting and other conditions as many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates. Discussions are still being held with the New Zealand Post Office regarding the rates of bulk presorted mail to New Zealand. </para>
          <para class="block">Oilier Postal Adjustments </para>
          <para>Amendment of Postal Regulations or executive action will bring about other variations, details of which are set out in the statement available to honourable senators. Included in the variations is the commission on money orders, the minimum for which is to be raised from 1 5c to 30c as a result of the substantial loss incurred on this service. In many cases postal orders provide a suitable alternative to money orders at less cost to both the customer and the Post Office. To widen the appeal of this service, additional $9 and SIO postal orders will be introduced as soon as possible. There also needs to be an adjustment and regrouping of postal order fees to cover the small loss experienced on these items and to simplify counter operations. For parcels posted to places within 30 miles, this rates will be increased by 5c each, and to cover costs the charge for lighter weight intrastate parcels will be increased by the same amount. </para>
          <para>In 1968, when the fees for the clearance of private posting receptacles were adjusted, it was indicated that they did not cover costs. This service is very expensive to provide; parking problems in inner capital city areas also accentuate the difficulty associated with this facility. Hence a doubling of the fees is proposed as a further step to place this facility on an economic basis, except that clearances on holidays will cost the same as clearances on Sundays. There will be a rise in fees for the registered post, cash-on-delivery post and messenger delivery services. These special services are particularly labour intensive and tariff increases for them are required to cover costs. </para>
          <para>The Tokyo Congress of the Universal Postal Union in 1969 made a number of changes to the categories and tariff structure of the international post which have been embodied in the new structure: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman">
            <item label="(i)">
              <para>fewer and larger weight steps for heavier items; </para>

            <item label="(ii)">
              <para>merging of the sample and phonopost categories into the small packets category; and </para>

              <para>abolition of reply paid postcards. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>For British Commonwealth, Asian and Oceanic countries, the basic letter rates for overseas surface mail are being increased by 2c to 7c, and 9c for other countries. Even after the introduction of the payments by other countries of amounts towards the costs of our internal handling of international mail on 1st July 1971, the substantial loss incurred would continue to exist. Comparative international rates to overseas countries, expressed in' Australian currency are: </para>
          <para>Britain: Se (4.5c for British Commonwealth countries) </para>
          <para>Canada: 10c (5c for British Commonwealth countries) </para>
          <para>France: 13c </para>
          <para>Germany: 12c </para>
          <para>United States: 12c. </para>
          <para class="block">The Universal Postal Union Convention fixed the relativity of the upper weight steps to the basic rates. The increase in the international letter rates will have relatively little effect as far as the general public is concerned, as its most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards, which may be sent at the 6c printed papers rate proposed, and aerogrammes, which will shortly be increased in writing area by more than 20 per cent and arc unchanged at 1 0c. </para>
          <para class="block">New Services </para>
          <para>As part of the Post Office programme for meeting the changing postal needs of the business community, government organisations and the public at large, 2 new services are to be introduced. From 1st October 1970, a service known as 'Printpost Direct Bags' will be introduced. Under this new international service, printers and publishers who have bulk consignments of printed matter for the one address will be able to send them by surface mail in direct bags at 30c per 21b, provided they weigh between 22 lb and 60 lb. At present, such consignments must be broken up into separate packets and parcels. </para>
          <para>An air parcel service will also be introduced. Up to this time, the Post Office has not provided a competitive domestic air parcels service as the normal airmail fee of 3c per ounce has been added to the surface parcel rate to arrive at the airmail parcel rate. Compared to the airlines' parcel service, this has resulted in such high rates that virtually no business has been forthcoming. </para>
          <para>A new air parcels tariff has been developed which is tied closely to distance, lt is proposed that in each of 4 zones based on air route distances there will be a 'per lb' basis of charging, with a minimum charge. The zones and tariffs proposed are: </para>
          <para>Zone I (0-500 miles) 20c per lb: minimum charge 80c. </para>
          <para>Zone 2 (501-1,000 miles) 35c per lb: minimum charge 90c. </para>
          <para>Zone 3 (1,001-1.500 miles) 45c per lb: minimum charge 90c. </para>
          <para>Zone 4 (1,501 miles and over) 65c ger lb: minimum charge 90c. </para>
          <para class="block">Except for very heavy parcels in Zone 4. these charges are cheaper, and in many cases much cheaper, than the present charges for airmail parcels. In Zone 4 the very heavy parcel charge is fractionally higher because the new rates per lb have been expressed in multiples of 5c for ease of calculation, lt is proposed that the new service will be introduced progressively, commencing with the capital cities and the larger provincial centres served by air. The service will go into operation on the 1st January 1971. Other routes will be included as the necessary arrangements are made. On routes not included for the time being in the zones the present airmail fee of 3c per ounce, rounded off to 50c per lb will be applied to parcels for which air conveyance is required. Priority Paid parcels will be charged an additional 30c. </para>
          <para>As an integral part of the community, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> the Post Office is subject to the same pressures in relation to wage increases and rising costs as is any other business. Awards announced last year will add $58m to the total Post Office wages bill and this is more than 10 per cent of the total wage payments to staff. In such a situation it is not possible to absorb costs and, unless the Post Office is to totally disregard business considerations, increased charges are inevitable. No-one can deny that prices generally in the community are trending upwards and a look at individual charges for well known services over the past .10 years shows this pattern of increase. Labour charges for repairs to home appliances, motor vehicles, etc., have gone up by more than 60 per cent - taxi, rail, bus and tram fares have averaged increases above 40 per cent and some daily newspapers have raised their prices by 40 per cent. Typical fees for professional services also show rises of from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. Post Office charges have risen in the same period, but against the backdrop of the business and professional fields, the rises have been moderate. </para>
          <para>Converting the Post Office to a statutory authority is in some quarters held to be the solution to its financial problems. However, the British Post Office, which recently changed from Deparament of Stale to corporation status, finds itself faced with similar problems to those of the Australian Post Office. In Britain, the charges for some local and trunk call charges have been increased this year with the object of the telecommunications service achieving a financial return of 10 per cent before interest on net assets. In Australia, the return on net assets, before interest in the same field in 1969-70 was only <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent. Business telephone rental in Britain has been increased from SA34 to $A52 and the service connection fee of $43 has been increased to $54. The object of these increases in Britain is to ensure that the telecommunications service conducts its affairs on the lines of an efficient commercial undertaking seeking an adequate return on invested capital, to ensure an adequate investment programme to effect improvements in the service and so that its capital investment programme should be of sufficient stability to permit effective long term planning. </para>
          <para>The problems being encountered by the American Telephone and Telegraph Co., operators of the Bell telephone system, are probably known to many honourable senators. There has been a decline in the quality of service given in a number of major American cities as a result of the company's efforts to keep pace with rising demand in the face of increasing costs. As a result, massive quantities of capital are now required to meet expanded demands for service and much of the new capital required in 1969 was raised by debt financing which, at the end of that year represented some 39 per cent of total Bell system capital. The Australian Post Office has 98 per cent of its capital financed by long term debt. </para>
          <para>On the postal side, the proposed basic postage rate of 6c compares favourably with rates in overseas countries, more particularly when allowance is made for the much greater density of population and the reduced distribution costs of other countries when compared with Australia. Rates in other countries, expressed in Australian currency are: </para>
          <para>Britain: 4.5c with an increase to 6.3c proposed </para>
          <para>Germany: 7.3c </para>
          <para>Canada: 5c </para>
          <para>United States: 5.4c with an increase to 7.1c proposed </para>
          <para>France: 6.4c </para>
          <para>Sweden: 9.5c. </para>
          <para>Rapid increases in wage rates in a highly labour intensive operation is the common experience of the Australian Post Office and the overseas administrations. The United States Post Office deficit now exceeds$A1.6 billion annually, the British postal service lost $A37m in 1969-70, and the Canadian Post Office lost $A47m last year. </para>

Except for the proposed air parcels service which is expected to be operational on 1st January 1971, these will generally apply from 1st October 1970. The Bill also amends the Post and Telegraph Act to provide that Government publications are deregistered from 1.9th August 1970, and will no longer be eligible for concessional rates. I have dealt with the reasons for the decision to increase certain of the Post Office rates when speaking on the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill. The more significant changes to be made have been outlined, including those in this Bill which vary telephone rentals and connection fees and postal charges other than the basic postal rates which have been set out in the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill. There is no need for me to again cover these matters, and I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition opposes this motion. Th'e Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> agreed that we would not sit on Friday and arrangements have been made accordingly. It is not proper to break those arrangements at this late hour. Previously the honourable senator indicated that the Senate would not sit on Fridays, so honourable senators entered into all kinds of arrangements in their home States and elsewhere. After the suspension of the sittings, at 8 p.m., General Business should have been called on. Instead, it was stated that the Repatriation Bill had to be passed. The Government chose to introduce 2 Bills and to have the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> read her second reading speech. A lot of time was occupied in those second reading speeches. If the Repatriation Bill were urgent; it should have been dealt with immediately. These other non-urgent Bills should have been stood over. Instead the Government took this unnecessary course and broke the arrangements to which I have referred. If the Leader of the Government in the Senate wants the Senate to sit late tonight, he will insist upon that being done, but it seems to us to be a very unsatisfactory way of conducting the business of this legislative chamber and we will oppose the motion. </para>

I sought the leave of the Senate yesterday to have the Repatriation Bill and the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Bill debated together, which was agreed to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> then led for the Opposition on both Bills. I remember that he drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the other place the Opposition moved an amendment criticising the inadequacy of the repatriation legislation and proposing the appointment of a joint select committee to inquire into all aspects of repatriation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> said that the Opposition would not be moving in this chamber for the appointment of a senate select committee as this aspect would be dealt with under a separate heading. 1 find myself in a little bit of difficulty now because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has sought to introduce a third motion into the debate tonight. </para>

            <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> the intention of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> is to short circuit the debate on the motion which is on the notice paper concerning reference of all aspects of repatriation to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. The Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> has indicated that a proposal for the appointment of a joint select committee was put forward in the other place but it was defeated. The Senate has on a previous occasion carried a resolution for the appointment of a Senate select committee. Therefore, the Opposition decided thai it would proceed on the basis of the notice of motion which is on the notice paper. The Leader of the Opposition has proposed a cognate debate, which would save a lot of time. I do not wish to debate the merits of his proposal now. It seems to me that the arguments for and against have been put. The Leader of the Opposition's proposal would be time saving. Anyway, it would bc open to an honourable senator during the course of the debate on the repatriation legislation to move a motion similar to the one which the Opposition has proposed. This would prolong debate. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition's proposal would be time saving and I will not take up any more of the time of the Senate canvassing it. However, I suggest to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> that he accept it. </para>

            <para>- I spoke on this legislation last night for only a very brief period because I rose just prior to the stipulated time for the adjournment of the Senate. A number of things have arisen since thenwhich I want to canvass. The introduction into the debate of the terms of the motion on the notice paper in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> name has widened the scope of the debate. I. am amazed at the attitude that has been adopted by the Government in relation to the Repatriation Bill. Yesterday we almost had to conduct a mopping up expedition in this chamber because of the crocodile tears which had been shed by Government senators, who claimed that the passage of this Bill was being delayed. In the debate which took place just prior to the suspension of the sitting this morning concerning whether the Senate would pursue its normal course of debating general business this evening, a fairly important resolution on the notice paper was scrubbed. A lack of sincerity on the part of the Government is shown by the fact that the Leader of the Government in the Senate was to come into this chamber and, at very short notice, move that the Senate sit tomorrow. I have no objection to the Senate sitting 5 or 7 days a week if it is necessary to do so, but I think it is most unfair to require honourable senators, some of whom have entered into other commitments tomorrow-- </para>

              <para>- I am speaking to it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President.</inline> I believe that what I have raised is relevant to the allegation that the passage of this Bill is being delayed by the Opposition. The Government has, at short notice, adopted the very petty attitude of saying that the Senate will sit until this Bill is passed. This is the first time in the history of this Parliament that the Government has shown any interest in the welfare of ex-servicemen or repatriation benefits. The Government is only adopting this attitude because it is not having any success with its law and order policy. </para>

              <para>- They never show any interest in repatriation. No doubt one of the reasons why the Government is trying to push the repatriation legislation through the Senate is to ensure that the minimum time will be allowed to debate this very important matter. The Government does not want a public exposition of what it is doing to the ex-servicemen of this country.  One of the Government's ways of overcoming this problem is to ensure that there is a minimum of debating time so that the legislation will be disposed of as soon as possible. In other words, the repatriation problem is being pushed under the carpet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack is interjecting. He makes some shocking interjections. I will not answer him. He will have an opportunity to make a speech afterwards if he has the moral courage to stand up and do so. The notice of motion on the notice paper states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para>The Senate has on several occasions carried resolutions in this chamber for the establishment of a Senate Select Committee to inquire into such matters. After having a look at the names of those honourable senators who have voted against the establishment of such a committee one must wonder where the interest in the problems of ex-servicemen lie because it certainly does not lie in the hearts or the minds of a majority of the Government senators. I hope that the Government will rethink its attitude towards repatriation and that it will give serious consideration to the establishment of a committee on repatriation. I hope that honourable senators opposite will at the appropriate time vote in favour of the setting up of such a committee because it would be one way in which the shortcomings of the Repatriation Act could be examined. It would also be a way of examining the shortcomings of the Government's overall attitude to repatriation and ex-servicemen generally. I will have more to say on this matter as the debate progresses. </para>
          <para>In order to bring honourable senators up to date with the terms of the amendment which has been moved on behalf of the Opposition I shall read it. The amendment states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At end of motion add: but the Senate is of opinion that the pension rate for the TPI ex-servicemen, the general rate pensioners and war widows should not have been allowed to decline notwithstanding the proposed increases, in relation to average weekly earnings.'  lt is my intention later this evening to give documentary evidence of how compensation payments to  ex-servicemen have slipped far behind. 1 will be very critical of the Government. I shall be passing some very pertinent remarks. 1 hope that those honourable senators who have a pornographic turn of mind will not endeavour to twist my remarks in the same manner as they did when the Senate was discussing the social services legislation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman),</inline> who represents the Minister for Repatriation in this chamber. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This Bill now before the Senate provides for higher war compensation payments by way of increases in the rates of pension for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen-  and so on. Then I made reference to his notes on the Sixth Schedule where he said: </para>
            <para>The Sixth Schedule is to be amended to provide an increase in the special compensation allowance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">For many, many years this Government would never admit that the payment of war pensions was in fact compensation. But since the introduction of this section of the Schedule the Government is prepared to admit that it is a special compensation allowance. Then the Minister goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This allowance is payable as additional compensation to those seriously disabled ex-servicemen whose actual incapacity is assessed at from 75 per cent to 100 per cent of the general rate. The increase will be SI per week at the 100 per cent rate scaling down to 75c per week at the 75 per cent rate. The new rate of allowance will range from $6 per week for those whose actual incapacity is assessed at 100 per cent to $4.50 for those so assessed at 75 per cent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I want to elaborate on this in a moment also. Then the Minister makes reference to the Third Schedule. He stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Third Schedule will be amended to provide increases of 60c per week for the first child of an ex-serviceman, who dies from war causes, and 75c for the second and subsequent children. For a double orphan, that is a child who has also lost the other parent, the increase will be $1.85 per week. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then he went on to give the details of the pension. For the average youngster today, 1 suppose even those in the lower income group, 60c a week is about the amount of pocket money he receives, but here is this benevolent Government granting an increase of 60c a week to a child who will never know its father. And the Government looks upon this as adequate compensation. I would say that is a very hypocritical attitude to adopt in relation to the needs of those people in the community who have no one to fight their causes for them. </para>
          <para>At the end of the second reading speech are listed the amounts that will be paid under this special compensation allowance. We find that the 100 per cent general rate is $12 a week. The special compensation allowance is $6, making a grand total of $18, which in the old currency would have been £9 per week. At the 75 per cent rate the amount payable is $9, plus $4.50 special compensation allowance, a total of $13.50 per week. Only those people who are seriously incapacitated would come within this category. If any honourable senator has had to deal with some of these applications he would know that trying to get this special compensation allowance out of the Department is like trying to get blood from a stone. I suppose in recent times I have had success with about 2 per cent of the cases in which I have tried to get this allowance. I hope the Minister when he replies will be able to tell this Parliament how many cases are involved, how many applications have been received and how many applications granted. These are figures that I think ought to be exposed to the light of day. This allowance was brought in as a political measure a Budget or two ago and it has been utilised as political bait ever since. It certainly does not help the people concerned very much at all. But all of that great range of pensioners - and later when the figures are given honourable senators will see that the number is extensive - those who have given something of their lives, and the physically, mentally or otherwise damaged who come into the 75 per cent category and below, have not received lc increase for many, many years. </para>
          <para>The Queensland sub-branch of the Incapacitated Returned Servicemen's League sent me a very biting telegram which 1 will read to honourable senators later. I will now return to an examination of the pensions that are payable as set out in the Repatriation Commission's annual report covering the period 1969-70. For those honourable senators who want to refer to the report, the statistics of the main activities of the Department are listed on page 3. For the period 1968-69 there was a total of 600,979 war pensioners. Apparently the figure for the year 1969-70 is 585,307. This is a decrease of almost 16,000 pensions payable. Yet we find that the overall percentage increase for repatriation pensions and benefits is less than the percentage increase in the defence vote of this country. In other words, the Government can find money to kill but it can never ever find money to rehabilitate, to compensate and to look after those who have served in previous conflicts, and even in the current conflict. Many young fellows are coming back, from Vietnam who, through red tape or for some other reason, or perhaps because of non-entitlement, are having their pensions held up. There is more than 1 case of a young widow who has had to live in pauperism until such time as her compensation came through. There are many instances of servicemen who at the time of discharge have their payments held up and who are struggling. If the Department or the Minister or anyone interested wants to have a look at some of my files for documentary proof of. these claims, they will be available at any time. </para>
          <para>Now, of course, we have these extensive service pensions payable. We find for the year 1968-69 slightly more than 67,000 people were entitled to service pensions. This has increased for the financial year 1969-70 to 74,420, an increase of 7,000 odd. Of course, this increase is merely  a  book entry, if we come down to tin tacks, because the service pensioner, apart from  a  couple of minor fringe benefits, does no better than the age pensioner who is on the same rate of pension. So that if the Government says it cannot afford to pay these pensions it is pulling the wool over nobody's eyes, least of all the eyes of the Opposition. The percentage increase in the rate of expenditure for the Department is insufficient to justify the case that the Government has put up. .1 say that rather does it boil down to hard, cold political issues. The Government is adopting an attitude to a very large section of this community that it does not care about, except for those from which it thinks it may be able to buy votes in a political campaign. It is significant that the Senate election will be held this year. Wherever it can the Government is trying to buy votes. But it has not used ils last election bait to the degree of compensating those who probably are not greatly affected, because many of them, generally speaking, would be able to continue in fairly normal employment. I .refer to that vast number of people receiving a general rale pension of 75 per cent and lower. Tn the days of a Labor Government when the standards for these things were set, the standards which the Government has failed to maintain over the intervening years, it was looked upon as a form of compensation for injuries suffered, lt was looked upon as some sort of return to both the men and their families for the time that they had devoted, in most cases, during the early years of their lifetime to the service of this country. [ mentioned a moment ago that I had received a telegram from the Queensland sub-branch of the Incapacitated Returned Servicemen's League. This is a copy of a telegram which was forwarded to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and two or three others requesting -  move for payment of all meagre pension increases to be made retrospective to 1st July. Will you assist and also express 'disgust at no increase in general rate war pension. </para>
          <para class="block">Every member of this sub-branch is in receipt of a pension, and they are the people most affected. I would suggest that the Minister attend a meeting of this sub-branch or one of their social functions. He would see with his own eyes the disablements that these men have suffered. The other point raised in the telegram is that payment ought to be made retrospective to the 1st July. That is a very valid point. It is significant that the Government has adopted by practice and custom an attitude of always making pension payments at the latter part of the year. In this case payment will be made on 1st October. In other cases it has been much later. It is equally significant that when the Government fixes taxes or increases taxes they virtually operate from the day of the Budget. Smart business people are able to get in for their cut because they apply the sales tax or the price increase on stock which they have bought at reduced rates. When it comes to dealing with ex-service and other pensions the Government finds it convenient to postpone for as long as possible the payment of any lousy increase it makes. </para>
          <para>I take this opportunity to point out that it is the Department's cheese paring policy - and the Minister's too if the cap fits - to pare down expenses in remote areas. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> some parts of my State of Queensland a repatriation officer is never seen. In other places he is seen at infrequent intervals. We have struggled for a long time to have a full time repatriation officer established in north Queensland, a thousand miles north of Brisbane. But all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. I do not care if the Government does not want to put the officer in Townsville. Cairns or Mackay is equally suitable. By having this officer in north Queensland thousands of ex-servicemen will be given an opportunity to call and talk about their problems. It is all very good for the Department to say: Our officers visit the bigger provincial cities at a fairly regular time.' This is true. Many ex-servicemen are unable to take time off work to have an interview with the repatriation officer. Many never hear that the officer is in town. It is true that the local sub-branch of the Returned Services League is advised and the advice goes on the notice board in the club rooms. This is some concession. But it is not enough. Every man should receive some sort of notification which is of a more intimate nature. I can see the notice on the board in my club if I want to go there. I do not often have the opportunity to go there. But if there were a regular officer at a regular address with a regular phone number the lives of more ex-servicemen would be saved. </para>
          <para>I have seen people in the remote parts of Australia who say: 'We have not got the time to visit a repatriation officer.' In many instances they do not have the financial resources to pay their fares and probably overnight accommodation in a small country town to see the repatriation officer on one of his infrequent visits. I again ask the Department to re-examine this question of establishing a full time office not only in my State but in every other State where it may be applicable. I think there is only one regional office in this country outside the capital cities. This is a shocking indictment of Government policy. World War II veterans grow older. Most of us have now passed 45 years of age and many of us are in the 55 and 56 age group. These are the people who now need assistance most. As one grows older one's physical desire to receive treatment probably weakens. Certainly no sacrifice is made to receive treatmerit. There is a tendency to put it off until tomorrow. The attitude is: I will see the doctor some time. Eventually that person's health deteriorates and no pension is any good at that stage. Probably the only pension he receives is an ex-service burnt out diggers pension and a funeral allowance. </para>
          <para>I will quote a couple of cases to show the inhumanity of some sections of the Department. 1 am not abusing the employees in the Department. This starts right at the top of the tree. The onus and the moral responsibility fall right on the Minister. Of course in turn the Minister is answerable to the Government, or vice versa. I do not care which way one puts it. I want to quote the Webb case. It is a very pathetic case. This lady has given me permission to use not only her name but also her address. She lives at 42 Adam Crescent, Montmorency, Victoria. The post code is 2094, if the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holten)</inline> would like to send her a kind letter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Webb</inline> states in her letter which is only a few weeks old: </para>

          <para class="block">Whatever the background to the case may be it is a pathetic story. I accept it as genuine. That lady has seen fit to sign her name to that communication. I do not have permission to use the gentleman's name although I have permission to expose his case. I shall- refer to it as case A. This was a man who served, overseas during World War II. He developed a particularly nasty type of dysentery. In recent times he developed, cancer of the bowel. Over a long period of time the Australian Labor Party has strongly advocated, as do all ex-service organisations, that it ought to be the Government's responsibility to accept cancer in all cases as war caused whether or not there is proof. I. submit with respect that the Government could well re-examine its conscience on this matter. At this time nobody knows the origin of cancer. Nobody knows why it is caused. I have seen sectional figures relating to the incidence of cancer. I have not seen complete figures, but the sectional figures reveal that ex-servicemen as a group are more prone to cancer than other people. lt might bc an interesting statistical exercise for the Minister to bring out a complete review of this aspect to .see whether this trend can be established. But even if figures do not prove this to be so. one would think that as a matter of concession the Government would acknowledge cancer for repatriation purposes in cases where people have given so much of their health and their lives. </para>
          <para>When compared with the total number of diseases which cause early death or major incapacity the incidence of incapacity from cancer is not high. One would  think that the Government would examine this aspect to see whether a repatriation benefit could be granted, whatever the cause of the cancer and whether it involved the payment of a pension to the widow if the ex-serviceman passed on or the granting of a pension of a TPI pension if the ex-serviceman found that his employment had to be terminated as a result of his contracting cancer. I do not blame the Department for this situation; the Department acts under the Minister's instructions. What else can it do? In fact, officers of the Department have said that. In the case of this man there is no proof that the cancer was caused by the disease which he contracted while on war service. The matter went to the Repatriation Board and then went on appeal to the War Pensions Assessment Appeal Tribunal which decided, after careful consideration of ail the medical evidence and other considerations, not to attribute the contracting of cancer to war service. It may be said that the case can be re-opened if there is additional evidence, but what is the use of doing that? This man is in a hopeless situation: he is in a position where he cannot win. 1 have details here of another case, the details of which I shall not go into this evening because to do so would take me the best part of an hour. However, I have permission to use this man's name and in this case I think the refusal of compensation or pension is a clear indictment of this Government's policy. The gentlemen to whom I refer is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ronald</inline> Carr of 29 Prosser Street, Toowoomba, Queensland. This man served over a lengthy period of years in the Royal Australian Navy. Apparently he was a man of good conduct. He held a senior rank in the Navy and gave everything that he had for a long time to the service of the Navy. He did not serve in wartime but after suffering from a coronary, he was discharged and went back to a job. Then he was told that the Department of Labour and National Service would look after him and that everything would be all right. He was given no compensation or repatriation benefit - nothing crf this sort. It did not matter that he had given 15 or 20 years of his life in one of the Services. One cannot gel compensation if certain people think that one is not entitled to it. No benefit of the doubt is applied. That provision is just a big joke. There was a time when the appropriate section of the Repatriation Act allowed an ex-serviceman to have the benefit of the doubt, but that provision no longer applies. I challenge the Government to cite one case where the benefit of the doubt provision has been applied recently. The Government wants to cut down on its expenditure on repatriation so that it can increase its expenditure for purposes of war. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carr</inline>was told by the Department of Labour and National Service that he could have a job as a railway porter, but when he began at that job he was told: 'Here are some 56 lb boxes of butter; you can lift those around.' What man who has suffered a major coronary could take employment of that nature? From that time on he was dumped by everybody. It is significant to note that at the first examination by naval doctors they could see that his coronary had been induced by the nature of his service, but when he came before a board on which one of these doctors served his claim was rejected because, they said, he was not entitled to a benefit. The result was that apart from the normal payments which were due to him at the end of his service he received no compensation and no repatriation benefit. I have a very damaging file on this case and I propose one evening before this session is finished to produce this material because I think it is one of the greatest scandals that I have ever seen. </para>

              <para>- You have asked for it and you are getting it. and if you say anything else you will get it again. I propose now to refer to another case in which 1 have not permission to use the man's name. The letter relating to this case is available to departmental officers and to the Minister if they want to look at it. This case involves a man in Western Australia who receives a 60 per cent general rate pension for a disability and who needs physiotherapy for disabilities from which he suffers. 1 hope that the Department will look into this case. This man's wife wrote to me in these terms: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">However, she went on to state that, on that particular day, so that her husband would not lose lime from his job, she decided lo go along to the Department to make an appointment for him. She found it so difficult to find the appropriate section of the Department that she had to visit that she was compelled to seek aid from the lift driver, who was the only one who showed her any courtesy. She went on to say that there should have been two physiotherapists in attendance but only one was on duty. She was so confused that she did not know what she was doing. When eventually she saw the physiotherapist he told her that a lamp only should have been used for treatment, yet the man's own repatriation doctor had said that he needed physiotherapy. There was a conflict of opinion. By this time everyone was becoming completely fed up. This lady continues in her letter to refer to the occasion when she visited the Department. Also present at that time was a man who had come from Northam, which apparently is 60 miles from Perth, only to find that his appointment was not listed and that the repatriation doctor knew nothing about him. She states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>He had a train to catch back at 4.40 p.m. and when I left around 4 they were still trying lo sort things out. </para>

          <para class="block">She goes on then to mention that the notice on the door of the physiotherapist's waiting room read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Don't come in, sit and wait. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But then at the bottom of the notice and in smaller printing the sign read: 'You will be called in.' I do not blame this lady for being very upset about the manner in which her husband was treated and the manner in which she was treated. Again, this is not the fault of some employee in the Repatriation Department; the responsibility lies with whoever is in charge and this is where the blame must be sheeted. It comes right back to the Minister. She goes on to state in her letter that she oan understand now why her husband cannot bc bothered applying for any increase in his 60 per cent rate pension. His attitude is that it is just a waste of time and that when his complaint worsens he will not notify the Department even but will accept treatment from his local doctor. But this is the sort of thing that is happening all the time. </para>
          <para>The Government does nol have human attitudes; its only interest is keeping the expenditure of the Department as low as possible. In fact, because of the Government's altitude, the National Capital Development Commission would have more opportunity of getting money from the Department of the Interior than an ex-serviceman would have of getting satisfaction in his repatriation problems. I propose now to refer to another case. Again, if anybody wants to look at the details of this case they may do so. This case concerns an ex-serviceman ' who is getting on in years and who has suffered from indifferent health. He has tried to get a repatriation pension. This man had served in the Darwin area, which was a theatre of war after a certain period, but because he was in the area outside this period, although he is qualified lo wear a returned from active service badge and is qualified for membership in the Returned Services League, he is now denied the service pension which is paid to burnt out diggers. The Department said in a letter to him: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To qualify with service in Australia only, he had to serve for 3 consecutive months in the Northern Territory, north of parallel 14.5 degrees south latitude on or after 19th February 1942 and before 13th November 1943. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The letter continues: </para>
          <quote>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The departmental officer then expresses regret. That is the stock answer. He is probably quite genuine in his expression of regret because in my dealings with repatriation officials I have found the majority of them helpful; but they are completely hamstrung by the shortcomings of the legislation and the absence of a desire on the part of the Government to amend the Act whenever shortcomings are brought before it. it wants to keep pushing things under the carpet. </para>
          <para>I make a final appeal that before this Bill passes through this chamber and comes into law the Government examine the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> on behalf of the Opposition and also the motion on the notice paper which asks that there be referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare all aspects of repatriation, including the operation of the Repatriation Act and of the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act. There is a whole series of things, apart from the few instances 1 have mentioned, that ought to be exposed to the light of day and would be if the Government had the political intestinal fortitude to have them exposed to the light of day. There are numerous cases on the files in my office, as 1 am sure there are on the files of every other member of this chamber and every member of the other place, too. They are hopeless cases under the terms of the present Act. But in many instances only a minor amendment of the legislation is neded. That will not cost the country a fortune, but it will give justice to those people who most need it. 1 conclude with that plea for those 2 requirements that we have put forward. </para>

            <para>- lt is not my intention to speak at length on this Bill; but I take advantage of it to highlight to the Australian people the niggardly treatment that is handed out by this Government to men and women who have given their utmost in the service of this nation when their service has been required. We have a situation today in which young 20-year-olds, very often against their will, are being taken away from their homes and their family life, thrown into the Army, conscripted to serve in Vietnam, wounded in action, brought back to Australia and awarded a total and permanent incapacity pension if their case warrants it. Then for the rest of their lives, on the standards of this Budget, they are expected to live below the poverty line that exists in Australia today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In this legislation the magnificent and beneficent sum of S38 a week is being awarded to the totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioner. As a result of the Budget and this legislation, he receives an increase of $2 a week. So, a young man who has been conscripted by this Government to serve in Vietnam, who is gravely wounded and who comes back to Australia, even if he is given a TPI pension, is expected to live for the rest of his life on $38 a week. The minimum wage awarded by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to workers in industry today is $42.50 a week. Even under the Government's own health legislation, if anyone has an income less than $42.50 a week he does not have to insure; the Government will insure him under the voluntary health insurance scheme. </para>
          <para>The Government, in giving a mere $2 a week handout, is awarding to these young kids who have been wounded in the service of this country an amount miserably below the poverty line. Let us consider it on another comparative basis. What are the average weekly earnings of the male worker in industry today? They arc $63 or $64 a week. </para>

          <para>Let us look at other matters that one sees in the annual report of the Repatriation Commission. Frankly, I have the greatest of respect for officers of the Repatriation Department for the manner in which they treat members of the Parliament in regard to the cases that are refered to the Department by members from time to time. 1 only wish that the appeal tribunals, particularly the entitlement appeal tribunals, would give the same consideration to the cases that come before them, having regard to the onus of proof that is imposed upon the Repatriation Commission under the statute. </para>
          <para>At page 70 of the annual report of the Repatriation Commission for 1969-70 we see that, as regards the 1914 War, the total number of appeals to entitlement appeal tribunals for action was 2,313; the number allowed was 138; the number disallowed was 1,492; the number referred back to the Commission and allowed was 9; and the number withdrawn or lapsed was 72. So, whereas 147 were allowed, 1,492 were disallowed. Can anyone tell me that at the stage of life at which these men are - these men served this country at Gallipoli and in France, Egypt and New Guinea in the 1914 War - and having regard to the onus of proof that rests on the Repatriation Commission, the law of averages is 10:1 against their having an appeal allowed? </para>
          <para>As regards the 1939 War, the total number of appeals for action was 13,397; the number outstanding at 30th June 1969 was 3,907; the number lodged during the year was 9,490: the number allowed was 1,361; the number disallowed was 7,456; and the number referred back to the Commission and allowed was 103. There the ratio was more than 4:1 in round figures. It appears to me that the older one becomes in the service of one's country and the more difficult it becomes for one to prove one's case, the more difficult it is for one to receive any assistance from the Repatriation Commission. </para>
          <para>As regards special overseas service - this covers the men in the hostilities in which this country is engaged although the Government refuses to declare the war to be a war - the number of appeals outstanding at 30th June 1969 was 65; the number lodged during the year was 166; the total for action was 231; the number allowed was 50; and the number disallowed was 87. These are the appeals of young kids who have been conscripted by this Government and set to the jungles of Vietnam, often against their will. They are expected to come back to Australia and make application for a repatriation allowance; but in their case the ratio is about 14:1. Therefore, on those figures alone, apart from the individual cases that one has brought to one's attention from time to time, I say that the entitlement appeal tribunals are not honouring their obligation under the </para>
          <para class="block">Act to give the benefit of the onus of proof to ex-servicemen who have served this country when it has needed them most. </para>
          <para>There is only one other matter to which I wish to refer. A case is about to be formally referred to me. It has been referred to me by telephone. It is the case of a man who has been trying for many years to obtain justice at the hands of the Repatriation Commission. He lodged claim after claim and made appeal after appeal. He is now in the twilight of his life and is some 72 years of age. He had been receiving a Service pension but he is now receiving a war pension for wounds or injuries he incurred during the course of his service with the 1st Australian Imperial Force. Now, because of the amount he has received by way of war pension, his Service pension apparently is to be reduced. The information I have came over the telephone and I have asked the people concerned to send me the papers. </para>
          <para>I was always under the impression that a man received a benefit - for want of a better term - by way of compensation from the Repatriation Commission for service to this country. Now it appears that a man in such a situation, who is either in receipt of a Service pension or an age pension and then subsequently receives a war pension, is to have his Service pension or age pension reduced corespondingly in order to meet the demands of the means test. </para>
          <para>I believe that there are so many anomalies and injustices under the present repatriation scheme that the Opposition's move to have repatriation refered to a standing committee of this Senate is in the interests of ex-servicemen, in the interests of this country and in the interests of this Parliament. I certainly support the proposition proposed by the Opposition this evening. </para>

            <para>- I did not intend to speak on the Repatriation Bill (No. 2) which is now before the Senate. I was more interested in Notice of Motion No. 1 relating to an inquiry into repatriation which has now been coupled with this debate. I intended to speak to Notice of Motion No. 1. I will speak briefly to the Bill because I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and other honourable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber have been able to point out to the Senate the lack of attention and consideration that has been given to ex-servicemen in the Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe it is now very important that the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare . should examine the whole question of repatriation, lt is true that I would have preferred the establishment of a select committee of the Senate to do this job in accordance with the resolution carried by the Senate on two occasions but refused by the Government. I would prefer that course to be taken because the issues relating to the operations of the Repatriation Commission are extremely broad. I think an examination in depth of the Repatriation Department would result in it being modernised and streamlined. Because the Government refused, on the two occasions that that resolution was carried by the Senate, to put this matter up for investigation by a select committee 1 wholeheartedly support the motion before the Senate tonight. </para>
          <para>I do not think there would be one honourable senator in this chamber who has not on numerous occasions dealt with cases which he believed in his heart should not only receive sympathetic consideration by the Repatriation Department but which should in fact result in the applicant being granted the benefits to which he was entitled under the Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> mentioned a number of cases tonight. If I had the time f could duplicate them three or fourfold from the cases T have in my files. When an ex-serviceman comes into my office to put up a repatriation case I generally feel that I cannot do any good for him. This is the first reaction. I think that Christmas Day has arrived when 1 win I case out of the many about which I make representations to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holten).</inline></para>
          <para>The repatriation appeal tribunal system needs a very close examination. One of the frequent complaints 1 receive about the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals is that people who appear before them feel that they have not been given a reasonable hearing. They believe that their cases have not been given the close attention that they deserve. I raised this matter only a fortnight ago with the Minister. The man involved in the case travelled about 150 miles to appear before a tribunal. He firmly believes that the tribunal made its decision before he entered the room in which it met. He told me, in substantiation of his belief, that one of the tribunal members left the room with him, descended with him in the lift and left the building at the same time. Yet the next day he received a rejection notice dated the day of the hearing, lt was mailed to him at his home. No-one will ever convince him that the decision was not made prior to his appearing before that tribunal. If tribunal members are not sufficiently interested to remain and consider the evidence then you would think that at least they would be decent enough to wait until the man concerned left the building before going on their private way. No-one will ever convince that man that his hearing was fair or the matters he put before the tribunal were considered. </para>

              <para>- Not as yet. I have asked for the case to be investigated but have not yet received a reply. The point I am making is that I believe that an examination in depth would find many instances of ex-servicemen who feel that their appearance before tribunals has not been considered in a correct and proper manner. I have other examples, as, no doubt, have other honourable senators, of the lack of sympathy extended to many elderly pensioners, particularly those with total and permanent incapacity and those receiving the 100 per cent pension and who are hospitalised in the late years of their lives, f know of cases of men in their 80s who receive either a Service pension or a TPI pension and who are entitled basically to full medical and hospital benefits but whose illnesses have been declared to be chronic and who have had all payments taken from them at the time when they have a few weeks to live. We find that the Repatriation Department does this. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Quite recently the Minister upheld representations by me relating to an elderly gentleman who died in Warrnambool hospital. The position now is that the Repatriation Commission has agreed to reverse the decision made in this matter. This has relieved the worry of this poor woman whose husband, a TPI pensioner aged 85 years, had been admitted to hospital. She knew he would never come out alive. That man was advised by the Repatriation </para>
          <para class="block">Department in a roneoed letter - and that type of letter also is a disgrace to the Department- of the simple fact that he had been declared chronically ill and that no further hospital and medical benefit payments would be made. That letter was sent to this man, aged 85, who had been a TPI pensioner for years and years. </para>
          <para>Why not have an examination in depth into these things? I think the Minister clearly realised when that case was put before him that the action taken was most unjust. All these matters should be examined in depth. The Returned Services League would then be able to put very clearly before a select committee the reasons why it wants urgent amendments to the Repatriation Act. More importantly, the people who feel that they have been aggrieved could appear personally to give evidence. I feel that that is most necessary. A type of ombudsman obviously is needed at repatriation level at this stage of history because there are so many people who feel they are not getting a fair crack of the whip. Also, the Senate has agreed with submissions by the RSL relating to medical treatment for all persons over 70 years of age who served in the First or Second World Wars. It amazes me that the Government will not agree to this proposition. Very little cost is involved. When the position is assessed, many of these people would already have this entitlement because they receive a service pension or because they receive an age pension. There are a few left over in this aged group. If one looks at the lists in RSL clubs one sees the dwindling list of membership every year because of the death rate among both First and Second World War veterans. The cost would not be great, but it would give some recognition to those mert who fought for their country. </para>
          <para>The widows and dependants of those who died should be given some recognition. Many veterans died from injuries they received, which were not recognised - and I believe this to be a fact - or illnesses they contracted which were not recognised by the Department of Repatriation. I believe this to be a fact also. In the last 5, 6 or perhaps 7 years of their lives ex-servicemen over 70 should be entitled to this benefit. In the Senate the Opposition has sought, by resolution, that all persons Over the age of 70, irrespective of which war they fought in, should have this type of benefit extended to them. There would be very little cost in comparison with the total Budget of this nation. I do hope that the Senate will, in its wisdom, if a vote is taken tonight or if not tonight tomorrow, carry the amendment referring the matter to a committee. I believe that if a committee Ls set up we will get back from the committee a report that will substantiate that the many things about which we have spoken tonight show that the Act needs a complete review and that perhaps an entirely new Act may be required. Certainly the present Act needs many urgent amendments. </para>
          <para>The benefit of the doubt has been referred to by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I want to add my voice and my views to the belief that the benefit of the doubt provision is not being followed in the spirit in which it appears in the Act but that in fact it is being carried out in direct contradiction to the intention of the Labor Government which inserted this clause in the Act after the Second World War. Let us get to the position where we can examine these things properly and in depth. After we have examined them in depth we should ensure that the proper legislation giving these men their entitlements is carried through both Houses of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- in reply - This Bill will be implement the Government's Budget proposals in the repatriation war compensation field. The long title of the Bill shows that it is a Bill to amend the Repatriation Act 1920-1969, as amended by the Repatriation Act 1970, so as to provide for increases in the rates of certain pensions and allowances and for additional Repatriation Boards and to appropriate the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purpose of certain payments resulting from those amendments. In other words, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for pension allowance increases and to provide for the appointment of additional Repatriation Boards. But during the course of the debate honourable senators have taken the opportunity of ranging across the whole Repatriation Act and of referring to treatment and various other aspects of the repatriation setup. I will not take a great deal of the Senate's time traversing the speeches or referring to the Bill, other than what I have said. In the short time that I intend to take I would like to reply to some of the points made by various speakers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer firstly to some of the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> who opened the debate for the Opposition. He referred to the increases in allowances as being totally inadequate. I point out that there always have been critics of the Repatriation Act, either directly because of the insufficiency of the rates or indirectly by seeking to widen the condition of eligibility. 1 think this is a good thing because it certainly will keep the Department of Repatriation people on their toes to see that they do everything possible to assist the people involved. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> that representatives of the Returned Services League again had the opportunity of appearing before the Cabinet subcommittee on repatriation and of pulling their case to various members of the Ministry before consideration was given to the Budget. This is an opportunity that the RSL and some of the ex-servicemen's organisations enjoy each year. 1 do not think that many other organisations in the community can avail themselves of this kind of opportunity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> also referred to the fact that in past years the Opposition had supported the submissions of ex-servicemen's organisations. He proceeded to refer to the RSL war compensation plan. This year's RSL war compensation plan repeats the request that was made for the first time in 1969 for an independent non-parliamentary committee of inquiry to completely review the principal Repatriation Act and its provisions. In the last few years there have been requests for 2 separate kinds of inquiry - the non-parliamentary inquiry or committee of review and a parliamentary committee. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will note that last year the Senate expressed an opinion that there ought to be a Senate committee of inquiry into repatriation matters to commence not earlier than 1st January 1970. However, no formal move to set up an inquiry has yet been made, I remind the Senate that in 1967 there was a formal motion in the Senate for the establishment of a committee. At that time the Minister and the Government opposed the idea and the motion was not successful. In short, the Government has not favoured either form of inquiry. As a general observation, the League's case, as presented in the plan, does not of itself justify an inquiry. It recites a series of changes in social standards and medical science, the strategic situation and the economy and it identifies a number of areas of repatriation activity which it would like to see examined. However, it offers no evidence that the first group of factors has not already been taken into account sufficiently in advances made in the system: nor that the parliamentary review committee is  the  only or even  the  most satisfactory way of considering specific issues. </para>
          <para>If  the  League's request were granted,  the  principal pension rates would rise as follows: The totally and permanently incapacitated rate would rise from $36 to $42.40, an increase of $6.40 a week;  the  general rate 100  per  cent pension would rise from $12 to $21.20, an increase of $9.20 a week:  the  war widows' pension would rise from Si 5 to S21.20. an increase of $6.20 a week. The League suggests these rates as an interim measure pending an examination of compensation payments  by  its proposed special committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> reminded the Senate that on 3 occasions it supported what the Opposition  put  forward. The facts are that on a number of occasions the Senate has indicated  that  there should be a select, committee to examine the repatriation system and its recommendations to  the  Senate at the conclusion of  the  debate on the 1969 Repatriation estimates suggested that it commence its inquiry not earlier than 1st January 1970. </para>
          <para>In 1969 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drury</inline> moved that at the end of  the  motion for the second reading of the Bill certain words bc added. The Government's attitude in this matter  has  been quite clear. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKel-lar,</inline> when Minister for Repatriation, went into some detail in the debate in 1969 on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> motion that a Senate, select committee be appointed to examine repatriation matters. In explaining  why  the Government did not favour the appointment of such a committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> stated that the Government's view then was that there was already a continuing opportunity for review by Parliament, through the introduction of amending legislation, notices of motion and speeches' during the adjournment debate, and by the administration itself. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline>then referred to the 1943 Committee and said that the RSL and the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers' Association were using the 1950 review. The 1943 Committee was primarily concerned with adopting the then Repatriation Act to meet the needs and conditions of servicemen of World War IT. The same circumstances had not recurred. In 1950, almost as soon as the Government assumed office, it conducted a review of repatriation affairs generally. As I have just said, there is continuing opportunity for review of the system to be conducted by Parliament and by other means. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline>referred to the case put forward by the Returned Services League for extending repatriation hospital, medical and pharmaceutical benefits. In the past few years there have been numerous requests from organisations and individuals representing ex-servicemen for the provision of free treatment and services for veterans of the Boer War and World War I. Proposals have varied from hospital treatment of the acute phase of an illness to full medical and hospital treatment services; and from treatment for all of the veterans to those who served overseas. </para>
          <para>Those people who are disabled through war service and on existing means test standards are judged to be needy are already entitled to medical and hospital treatment. Thus the proposal to extent treatment facilities to Boer War and World War I ex-servicemen would benefit only those veterans who are neither seriously incapacitated because of war service nor in financial need. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> also referred to the funeral grant. This has always been a grant towards the cost of a funeral and has never been intended to cover the full cost. A number of other speakers raised matters in this debate but time is short and I cannot reply to all of them.I have replied to the more important points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> The Government cannot support the proposed amendment. </para>
