It was thought proper that these should be adjusted. I  am  unable to say what the effect on the Qantas cost position is.

            <para>- I direct  a  question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is it  a  fact that the Minister for Health recently warned hospital and medical benefit organisations that when applying for registration under the National Health Act by 1st October 1970 they must keep administration costs within prescribed limits? In the Minister's Press statement of 19th January this year, in which he referred to the findings of both the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs and the Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry, did he state that the Government expected of health funds generally that they would reduce or contain overall management costs, and that included, of course, commissions paid to agents? Can the Minister inform the Senate whether any funds, in the interests of their contributors, have abandoned the system of paying agents' commissions as  a  percentage of contributions collected and have introduced the system recommended by the Senate Select Committee of paying commissions on  a  periodically reviewed and uniformly applied work value basis? Will the Minister also inform the Senate which funds propose using the percentage system which is clearly inflationary and inappropriate in that it provides for agents' commissions to be increased whenever contributions are raised to meet fee increases or additional benefits? </para>

          <para class="block">The honourable senator has asked me two questions, the first of which deals with drought relief for South Australia. The information available to me indicates that the Premier of South Australia wrote to the Prime Minister requesting Commonwealth assistance and financial support for the implementation of drought relief measures in South Australia. In a reply dated 30th September the Prime Minister indicated that the Commonwealth would be prepared to reimburse the State for expenditure on agreed measures in 1970-71 in excess of Si. 5m. In arriving at the decision the Prime Minister made it clear that regard had been paid to the need to deal uniformly with the States in these matters. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator's second question relates to proposals for a nation wide debt reconstruction scheme. I have an answer to a question on notice on this subject. I will give that answer, which has been supplied by the Minister for Primary Industry, later today. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> 1 can say now, speaking generally, that there have been a number of recent proposals, including those from several State Governments, for debt adjustment schemes and debt reconstruction schemes in one form or another to help alleviate the problems confronting the rural sector of the economy generally and the wool industry in particular. As honourable senators will know, the Minister for Primary Industry is having carried out, as a matter of urgency, an examination of the overall problems confronting primary producers in Australia. The attitude of the Commonwealth towards the provision of additional finance will be considered in the light of the result of this examination. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONThe honourable senator is asking me to give a long term answer at question time in relation to a matter of policy. I think the Prime Minister made clear the current situation in Vietnam. He was speaking against the background of the latest suggestions by  President  Nixon which I understood received some commendation not only from Government supporters but also from the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- 1 direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who also is Minister for Supply. In view of the recent withdrawal of participation by the United States of America in the communications system known as Project Mallard., which was to have been a global military communications scheme involving an overall cost to the countries involved of $ 1,000m, can he say how much has been expended by Australia and the British and Canadian Governments who are partners in the project? Is Australia to be compensated for its expenditure on this costly but now abandoned scheme? </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONrt is true that the United States of America has indicated its intention to withdraw from the Mallard proposal which, without being too precise at question time, is a proposed communications system, [t is true that Australia is playing a very modest part in the scheme which, of course, has plenty of pluses for Australia because of the application of technology studies. Ft is too early at this point of time for me to indicate what will be the ultimate result. Discussions are currently going on with the other nations involved in the project as to what may be done in view of the proposed American withdrawal, particularly as some expenditure has been entered into in Australia. That expenditure will not necessarily all be lost because of the experience, practice and training gained in the applicable science. Also, studies are proceeding to ascertain whether there may be some variation as a result of the American action. As a matter of fact, I have called for an information paper on the implications of the American action. As soon as I am in a position to give a more detailed answer as to what the ultimate will be in relation to the Mallard proposal, I will most certainly put it down in the Senate. </para>

            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation been drawn to a report, stated to have been prepared by his Department and, asserted to be confidential, that thousands of Sydney home owners beneath the flight paths of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will have to consider soundproofing measures by 1976? Is this report correct? Does the report also maintain that the cost of soundproofing will have to be borne by the home owners? Is it correct that it is envisaged that there will he a 70 per cent increase in aircraft movements over Sydney by 1976? Is the Minister aware that municipal councils in and around the Sydney airport are very concerned at the effect that these reports are likely to have on property values within their areas? In view of the general cause for alarm, will he make a ministerial statement on these very vital matters, for the benefit of home owners in the area, so that it can be debated before the forthcoming Senate election? </para>

            <para>- Having read the newspaper this morning.  1  anticipated a question of this kind. I have had prepared some information which, I think, will cover the quite detailed and numerous points raised by the honourable senator. At the request - and  1  repeat at the request - of the State Planning Authority of New South Wales, the Department of Civil Aviation, New South Wales region, made available to the Authority some preliminary details of the latest noise exposure forecast for Sydney Airport. As the information made available to the State Planning Authority is still being revised by the Department of Civil Aviation in the light of the claim made by a Labor member of Parliament, which I think was supported by the noise recording figures, that when the Boeing 747 arrived at Sydney Airport it appeared to be appreciably quieter than the Boeing 707 and having regard to the fact that these figures have yet to undergo final checking, the information should be regarded as tentative at this stage and therefore one should be a little careful about relying on the information. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The limited details that were made available to the State Planning Authority were made available for two main reasons. Firstly, the Authority was most anxious to have as much information as possible on the noise exposure forecast for its discussions with the local council surrounding the Sydney Airport and, secondly, these councils and the State Planning Authority are members of the Sydney Airport Noise Abatement Committee and as such they should be privy to the information in question, although how they treat it once they get it, when it is said to be confidential, of course is a matter for their judgment. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>may I be permitted to answer the question without interruption? If the honourable senator took some trouble to examine what I am saying he would find that the Department has acted very properly and, I think, very fairly. I believe that it has an obligation - I have tried to ensure that it honours that obligation - to keep State planning authorities in all States as well informed as possible about noise exposure forecasts. It examines new information and updates old information and makes it available. Authorities and councils in the respective State capitals receive these details in preliminary form and in final form as soon as the Department can let them have it. I think it would be prudent to await the final report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise before commenting further on the soundproofing of houses in the vicinity of any major airport. I think it is in the interest of the general public that, as far as possible, any hazards that might be thought to be likely to develop should be communicated to local councils and to State planning authorities as soon as possible in order that at a later date people cannot say that they were not told of potential difficulties. </para>

            <para>- J think it is fair to say that grave concern has been expressed by many sections of the cattle industry about the closure of abattoirs. I know that feeling has run fairly high in many places, particularly among cattle men. 1 have heard people say that the Americans are directing a vindictive, campaign against Australian abattoirs. I remind the Senate that some countries have been banned completely from the meat market of the United States of America because their abattoirs did not meet the required standards and because their inspection services were not of a sufficiently high standard. </para>

              <para>- I am sure. The United States was enforcing a policy of federal registration of American abattoirs trading across the State border and, as a result of domestic pressures, was being forced to ensure that imported meat came only from the abattoirs which were of a standard at least equal to the federal requirements. The Department of Primary Industry has been faced with the never ending job of trying to meet the problems in regard to meat inspection and meat export. It has been trying to face up to them and has been doing what is humanly possible to ensure the abattoirs could continue to operate as the American market is of enormous importance to Australia, both through the market itself and its earning capacity. The honourable senator asks: What is being done to let the abattoirs know what is going on? A handbook is made available to each of the abattoirs. It contains all the information from the Department of Primary Industry as to the required standards' to be met. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. Is the Government aware of reports that PekoWallsend Ltd has discovered a massive deposit of uranium near the Narbarlek region of the Northern Territory and that the Peko find is much larger than that recently made by Queensland Mines Ltd? I wish to make it clear that I am not suggesting in any way that the reports are or are not correct, and I am not suggesting in any way that if they are correct the discovery is or is not commercial. As the Government took immediate steps to limit overseas ownership in Queensland Mines Ltd following the discovery at Narbarlek, will it now take urgent steps to find out whether heavy overseas buying of PekoWallsend shares is occurring? If this is occurring, what action does the Government propose to take to prevent overseas control of this company? What can the Government do if it finds that any company in such circumstances is not registered in the Australian Capital Territory? Will the Minister consult urgently with his colleague in order that a public announcement might be made on the issues involved? </para>

            <para>- This question falls within the responsibility of the Minister for National Development whom I represent. I think I remember reading that not long after the reported discovery of uranium at Narbarlek by the Hudson group some discovery had been made by Peko-Wallsend </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Ltd but the report did not give any idea of the volume, the length and size of the ore body or the grades. Since that time nothing has been said. Therefore I imagined that it was not quite as significant as at first thought. I do not know whether there has been any heavy buying in Peko-Wallsend Ltd shares. I imagine if there was and if the deposit were of consequence the same line of approach could be adopted as was adopted in the previous case. I shall certainly consult urgently with the responsible Minister, draw his attention to the senator's comments and suggest to him that action could be contemplated quite urgently if the facts are that there is there an ore body of great consequence. </para>

As South Africa will be entering an all white women's team in the Federation Cup tennis series to be held in Perth in December, despite the fact that South Africa has been expelled from the International Lawn Tennis Federation, will the Government take advantage of the occasion to inform the South African Government that in future the refusal of permission to any Australian of non-European origin to enter South Africa would be resented by the people of this country? </para>

              <para>- I am not certain that I gathered the full context of the question. Questions have been asked before in this place in relation to the attitude mentioned by the honourable senator. What I said a long time ago still applies, that is, that any attempt to introduce politics into sport will be disastrous for sport. As far as I am concerned, when people come here for ..the sole purpose of participating in sporting activities no other matter should intrude. I know of no prohibition on sportsmen from Australia going into South Africa and I believe that if any sportsmen or sportswomen from South Africa come here to play we should, in the spirit of sportsmanship, make them welcome and try to beat them at sport. </para>

I refer to the plight of 100 Australians who joined nights of a Norwegian charter flight company at Kuala Lumpur or Singapore, ostensibly to journey to London, but who were off-loaded at Amsterdam, Ostend or Vienna. If these passengers bookings were made with World Air Corporation and European Air Charter, both of which companies have Sydney and Melbourne offices, what action is contemplated by the Minister to protect the rights of the air travellers involved and what punitive action can be taken against the organisations which have welshed on their obligations to passengers? </para>

            <para>- This will necessarily be a long answer because it involves a matter of public concern. The honourable senator was good enough to indicate yesterday that he intended to ask a question about this matter. We were happy to cooperate because we regard it as a matter that ought to be ventilated. Wc share the honourable senator's concern over reports of recent difficulties being encountered by Australians in returning home from London on charter flights on which they had booked. The charter flights concerned did not commence in Australia but from a point outside, and it is my understanding that the passengers on the flights to which the honourable senator's question refers and who were destined for London transshipped from the charters at certain points in continental Europe. As the flights concerned commenced overseas we are unable to confirm the names of the travel agencies or organisations, including the air carriers, who could be regarded as being responsible for the alleged difficulties over the return flight bookings. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In view of charter flight problems that have come to our notice in recent weeks, and even a little earlier than that, 1 thought it desirable to issue a Press statement generally in relation to some of the problems to be considered and drawing the attention of the travelling public to the basic rules governing charter flights and cautioning prospective charter travellers to deal only with reputable and well established organisations in arranging their charter travel ft is to be hoped that the substance of the statement wilt act as a warning to persons interested in charter travel to deal only with well established and reputable organisations and to travel on charter flights direct to and from Australia which in the main are conducted by the schedule airlines. </para>
          <para>Action to intervene on behalf of the passengers mentioned by the honourable senator is not being contemplated. We discovered that such action would be inappropriate where the reported difficulty concerns air travel between points overseas. In the instances to which the honourable senator has drawn attention it is not clear whether the organisations through which the passenger bookings were made or the air carrier concerned was responsible for the alleged difficulties that arose in regard to the return charter flights. If overseas carriers or agents have, as the honourable senator mentioned, welshed on their obligations it is unlikely that Australian criminal law can be invoked against them. In the case of Australian organisations if- their activities infringe Australian criminal law in relation to obtaining money by fraud or false pretenses, they could be prosecuted. Passengers who feel they have a grievance could report the circumstances to the police to investigate whether criminal proceedings could be brought or they could bring civil proceedings to cover the loss sustained. </para>
          <para>For some few weeks now we have been preparing a pamphlet which we believe will be useful to the Australian public to inform them of the benefits, gains and dangers in charter flying. This pamphlet is held up because the International Air Transport Association conference in Honolulu is examining and has been examining the overall pattern of fares and the pattern of charter group travel. We want to bring it up to date. We will give the honourable senator a copy when we receive it and, indeed, all honourable senators. If the honourable senator would like, we will give him a copy of a policy statement which at present governs charter flying. We would all be aided if as many people as possible were to make it clear that while charter flying has benefits it also has dangers and one has to be extremely careful to operate with reputable organisations against which some recourse can be had if things do not work out. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport aware of the serious shortcomings concerning cargo handling on some Australian National Line ships and at various port terminals? At these terminals cranes and lifting equipment are inadequate to move certain loads and some types and sizes of containers built to ANL specifications. As a consequence of this, perishable cargoes have to be left behind or, if taken on board, have to be off-loaded at other than the port of final destination or alternatively must await another ship of the line which has equipment to handle the cargo. Will the Minister cause an early inquiry to be made into this situation which is causing concern to Tasmanian exporters and importers - especially of perishable commodities - whose interests are being seriously damaged and further development of some primary industries jeopardised? Further, will the Minister also indi cate the reason why developing primary industries and other industries the promotion of which demands orderly marketing cannot negotiate contracts with the ANL for the regular carriage of their products? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it a fact that the Government placed a ban on members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition attending today's rally of farmers at the front of Parliament House? Is it also a fact that 12 members of the Government parties rejected invitations from the farmers to address the meeting, mainly on the excuse that they had other commitments? Did these commitments involve watching the rally from afar, that is from the steps of Parliament House and from the window of the Australian Country Party meeting room? </para>

I ask: Is there any truth in the report which appeared in last weekend's 'Sunday Telegraph' that the new or second international airport planned for Sydney may be scrapped and that the Government may keep secret a report which has been prepared on a proposed second international airport until after the Senate election? If there is no truth in the Press report when will the Minister advise the Parliament of the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee? Further, will the Minister assure the Parliament that the contents of this report will be announced before the Senate rises for the forthcoming Senate election? </para>

            <para>- One needs a crystal ball in this business in order to try to work out the type of information which might be sought. This is a question which I gath ered on a flight back from Perth would be asked. I think it would be quite obvious to all honourable senators that Sydney will without any doubt require a second major airport. Where it will be and what role it will fill are highly complex considerations. A great deal of study is necessary before I would be in a position to recommend such a major development, which will cost many tens of millions of dollars; in fact, I think T can say that it may cost hundreds of millions of dollars. I received about <inline font-style="italic">21</inline> weeks ago the report of the interdepartmental committee which looked into Sydney's airport needs. In due course this report will go before the Government. Because of the complexity of the matter and the number of considerations involved some time must of necessity elapse before any firm decisions can be taken. Any opinions which have been expressed in the Press as to the outcome of these considerations must therefore be clearly premature and, I believe, speculative. 1 think all honourable senators would - be aware of the fact that substantia] investments are involved in major airports. Prior knowledge of the location of a new airport could lead to two things. Firstly, it could lead a tremendous over-involvement of public funds. Secondly, it could lead in some cases to some people being put to great disadvantage. I would not want to be a party to either of these things. </para>

I ask: Will the Minister consider the proposal of interested rural bodies that all capital expenditure which is required for the development of rural airfields be a charge which is underwritten by the Commonwealth Government? Does the Government now provide a proportion of the initial capital and the expenditure required to repair existing rural airfields? Further, is it a fact that the Government provides the full amount of the initial capital and the expenditure on repairing all metropolitan airfields? Is there a reason for this discrimination? </para>

            <para>- I wilt endeavour to answer this question now, and if any part of it is not answered adequately I will have an answer covering that part prepared for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> He referred to what ls called the local ownership scheme which the Government has implemented In regard to rural airfields. Thu involves the Government, for Its part, and rural communities through their councils, for their part. In many cases, literally tremendous assets have been transferred to the local councils. After the required standard has been achieved and the airport has been handed over to the local authority, the Commonwealth provides 50 per cent of the future capital expenditure and 50 per cent of the maintenance. The reason for this is to generate local interest in the airport, to make local use of it as fully effective as is possible, and to have local knowledge for airport development in the interests of the local people. It is true that major capital airports which cost tremendous sums of money are provided fully by the Government but it will be recalled that substantial revenue is recovered from domestic and international passengers towards those costs. So the matter is not totally without some balance. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government at present is studying very carefully the local ownership scheme in regard to country and rural airports. I have just returned from inspecting about 22 rural airports. It will take some time to complete our studies but we are conscious of the problems that exist and the points that have been raised by the honourable senator. </para>

Is it a fact that the Government has received a recommendation from the Royal Australian Air Force to import a number of Mirage HID jet trainers to complement its present 10 Mirage aircraft and that the new aircraft will be completely manufactured in France? Have any special arrangements yet been made with the Services to co-ordinate their purchases having regard to the requirements of the Australian aircraft manufacturing industry? If it is a fact that there is a recommendation to import additional aircraft will the Minister, before deciding on the matter, allow Australian aircraft manufacturers and the special committee which the Government has set up an opportunity to consider what should be done in respect of jet trainers for the Australian Services? </para>

          <para class="block">I rather fancy that the honourable senator's question stems from an article in this morning's 'Australian Financial Review'. The article attracted my attention because it seemed to me to be born of a statement that I made in this place as long ago as May this year to the effect that studies had been going on for some time into the possibility of obtaining an advanced trainer for prospective Mirage pilots, and that for a variety of reasons which J do not need to canvass now it was decided not to go on with the project. This morning's article and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> question are based on what is stated to be an intention now to purchase some dual Mirage aircraft for advanced training purposes. The article stated almost categorically that the aircraft will be imported, not manufactured in Australia. That statement was made against the background knowledge that wc have that the Mirage, with some exceptions in relation to various parts, ls built almost entirely in Australia under licence. </para>
          <para>I sought some information on this matter because it concerned me as it obviously concerned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> I have been informed that some training for the Mirage aircraft has been done on the Winjeel, the Macchi, the Sabre, the Mirage HID, which is a dual aircraft, and the Mirage III O which is a single seater aircraft. But, for  a  variety of reasons, the Sabre has been eliminated and the Air Force; in fact, has been using the dual Mirage as an advanced trainer. </para>
          <para>To come to the real issues in the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> I can say that consideration is being given to the acquisition of a small number of additional Mirage HID aircraft. At the present time it is not certain whether any additional aircraft will be ordered - this is only a project or in concept - pending assessment of the utilisation of the existing ones. So, the matter is only under consideration in the first place. Then, having gone, past that stage of consideration, if it is decided that the Air Force needs additional dual Mirages for training purposes, or in the event of additional aircraft being required, consideration will be given to local manufacture. The proportion of local content would depend, as it does in all such cases, on the number of aircraft to be bought. It is possible that a small number of additional dual Mirages could be built on the same basis as the 10 that we are using at present. The proportion of local content in those aircraft is substantially lower than that in the single seat aircraft because of certain things in relation to the fuselage. </para>
          <para>So, the answer to the honourable senator's question is that no decision has been taken yet - the Air Force is examining whether it needs any additional dual Mirages for advanced trainer purposes - and, if such a decision was taken, at that point of time a decision would have to be taken on whether we could use our own facilities for that purpose. If and when we come to that issue, I have some pretty definite and firm views on it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Do I take it from his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald's</inline> question, namely, that there is no doubt that Sydney requires a second airport, that his Department does not intend to develop a parallel runway system at the Kingsford-Smith airport in order to cope with the expected heavily increased aircraft movement requirements in Sydney? So that members of the public who are vitally concerned about the matter can be thoroughly Informed on all aspects of what is happening in this area of aviation administration, will the Minister present to the Parliament a ministerial statement on the matter before the Senate elections so that the subject can be debated here? </para>

            <para>-I think I am correct in saying that some years ago - I understand in about 1964 or 1965 - the previous Minister for Civil Aviation appeared on television, made a public statement and displayed diagrams showing the whole pattern of a proposed second runway at the Kingsford-Smith airport which would cope with extra traffic and which, it was thought, could be necessary before the building of a second major airport. I believe that this was made public knowledge. I am informed that the Public Works Committee of the New South Wales Parliament also studied the matter and made it public. I am seeking to have that information made available to me as soon as possible in order that I may satisfy myself as to the first part of the honourable senator's question, which is also  a  query of mine. In regard to the making of a public statement that could be debated, I will give consideration to that, but I cannot really feel in my own heart that it is necessary. </para>

Is it a fact that individuals who, within the past 18 months have paid line installation costs will be refunded the amount paid? Are there instances in which considerable sums were paid by primary producers? Will the Minister see that the Postmaster-General's Department notifies contributors personally of this very generous measure proposed by the Federal Government and also see that refunds are paid promptly? </para>

            <para>- We treat as worthwhile any suggestion that may lead to an improvement in flying training or air safety. To that extent I am indebted to the honourable senator. I know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robey,</inline> having met him at the Bankstown air pageant only about 4 weeks ago. Although we were together for quite a long time he did not mention to me the matter raised by the honourable senator. Nonetheless, I will obtain a copy of 'Aviation News' and read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robey's</inline> comments. It is very likely that there will be a variation in the approach of individuals to flying training, as anybody who has been trained to fly would understand. Each flying instructor has his own particular way of instructing people. However, the basic method and the basic requirements remain unchanged. I do not know of any variations. I do know that Department of Civil Aviation examiners are expected to be particularly strict and uniform and to ensure that standards are maintained everywhere. The honourable senators suggestion is worthwhile and I will take it up. Later I will discuss with the honourable senator what 1 find out about this matter. </para>

            <para>No. Overseas studies indicate that nuclear power stations with capacities of many thousands of megawatts would be necessary to obtain both cheap water and power. In addition there are very considerable technical problems to be solved before dual purpose nuclear desalination plants of such sizes become practicable. This may occur towards the end of the century. I would add that nuclear units of such a size could not be fitted conveniently at present into any of the Australian electricity systems. </para>

This list contained the names of 66 officers in Port Moresby. A revised list is now being drawn up by the Administrator.

          <para>When the authorisations by the Administrator were issued in 1968 the Administrator stated that he considered that: authorised officers will be able to handle the bulk of Press inquiries but matters of major importance including policy issues or controversial issues should be referred to the Administrator or one of the Assistant Administrators or the official spokesman at Administration Headquarters </para>
          <para>Officers will have to use their own discretion in deciding if a matter falls into this category. </para>
          <para>Matters of policy include questions concerning the budget, major moves on political developments, major organisational changes in the Administration or issues where major decisions are pending. Where a policy has been announced authorised officers are permitted to supply information at their own discretion. It is emphasised that the Administrator wants the public to be as well informed as possible about the objectives, policy achievements and view points of the Government. Within the bounds of common sense as much help as possible should be given to Press representatives by those authorised to deal with them'. </para>
          <para>An instruction issued by the Administrator last month emphasised the increased responsibility of Ministerial and Assistant Ministerial Members in the making of public statements. This was in line with the increase in responsibility of Ministerial office holders since the previous circular was issued. The Administrator stated that this did not alter the obligation of authorised officers of the Administration to provide factual information in response to Press inquiries. </para>

It should be appreciated, however, that commencement of any Commonwealth office construction in Adelaide would be subject to other Commonwealth priorities and the availability of funds for capital works. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: (1)The Air Navigation Regulations stipulate a mandatory requirement for the carriage of hostesses on aircraft operated on regular public transport service - the number varying according to seating configuration. This requirement is in the interests of the safety of passengers and is not likely to be waived. For F27's the requirement is two hostesses, for Electras and DC9 three hostesses and for Boeing 727 four hostesses. As a matter of operating procedure, both airlines carry four hostesses on the DC9 and four or five hostesses on the Boeing 727 depending on loading andtime of operation. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The expenses incurred by the airlines in respect of individual operating costs are of a confidential business nature. However, I am in a position to inform the Senate that the total amount expended by each airline in respect of expenses relating directly to the employment of hostesses is of the order of two million dollars. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The total cost to each airline in respect of provision of meals is of the order of $1.25 million to$1. 5 million. The sale of liquor on aircraft is at commercial prices and there would be no cost saving by the abolition of this service. Indeed, the reverse would be the case. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>As mentioned in the answer to question 1, the law requires carriage of hostesses in the interests of the passengers and there is no prospect that the number could be reduced to 1 on the types of aircraft currently operated by the major airlines. As an indication to the Senate, I would say that if all meals were eliminated on air services involving a stage length of under 2 hours, a fare saving of approximately 1 per cent could be effected. If meals on all air services were abolished, and the honourable senators will quickly realise that this would involve considerable hardship on passengers to New Guinea, Darwin and Perth, then the order of the possible fare saving would be one and a half to two per cent. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply: 1 am unable to give the assurance sought by the honourable senator because it would be wasteful to supply the three regional directories to all subscribers in Tasmania when the great majority have a need only for the directory covering the region in which they are located. If a subscriber has a need for a directory covering another region in Tasmania it will be supplied on request without charge. Subscribers who make only an occasional call to another region will be able to obtain wanted numbers from the Department's Telephone Numbers Centre without charge. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONOn 19th August <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> asked the following question: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. As continuing drought in Queensland and other States is causing catastrophic circumstances for rural producers and rurally based businessmen, will the Federal Government give immediate consideration to establishing a small drought alleviation committee composed of senior officers of the Department of Primary Industry and the Treasury to investigate conditions in areas where drought is occurring and prepare a prompt report as to ways in which the Federal Government may offer effective aid to the States where drought is occurring and also to advise the Government as to the immediate legislative and financial measures which require introduction by parliaments to avoid the possible bankruptcy of individuals or the loss of property which may be forced on individuals - both producers and businessmen - due to economic circumstances which are beyond their personal control? </para>
      </quote>
      <para>At that time I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> of the action already taken by the Government to assist States suffering from drought and that I would refer his proposal for a drought alleviation committee to the Minister for Primary Industry. I have now received advice from the Minister in the following terms: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>The Australian Agricultural Council at its meeting last June, considered the question of drought in Australia and established a Consultative Committee on Drought to examine and report on problems involving inter-State, multi-State or Commonwealth-State aspects, e.g. drought relief drought rehabilitation and drought mitigation. The Committee will also consider the question of encouragement of forms of land use and farm management practices that take account of  thepermanent  risk of drought, as well as other matters relevant to combatting drought or ameliorating its effects on rural industries. </para>
        <para>The Consultative Committee comprises representatives of all Stale Departments of Agriculture and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries together with representatives of CSIRO, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Departments of the Interior, Treasury and Primary Industry. It will include representatives of other Commonwealth and State Authorities as necessary. </para>
        <para>The initial meeting of the Consultative Committee was held in Sydney on 15 September. The Committee reviewed the situation in the States the procedures followed in making drought declarations and the wide range of relief measures that are extendedto graziers and farmers affected by drought. Other matters discussed related to restocking after drought and the encouragement of fodder and water conservation. </para>
        <para>The Consultative Committee on Drought will continue its work and is to meet again later this year. It will be reporting to the next meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council early in 1971. </para>

            <para>- I would like to make a comment on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has just said. As late as last week I looked at the business paper myself and suggested to my staff that something should be done about the number of questions on the notice paper, one or two of which are within my own responsibility. I will certainly take this matter up and I know that other Ministers will also do this so that wecan get answers to as many questions as possible without delay. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of these Bills is to increase the 25 per cent rate of sales tax to 27½ per cent and so give effect to the sales tax increases announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> in the Budget Speech. The 9 amending Bills are necessary because the sales tax is imposed by 9 separate Acts to meet the requirement of the Constitution that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with one subject of taxation only. That is the point about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was concerned. The goods affected by the increase are those listed in the Second and Fifth Schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Among the principal classes of goods affected are motor cars such as sedans and station wagons which are specified in the Fifth Schedule. The increase will not apply to motor cycles, motor buses or other commercial type vehicles such as utilities, panel vans and trucks which are currently taxed at the general rate of 15 per cent. </para>
          <para>The Second Schedule embraces a fairly wide range of goods. The more important of these are radio and television receivers and record players; toilet and beauty preparations and shaving requisites; cameras, films and photographs; watches; jewellery and furs. A comprehensive statement listing the goods which are to be taxed at 27* per cent is being circulated for the information of honourable senators. The present rate of 2* per cent applicable to household furniture and appliances remains unaltered. So also does the general rate of 15 per cent which applies to a broad field of goods not specified in any of the sales tax schedules. The increase in rate is expected to yield additional revenue amounting to $29m in a full year. To avoid disruption of trading in goods affected by changes in sales tax rates, it has long been the practice for such changes to take effect from the day following their introduction into Parliament. Accordingly, these Bills have effect from 19th August 1970. I commend the Bills to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1967. Honourable senators will see from the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated that the Bill proposes amendments to the First Schedule to the Act which sets out the categories of goods that are exempt from sales tax. Two new exemptions which are proposed will exempt Australian-made motor vehicles for use by members of the armed forces of Canada and New Zealand stationed in Australia. The circumstances in which exemption will be allowable are to be prescribed by regulation, the intention being that they will parallel those in which exemption is currently available to United States and British servicemen. In conformity with Australia's obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement with the United States, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act was amended in 1963 to enable United States servicemen stationed in Australia to purchase Australian-made vehicles free of sales tax. A similar exemption was subsequently provided in favour of British servicemen. The amendment now proposed will extend the exemptions to vehicles for Canadian and New Zealand servicemen. Comparable concessions are enjoyed by Australian servicemen stationed in those countries. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that the specific exemption of goods for use by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Ltd - an airline no longer operating - and Qantas Airways Ltd be removed with effect from 20th August 1970. Other provisions of the sales tax law exempt such items of equipment as aircraft and aircraft parts, servicing equipment and tractors for towing aircraft. But in respect of goods not so exempted, it is considered that Qantas Airways Ltd should be in the same position as other airlines. Qantas already is liable to Commonwealth taxes other than sales tax. The Bill includes a provision to exempt goods for use, and not for sale, by the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. The new exemption is supplementary to the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Act 1970 which sets up the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. This exemption is to commence on the date on which the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Act 1970 will, by proclamation, come into operation. The remaining provisions are of a drafting nature designed to restore certain exemptions related to provisions in the Customs Act. The exemptions were inadvertently Tendered ineffective by amendments to the Customs Act that came into operation on 1st October 1969. It ls proposed that these sales tax amendments should be deemed to have been in operation since that date. T commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

              <para>- I think this is a wise procedure because these Bills are purely machinery matters. The purpose of the 5 measures is to extend for 6 months the bounty which operates until 30th June this year. In 1968 it became evident that the situation with regard to the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers and cellulose acetate flake had changed and it was considered wise to refer the manufacture of these products to the Tariff Board to ascertain whether there should be any change in the current tariff on these substances. Debate went on for some time in another place with regard to the bounties which should be paid on these substances, but it seems to me that this is not the time to examine the situation which should obtain. We should be waiting until the Tariff Board report has been considered by the Government and is presented to us for our consideration. I understand that the Tariff Board, after a fairly lengthy period - the delay being due probably to lack of staff to examine proposals such as these - has made a report on each of these 5 bounty propositions and the reports are at present in the hands of the Government. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It seems to me that at mis stage what we should do is to extend the operation of the present bounties until the reports have been presented to Parliament. The Bills propose that the bounties should not continue for any longer period than is necessary to enable the reports to be brought for consideration of Parliament, at which time the bounties would be varied as and if necessary. I think the only criticism that I can make is that the time which has elapsed between the reference of these matters to the Tariff Board and the presentation of the reports to the Government has been too long. In view of the manpower available to the Tariff Board to examine the need for a change in the level of bounties brought about by variations in the manufacture of various commodities, I suggest that too many matters are referred to the Board for its consideration. I suggest that these reports should have been presented much earlier. However, the Opposition has no objection to a continuation of the bounty at its present level on the 5 items referred to in these Bills. W,e, shall not oppose the measures. We consider that the bounties should continue until the reports have been presented to the Parliament, at which time we can deal with the matters in detail and consider whether, we are prepared to accept the recommendations or whether we think they should be varied. We do not oppose the Bills. </para>

            <para>- In reply - Very briefly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilkinson</inline> has said, we are dealing here with 5 Bills which really have been joined together for the purpose of discussion and debate. These measures are the Urea Bounty Bill 1970, the Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty Bill 1970, the Sulphuric Acid Bounty Bill 1970, the Pyrites Bounty Bill 1970 and the Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty Bill 1970. The first 4 of these measures are intimately associated with each other because they are in the manufactured fertiliser field. As such I think the general agreement of the Senate would be forthcoming that Australian fertiliser production is an essential item of Australian primary production and needs to be sponsored and fostered. In brief one ought to make one or two comments, although the Bills are agreed to by the Opposition. The Urea Bounty Act was extended to June 1970 in the 1969 Budget session. The Government thought that the Tariff Board report would be received during that extended period. But the report was not received until the end of June 1970. The Department of Trade and Industry advises that the recommendations in the report will be submitted to Cabinet in time to know of the Government's decision prior to 31st December 1970. The estimated cost of the urea bounty from 1st July 1970 to 31st December 1970 is $250,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A similar situation applies in regard to the Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty Bill. The estimated cost of the bounty for that period is $500,000. To the Sulphuric Acid Bounty Bill a similar situtation applies and the estimated cost of the bounty for that period is $225,000. As all honourable senators will be well aware, pyrites is an essential item in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. We have had some problems in Australia with pyrites disposal. A similar situation exists in relation to the Pyrites Bounty Bill and the estimated cost of the bounty in that case is $186,000. The Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty Bill is to some extent not in quite the same situation. It is associated with some of the chemicals concerned but not with the fertiliser industries. But the general principles of timing and the problems that have been posed are common to all Bills without exception. In this case the estimated cost of the bounty for the period is $112,000. I think those explanations should satisfy the Senate and I am content, therefore, to let the matter rest. </para>

        <para class="block">Act was extended to 30th June 1970 In the 1969 Budget session in anticipation of the Government receiving the Tariff Board's report during the extended period.

The Department of Trade and Industry will advise the Government on the recommendations contained in the report. Its advice will be submitted to Cabinet in sufficient time to enable the Government to make an announcement of its intentions prior to 31st December 1970. On 5th July 1970 the Government announced its intention to extend the Act. AsI said earlier, the estimated cost of the bounty between 1st July 1970 and 3 1st December 1970 is $112,000. Essentially the same set of circumstances apply as those 1 mentioned in my remarks earlier.
