            <para>- I wish to commence by saying that my motion is not submitted with any idea of taking up Government time. A little while ago, on the motion for the adjournment, a statement was made in the Senate one evening by Senators Fairbairn and Bakhap, with regard to the trouble on the wharfs. I resented most hotly the statement made by those honorable senators, and per haps with more warmth than the occasion demanded. The manner in which I spoke on that evening was due to the fact that I had spent several hours in close conference with the Associated Federal Secretaries of the Labour organizations of Australia, and, although we had not been discussing industrial mattera specially, I came away from the interview with them with a fair amount of anxiety for the future peaceful relations of industries in Australia. On that evening, when both Senators Fairbairn and Bakhap seemed to take the usual old Tory stand that unionists were curs, and hunted in packs, I, perhaps, went a little too far in my expressions of disapproval of their statements. </para>

            <para>- I put that down to the feeling which one has when he knows how nearly the peaceful running of our various organizations is to disruption, which, I venture to say, is deplored alike by unionists and nonunionists, and by employers and employees. It is because of that that. I am moving the adjournment of the Senate this morning. After the remarks made on the occasion to which I refer, I was interviewed by some people better informed as to the position of affairs on the wharfs than I had been. They gave me some facts regarding the relationship between unionists and the so-called loyalists. The statements made to me I promised to bring before the Senate that afternoon. I was prevented from doing so owing to the Senate rising at 4 o&#39;clock, in accordance with the Standing Orders. I called for a division in the endeavour to induce honorable senators to wait for a few minutes longer to hear what I had to say, but, as I was the only senator calling for a division, there was no division. Last night I again intended to bring this matter forward to save the time of the Senate, but, as&#39; we already had experience of one call for a quorum when the Senate was not counted out only by the narrowest margin, I thought it better to bring the matter up in this way. </para>

        <para>The waterside unionists have entered into an agreement with the authorities to work amicably with the so-called loyalists. . They say that they are carrying out their agreement strictly to the letter, and that the occurrence referred to by Senators Bakhap and Fairbairn was not caused by  unionists, and did not take place on the wharf. I do not wish to imply that the honorable senators to whom I refer did not speak with a conviction that they were correct in all that they said. The unionists say that the occurrence tookplace in the railway yard; A responsible member of the Waterside Workers &#34;Union informed me that had any qf the members of that union been responsible for what occurred, they would have been immediately handed over to the police, because the members of the union are waiting each morning for employment, &#39; and are quite well known to the other side. Had the disturbance, been caused by any of the union members, their names would immediately have  been given to the police, and the offenders would have been brought to justice. </para>

            <para>- Whether I do or not, I am now making a statement of facts concerning them. These men claim that there is one mau in particular who is the cause of the discord and unrest, and will possibly lead to one of those industrial disturbances which all will regret unless something is done to prevent &#39; him stirring up strife between the parties. The person to whom I refer is G. V. Baker, the secretary of one of the loyalist sections working on the wharfs, and the man from whom, I assume, Senators Bakhap and Fairbairn obtained the information upon which they based their statements. </para>

        <para>Let me point to one of the conditions that has obtained on the wharfs,, though I do not say it exists at the present moment. This .particular man is working for the shipping companies, and time after time &#39;has managed to have his section employed when good jobs have been available, because he has had beforehand information as to the ships coming in, so that his men might be ready for them. Although the compact for a fair deal is loyally carried out&#39; by the unionists, a fair deal has not been given to&#39; them. I bring this- matter under the notice of the Government, because there is considerable industrial unrest due to the belief of. the unionists, who are sticking manfully to their agreement to work in harmony on the wharfs, that they are not getting a fair deal, and that the small minority of 60-called loyalists are getting all the  plums  of the jobs. This man Baker does not work. He manages to live on the work of others; he cultivates and prospers by disputes. It is my duty to call attention to the imminent danger of peace upon the wharfs being broken because of the conduct of an individual whose character may be ascertained ifthe Government care to peruse the reports of the detective who investigated  the business to which I have just referred. </para>

The fact that he was  president  of this union, of course, made industrial trouble impossible; but, nowadays, at any rate, there will continue to be industrial unrest until the workers get all they earn. While we are not living in a state of perfection it is the duty of the Government to do all in their power to save this country from industrial outbreaks engineered by any one individual; and, if I am in a position to bring under public notice circumstances the investigation of which will prove my accusation, that the man chiefly responsible is suspect, then I feel that I am doing no more than my duty. </para>

            <para>- It should not be lost sight of that, at the most, there are but a couple ofhundred of these socalled loyalists, while there are at least a couple of thousand genuine unionists who have undertaken to maintain the peace, and who are endeavouring to honour their word in very difficult circumstances. If the minority are to secure the pickings of the work on the water frontage, it is but natural that industrial disturbances will break out afresh. We all deplore them, but they are bound to occur. The so-called loyalists are getting&#39; inside information, and are able to pick and choose the best of the work. The choice jobs&#39; are going to the few, while the worst are being foisted upon the many. If the Government do not consider that cause for bitterness of sufficient importance to engage their attention, then I certainly do. </para>

          <para>. - No one regrets more than I do the outbreak of trouble and disputes upon the wharfs. The Government have done their best to adjust those difficulties, and have succeeded in securing a clear-cut and definite agreement. It is never an easy matter to determine the merits or demerits of an industrial struggle. In this instance, however, the Government have been actively engaged in mediation, and have secured- an agreement. We have been hopeful that the spirit of that agreement would be observed by all parties concerned. I may say that I have the agreement before me, with signatures attached thereto. It provides for preference to the original loyalists, who were recognised as being in a different position from those who came in later. Preference is to be given up to the earning of what is deemed a living wage, namely, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 12s. 6d. per week, after which all conditions are to be equal. Neither the great body of unionists nor the mass of the loyalists are responsible for what individual anarchists in their ranks may seek to. do. Yet there is responsibility on all parties to endeavour to maintain industrial peace. There is responsibility upon all public men. Legislators should be especially careful not to make  statements of a serious nature which they may not be able to verify in every respect. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will supply me with all the particulars regarding matters mentioned to-day, I promise that the Government will investigate them. It should be to the interest of all to avoid scenes such as have recently occurred. We should neither say nor do anything likely to disturb industrial harmony. With respect to the personal character of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> I am not prepared to enter upon a discussion. It is not the duty of the Government to investigate the private life of any individual unless therein he is deliberately setting up discord where harmony should prevail. Where there have been distinct abuses of the agreement the Government will be prepared to institute inquiries, and I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will lay before me the whole of the facts in his possession. </para>

            <para>- I always endeavour to look facts fairly in the face. Whoever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> is, or whatever may be his character, I am bound to state that he will be dealt with very unfairly if the Government agree to institute an investigation into his private life incompatible with the position he occupies at present. This questioning of a man&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> should be very carefully considered. Among honorable senators who is there that would care to have the whole of his private life held up to the gaze of a critical public? Is there no baseness that we would hide? Is there no wrong that . we would have the public remain in ignorance of ? Why, then, should this man be pilloried on the assumption that he came here to tell me something regarding disturbances on the wharfs? . To the best&#39; of my knowledge I have never seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker.</inline> If he has been among those who have visited honorable senators, and have called attention to unpleasantness occurring on the wharfs, I frankly state that I am unable to distinguish him. I do not recall him by name, and I would be unable to place the man. Some of the loyalist workers have &#39;been assaulted while endeavouring to carry on their duties. One man - and I cannot even tell his name at this moment - showed me, in the Queen&#39;s Hall, his wrist which had been permanently injured by an attack on the part of some of the waterside workers. He had to remain in hospital for several weeks, while his wife and children were compelled to fend for themselves. Without making reference to the dispute itself, and with no shirking of responsibility on my own part, I feel inclined to accuse both the Federal and Victorian State Governments, as well as the employers&#39; associations, and the community generally, of having failed to recognise the merits of the services rendered by these loyalists a couple of years ago. I believe they have been treated in such a way as to militate seriously against any future exhibition of loyalty by volunteer workers in a great national emergency. They have been relegated to the national scrap heap. The system under which they were being given employment has been favorably commented upon by a Commissioner, whose report the Government have studiously withheld. </para>

            <para>- The Government. It appears that the new system under which these men were ostensibly to be granted a preference has been provocative of nothing but unpleasantness and personal danger to them. So much has this been the case that for weeks past honorable senators have been besieged by the loyalist workers, who find their present position an impossible one, and who are therefore asking the Government to grant them some monetary compensation to enable them to relinquish their pursuit of an objective which is impossible of at- . tainment, namely, fraternal association with the unionist members of the Waterside Workers . I have advised them to seek pecuniary recognition of the fact that they rendered valuable service to the community in a time of special stress and&#39; danger. I am sorry that I had to tender them that advice, but I was obliged to do so, because I realized that the Governments, both State and Federal, have not stood behind them with the steadfastness which they should have exhibited.  Under cover of this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Gardiner</inline> has indulged in the hope that the workers will yet be able to secure the benefit of all that they produce. May I point out <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> him that our present system of society will enable any association of workers, if it possesses proper organizing capacity, to secure all that its members produce. What is there to prevent any union, big or small, from banding its members together co-operatively, from becoming a producing association, and thus securing for themselves the benefit of all that they produce? There is only one thing needed, namely, organizing capacity, and it is well for us to recognise that this is about the scarcest factor in any civilized community. Unless, any corporation possesses at its head organizing capacity of the finest quality, success cannot be achieved. Otherwise, what is there to prevent the seamen owning all the ships trading round, our coast, or the Australian,  Workers  Union owning all the sheep stations of Australia, or the coal miners owning all. our coal mines? There is absolutely nothing but their lack of economic perception along proper  lines, and the absence of organizing capacity. During the recent seamen&#39;s strike the working men lost &#163;3,000,000 in wages. Where is there any capitalistic combination which possesses such a fund? The company law of any State will favour the registration of any body of workers which has for its objective the securing to its members of the whole produce of their labours.  All the aims which are now being prosecuted with such unnecessary acridity are quite possible of achievement by the workers of Australia in present circumstances. </para>

The men who go on strike for three and four months at a time, and who consume the stored up. resources of the unionists, are not the thrifty workers of Australia. It is the depositors in our Savings Banks who can be grouped in that category. There is room in this country for Labour leaders who will decline to pander to halfeducated mobs, and who will take up the role of instructors by telling the workers how easy it is for them to secure for themselves the full product of their labours if they will only develop the necessary organizing capacity. </para>

            <para>- I intend it to be rough. The boilermakers should have been working their own ships ten or eleven years ago. But the truth is that they have, not what is vulgarly called &#34; the guts &#34; to do it. I have no hesitation in saying, that wise Labour leaders would, long ago, in perfect peace with the rest of society in Australia, have secured a large number of those objectives which are being pursued with so much bitterness to-day; but I wish to get back to the question under cover of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has moved the adjournment of the Senate. My duty is to see that justice is done to all sections of the community, to insure that law shall be maintained and order preserved. Anarchy is no good to anybody. If we are to have the &#34; order of the boot&#39;,&#34; the law of brute force, substituted for what is our heritage  - and for which generations of our forefathers fought - we are in very bad case indeed. Any Government which will not use the whole of the community forces at their disposal in order to maintain the citizen rights of individuals is unworthy of the&#39; name. I can &#39; assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> who is laughing, that I feel, very strongly upon this matter. I believe that these loyalist workers have not been supported either by the Government, or by associations of employers, or by the community, in the way that they should have been supported. I say to honorable senators opposite, who probably regard me as one who foments disorder, that I care . not a snap of the fingers either for capitalists, middlemen, or banks, or any other institution. I am a man who can spend &#163;5 a day if necessary, and, like Franklin, can live, when circumstances demand it, &#34;upon 6d. a day. I claim to be as independent a representative of the people in this Chamber as they are ever likely to send here. I have spoken on behalf of the whole community, and &#39; of all those hard-working and sensible units which compose it, and I hope that, in the future, they will be allowed to pursue their avocations peaceably in this free country. </para>

          <para>. - In speaking to this motion the Leader of the Opposition has foreshadowed trouble in the maritime trade unless caution is exercised. May I point out that the lesson which he seeks to- inculcate inothers, needs to be taken as much to heart by himself, because he and those who are associated with him have infinitely more influence with the people who are likely to feel aggrieved than have any other persons either in this Parliament or outside of it? If trouble is likely to arise it naturally follows that somebody must have a grievance. In this connexion I would remind this Chamber of the ceaseless effort which preceded the establishment in this country of a tribunal for the settlement of industrial grievances. There are men in this Senate who made many more sacrifices to bring the Arbitration Court into existence than have been made by those who are now living under its  &#230;gis.  It is rather a sad commentary upon the common sense and enlightenment of the trade unionists of this country for their spokesman to declare that, despite this tri.bunal which has been created for the express purpose of settling industrial disputes, industrial strife will unquestionably arise. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that those who are threatening trouble, and even those who are predicting it, are taking a long stride towards levelling the Arbitration Court -which they profess to uphold, to the dust. That tribunal was established by no simple process. . It did not materialize  like the manna of old, or the mushrooms which spring in the morning dew. It was obtained only after ceaseless effort on the part of that grand old battalion of Labourites who preceded us. It was established without the help of the wharf labourers. The very men upon whose behalf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has sought to enlist sympathy, were not such staunch labourites in the past. I am a living witness to the fact that they &#34; scabbed &#34; on me, and took my job in 1S90, when I was battling hard for labour principles and fair conditions. They &#34; scabbed &#34; on me again when I was a seaman in 1893. Yet these men now have the temerity to pose as the champions and crusaders of a real, live, and genuine labour policy. I tell them that they cannot afford to throw stones.&#39; They are living in a mightydomed glass house at the present time. We have secured for them a tribunal for the settlement of industrial troubles towards the building of which they &#39; never contributed a single brick, and mow they claim -to be the <inline font-style="italic">creina</inline><inline font-style="italic">de la</inline><inline font-style="italic">creme</inline> of the Labour movement. </para>

        <para>The time was when we lived under a. competitive system, and&#34; when men&#39;s wages and conditions were not regulated by a Judge Higgins, whose awards have been trampled into the dust. The time was when: their wages and industrial conditions were regulated by a tyrannical system of competition. The time was when the galling necessities of the worker dictated his wages, and not the rule of reason and social equity* Public opinion has been educated up to the standard of getting arbitration, and, having secured it, I say to the wharf labourers of this country, that they are standing in their own light if they fail to avail themselves of that tribunal. They are- simply playing the part of a prospective tyrant by trampling under foot the fruit of the successful efforts made by genuine Labourites in the years gone by.  </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline>name has been mentioned during the course of this debate, and rightly so. In his presence, even though  by doing so I shall violate the rules of propriety, I am glad to bear witness to the fact that, under his able leadership, the seamen on the Australian coast were led from almost a condition of. industrial bondage to conditions which have never been equalled in any other country in the world, npt even iis America. His&#39; record speaks for -itself. Under the able guidance of men of the Guthrie type the position of our Australian seamen was improved in a way which has far exceeded any improvementgained by them under the leadership of men of the Walsh type. </para>
        <para>I hold firmly the view that bodies of labour which unload their services or their products on the community, or, as in the case of the seamen, cause freights to be increased by 10 per cent., are directly responsible for saddling the people with an increased burden. The community in general are paying the increased cost, and I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> if he does not admit that 90 per cent, of the workers of this country will have to bear the extra cost arising out of the increased rates paid to the seamen ? Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;</inline> go to the mining districts of Kalgoorlie or of North Queensland, or to the wheat-growing areas, and tell the workers engaged in the industries there that they should, have an increase in their wages ? He knows that the inevitable result of such an increase would be that those industries would be paralyzed, or would cease to exist. I could take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to Kalgoorlie, where -30,000 people are employed, and if their wages were increased as &#39; a result of his agitation, the closing down of the mines would be inevitable. Yet these people, who cannot receive increased wages, have to bear the cost of the increased rates granted to seamen and maritime workers. The products of our wheat, mining, and other industries have to be placed on the markets of the world, and such industries have to bear the burden of a forced increase in other industries, which are fostered under unfair conditions. The position in regard to coal produced in New South Wales is somewhat similar, as practically 75 per cent, of the output is consumed in Australia, and increases granted in that industry are passed on to the Australian people. But, if the cost of producing a bushel of wheat is increased, the increase cannot be passed on. Our wheat has to be. sold in the markets of the world, and competes with grain produced with black, brown, and brindle labour. u The increase recently granted to seamen is an indication of how the cost is passed on to the people, many of whom can. ill-afford to&#39; bear it. This is making progress in a circle; that is, ending where you began. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> think that the miners in Kalgoorlie, North Queensland, and Broken Hill are receiving the wages they were getting years ago? When I was working on the coast, twenty-five years ago, I was receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> per month, but that rate, as a result of the efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and others, was raised to &#163;14 per month, and at a time when those who are now supposed to be leaders of the Labour movement &#34; scabbed &#34; on me. Wages at that time were raised <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> rational, means, and not by force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and his followers are paving a way for the time when history will repeat itself. It is our duty to protect the workers of this country, and we must stand by that shield of defence created by the efforts of the champions of Labour in the past. It is no use making progress in a circle; we want to make progress in a straight line. We must go straight ahead, and workers should not receive increases at the expense of their comrades. What right has a seaman, for instance, to refer to a Kalgoorlie miner as a comrade? Comrade, be  damned ! It almost makes my .blood boil when the term is used. The increases granted to some industrialists have to be paid by the unfortunate wives and children of other workers. The seamen are the only persons likely to benefit by the recent increase in wages. It is time we made an even deal all round. If twenty <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Gardiners,  or twenty Judge  Higginses  went to Kalgoorlie I would defy them to formulate a scheme to keep the present number of men employed at increased wages. The same can be said of our wheat industry, in which men and women - heroic women - are doing their work under the most arduous conditions. The same can be said of our timber, base metal, dairying, and other industries. Many of our rural workers are leading the life of martyrs. Has any consideration ever been given to them ? Many of them are working with rags on their backs, with scanty supplies of food, and very few opportunities of educating their children. I am anxious to see progress made in a straight line, and when increases are granted in one direction we must see that we do not impose heavy burdens in other directions. While this country lives largely on the returns from a product that has to be hawked to&#39; the different markets of the world, we must see that those engaged in raising that product are given a * fair deal. To grant concessions to one section of the community at the expense of another section is not progress. It may be progress of a hybrid form which cannot be defended or justified for a moment. I hope that wiser counsels will prevail, and that these men will uphold arbitration and realize that they had a friend in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. I was once brought into contact with men in Kalgoorlie - when a .Labour Government was in power - when not more than five out of 500 or even 1,000 believed in what I said. But I explained the true position, with the result that a resolution was unanimously passed in my favour. The time has arrived in this country for telling the multitudes of the workers that they have their duties and responsibilities as &#39;well as their rights. The person in the private relationship of men who is respected is not the hypocritical friend who tells you that he has been thinking of you for a long time, and that there is nothing wrong with you, but the one who comes to you and tells you where you are wrong. The man who comes to you, in need or otherwise, and tells you of your faults as well as your virtues is a true friend, the steadfast friend, and one in whom confidence should be placed, and the same applies as true in social affairs. The time has arrived for us to cease fomenting strife. I stand by the workers - never mind what I said about scabs and blacklegs - and if we are to progress we cannot do it by glaring at each other and grappling at each other&#39;s throats, but only by pulling together, by having a true feeling for each other&#39;s welfare, and so studying the interests of the whole community. </para>

            <para>- That is the opinion of most Labour men, but, unfortunately, they are led by a few who have instituted a reign of terror in the ranks of unionism. Many of the men are afraid of their leaders. On the other hand, there are workers who are in trouble because the Government and other employers have not stuck to them as promised. &#34;What would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> have thought if I had not brought this matter forward when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and I were approached by certain loyalist workers? What would he have thought if I had not reported that those men had been assaulted by certain unionists belonging to the Waterside. Workers organization? Notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, I &#39;believe that the men who were responsible for the assault were members of the union, and were probably representatives of the Industrial Workers of the World. At the time when the loyalists came to the assistance of the Government we were at war. We had an Arbitration Court for settling industrial disputes, but notwithstanding that, and the fact that the nation was at war, the men went on strike and delayed the despatch of a hospital ship. The loyalist workers then came forward to assist the Government, and the Government promised that they would be cared for. Apparently,, the Government have been lukewarm in this matter, and have not assisted the men as promised. I realize that it is very difficult for two sections of workers, antagonistic to each other, to work together, but that does not relieve the Government of the responsibility of honouring their promise to protect these men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has referred to me as an old Tory, and if a Tory is one who believes in seeing, that wrongs are righted, I hope that I shall be a Tory for the rest of my life. I have also been characterized as a- Socialist. </para>

            <para>- In the words of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Beni I can describe myself as a safe Socialist. I am sure that every honorable senator in this Chamber is anxious to see justice done to these men&#39;, and it is a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> brought forward such a charge against the leader of the loyalists, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker..</inline> I do not think I saw him, although he may have been there. It is a pity to bring up this matter unless there is proof that the man has done wrong. Sinners may be&#62; found in every body of men. I recollect that a Labour leader in an indiscreet moment, on ono occasion said to fellow unionists, &#34; Make it a hell upon earth for any man who breaks away from the union.&#34; Now, we do not want to have a doctrine like that advocated in this conntry. These loyalists, I believe, have been badly treated, and I think that nine-tenths of the people in Australia believe that the men who came forward in the time of our peril, when the Arbitration Court was being ignored, and when a hospital ship was being held up by strikers, ought to be supported by the Government to the utmost of its power. </para>

          <para>. - I did not intend to say a word on this subject, but I feel called upon to reply to some of the harsh statements that have been made concerning unionists. Of course, I do not take much notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I know he cannot help himself. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> appears to be fortified this morning, and was rather abusive in hi3 interjections to me across the Chamber. I congratulate the Government, and especially <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> on the good work done in connexion with the recent strike, and the tactful manner in which he adjusted that trouble. I have no sympathy at all with these &#34; loyalists,&#34; and I think that recent events have demonstrated how necessary it is that Parliament should be shifted from Melbourne, because we find these men outside Parliament House day after day pleading for assistance. They are mostly hefty young fellows who could easily ge&#39;t work elsewhere if they cared to look for it. What happened in Sydney the other day? On the first Monday in this month thousands of returned soldiers were seen walking in the Eight Hours&#39; Procession in that city, displaying banners to demonstrate that they were den ied the opportunity of earning a living at their old callings, and many of them had spilt their blood for this country. Did they come down to this Parliament pleading for assistance ? No. They have gone out to fight the battle of life again without Government assistance. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that one man whom he knows was a coal lumper who gave seven sons for the serviceof his country. Pour of them made the supreme sacrifice in the war, and two were crippled. Yet this man, by the action of these so-called loyalists, is denied the right to earn his living at his particular business, while these &#34; things &#34; who came in when unionists were on strike, are being pampered by the New South Wales Government. Not one word appeared in the public press of that great demonstration on behalf of the returned soldiers. No protest has been made concerning their treatment by the Government. I congratulate title Government on what they have done, and I say, let these so-called loyalists go out to earn their living, and take their chances with other men. The unionists are perfectly willing to let them take their chances. But, instead of doing that, they come to the Government crawling and cringing for assistance. The time of the Senate is being wasted on matters of this sort. Thousands of returned soldiers, I repeat, are walking the streets of Sydney unable to get work, while men who were eligible for service during the war, but who forgot their obligations, are now allowed to take the bread out of the mouths of mothers and fathers of boys who fought at the Front. One man who came down to Sydney during the strike, is over 6 feet high, and said he had six sons as tall as himself. Where were their rifles during the war? They were among the &#34; cold-footers &#34; who would not go to the war, but who, assisted by the State Government, are now taking the bread out of the mouths of those who had gone to the Front. I am not going to attempt to reply to all the insinuations that have been made in connexion with this matter, but I may remind the Senate that, in the course of time, each man who has been in authority, has used the same words of abuse towards those who are leading the Democracy of this country, from the day&#39;s when William Charles Wentworth denounced Parkes, who in his turn denounced Reid, as Reid denounced Hughes; and now, good God! we have Hughes using the same language towards the leaders of the present-day unionists. I say that those who to-day stand in the position of leaders of the Labour movement are quite as good and quite as honest as were those who were leading it in the early days of its history. And, thank God, when they hand in their checks, people will not be able to say of them that they sat in Parliament alongside men who, a few years before, were their bitterest political enemies. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DE</inline>LARGIE (Western Australia &#91;12.7&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> remarks may be taken as a reflection upon his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> for having submitted the motion, but I do not altogether agree that this discussion is a waste of time, though. I admit that a good deal of time in this Parliament has been occupied in the consideration of affairs connected with the wharf labourers of this country. They have always been the disturbers of our industrial peace. Evidently they are prepared to break any kind of peace, and always ready to kick up a &#34; bobbery &#34; when there is no occasion for it. For a good many years, I was connected with the wharf labourers. Indeed, I took up their cause at a time when they were so hopelessly in the gutter that nobody would look at them. </para>

          <para>- Eighteen years ago, at Albany, when they did not even have a union, they came out on strike without any chance of success. At that time, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> classical term, they had not the &#34; guts &#34; to know how to keep a union together. When they came out on strike, the ship-owners brought men to Albany to carry on, and after the strikers had been out of work for about six months, and were hopelessly beaten, they appealed to me to plead with the principal ship-owner at Albany <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Malcolm McEacharn)</inline> to take them back. Having no union when they ceased work, they could not go into the Arbitration Court. From that time, and until about two years ago, I was connected with their union as a member of the central council, and, during my association with them, I was instrumental in organizing them into something like a respectable trade union. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was the President; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford,</inline> a member of another place, the Vice-President, of the Waterside Workers Federation, which was organized by us. We were for ever pleading with these men not to be so ready to throw themselves into every industrial trouble that cropped up in Melbourne, Perth, and elsewhere, whether it was a bakers&#39; strike, a shoemakers&#39; dispute, or an engine-drivers&#39; strike, or trouble in any other trade. During those years, we had a most difficult task in persuading them of the futility of disorganizing the shipping industry in Australia. Sometimes we were able to control them. In 1916, at an unauthorized conference of this union, held in Hobart, and behind the backs of the  President  and VicePresident, and myself , an attempt was made to bring about a general strike for political purposes. Now, the leaders of the British Labour movement have stood up to this kind of thing time and again, and have told trade unionists quite plainly that they must not attempt to govern the country by means of strikes; that political strikes must not be engineered. It is time that the official mouthpieces of Labour in Australia took up the same attitude. Are they afraid to do so? Do they fear that the fate which overtook me, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and other members of the Labour party will be theirs, and that they will be expelled from the movement? Is that the reason? Do they refrain, because, to repeat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> term, they have not the &#34; guts &#34; to stand up to the unions ? It is time that we separated industrial from political affairs in the trade union movement, and unless the Labour leaders take some action in this direction those who have secured control of the unions will undoubtedly drag this country into that condition of Bolshevism which, has made Russia the laughing stock of the world. If those men who are the subject of this discussion, the loyalist workers in Melbourne and the Nationalist lumpers in Fremantle were &#34; scabs &#34; in the ordinary sense of the word ;. that is to say, if they were taking work from other men who had a right to it, I would be the last man to stand up in this Senate and say a word in their behalf. But I have undeniable proof - and every honorable senator who wants to know the truth can get it from information which I have in my possession - &#39;that at the Hobart Conference, to which I have referred, the question of a general strike was actually under discussion for three days, and it was only stopped when the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> exposed the whole business, and showed thai the conference was sitting in secret behind the backs and in defiance of the leaders of the union. </para>

            <para>- Because a secret conference was called, and the leaders for the time being were ignored. The conference really was unconstitutional. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the  president,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford,</inline> the vice-president, were ignored. I was in the Old Country at the time, and I have no doubt that had I been in Australia I would have been ignored in the same way. I can assure honorable senators, however, that, according to my record of the official minutes, there was a discussion in secret for three days on the desirability of bringing about a general strike if conscription were carried at the referendum, and so defeating the expressed will of the people, on a great political question. </para>

            <para>- When the whole business was exposed, they actually had the audacity to instruct their secretary to refute statements that had been made in the public press, and they quietly dropped their tails between their legs and ran away from the position they had taken up. These are facts which should be known, because they affect the subject now under discussion, and because these are the men who have brought about such a deplorable state of affairs in Melbourne and Fremantle. I drew their attention so often to the folly of being mixed up in troubles that were not theirs, that evidently they said among themselves, &#34; This fellow de Largie is no good to us. We must get rid of him.&#34; They got rid of the delegate who organized them, put them on their feet, and made them a self-respecting union ; and for what ? Because I had the &#34;guts &#34; to tell them straight and plainly when they were wrong, and when they proposed to do what was undoubtedly unconstitutional. </para>

          <para>-  I do not think that any member of the Senate has a longer record as a trade unionist than I have. I do not think that any one has put up a bigger fight for trade unionism than I have.In 1884, when some honorable senators present were in swaddling clothes, I was presented with a gold medal for services rendered to trade unions. That is a few years ago now. I went, through the 1887 strike as an official. I got through the 1890 strike when warrants were drawn out by McMillan and Bruce Smith to send me to gaol in . Sydney, which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes refused to sign. I got through the strike of 1893, which was the biggest thing of the kind we ever had to face. Honorable senators will remember that when the bank smash took place the employers insisted on freedom of contract. Who broke downfreedom of contract? It was not honorable senators sitting opposite me to-day. The persons responsible for breaking down freedom of contract were George Sangster, Ben Tucker, and myself. When we got the ship-owners into a conference, freedom of contract went by the board. From that time on we made mutual agreements until the Federal Parliament was established. Amongst some of our supporters then was dear old Charlie Kingston, who made his mark on a Royal Commission which was moved for by Tom Davis, in. New South Wales, by laying down the first principles of arbitration. If honorable senators will look up the report of that Commission which was appointed in New South Wales, they will find that in the course of its inquiry Kingston laid down the principles of arbitration for the settlement of disputes. </para>

            <para>- New South Wales made an experiment in the matter, and then the Federal Parliament took action, and we found that even members of the Labour party were against extendiug the provisions of the Arbitration Act to men going to sea. I could show honorable senators a copy of a wire to prove that Kingston was so strong on the matter that he resigned his seat in the Government. He threw up the whole business because the principle was not to be applied to seamen. Here we, as trade unionists, Senators Gardiner and Guy, and every one else, said that we were done with strikes, and wanted some other method. Where are some of those honorable senators to-day? They have gone back to strikes. They have reneged. </para>

And what is said by the other men who were concerned in the plebiscite? They say that the third degree was put on them to get out so that Wallace would be able to allow Ryan to run for the district. </para>

            <para>- What is the position with regard to the wharf labourers here? I do not suppose that, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, there is a single member of the Senate who has been more closely associated than I have been with the wharf labourers of Melbourne. I well remember the strike in 1890, and in 1893, and my close association with a dear old friend Ben Tucker, who, I am sorry to think, is at the present time getting near to the end of his tether. &#34;He was secretary to the union in Victoria for years. While in that position he organized the union when it was absolutely split up. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> will remember that, so far as Sydney is concerned, there was no wharf labourers union in that city at all in 1890.&#39; </para>

            <para>- Yes, with six members. I am not sure, but I think a man named Maitland organized the coal lumpers, and Ramsay Macdonald the wharf labourers. The whole position regarding the wharf labourers is this : Any man who gets out of a job, whether he be a joiner, carpenter, or painter, goes down to the wharf and does a bit of lumping.  Those men cannot be organized. Any honorable senator who has had experience in organization knows the difficulty of handling casual labour from other out-of-work unions. The wharf labourers&#39; trouble occurred at a time when the parties involved could have gone to the Arbitration Court, and have settled their difficulties forthwith. I sent the seamen a wire last January, when they were gathered in&#39; Sydney, to the effect that if they would only guarantee immunity from strike for two years every one of their points would receive favorable consideration. They turned that proposition down. They need not have lost a day&#39;s work. Ten weeks of strike were precipitated, although they could have gained favorable consideration of the whole of their points in January without one man losing one hour&#39;s wages. The wharf labourers could have gone to the Arbitration Court. Nobody will say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has failed to give fair and favorable consideration to every subject which has come before him. I had no trouble in the instance which brought me into touch with the Arbitration Court.- Our difficulty had been with the Government; but when we came before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins he was prepared to consider our case without undue delay. </para>

            <para>- I have been connected with the movement for quite a long time, and I have nothing to regret. If there is one institution for which it can be rightly claimed that its objectives and its methods of reaching them are above-board, and its general history clean, it is the institution of trade unionism. There are men now in this Parliament who did a great deal for trade unionism, and for whom trade unionism did a great deal. It is a matter for regret that there are members of the Federal Legislature who have spent a great part of their lives in the service of the working people, but who now find it necessary to say the most unkind, the dirtiest things possible, about the -institution for whose creation and improvement they have been largely responsible. </para>

            <para>- Possibly, the honorable senator is right. Nevertheless, it is a matter for considerable regret that those men should now lose no opportunity to say the most evil things about the institution which they did so much to create. These men know the machinery of trade unionism and the . methods of organization, and trade unionism owes nothing to the people who claim they have done everything to bring it into existence. It owes nothing to the men who, when the test was applied, failed it. It might reasonably expect, however, that those men should be manly enough to admit that they did not understand the first principles of Labour organization. The latter is built upon this basis, namely, that when the majority speaks, the individual obeys. When the majority speaks, my personal opinion &#34; goes to the pack.&#34; That is the only way. We have the right to express our views in the proper place, at the proper time. We cannot expect to run our organization unless we are prepared to sink personal opinions and abide by the decisions of the majority. </para>

            <para>- Possibly ; I do not know. The honorablesenator has probably made himself familiar with individuals among the loyalists. We have spent a quarter of a century in endeavouring to obtain arbitration as a means of securing just conditionsof labour ; yet to-day hundreds of unionists, including returned soldiers, are unable to benefit by representation before the Arbitration Court. That is not because myunion has not been always to the forefront in . advocating arbitration,and in working under awards and abiding . by them ; it isbe- 13832 <inline font-style="italic">Adjournment</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">{Formal).</inline></para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> cannot justify the wharf labourers &#34; scab &#34; union. He has attempted to do so. He worked for the wages of sin, and he is getting them. He made his own bed, and he should be content to lie upon it, and not howl so much about it. I regret very much that men like the honorable senator thought that they constituted the Labour movement, and that nobody else had a right to say anything. Only the other afternoon the VicePresident of the Executive Council assured us that the Cabinet had not considered or settled anything in reference to the payment of a gratuity to our soldiers. Yet the same night the statement was made in Brisbane that the gratuity was to be paid; the amount of it was stated, and the way in which it was to be paid was set out. How do these discrepancies between statements by Ministers arise? I believe that it is necessary for the Government to take intoconsideration the industrial affairs of Australia. Up to date we have acted pretty . sanely . in this country. I know that quite a number of persona from abroad have come here to tell us how we ought to organize our labour forces. Whilst I do not claim that we have reached perfection in that matter, I do maintain that Australians have easily shown the way to every other country in regard to labour organization. They have done so, not because they have had in their Parliaments men who possessed all the advantages of a University education, but because within the ranks of Labour there have been many honest, earnest, and able men. I know that there are certain elements in the ranks of organized Labour in Australia which are very dissatisfied with our Arbitration laws. But there is a reason for that. I have already given instances of the inability of our trade unionists to secure the benefits of arbitration, although they earnestly desire to do so. There are other reasons why industrial troubles will arise, and why recourse will be had to other than arbitration methods for their settlement. </para>

          <para>. - I have no desire to discuss this question with any degree of heat, and I think that upon the broad question of the merits of unionism we are all in agreement. We are nlso agreed that it is desirable to avoid any danger of future industrial unrest. I share many of the views which have been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> As an old unionist, who claims to know something about the Labour movement, I confess that much of what he stated is absolutely correct. But hitherto the fact that in the Labour movement there has been a majority upon one side, has not prevented the free expression of the views entertained by the minority. To-day, however, the minority is bound to obey the majority. </para>

I repeat that when there was no organized body of loyalists in Australia, the very grievancesto which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has directed attention existed. Under the system which previously obtained, some wharf labourers earned as much as &#163;10 or &#163;12 per week, whilst others could notmake a living wage- A good deal has been said in regard to various unions ; and I think that a great mistake has been made by reason of the action of small sections of unionists who have flouted the Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> himself has admitted that the majority of the Australian Workers Union are in favour of arbitration. But we know that the wharf labourers and direct actionists, are attempting to destroy our arbitration system. They are the people whom I denounce, not only as a danger to Australia and to the Labour movement, but also to arbitration. </para>

            <para>- If any industrial trouble  is  likely to arise, why cannot the members of the Australian Workers Union, and of other organizations which are in favour of the settlement of disputes by means of arbitration, band themselves together for the purpose of keeping the direct actionists in. their places, and of hastening decisions by the Arbitration Court? 1 believe that the long delay which is involved in securing an award from that tribunal is responsible for much of the existing industrial unrest. This condition of affairs needs to be remedied. We are all agreed upon that. When, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> accuses us of desiring to hinder a prompt settlement of industrial troubles by the Court, he is making a charge which is absolutely without foundation, and which he cannot substantiate. I suggest to my honorable friends opposite that if we join forces in an endeavour to insure early decisions by the Arbitration Court- </para>

            <para>- I know that some unions were deregistered because they broke the law. I do not care what means are adopted by the Government to insure the punishment of unions who offend in that respect. When a contract has been entered into, i&#39;t should be loyally respected by all parties to it. I feel very strongly on this matter, because I fear that the methods which are being adopted by a certain section of unionists will, if persisted in, ruin unionism. Any agreement which has been made should be loyally observed by all parties to it, because after all, arbitration is, as yet, merely an experiment. I know that the tendency is to grant employees as f avorable industrial conditions as possible. That being so, most of the causes underlying friction ought to have been removed. </para>

          <para>. -  In replying, my task has been made easy. I brought this debate before the Senate with one distinct purpose in view, and that was to prevent a continuation of misunderstandings that might lead to industrial trouble. It is quite true that I attacked the character of a man - the secretary of the loyalists&#39; organization - but it was because that man, I am informed by the people for whom I stand, is deliberately endeavouring to stir up industrial trouble. I was more than surprised when I read in the press report concerning his house catching fire that he deliberately informed the police that he believed the unionists had set fire to it. The matter was investigated by the police, and I ask the Minister to call for their report. If he does that, it can be submitted to the Senate before we adjourn. The report of the police, and of the detectives engaged on , the investigation, clearly leads to the conclusion that this gentleman set fire to the place himself. I am as careful as any man in making statements under the privileges of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- Because this is the place where I act in an official capacity in the interests of the people I represent. This debate has been characterized bv some remarkable speeches. The point I wish to make, on behalf of the unionists, is that they are working  amicably on the -wharfs under the agreement entered into by the Government, the original loyalists, and themselves, and  are doing their very best to honour the compact. I wish that to be very clearly understood. There are a number of people who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> said, rushed to the country&#39;s assistance, and endeavoured to work themselves into the unionists&#39; ranks, and they are the ones who are causing the trouble. These are the people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refused to recognise. The question of unionists <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> non-unionists has been a difficult problem ever since unionism was established, and it will be the cause of heated passion  so  long as we have men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> depicting the type of men that should lead unionism. Unionism has never been fortunate enough to secure as its leader a man of the character, capacity, attainments, and ability that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> thinks he possesses. </para>

            <para>- It is not likely that we shall be able- to secure a man of the eminent qualities that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> thinks he possesses: men who stand aloof; men who are above all influence, and oan snap their fingers at any one. Such qualifications have never been possessed by any statesman. We have heard of the leaders of unionism in the glorious old days of the past. In those days, we had to look for leadership to such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie, Senator de</inline> Largie, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I am not going to criticise their leadership, but they fall short of the type <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> mentions. They are so little removed from the men leading unionism to-day that I am not very much concerned as to its future, because I believe we have men possessing all the good qualities that were supposed to be held by the leaders of twenty years ago. </para>

Nothing has  changed in the Labour world, and there- is not likely to be a change until the worker receives what he produces. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> method of leading labour would be by standing aloof and telling the men what was the right thing to do. The men engaged in our industrial undertakings know what is right, and they do it; but so long as they possess human passions, there will be occasions when they are likely to resort to violence. </para>

            <para>- Then I think the honorable senator is like myself, and does not possess very much. We imagine that we have reached a stage where labour can be free and independent from the trials we were experiencing. We claim that the steady progress, not only of unionists, but of non-unionists, is directly traceable to the exertions and sacrifices of unionists. No one section of labour can claim credit for that. I can-, not claim to be a leader of industrial unionism, because at the age of twentyfour years I was thrown into the political arena. In 1891 I was a Labour candidate, and I am one to-day - that is my record. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> made violent insinuations concerning the conduct of a union ballot, wherein he made the deliberately false statement that corrupt practices .had been adopted in connexion with the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallace.</inline> The facts are quite simple. When arrangements were being made for selecting a candidate for West Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallace</inline> led in the. selection ballot by ten to&#62; one against his opponents, but he stood down in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> whose services he considered invaluable to the party. No misrepresentation should be made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallace</inline> in that regard. One may discount his judgment or the methods adopted, but so far as he was personally concerned, everything in regard to the election is to his credit. The electors of &#34;West Sydney selected him for the position, and he tendered his resignation to the executive to enable them to select another man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> does not gain anything by such misrepresentations, and I would like him to understand that there is nothing underhand in unionism to-day. The same common-sense, men control the organization, and are as competent to conduct the work as the type referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> So far as Labour is concerned, it must be admitted that the position will much better be met by giving consideration to all interests, instead of one side trying to set a path for the other to follow. Our unionists to-day - the Minister in charge of the Senate has just informed me that he is still a unionist - are of the same type that governed the Labour forces of this country twenty years ago. If some men find themselves outside, and feel that their records of years past entitle them to be opponents of Labour, I do not care Senators Lynch, Guthrie, and de Largie have made mean and bitter attacks upon unionism. </para>

            <para>- I regret that so much time has been . occupied in discussing this matter. I did not occupy my full time in opening the debate. I brought the matter forward, conscientiously believing that the statements made by the representatives of the Waterside Workers Union were true, and that they were working amicably in accordance with the arrangements entered into. The person I have referred to is, in my opinion, the cause of the trouble, because he has been constantly agitating and irritating unionists. The ship-owners were playing into his hands by giving the best class of work to the loyalists, and what remained to the unionists. I have brought these facts before the Senate, conscientiously believing that if there is trouble, it is better to deal with it in a straightforward way rather than by endeavouring to crush out unionism. This is not a new matter, as at the Governor -General&#39;s Conference I asked the Government to remove the loyalists while there were a few ships to be handled, because when the work on the wharfs became more active, there was little likelihood of their working amicably together. The re-registration of the unions was promised by . the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and I believe the latter gentleman has been endeavouring to give effect to that undertaking. A definite promise was made. I hope the Government will move in the matter, and realize that the union is doing its best for industrial peace. </para>

          <para>. - I must very regretfully join in the protest made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> against the suspension of the Standing Orders to put this Bill through. It has not been in my hands for many minutes, but I can see that what it may mean is to perpetuate the War Precautions Regulations connected with the restrictions which for some years past have been imposed upon the mining industry and also the perpetuation of the regulations in connexion with shipping. We have been told in this Chamber by the representatives of the Government that whatever powers they desired to have extended beyond three months after the date of the proclamtaion of Peace would be the subject of specific legislation. This Bill will merely continue the operation of the War Precautions Act in many directions. That was protested against here, and we had a promise from the Government that it would not be done. I put in my strongest protest against this measure being - and I use the expression with due deliberation - sneaked through at this late hour of the session. </para>

          <para>. - I am very glad indeed that at least one honorable senator on the Ministerial side has had the courage to adversely criticise the Government for attempting to carry on the business ofthe country in this farcical way. It isa pity that there are not a few more on the other side prepared to take the same course. If there were, we might render these absurd efforts of the Government nugatory. It is absurd to try to make the people believe that these Bills will receive consideration from any honorable senator, because honorable senators opposite know as well as I do that in the circumstances that will be impossible. Yesterday, a whole sheaf of Bills was sent up to us from another place which we are supposed to put through before the close of the sitting on Friday, and to-day a further sheaf of Bills is presented by the Government. It is a pity that a few more honorable senators on the other side have not the same regard for their duty to the electors of Australia that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has. If there were, they would tell the Government that it is time to stop this silly business, and that Parliament should continue to sit long enough to give proper consideration to its legislation; or that, in the alternative, these matters should be allowed to stand over until the new Parliament assembles. </para>

I say that, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, no honorable senator on the Government side will complain of the way in which the business of the Government has been dealt with by the Opposition during the last week.

The business at the close of a session cannot be satisfactorily carried on without a mutual understanding between the representatives of both parties. That is the spirit in which I have met the Acting Minister for Defence, and I tell him that it is calculated rather to delay the business of Parliament if an attempt is made . to rush through measures that are objectionable. There is quite a number of measures on the businesspaper which, if I thought the Minister intended to try to pass them, I would not allow to go through until physical exhaustion compelled me to give up my opposition. I am assuming that the Minister will act reasonably, and will not put an undue strain upon honorable senators. I expect that he will try to put legislation through by an appeal to reason, and not by force of numbers. I tell him that to-morrow he will be in jus&#39;t as good a position to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders to deal with this Bill ashe is in to-day. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister will follow the course I suggest we can have the advantage of his statement as to what the Bill contains, though, perhaps, he can give us ho more information than is disclosed by the title of the Bill, which shows that the intention is that the operation of . the  War  Precautions Act shall be extended. There has been a good deal of criticism in the Senate of the operation of the War Precautions Act in connexion with the metal industry, and a criticism which justified the time and intelligence which honorable senators directed to it. I can quite understand honorable senators on the other side warmly expressing their feelings against the proposed continuance of  a  most obnoxious system. I can quite enter into their feelings when  a  proposal of this kind is sprung upon them in this way. It is not conducive to the proper conduct of the business of the Senate. The Minister might move the suspension of the Standing Orders at one stage as well as at another, and if he delayed the motion for twenty-four hours he might be in a position to decide whether he would go on with this measure or postpone its consideration until next week. If all these measures are to be rushed through, it will only be with the physical exhaustion of honorable senators. The Government will triumph, not by reason of their intelligent conduct of business, but because of their overwhelming majority, and owing  to the limitation of physical endurance on the part of the Opposition. The proposal of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to secure the suspension of the Standing Orders should be vigorously challenged by all honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- Of course, we should not be embarrassed by them. They are always a source of inconvenience, especially to the Government. The Bills, with an avalanche of which we are threatened, are of such a nature as may lead to interminable debate, unless the Government take the extreme course of moving &#34;That the question be now put.&#34; With their majority, of course, that procedure may be successfully adopted. There are three Bills in particular, among the sixteen or twenty which I have made a supreme effort to  masteT.  They are. highly debatable, and thoroughly objectionable. I can see no hope of their being passed by this hour to-morrow. We are almost sure to be required to meet next week, and possibly the week after. What good can the Government do by essaying to force sixteen to twenty measures through this Chamber in as many hours? If they persist in their forceful tactics, I shall persist, in the interests of good legislation, with my obstructive tactics. . I shall not only call for a division upon this, motion, but upon every other request for the suspension of the Standing Orders during the remaining hours of this session. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will facilitate the passage of this measure if he seeks to force this motion. I have in my hand a copy of the Bill, but it has not yet been circulated among honorable senators, and is notupon our files. It was introduced and read a first time in another place yesterday, and it was passed without much ado. So far as I have been able to examine it, it is a very comprehensive measure. We have more than once discussed in this Chamber the desirableness or otherwise of extending the War Precautions regulations. Those regulations, which it is proposed, under cover of this Bill, to keep in force until the end of December of next year, are specified merely by titles, and not in detail. They are : Mining, Shipping, Enemy Shareholders, and Land Transfer. I defy any honorable senator to go through the regulations upon the table of the Senate and make himself acquaintedbefore the dinner adjournment with the specific regulations which are to be continued in force until the end of next year. I, for one, am not going to legislate blindly. The existence of many of these regulations, even for the period of the war, was regarded as a matter of hardship. The mining community were furious over the promulgation of soma of them. We have been promised, time after time, that at the earliest convenient opportunity they would be repealed. Earlier this year we dealt with the moratorium regulations. The Government proposed to continue them in force for a definite period. What was done? Those particular regulations referred only to two matters ; they were the Moratorium General and the Moratorium Active Service regulations. But the Government took the course of setting forth, as a schedule to the  measure which proposed to continue the operation of those regulations, the whole of them as they stand to-day. The Bill was passed; the Act contains in its print the Moratorium Statute up to date; and it has, as schedules to it, the Moratorium General and the Moratorium Active Service regulations. Nothing like that procedure is being done here, however. We are asked to legislate blindly. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> not to press this motion. We are dealing with the trade and industry of the Commonwealth in a most comprehensive way; in primary production, largely, and its export. (From Western Australia, from Tasmania, and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the operation of restrictions upon the mining industry has been a source of continual complaint. Here we are asked at one consideration to pass through all its stages a Bill which seeks to continue in force certain War Precautions, regulations with regard to mining; and not even the Minister himself can indicate their character. </para>

            <para>- That is sp; yet we are asked to legislate in this blind fashion. Further, the Bill introduces new principles. It provides that, until the end of next year, the GovernorGeneral shall have power to issue regulations. We are not simply continuing existing regulations, but are giving power to the Governor-General between thi? date and the end of next year to alter, modify, or repeal present regulations, or to substitute new regulations for those now in operation. We are asked also to preserve, in respect to offenders against the regulations, the right of redress, even  though  the War Precautions Act has expired. This&#39; is not merely a machinery measure: it is not one which deals solely with technicalities. It is most practical; it is a measure of substance, of vital interest to the most important industries of the Commonwealth. I again ask the Minister not to force this Bill through the Senate at high speed, even though it may have taken only one day to pass in another place. </para>

          <para>. - I am not in any way attempting to limit honorable senators&#39; rights of speech, or their opportunities to fully debate the Bill.Senator Keating has not put the position quite fairly. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that he and I have co-operated in the past in performing this &#34;trick, when the Government with which we were associated desired to push through with their business. The mining problem is undoubtedly grave, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says. I realize that, and I will endeavour, at the proper opportunity, to make as full a statement in respect to these regulations as I can. I point out, however, that with the ratification of Peace, which may be announced practically at any time, there will arise international complications with respect to raw materials and general trading matters. I do not expect to be able to make a complete statement on those phases; for it should not be lost sight of that Australia is not quite as independent as might be wished, either in regard to freedom of speech or in the handling of those subjects which I have just indicated. </para>

            <para>- This motion does not seek to limit honorable senators&#39; opportunities of debate. It is merely intended to facilitate the passage of the Bill, should a favorable opportunity occur, for example, to pass straight fromthe &#39; first-reading to the second-reading stage. There is no reason why there should be unnecessary delay when it can be simply and fairly avoided. Honorable senators know how, in the dying hours of a session, Bills which have accumulated upon the notice-paper are rapidly passed from one Chamber to the other for the consideration of only slight amendments. It is highly_ desirable that formalities should be, as far as possible, done away with. Every honorable senator will be entitled to occupy his full time for discussion. We should not now be expected to take the first reading of a Bill upon one day, the second reading on another day, and then waste still another day in passing the measure backwards and forwards to deal with minor amendments. In the last hours of a session I have known Bills to go from one place to another like greased lightning, when there has been, perhaps, not more than one word in dispute. The Government desire now to avoid all obstacles. I would be the last to seek, to effect the closure. My motion does not in any way challenge or circumscribe the rights of honorable senators, but I appeal to them to co-operate in order to deal with the business in hand . </para>

          <para>I wish to point out that it is an ordinary Loan Bill, under which the Treasurer seeks authority to raise &#163;1,107,602 for the purposes of new works during the current year. A sum of &#163;352,619 is already available under previous loans, so that the estimated expenditure upon works out of loan money is &#163;1,460,221. That amount is &#163;347,000 more than the actual expenditure for 1918-19. In order to show how that increase is brought about I propose to state the excess expenditure which is contemplated upon each particular Department or item. That excess is made up as follows : - Naval and military expenditure, including reserves of ammunition, &#163;27,067; River Murray waters scheme, &#163;10,904; acquisition of land adjacent to Federal Capital Territory in payment for past acquisitions, &#163;15,987; additional payments in con nexion with London offices, &#163;15,880; extra payment for the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, &#163;321,000. In regard to the last item, honorable senators will recognise that during the war, and not merely because of high prices, it was practically impossible to purchase many of the materials which are essential to that Department. </para>

              <para>- I know of persons who have had to wait six months in order to get a telephone put on to their houses.. This item, therefore, is intended to make up a good deal of the leeway which was inevitable under war conditions. We are all interested in seeing this great Department brought up to date in order that it may prove an efficient machine for transacting the business of the people. The last amount which I mentioned is required to enable the Post- &#39; master-General&#39;s Department toprovide increased postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services-. The estimated cost of the works and machinery required for the Navy is &#163;167,000. There has been very little loan expenditure on the Navy during the war period, because the Department was practically at a standstill by reason of the fact that our seamen were largely engaged overseas. The whole of the money provided for in this Bill will . not be spent during the current year. Every effort has been made to curtail&#39; expenditure, and provision has been made to complete only works which are already in hand. The Bill is essentially one for consideration in Committee. I shall be glad to supply any honorable senator with any further information in regard to specific works when we reach that stage. </para>

When an important measure is submitted to us, the Opposition should at least be afforded an opportunity of considering it. Notwithstanding that I have been working at top speed in my endeavour to grip the provisions of the various Bills claiming our attention, they have been brought forward so rapidly that the task has proved a hopeless one. This hurry is being deliberately created by the Government for the purpose of getting their measures through this chamber. </para>

              <para>- But no doubt an arrangement may be made under which, by leave of the Senate, I shall not be required to forgo my right to speak upon the Bill. But the Minister has apparently made up his mind to go right through the Government programme before we rise. There are a few measures to which I would like to give serious consideration. I have attempted to consider at least three of them, but, owing to the limited time at my disposal, 1 have been quite unable to do so. The Bill now before us is one to authorize the Treasurer to raise a loan of &#163;1,107,602 for certain purposes. Those purposes are specified in the measure, and the schedule &#39; shows the amounts which are to be appropriated. I should like to know whether this money is to be raised in Australia, Great Britain, . or America. </para>

              <para>- When I go to. a bank for a loan I know that the authorities there demand quite a lot of information. I can scarcely imagine a more loose method of doing business than for Parliament to be asked to sanction a Loan Bill under which it is proposed to raise more than &#163;1,000,000, and in which is included even an odd &#163;2. Is this money to come from our financial institutions, whose businesses have already been seriously hampered by reason of the large amounts which they have had to provide for the Government? Not only have their businesses been thus interfered with, but also the businesses of their clients. The whole of the financial business of this country is being seriously upset by the ruthlessness with which the Government are rushing into the market </para>

              <para>- But even that bank has its limitations. I cannot forget that during the first two years of war that institution provided the Government with &#163;15,000,000 or &#163;20,000,000, free. of interest.  It started its career in time of peace, but in its very early history it was called upon to stand the test imposed by war. Not only did it stand that test successfully, but it enabled other financial institutions to survive the upsetting of their business by war conditions and permitted the loans which had been raised to be successfully floated. This measure seeks authority to borrow money for financing certain public undertakings. When we consider the various works concerned, we wonder why the Government could not have effected savings in other branches to enable them to carry out the- works without borrowing. A sum of &#163;15,000 is to be set aside for carrying out certain work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, including certain naval engineering and other works. A similar amount was appropriated in a previous act. Provision is also made for buildings and an engineering plant at the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong, to the extent of &#163;11,500. I suppose the work of increasing the plant at the Cordite Factory is one of those particularly pressing and urgent matters .now that the war, which was to end all wars, has ended in victory to the Allies. Instead of war being at an end, it seems that we have to go full speed ahead to make ready .for the next conflict. We are going to mortgage the peaceful possessions of the people in this community and manufacture cordite to the extent I have mentioned. There is also an amount of &#163;55,000 for erecting cottages at Lithgow. That is a matter for which the Government are justified in borrowing, because&#39; it is to provide cottages for workmen, and because there will be an immediate return the moment such buildings are occupied. Provision is also made in the Bill for extending the Perth </para>

              <para>- That is one of the amounts mentioned here, and I suppose the amount is for the ballasting of the line. The completion of that important work has been the means of linking the eastern States  with our western territory, and has already shown itself to be a reproductive undertaking. An amount of &#163;3,000 is also set aside for the Northern Territory railway, and I am sorry the Government are not borrowing a little more and making a general endeavour to link the north with the south. I regret that our pledge to South Australia has not been honoured, and that a larger sum has not been placed on the Estimates for the purpose. Such a line would be of great military value. I suggest, too, for the present consideration of the Minister, that it would be the means of despatching troops to preserve order, in  the  Northern Territory if our warships&#39; failed. The total set down under Works and Railways is &#163;438,200.&#39; Provision is also made for the construction and extension of our telegraph and telephone system, and an amount of &#163;398,026 has been set aside for that purpose. There is also a sum of &#163;50,000 provided for erecting the necessary machinery for the general arsenal, but as to it the Minister has given us very little information. If there is one thing more necessary than another now that the war is over, it is the completion of an arsenal, in which light and easily movable guns can be manufactured, so that we may be in a position to defend ourselves. Some explanation of this item could well be put before the Senate. I know there is always some&#39; secrecy concerning military preparations, but if other nations wish to find out what we are doing in this way they always have means. It would be better, when such works are being undertaken, for a clear statement to be made in Parliament as to what is intended, so that other nations might gain our confidence, and realize that we were preparing, not for attack, but to defend our country. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Apart from enabling us to manufacture high explosives, it has been the means of again enriching the sugar people by converting what had been a waste product into a valuable commodity. Now that the war is over, matters of defence should be discussed in the full light of day. Such a policy would enable the people to take an intelligent interest in the expenditure of public money. There is always a possibility of misunderstanding arising if our present policy is continued. Our relations with such nations as Japan should be made perfectly clear. The real sentiment and opinions of the Australian people should be freely and openly expressed in Parliament, as other nations would then know exactly where we stood. Japan, for instance, would realize that it was not our wish to treat her in a different way from other foreign nations. It should be known that it is our desire to keep our country to ourselves, and that in matters  of trade Japan would be placed on th same basis as America, France. or Italy. If we bad a clear understanding between Japan the present suspicion would disappear. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline> having a clear understanding with our neighbours in the East we could avoid huge expenditure in the way of defence, and prevent burdening the people with a debt that will make life almost unbearable a generation or two hence. Instead of borrowing we should have a system whereby every pound borrowed should be placed on the shoulders of some one able to bear it. A Loan Bill should not be introduced into Parliament unless it embodied a means of providing a sinking fund and the payment of interest. There is an item for the Flinders Naval Depot - machinery and plant, &#163;10,000, and another for wireless telegraphy, &#163;12,000. If the Government were alive to the interests of the people and as enterprising as the Marconi, Telefunken, and the Australasian Wireless companies, I would have no objection to the expenditure of almost any sum for the development of wireless telegraphy, not with the idea of the Government reaping exorbitant profits, but in order that a very profitable business might fall into their hands. With their well-equipped plant, they could supply all the wireless apparatus required by the shipping companies of Australia, and, indeed, might make it part of their policy that all vessels engaged in the coastal trade should use this Australian wireless system, so that a large proportion of the profits which at present <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> to German and other foreign companies would be secured for the people. I have no desire to unduly delay the passage of this Bill, the expenditure under which, apparently, is to prepare us for another war; but if we do not prepare for war the chances are we will have war upon us much sooner than if we were prepared. Therefore, without protesting unduly against the Bill, I am prepared to allow it to pass. </para>

            <para>. -  There is something about thi? borrowing of money which I think should engage the attention of the Senate. I do not know whether it is proposed to borrow the money in London or in Australia, but I think it should be obtained in this country. The operation of borrowing requires overhauling.

          <para>I should like also to know where it is intended to locate . the machinery &#62; and plant for the Arsenal, in respect of which &#163;44,836 is to be appropriated. Is it intended to construct the Arsenal at Tuggeranong, and is it to be. a general Arsenal, or merely a place where certain machinery is to be employed, so that, at short notice, other manufacturing con&#39;cerns may &#39;be able to do work which at one time it was proposed to carry on at the Arsenal? If it is intended to spend a further sum of money in this direction in Melbourne, I must oppose it. The expenditure should be at Tuggeranong, where the Commonwealth Arsenal is to be located. Much the same may .be said with respect to the Naval Base works. I should like to know the contents of the so-called secret document which has been furnished to the Government by Admiral Jellicoe. Where do the Government pro. pose to spend these huge sums of money? Why is this information made available to certain people but withheld from honorable -senators and the general public? Surely we are entitled to it. This holding up of the report for an indefinite time is not treating Parliament fairly, and I enter my protest against it. Later, we are to -be asked to vote &#163;13,000, not under this Bill, it is true, for the purchase of land for the Port Stephens Naval Base. I should like to know the area of the land, who are the owners, and what taxation, they have been paying to the Commonwealth and State Governments on that land. Plans should be furnished to the Senate, so that we might know what we are doing. We should not pass this vote of &#163;13,000 in the absence of information from the Minister. </para>

Workmen at Lithgow have the advantage of the social environment of a considerable township. That is not possessed by those at work on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway, and the buildings in which men, women, and children are living along that line are a perfect eyesore to travellers over it. For the second or third time, I wish to bring under the notice of the Government the justice of providing more decent homes for men working on that line than are at present provided for them. </para>

        <para class="block">As honorable members are aware, a referendum in connexion with the proposed alteration of the Constitution is to be taken at an early date. We recently passed a Bill amending the electoral law . and the purpose of this measure is to bring the machinery for the holding of the referendum into line with what we have already done in dealing with the Electoral Bill. This measure contains twenty-two clauses, but they are purely consequential upon the passing of the Electoral Bill. Some of the clauses provide merely for alterations in &#39;the references to sections of the Electoral Act where the numbers of those sections have been altered by the Electoral Bill which we have recently passed. Other amendments are rendered necessary by the re-introduction of the principle of postal voting. We have again decided to adopt that principle in our electoral law, and it is intended under this Bill to apply it to referendums as well as to elections. Provisions are, there fore, included in this Bill to enable electors to vote by post at referendums. It is proposed to reduce the penalties for an untrue statement with regard to electoral expenses from &#163;500 to &#163;100, and it is proposed to make a similar reduction in regard to the failure by newspaper proprietors to send in returns of electoral advertisements. A slight alteration in the form of the ballot-paper for a referendum is proposed. But honorable senators will see by the schedule to the Bill that the form of ballot-paper provided for is very simple. The provisions relating to bribery and undue influence are extended to cover cases in which the object of the bribery or undue influence is to induce an elector to support or oppose a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution. The object is to apply to the holding of a referendum the provisions with regard to bribery which we have adopted in connexion with elections. An important amendment of the existing Act is provided for in clause 22. As honorable senators are . aware, provision is, under the existing law, made for the issue of pamphlets in connexion with a referendum. Each side is given the option of issuing a pamphlet. I do not know whether that provision was adopted because it was considered that at the time the newspapers were not giving both &#39;sides a fair report. It is, however, proposed in this Bill to repeal that provision of the existing law I understand that it is not proposed by any parly at the present time to issue pamphlets in connexion with the next referendum, because, whilst there may be some difference of opinion as to whether the proposed amendments of the Constitution go far enough, it is agreed that they are in the right direction. I shall be pleased to give any information which honorable senators desire when we get into Committee. </para>

              <para>- This is the first time I have seen it. The Minister says that there is nothing important in it, and I suppose it will go through as it is. In dealing with the Electoral Bill, it  was considered desirable that ballotpapers for the Senate should be marked with numerals indicating a preference for candidates the same as in the case of the election of members of the House of Representatives. I point out that under this Bill papers will be put into the hands of the electors which must be marked with an &#34;X.&#34; Something might be done to make the referendum ballot-papers more uniform with those . used for elections. I suppose that I shall have to take it for granted that everything in connexion with this Bill is right; but let me say that the state of the Senate at the present time confirms me in my belief as to its uselessness. The manner in which Bills are being put through should induce the people to arrive at the same conclusion. I protest against the passing of these measures in the manner in which they&#39; are being passed. </para>

            <para>.- The making of a statement of expenses by candidates at election times is somewhat similar to the preparation of a declaration by merchants in regard to imports. That is to say, the procedure tends to dishonesty. Candidates&#39; election expenses are limited by Act of Parliament. Expense lists, though they may appear to be correct in the letter, may be far from accurate in the spirit. We should not seek to enact legislation which may cause a brother to stumble. We should not place temptation in one&#39;s way to commit some petty act of dishonesty. Regarding the forthcoming elections, one thing is certain, namely, that during the remaining weeks prior to election day in December next, there will not be time for honorable senators to expend up to their maximum ; that would entail campaigning at break-neck speed, at any rate. I have seen some remarkable returns, which must have caused the parties concerned a great deal of slim thinking in their preparation. Personally, I would penalize a man guilty of bribery by not permitting him to sit in Parliament. If it could be proved that bribery and corruption had occurred, the guilty individual should not be allowed to take his seat in Parliament if successful at the polls until his disqualification had been removed by a vote of both Houses of the Legislature. This provision is ridiculous, and should be deleted from our electoral laws. </para>

            <para>. -  I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that the reduction of the amount of fine has not been in the interest of the big newspapers, but specifically in that of small country proprietors. It has been found, in practice, that the operation of this section has been rather ridiculous. The principal Australian newspapers run their business upon proper lines ; but there are hundreds of little country concerns whose proprietors are editors and accountants, and everything else. The electoral authorities have frequently refrained from prosecuting, seeing that it would ruin many a small man to impose a fine, of &#163;500. The penalty of &#163;100 is quite heavy and drastic enough, particularly in view of the fact that the offence is more often unintentional and technical rather than flagrant and deliberate. </para>

            <para class="block">That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Imperial Parliament has recently passed an Act called the Matrimonial Causes (Dominion, Troops) Act 1919. This Act gives the competent Courts of the United Kingdam jurisdiction to hear and determine matrimonial proceedings, such as divorce, judicial separation, and restitution of conjugal rights, notwithstanding any question of domicile or residence, in cases where members of the Dominion Forces have married in the United Kingdom. The Act does not apply to cases in which the parties have resided since marriage in the country of the husband&#39;s domicile, and all proceedings under the Act must be taken within twelve months after it is passed. &#39;Moreover, the Act applies only to the troops of those self-governing Dominions which pass legislation applying it to themselves. It is proposed by this Bill to apply the Act to Australia. Quite a number of our Australian troops, &#39;unfortunately, loved not wisely but too well during their stay in the Old Country. Sometimes, owing to indulgence in rather more drink than was good for them, soldiers have been taken advantage of, and, before they have realized their position, have found themselves married to undesirable women. We do not want that type of creature in Australia, and we do not desire that the soldier should be tied to such a wife. I do not suggest, of course, that these unfortunate marriages have been at all numerous ; nevertheless, there have been a number of very bad cases. With regard to those wives whom our soldiers have brought back to Australia with them, I need scarcely say that we all hope and fully expect that they will be a credit to Australia. I might add, personally, that I would far rather that our Australian boys had married Australian girls. That does not prevent one, however, from extending a very hearty welcome to the many young English wives who have arrived: in this country during the past year or two. </para>

The Government have gone out of their way to provide legislation to meet special cases.

              <para>- I recognise that it all depends upon how seriously we view the marriage sacrament. I take the most conservative view of it, and, therefore, I intend to vote against the Bill. I am not sufficiently conversant with its provisions to argue as to its merits, and, consequently, I ought to content myself with saying that I regret its introduction, and shall call for a division upon the motion for its second reading. To my mind,- it is an unnecessary and useless measure. &#39;I know that a number of our Australian soldiers have brought back with them British brides. Nobody has a right to criticise their action. </para>

              <para>- Even if there be an equal division of responsibility both ways, I still regret the introduction of this measure. Whilst I discharged the duties of Minister for Defence, I was called upon for about one day in each week to deal with a number of heartrending cases in regard to the allotment of maintenance money by our troops. That experience gave me an insight into some very painful incidents which transpired during the early stages of the war-, and the recollection of that experience induces me to regret the introduction of this Bill. </para>

            <para>. - I cannot understand the necessity for this measure unless the idea underlying it is to provide greater opportunities for wrongdoers. The Bill will make divorce easy, because petitioners for divorce will never be able to bring evidence either in England or Australia to which an effective reply can be given. I know that in the Old Country many girls have been married to Australian soldiers under an entire misapprehension. An Act has already been passed by the British Parliament for the purpose of freeing these women&#39; from their chains. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that this Bill is an exact copy of the British Act. </para>

              <para>- The remarks made by the Minister in explaining the provisions of the measure certainly did not convey that impression. Apparently the Bill marks a step towards Imperial Federation, and whether that would be a good thing I cannot say. But it is very singular that it is necessary for a Dominion to take action to render valid legislation which has been enacted by another part of the Empire. I shall follow the example of my LeaderBy voting against the Bill. </para>

            <para>.- One realizes the seriousness of a measure of this kind. The obligation with which it deals is one which is not to be trifled with. On the other hand, I quite recognise that very painful positions may have arisen owing to carelessness on the part of some of our soldiers. It would be a great pity if those men were tied up for the rest of their natural lives in a way that is unacceptable both to them and to the brides to whom they have been united, because of either carelessness or indiscretion on their part. I fail to see that the draftsman of this Bill can have been animated by other than a desire to provide a means of escape for these people. So far, however, I have heard no justification for the Bill beyond a suggestion that such cases do exist. </para>

          <para>SenatorGUY.  -  No. The more we try to hush these matters up the worse they will appear in the public eye. We ought never to be ashamed of the truth. Too much maudlin sentiment is exhibited by us. The result is that frequently some person gets hold of an incident and exaggerates it so as to make it appear ten thousand times worse than it really <inline font-style="italic">is.</inline> Why should we attempt to hide from the public that which they should know?

            <para>. -  The Minister has given a fair explanation of the Bill. We are not discussing the question whether there should be divorce laws or not, and whatever our opinions on divorce may be they cannot be discussed on this Bill. I understand that the English divorce laws are similar to our Australian divorce laws j but an Australian cannot have the protection of the English divorce laws because he is not domiciled in England. This Bill simply gives him the rights he would enjoy if he were domiciled in England. </para>

              <para>- A woman would have to follow her husband to Australia. The Bill enables an Australian soldier in England to be divorced under the English law; and whether there are one or fifty cases does not make any difference at all. The question whether there should be divorce or not is an open one. It is well known that there are some who are opposed to divorce under all circumstances. The people in Australia and in England hold different views on divorce matters ; but it seems that we should give the Australians in England the same rights as are enjoyed by persons domiciled in Great Britain. To me, it is a harmless measure, and one that gives an Australian the same rights as are enjoyed by British soldiers or civilians. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> The British Government have already passed an Act, but it is not one dealing with the whole question of divorce. Although this matter very largely affects the. Australian soldiers, the British Government have practically declined to legislate on an Australian matter without the authority of this Parliament, and that is a recognition of a sound principle. This measure is to give legal domicile for a particular purpose to soldiers who, owing to unfortunate circumstances, were compelled to be in England and Europe for a number of years. Great Britain recognises cer tain evils that have arisen, but they would not legislate on Dominion matters without the authority of the Dominion Parliaments. Great Britain decided to consult the Dominions, and said, &#34; If you wish our Act to apply to your soldiers, you must indorse it; but, if you do not, our Act will not operate.&#34; That is a correct attitude to take up, as it would not be right for Great Britain to legislate in respect of our domestic matters without our consent. No attempt has been made in the Bill to deal with the general question of divorce; and I may say my views on the general question are as strong as those of other honorable senators. The Bill is simply to apply the British law to men who have practically been citizens of Great Britain for a period of four or five years. The Bill is merely to give domicile to certain. Australian soldiers, and to enable them to approach the English Divorce Courts, which, I think will be admitted, are the most conservative in the world. </para>

          <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, a Royal Commission is inquiring into the conditions of the sugar industry, and a difficulty has arisen in connexion with the&#39; investigation owing to one of the principals of a firm - I think the managing director - declining to give certain information to the Commission. Owing to a decision of the High Court, it is very doubtful whether the Commission has power to compel the witness to give the information desired. The Government consider that in modern days such capitalistic undertakings have to be regarded as working in partnership with the people, and that the public has a right to be in possession of information the Government consider essential. The object of the Bill is to give full power to the Commission to demand the production of  information&#39; required. The point in dispute seems to be in connexion with the by-products of sugar. It may be that the full profits from that source have not been revealed ; and, if full information in regard to the sugar industry is to be obtained, this power is very necessary. </para>

              <para>- It should apply to everything. In connexion with these important industries there is a point where they cease to be private concerns. Although their success very often depends largely upon the genius of the business men controlling them, they are dependent for success on the patronage accorded by the community. No private individual should be permitted to baulk a public inquiry when the Government have determined that&#39; the information required is absolutely necessary in the interests of the country. </para>

            <para>. - I intend to oppose the measure. The fact that it is a big institution that is concerned does not affect me in the least. When I am in doubt as to whether an attack is being fairly made, then&#39; I feel inclined to leave things as they are. In this case a rival company may want to get at some particular method of procedure by which another big company is working successfully, and by means of this Bill may get a parliamentary pull over its rivals by the appointment of a Royal Commission to make certain inquiries. Within the last twelve months we have had an experience of the illegal use of power by a Royal Commission, in a way that is a discredit to civilization. I refer to the inquiry conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath,</inline> who ordered an investigation into the banking accounts of quite a number of honorable senators without their knowledge. I would have no objection to the production of my banking account before a Royal Commission, because I recognise that such a request might be quite a legitimate exercise of power on the part of a Commission or Court. In the case to which I refer the Commissioner wired to </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline>a private accountant in Sydney, instructing him to examine the whole of my banking accounts and transactions.. I knew nothing of the instruction, and I understand the private banking accounts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and some other members of the Senate were likewise examined. It is time some complaint was made about the underhand and despicable way in which the authority of- the Crown was exercised in connexion with that matter. Naturally this makes me a bit careful about granting exceptional powers such as are now asked for, when, as I have shown, power already provided by statute law can be used in the way I have described. I was in a most happy position concerning my banking account, which revealed what my position has been all my life. There were no huge sums of money to be accounted for. We appear to be drifting back to the conditions that existed&#39; in the early part of the seventeenth century, when the liberties of the people were interfered with at the will of royalty. In this Bill I see a tendency to disregard the sacred rights of the individual. Not so long ago a certain witness refused to answer some questions put by a Royal Commissioner, and his refusal to answer was upheld by the High Court. No doubt it is very annoying, when information which is badly wanted is withheld by certain witnesses, resting upon their rights as Britishers. I realize, of course, that the big trading Combines sometimes actually discharge the functions of a Government. Just as this Government may increase Customs duties on imported sugar and the Excise duty on manufactured sugar, so the sugar company may tax the whole of the people by raising the price of their product. These big &#39;Combines, therefore, have developed into taxing institutions, and they must be dealt with in a most drastic manner. I do not say, however, that they have not a right to retain their trade secrets. We have no right to pass legislation that will endanger, their trade position in relation to rival companies. The Bill does not suggest that this will happen, but the events that have led to the introduction of the measure convince me that the information was notwithheld without good reason. Usually information is- not withheld without good grounds.  </para>

              <para>- This gentleman states that as the Government have engaged in the. sugar business they should see to it that everybody is permitted to purchase sugar for business purposes. Those big Combines, trading in the necessaries of life, and gaining &#163;d. per lb. here and &#163;d. per lb. there, are really taking upon themselves the functions of government. Freedom of trade is being blocked by this system. But I oppose the Bill, because it may enable a big Combine, by means of a Royal Commission, to obtain important business secrets of rival concerns. I am not inclined to confer the power asked&#39; for upon the  Chairman  of the Commission unless I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary. A witness, by refusing to give information, may be preserving a valuable right. I am not fighting in the interests of the big companies ; I wish merely to safeguard- those who may be called upon to answer questions which might lead to the disclosure of trade secrets that should be. preserved. </para>

            <para>. - I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> misunderstands the purport of the Bill. The preamble states that certain persons named in the Bill have been authorized to inquire into and report upon the sugar industry in Australia and the other matters &#34;more particularly specified in the said letters patent.&#34; Clause 2 provides that the Commissioners appointed shall have the powers of a Royal .Commission. I have heard no great objections to Royal Commissions in the past, and have not heard of any serious objection from the Colonial Sugar Company with regard to this measure. If the company had any objection to it, I have no doubt that some honorable senators would have been informed. The Minister has pointed out that if a witness, when being examined by a Royal Commission, advances a&#39; reasonable objection to publicity, the Commission will meet his wishes and hear him in private. I agree with the Minister that people conducting large and small businesses owe a duty to the public. At this time of &#39;day they cannot demur to allowing duly appointed Royal Commissioners to inquire into their businesses, to discover whether they are being properly conducted from the point of view of the public. I do not think that any persons conducting businesses would object to that, but they naturally object to their secret processes being made public. I can see no objection to allowing these special Commissioners, who are very reputable men, to be clothed with the power of a Royal Commission. That is all the Bill proposes. </para>

          <para>While I am on my feet I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> whether he is  perfectly certain about the action which he attributed to the Royal Commission of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath</inline> was  chairman.  He says that that Commission sent a telegram to an accountant in Sydney, who actually went with it to a bank and inquired into a man&#39;s account. From what I know of banks, no bank manager would allow any&#39; person to look into a client&#39;s account upon merely presenting a telegram instructing him to do so. I think that the accountant must have had an order &#39;from the Royal Commission, and even then it would be immediately communicated by the manager of the bank to the client whose account it was intended bo examine. I cannot imagine the examination of a banking account in secret in the way described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Within the last few weeks there have been reports in the newspapers of the investigations by the Inter-State Commission. There has been some conflict of authority. The Commissioners seem to have believed that they had powers which the. representatives of the sugar company denied to them. . The representatives of the sugar company absolutely refused to answer some questions relating especially tochemical results obtained in manufacture. I suppose that is why there is a special reference in the Bill to the disclosure of chemical results obtained in manufacturing or trading operations. This, no doubt, is to give the Commissioners the right to ask for this special information, and to demand that it shall be supplied. I believe that members of the Commission were not going outside their powers or the scope of their inquiry in asking the  ques-  tions which they did ask of the representatives of the sugar company. </para>

              <para>- I .understand that when the inquiry into the purchase of the Shaw wireless plant was made, the private banking account of every member of the Ministry at the time was investigated. There could not be much objection to that; but there is a strong objection to the accounts of Ministers, or of any one else, being investigated without their knowledge. That was a scandalous proceeding on the part of the McBeath Commission. I should like to know who gave that Commission the power to do anything of that kind. I cannot understand why the Government of the day did not severely censure them for going so far beyond their powers. </para>

              <para>- I know that one of the supporters of the Government told us that one of the purposes of a Bill which the Minister moved the first reading of to-day was to continue the operation of certain regulations under the War Precautions Act. This Commission should be clothed with powers to secure from the &#34;representatives of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company the information which it endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to elicit. Instructions should be issued, however, that the Commission must not do what the McBeath Commission did when it investigated a man&#39;s private affairs behind his back, and without his knowledge. We have asked over and over again that the investigations of that Commission should not remain at the stage where we find them to-day; but we have been refused the request that the Commission should be authorized to further examine the purchase of the Shaw wireless plant and matters incidental thereto. It is scandalous that the investigation should have stopped half way. </para>

One of the reasons why the public are asking for complete investigation is founded upon the very matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> namely, the  Gohduct  of the Commission itself. I hope that the Commission which will inquire into the sugar industry, although composed of wellknown and eminent gentlemen,whose integrity and ability nobody doubts, will be explicitly instructed that upon no consideration may it call into question an individual&#39;s private character without that person being made aware that his affairs are under investigation. </para>

The Government are unable to take full advantage of the Royal Commissions Act by executive act&#39;; parliamentary sanction must be secured. In addition to this Bill being specific legislation to endow the Inter-State Commission with all powers under the Royal Commission Act 1902-12, there is a further clause which proposes to grant them powers to compel answers to questions, and to produce all books and documents relating to financial, manufacturing, . and chemical results. I hesitate to give any Commission, however estimable may be itspersonnel, power practically to compel the disclosure of trade secrets. </para>

I do not think the Senate would agree to a measure to force a manufacturing chemist to disclose the chemical results associated with an article in popular use. I do not see why the Inter-State Commission should desire answers regarding the chemical results of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for the purpose of completing a report which has to do with cost and with selling price, and with profits and production. I would like to see the word &#34;chemical&#34; left out, and then I could have no objection to the Bill. As a business man, I do not see how chemical results can have any bearing upon the profit and loss or production in connexion with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s operations in Australia. </para>
          <para>Mention has been made this afternoon of investigations of bank balances. There are investigations frequently going on in. connexion with the life of public men in various parts of the Commonwealth. I understand that we aTe to have before us to-morrow, when Supply is brought down, a request to agree to the disbursement of money for ,a Commonwealth Investigation Department under the control of the Attorney-General. To my personal knowledge, there has been a good deal of investigation proceeding, even recently, into the affairs of many people in the Commonwealth. I have actually heard that inquiries have been made regarding myself. No doubt, many <inline font-style="italic">dossiers</inline> have been stored away in the pigeon-holes of the Government containing information which it is thought may some day be required. </para>

            <para>. - I intend to support this Bill, but I fail to see why we should appoint Inter-State Commissioners if the Government do not intend to act upon their recommendations. So far, legislative effect has not -been given to any one of them by these gentlemen. When we pay the Inter-State Commissioners high salaries and liberal travelling&#39; allowances we want them to do effective work. We have deputed them to inquire into the sugar industry, and yet the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been able to stand up and defy them.  His  action merely demonstrates the urgent need which exists for an alteration of our Constitution so as to clothe this Parliament with larger powers. A Royal Commission appointed by a State Government is actually a Court, and has power to compel a witness to answer any questions that may be put to him. But when a Commission has been appointed by the National Government, a witness can stand up and defy it. I do not know the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> takes up, hut I am convinced that the Inter-State Commit sion would not ask him to do anything which was unfair.

          <para class="block">Probably, most honorable senators will recognise in this measure an old friend. Personally, I well remember the Navigation Bill when it was being considered in this Chamber. As a matter of fact,  I  had the honour of piloting it through its final stages here. I regard it as a fine, constructive measure, and one which reflects great credit upon the Parliament which passed it. This Bill is not intended to amend the Act. But the war conditions have knocked the Act somewhat out of shape, in some cases to our advantage and in others to our disadvantage. The Bill now before us is intended to enable us to proclaim parts of the Act instead of the whole of it. We shall, of course, have to give reasonable notice to the ships trading along our coa&#167;t, in order to enable them to conform to the provisions of the Act which we propose to proclaim.  I  need scarcely remind honorable senators that whilst the war was in progress the freight from New Guinea was 50s. per ton, but immediately the armistice was signed it dropped to 25s. per ton. Already people, are willing to bring goods here from the Pacific Islands at less than their cost price, not for the purpose of getting the trade from those islands, but for the sake of the opportunity to take goods from here. We do not want competition of that character, which would have the effect of lowering our standard of living. Therefore, we are anxious to apply the coastal provisions of our Navigation Act to the whole of our .coastline,  and also to those islands which have become our dependencies. </para>

But it is possible for things to be too cheap, and I believe the world is about to recognise that there is a standard below which the prices cannot go without involving the white man in degradation. Whilst I&#39; am anxious to see the entire Act proclaimed at an early date, complications would inevitably result from its immediate proclamation. Consequently, we propose to proclaim only certain sections of it upon the lines which I have indicated. </para>

            <para>. - Whilst I shall not oppose this Bill, I would like to get a little more information as to the precise sections of the Navigation Act which it is proposed to proclaim, and also the particular sections affecting the conditions of the seamen which it is intended to bring into operation. I expected that the Act would have beenproclaimed long ago. Had that course been adopted, the recent industrial trouble would have been averted, and the country would have been spared the great loss to which it was subjected. After the measure had been passed by Parliament) we were assured that it would not receive the assent of the King, and we were also told that we feared to proclaim it. All these difficulties, however, have . since been swept away, and yet the Government have merely dallied with it. Now they propose to proclaim it only in sections. It is to&#34; be regretted that the Government donot intend to proclaim the whole of the Navigation Act of 1912, and I trust that the sections which are to be amended and enacted will be the means of better conditions being provided for the men. I trust that provision will be made for a proper inspection of vessels, as at the present time ships are leaving Australian ports in an unseaworthy condition. During the last two or three years, three vessels which left ports close to Sydney were lost, and a number of sailors drowned. It frequently happens that vessels leave these ports before the coal or other cargo they are carrying has been properly trimmed, and in some instances they have totally disappeared. If the passing of this Bill will be the means of better conditions being provided for seamen, and a system of inspection is instituted whereby vessels that are unseaworthy will not be allowed to leave port, I shall be satisfied. If the Minister assures us that the proclamation of these sections will insure the proper loading of vessels, and the provision of suitable accommodation, the Bill should have general support. </para>

            <para>. - The full powers contained in the original Act are not embodied in this measure, but only certain sections with which the Bill specifically deals. The sections relating to the accommodation on ships will be proclaimed at a later stage. That cannot be done at once, as arrangements have to be made in connexion with those vessels which are being transferred to our control. The work of refitting them is being carried out as rapidly as possible. The whole of Part VI. will be proclaimed, and the Government trust it will not be long before all of the provisions of the 1912 Act are in operation. This measure does not apply to the load-line, and the other sections which are not dealt with in this Bill will be proclaimed from time to time. Delay in proclaiming the whole Act has been caused by the difficulty in framing the necessary regulations, but it is the intention of the Government- to bring the whole Act into force at the earliest possible&#39; moment. </para>

            <para>. - I would like the Minister to explain why the Act of 1912, which received the Royal Assent, has not been proclaimed, and why the Government are now endeavouring to rush through a measure of this nature to amend certain of the sections of that Act. It is my intention to offer the strongest opposition to this measure, because it is the duty of the Government to proclaim the whole Act. Two of the sections to be proclaimed do not interest me very much, but I am particularly anxious to see the section relating &#39;to Australian coastal shipping enacted. &#34;Under existing conditions, there is nothing to prevent the Japanese competing on the Australian coast. </para>

Is it fair that an Act, the history of which dates from 1903, when a Royal -Commission was appointed to inquire into the whole matter, and which was passed in 1912, should still be unproclaimed ? </para>

But what is the use of flogging a dead horse? Here, now, is an attempt on the part of the Government to bring the Act into force as soon as possible, and, remembering what he has done for the Australian mercantile marine, I suggest that .he do all in his power to assist the Government in passing the measure so that the Act may be given effect to without any further delay. I am quite sure he would not like any one to charge -him with doing anything to lead to further delay. He is justly entitled to every credit for what he has done in the interests of our seamen; and now that we have an attempt to give effect to the Act, I ask him, in all friendliness, to lend his assistance. </para>

The Government should have sufficient courage to say that legislation passed by this Parliament shall be proclaimed without any further delay.

              <para>- I remember being present at a festive gathering a few weeks ago, and being called upon to defend Parliament from a charge of being the greatest &#34; go-slow &#34; institution in the world. But, after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and remembering that it was in 1903 that a Commission was appointed to investigate the position of our seamen  that the Act was passed in 1912, and that in 1919 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is still demanding the proclamation of that Act, I feel almost ashamed that I did defend Parliament from the charge referred to. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is showing a flash&#39; of his youth again and is stirring up the Government. I hope they will advance some good reason to show why the whole Act should not be proclaimed. The Navigation Act as a piece of legislation is an absolute monument to the capacity of the Federal Parliament. The Government should have the courage to say that Australia governs itself, and that an Act having been passed by a majority in both Houses in this Parliament shall be proclaimed, and they will give effect to it. They are proposing in this Bill to deal with the matter piecemeal. I have no time for men who are afraid of the consequence of what this Parliament has done. </para>

To proclaim the Act need give offence to no other nation. This legislation is ours, and we take the whole of the responsibility for passing it If it contains any provision which in the light of the experience of the years that have passed require amendment we should proclaim the Act in operation as a whole, and then let the Government bring down the necessary Bill to amend it. Under this Bill the Government propose to pro claim certain portions of the Act&#39; applying to certain places. </para>

              <para>- The question before the Committee has reference to the time when this Bill shall come into operation, and in view of the fact that the effect of passing this Bill would be to postpone the proclamation of the Navigation Act as a whole, I am justified in making references to the Navigation Act to show why the Committee should not pass clause 2. The .Navigation Act could be brought into operation without offence to any nation, and it ought to be proclaimed openly and straightforwardly. It will be better for Australia if that course is adopted. If because of some fear we shift and side-step and deviate in_the slightest degree from what Parliament has willed, so much the worse for Australia. I hope that no influence will be permitted to delay the operation of the most magnificent piece of legislation dealing with navigation passed in any Parliament in the world. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is pressing the necessity for proclaiming the Navigation Act upon the present Government, as he pressed it upon the Government of the day when I had a seat on the other side of this chamber.  </para>

Every honorable senator who was a member of the Senate during the time when, the Navigation Bill was under consideration will bear witness to the splendid work which was done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and the great, services he performed on behalf of the seamen. I sat &#39; alongside the honorable senator for about five years, and during that time I think he dreamt of nothing but navigation. What are we trying to do in this Bill ?

              <para>- Although the general principles of the Navigation Act are quite sound, it must be recognised that amendments are required in some direction as the result of developments- since the Act was passed, in connexion with wireless, ship construction, bulkheads, and the general protection of passengers. It is the intention of the Government to proclaim at once the provisions of. the Navigation Act dealing with manning, in order that every ship may be manned with a sufficient crew. In the next place, it is our intention to proclaim those provisions which secure decent accommodation for seamen. Then we intend to proclaim the provisions which will secure the payment of standard wages on every ship trading on the Australian coast. Some reference has been made to trading &#39; by Japanese, but I point out that if this Bill is passed, that matter will be dealt with, because the Japanese vessels will be unable to1 trade on the Australian coast unless the men employed upon them are paid Australian white men&#39;s wages. A fourth principle of the Navigation Act which will be given effect to, if we pass this Bill, is that  dealng  with the competition of coloured crews. That will be  met by  the provision that vessels trading on the Aus-, tralian coast must trade under conditions which will be a bar to the employment of cheap coloured labour. The introduction of this Bill redeems the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on behalf of the Government, that the provisions of the Navigation Act to which I have referred would be proclaimed in &#39; operation at once. The other provisions of the Act deal with questions like wireless and similar questions. Honorable senators will remember that, after the disaster to the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic,</inline> I brought down an amending Navigation Bill, which was framed as the result of a world&#39;s conference that dealt with ship construction, bulkheads, compartments, and the necessity for the despatch of wireless information of the presence of icebergs. That Bill was passed by the Senate, but its provisions are not entirely applicable to the conditions prevailing to-day. The provisions of the Act, which will not be &#39;brought into operation under this Bill apply very largely to trade in other parts of the world. Honorable senators will  agree  that reasonable notice ought to be given to shipowners if they are asked to comply with provisions requiring better accommodation on their boats for passengers and seamen. During the last two years, whilst shipping has been under the control of the Government, we have made every effort to provide accommodation on Australian coastal ships complying with the provisions of the&#39; Navigation Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said that he hopes that this Bill will be rejected, and I ask him, in the circumstances, whether he desires that there should be a delay of even one day in securing to seamen decent accommodation upon the vessels upon which they are employed? </para>

              <para>- Does the honorable senator desire that coloured crews should be allowed to compete with seamen on our coast ? , The drafting of regulations and the organization of the _ staff have not progressed sufficiently to enable us to proclaim the Act in operation as a whole, but that is no reason why Australian seamen should be asked to continue to carry on their work under conditions that are not regarded as satisfactory by any of them. The one desire of the Government is to proclaim the Act as a whole at the earliest possible moment. But if they issued such a proclamation to-morro&#39;w they would find that something like 200 or 300 regulations had still to be drafted to give it real effect. </para>

I may tell honorable senators that I have commissioned boats in Australia during the period of the war that I would not permit to trade in times of peace. &#34;When we had to export our wheat and supplies for our people who were fighting under difficulties on the other side of the world, we could not look too closely into the conditions of the ship. </para>

I cannot understand the delay in proclaiming the Act. It was passed in 1912. I had&#39; the honour to occupy the seat which you now adorn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> during the period of the consideration of ,the measure. The Bill was regarded as a stopgap. It occupied the attention of honorable senators between the passage of one measure and the presentation of another. Whenever the Senate was waiting -for a job, so to speak, we picked up the Navigation Bill- </para>

              <para>- That is probably correct. It was shelved time after time, despite the fact that honorable senators took a peculiar interest in it, although few of them had actual knowledge or experience of sea-going conditions. The Act contains 425 sections, and, although it was passed seven years ago, it has not yet been proclaimed. During the first few months -following upon its passage there were many who wondered what prevented its proclamation. </para>

              <para>- Not for almost two years afterwards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, like myself, became rather impatient as well as curious over the delay.  We were given to understand that there were certain grave difficulties in- regard to the navigation laws of other parts of the world, which .stood in the way. We know that there were, apparently, good reasons for delay. Nevertheless, it was remarkable that a measure to which Parliament had devoted so much time and attention, ad which was practically founded upon an extensive report of a Royal Commission, should, have been so long shelved. It appeared to be singular that a Federal Act should have to wait upon an enactment by the Parliament of another part of the world. </para>

              <para>- I do not know which Government was to blame, or whether one was more blameworthy than another; but honorable senators have never been able to fully understand the causes for delay, &#39;and neither have the seamen around our coasts who were to have benefited by the measure. Of course, when the war broke out there were obvious reasons for still further delay, and no one grumbled very much. Now, however, that we have returned to conditions of peace, people are beginning to wonder once more. The Minister&#39;s explanation, so far as it went, was a fair one. He indicated a number of reasons which, to the Government at any rate, must appear to be good. Further, the Minister has definitely assured the Senate that matters vital to all who earn their living in our coastal shipping trade shall be given_ consideration without any more waste&#34; of time. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has assured <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that they will be brought within the scope of the Bill. The exclusion of cheap coloured labour is another subject to which the Minister re* f erred. The coloured labour problem is serious in the eyes of all white men who earn their living on our coastal shipping. I will support the Bill, because I believe it will confer some degree of benefit. But I again enter my protest against the delay in proclaiming the whole of the Act. Probably no other Parliament in the world has had a similar experience. Seven years ago the Navigation Bill was passed through all stages, but it still awaits proclamation. The Federal Parliament has established an unique record in an age of records. </para>

          <para class="block">I do about this subject. Under this Bill it is proposed that the Government may proclaim those sections of the Navigation Act which permit of seamen who have broken a civil contract being punished as criminals. These are the sections against which I <inline font-style="italic">put</inline> up a strong fight in this Chamber. Honorable senators who were present at the time will recollect that my opposition to them extended over two or three weeks. The Bill which is now before us will empower the Government <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> proclaim those sections of the principal Act which will brand as a criminal a seaman who absents himself from his ship until 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, when he ought to be on board at 7 o&#39;clock. I hold that the whole of the Act should be proclaimed or no portion of it.

              <para>- I am not prepared to trust the present Government. The gaols of Australia are not big. enough to hold all the men who committed offences under the principal Act in connexion with the last maritime strike. That Act contains some 425 sections, and the Government have power to make regulations in respect of 200 of them. The man .who should exercise control over navigation should be a navigator; but I am given to understand that the Government contemplate the appointment of a Director of Navigation who is not a nautical man. Imagine the claims of nautical men who have served in the North Sea during the period of the war, who have been torpedoed half-a-dozen times, when a prize is* offered like the position of Director of Navigation, being turned down in favour of those of a- man who never even volunteered his services to the nation. The passing of this Bill, I believe, is intended to afford a pretext for the creation of a Department of Navigation. </para>

              <para>- The first lot of proposals embraced a fairly large list. The necessity for this measure arises from the fact that if the collection of duties introduced into the other branch of the Legislature <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> 10th August, and 26th September, 1917, and 25th September, 1918, be not validated, the Customs Deportment will be open to claims for refunds by importers.

              <para>- But it should have followed the introduction of a new Tariff Bill. Only a few months ago the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> made a pronouncement in Melbourne as definite as any which has ever been made by any Minister in any country in the world. He said that at the very beginning of this session a Bill to amend the Tariff would be presented to Parliament. What has become of that promise? It has been relegated to the limbo of promises broken by the Government. We are just about to go before the electors, and I am wondering how the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is in charge of this Bill,, and who has always been a Protectionist in words, but not in deeds, will justify his position as a member of the present Government. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;</inline> Gardiner may say that he was influenced by other Free Traders, and that as a result Ministers were prevented from taking definite action. The introduction of a scientific Tariff to assist the establishment of new industries in Australia and those already in operation is urgently needed. It will probably be another year before Parliament will be asked to deal with the new Tariff, and during the whole of that time our Australian industries will be without sufficient protection. Many new industries might -be commenced if they could get the protection that was promised. Before the session opened on the 25th June the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> delivered a speech in Melbourne, in which he said that one of the first proposals to he brought forward in the new session would be a proper Tariff Bill. It is regrettable to realize that nothing has been done. We are again going to the people of Austraia with the same old story, and candidates will be telling the electors that it is necessary to have an up-to-date Tariff to make Australia a self-supporting nation. Under existing conditions raw material is shipped to the other side of the world, where it is manufactured into the finished article by cheap labour, and then returned to this country&#34; after paying a double freight. The whole business must be nauseating to those good Australians who wish to see this country selfsupporting. Unless we can establish new industries, and have our Australian people working under satisfactory conditions, Australia will have a hard row to hoe in trying to meet her enormous debt. Notwithstanding the promise made by the Win-the-War Government, when they appealed to the electors two and a-half years ago, that they would introduce a scientific Tariff, nothing has been done. We are now dissolving Parliament, and the only Tariff placed before us is this pretence. </para>

As the Senate has still about twenty measures to discuss, I do not intend to take up time in defining what I consider a scientific Tariff. This measure is not the redemption of the promise made by the Government, and is merely a Bill to validate the collection of duties on certain items. The people of Australia will now have an opportunity of dealing with those who have . broken their promises, and the members of the Government will realize that they cannot break promises of vital importance as they have done during the last two and a-half years. </para>

            <para>. - I express regret that a schedule is not attached to this Bill showing what the Tariff proposals are, because the Senate is entitled to know exactly what is under discussion. One of the schedules we are called upon to validate goes back to the 10th August, 1917. It is only a short schedule, and deals principally with intoxicants, and in one particular item reduces the duty on cinematograph films from 2d. general and l&#189;d. preference to 1&#189;d. general and1d. preference per foot. The Tariff of the 25th September also deals particularly with intoxicants, and, in effect, raises the duty we are validating on these articles by about 25 per cent. I do not take any exception to the highest possible duties being imposed upon imported ales, porters, and spirits, neither do I take particular exception to. any of the items wo are called upon to validate; but I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the pronouncement made so long ago as August, 1917, by the then. Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> when, by proclamation on the 10th of that month, the Government also prohibited the importation of the following articles : - Ale and other beer, porter, cider and perry, spirituous, in bulk or in bottle; potable spirits, perfumed spirits, and bay rum; biscuits, confectionery, eggs in shell or otherwise, fur apparel, perfumery; jewellery, imitation jewellery and imitation precious stones; bodies for motor vehicles, whether imported separately or forming the part of a complete vehicle. I think honorable senators have noticed the controversy surrounding the recent prohibition of sheep dips. Many honorable senators have also had protests from the reputable English firms of Fry and Cadbury in connexion with the prohibition of confectionery or manufactured chocolates. I do not object to the policy of any . Government which is intended to keep as much work as possible within the boundaries of this continent; and I have argued time and again, and shall continue doing so, in favour of protection for Australian industries. I think, it is a drastic action of the Customs Department to prohibit particular items, and it is not carrying out in a constitutional way the policy of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Not altogether. The Customs Act gives the Minister power to prohibit, but not to reduce duties or dispense with them. Now that peace has come, I earnestly draw the attention of the Government to the question of prohibition.

The Government should not stretch the powers of the Customs Act too far. The </para>

          <para class="block">Act was not intended to allow the Minister to prohibit the importation of certain articles, and by so doing make a favorite of one importer to the disadvantage of another. The policy of the Government would be carried out more satisfactorily by introducing a proper Tariff measure into Parliament, and I hope we have now seen the last of these irregular Customs prohibitions. I again appeal to the Government not to use prohibition by the Customs Minister for building up Australian manufactures, but to regulate trade in a constitutional and legitimate way by bringing before Parliament a schedule of duties. A reduction took place over two years ago in connexion with cinematograph films. I believe our importations of films come principally from America, and I regret that many of them are of a questionable character. I am certainly sorry to see the public of Australia being catered for almost exclusively by what I might term other than. high-class and clean picture films. When the Tariff is introduced, I should like to see the duty on these goods raised, to enable our Australians to. have an opportunity of producing something in accord with Australian sentiment, in place of the thrilling, hare-brained American pictorials now offered to the people. I submit these observations because, on another occasion, I have been ruled out of order in referring to them. I support the validating Bill, and ask the Government not to go too far during the recess with the powers they can use, because little good and considerable confusion will be caused thereby. </para>

          <para>I would point out that a measure for validating the Excise duties is generally laid on the table of the House with the Tariff proposals. Excise duties are being collected on the authority of the Customs Tariff Act 1908-11, and Tariff resolutions introduced on 12th March, 1914. Since the latter date several amendments have been made in the schedule. All Excise duties demanded or collected subsequently were validated &#39; by the Tariff Validation Act of 1917, and similar action is now necessary in regard to the amendments introduced in the present Parliament, and which are specified in the Bill before the Senate. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to refer, in connexion with this validiation of Excise duties, which have been increased by 33 to 50 per cent., to what, from a manufacturing standpoint, is a mistake in imposing Excise duty of ls. per gallon on methylated spirit, which hitherto was practically free. The alcohol is practically destroyed in the process of methylation, and the spirit is used very largely by Australian manufacturers. As &#39; an example, I may state that methylated spirit is used in the manufacture of a disinfectant which is now taking the place of German lysol, so that if an Excise duty of ls. per gallon is demanded on methylated spirits for manufacturing purposes, the cost of the manufactured article must necessarily be increased. I believe that about 900,000 gallons of methylated spirits is made in Australia every year, and that more than one-half of this amount is&#39; used by Australian manufacturers. It is employed in the manufacture of varnishes, lacquers, polishes, liniments, disinfectants, and other productions, and in the denser suburban areas is used in spirit lamps. Many people also buy it in small quantities from grocers for domestic uses. A good many small chemical industries using this spirit have grown Up as a result of the war. One, in particular, I have in mind is&#39; the manufacture of chloroform, which previously was almost exclusively imported from Germany. The owner of this small factory makes just a small amount of profit, which is practically destroyed by the Excise duty, and but for his enthusiasm he would have been discouraged from developing his business. Methylated spirit is used in many other chemical preparations, which are displacing imported articles, but, unfortunately, the imported product, though containing methylated spirit in many cases, comes in duty free. I have had an opportunity of making representations to the Minister for Customs showing how local manufacturers, especially those connected with young and growing industries, are handicapped in this respect, and I feel quite sure that when the schedule was before Parliament the Minister in charge of the Bill could not have fully appreciated the incidence of this Excise duty. I should like to move some addition to the Bill, to exempt from Excise duty all methylated spirit used in manufactures, butI am afraid that after . the lapse of two years it is now too late. I am, however, hopeful that when a scientific Tariff is brought down we shall &#34;not penalize local manufacturers by continuing this Excise duty while at the same time allowing overseas articles containing methylated spirits to come in duty free. I am bringing this matter under the notice of the Senate in the hope that the Minister will consult with his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, so that in the administration of the Act some endeavour will be made to give relief to some of the industries concerned. </para>

            <para>. -  I would not have spoken on this Bill but for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> remarks, which remind me of the fact that I have always been misunderstood in the public life in this country. As a pronouncedFree Trader, Protection to me has always been such an utter fallacy that I never could support the policy. We are now told that certain growing industries are being seriously handicapped by this Excise duty. That complaint invalidates the whole Protectionist doctrine. What is the raw material for one business is the manufactured article for another, and I could never understand how we can make things cheap by means of Protection. I have never bothered much about that matter; but I mayremind honorable senators that we had a. good lesson of what vested interests would do during the period of the war. In that critical time, when the interests of the Commonwealth were in danger, these industries, which in pre-war years were encouraged under the Protectionist policy, took every advantage of the fact that shipping facilities were interfered with and raised their prices to the highest possible limit. I am not a believer in this tinkering with production by means of Excise or Protectionist duties. The only proper course is for the State to undertake production for use and hot for profit. </para>

            <para>.- But for the diatribe of my honorable friend, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> I would not have spoken again upon this Bill. I am prepared to test the feeling of the Committee as to whether the Australian manufacturer shall pay an Excise duty of ls. per gallon on methylated spirits, and whether goods from overseas, and containing methylated spirits, shall come in duty free. If that is one of the articles of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> faith, then I cannot understand it. It certainly is not the faith of a pure Free Trader, and I am equally certain it has nothing to do with the faith of a Protectionist. I am complaining that by this Excise Bill the Australian manufacturers are being unfairly penalized. The Minister will be able to help if he expresses a little sympathy with the manufacturers who are in this unfortunate position, and if he will use his influence with his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, in the administration of the Act. Imports are beginning to come in again, and if we allow some of our Allies to flood the Australian market with dutyfree articles containing methylated spirits and at the same time charge the home manufacturer . ls. per gallon Excise duty, certain small but growing Australian industries will certainly be strangled. </para>

          <para>I wish to say that it is largely a formal measure. When the Premiers met in conference during the war there was an agreement that the Commonwealth should be the only borrower for Australia during the period of the war. Tasmania was the only State that accepted the scheme, and it is now proposed to assist that State by  the redemption of a loan for &#163;300,000. The money market is easier, and the Commonwealth is not likely to be a borrower for some time. But it is desirable to consolidate these loans in Commonwealth stock. It will not increase the debt, but will get rid of the Tasmanian debentures. Tasmania will be liable for interest and for principal when they become due, but to the Commonwealth, instead of to those who now hold the debentures. </para>

          <para>Honorable senators are aware that owing to our soldiers being at the Front, an Act was passed by this Parliament to deal with deceased soldiers&#39; estates. That Act gave the Minister for Defence the power to make full and equitable adjustments amongst the parties concerned in an estate. In . some cases -wills were made, and in some cases, also, their disposition of property was not very clear. The Bill was passed to deal with the disposition of military property, deferred pay, personal apparel, and so on, and under it the Minister for Defence was made the final arbiter in the disposition of the property of deceased soldiers. The operation of the Act during, the period of the war has been most satisfactory. That measure was not introduced, until some time in 1918, but it was not made retrospective to cover the estates of deceased soldiers who had enlisted before the date upon Which it was brought into operation. The object of this Bill is really to make the existing law retrospective to cover all who enlisted. The system which has been adopted has led to simplicity and to finality at an early date in dealing with these estates. In most cases the operation of the measure has been just. It is true that in some cases  we- have paid money to the wrong persons. </para>

            <para>. - This is a small Bill in volume, it consists only of - a few clauses ; but it is not quite the innocuous measure which the Acting Minister for Defence has represented it to be. He has stated that the Defence Department has occasionally, and, of course, inevitably, paid amounts to wrong persons. I know that in some such cases the Department has acted very  generously, and on discovering the right persons have paid them also, and have taken their chance of inducing the persons who received payment wrongly to disgorge. This Bill is deliberately designed to make the Act we passed last year retrospective. We passed the existing Act in 1918, and confined its application to the estates of soldiers who died after a certain date. Since then it has been necessary to deal with the estates of soldiers who died before that date, and the persons interested, as their representatives, in their estates and effects have rightly proceeded upon the assumption that the law would stand as it was before the passing of the Deceased Soldiers&#39; Estates Act of 1918. Now the Senate is asked to agree to a measure which will push the application of the existing law further back than we provided for, and people who have taken action under the correct assumption to which I have referred will have been absolutely misguided and find their conclusions erroneous. I will cite a particular  instance from a letter which was communicated in August last to the Defence Department. For obvious reasons, I do not propose to mention the names of the solicitors acting in the matter or the name of the soldier whose estate was in question. I wish, further, only to say that personally I am not in the slightest degree professionally interested in the matter; I am interested in it only as a member of the Senate. It is as a member of the Senate that my attention was drawn to the procedure of the Defence Department in this connexion and their procedure in relation to this Bill. I may say that in the instance to which I refer there is no doubt whatever that our Act of 1918 does not apply to the deceased soldier&#39;s estate. Those who were concerned proceeded on the assumption which I have just indicated, that the Act does not apply to the estate. It will apply, however, if we, by this legislation, push back the operation of the measure passed last year. Without any apprehension of such action as the Government have taken by the introduction of this Bill, the representatives of the deceased soldier wrote on the 13th August, 1919, to the Secretary of the Department of Defence. This, by -the way, was not the first letter which had passed between the parties concerned. It was one which was despatched in the course of a &#34;long continued correspondence. In their letter the solicitors provided the Defence Department freely and fully with advice upon the Act, in relation to this particular case, which had been furnished to them by leading counsel of Melbourne. The solicitors put all their cards upon- the table and acquainted the Defence Department with the strength of their case. They said, &#34;We do not want to sue, but If we are forced to do so we shall be compelled to&#62; sue the Acting Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise).</inline> We do not desire to serve those Ministers personally.&#34; Eventually, however, they were forced to sue. They asked the Defence authorities if they would instruct the Crown Solicitor to accept service, but they received merely a reply to the effect that the matter would be considered, and that they would be further advised. They gave that response a &#34;chaser,&#34; and got another reply of a similar character. Once more .they asked that the Crown Solicitor be authorized to accept service, so as to obviate the necessity of enforcing personal service upon the Ministers. They heard nothing further until they casually learned through  the columns of the press that the Government were about to shove a measure through Parliament which would prevent them from ever recovering. I will quote the letter of 13th August, and I ask the honorable senators to observe the tone and attitude of the deceased soldiers&#39; representatives. </para>

          <para>With reference to your letter &#39; to us of the 31st ult., we are extremely reluctant to institute legal proceedings to recover the amount of the deceased&#39;s military estate, owing to the smallncss of the amount in issue, and we have accordingly placed the facts ( including your two letters, one dated 16th July,to our client, the executor of the deceased&#39;s will, and the other, dated 31st July, to us) before leading counsel for his opinion thereon, and  Ave  are advised by him that such legal proceedings, if instituted, will be successful, and that the reasons for the refusal of the Minister for Defence to pay the military estate to the executor of the deceased alford no defence. He further advises that, regulation 12 is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> as those regulations are subservient to the Deceased Soldiers&#39; Estate Act 1913, and do not enable the Ministor to take away the Common Law right of an executor who has duly proved the will to require payment of moneys due to the testator, or to make a new will for the testator entirely in opposition to his wishes, and to give his property to persons not in law entitled to it. </para>
          <para>He is also of opinion that, even if regulation 12 were not <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> it has no application to this case, as it merely empowers the Minister, where he considers that there are any special reasons or circumstances which make it inequitable or undesirable to pay the military estate &#34;in the manner provided in these regulations,&#34; to pay such military estate to such persons as are approved by him. </para>
          <para>The words &#34; the manner provided in these regulations &#34; clearly refer to regulations 7 and 8, which apply only to a case where the deceased left a will which the executor has failed to prove, or where no executor is named in the will, or where it is ascertained that there is no legal personal representative. </para>
          <para>Here is a will which has been proved, and the Minister had notice of the fact before he directed the payment to the widow. </para>
          <para>He also advises that section 6 of the Act, which you refer to, affords no protection to the Commonwealth or to the Minister, as clause <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> only relates to dispositions of a military estate in pursuance of the Act, whilst clauses <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> relate merely to dispositions made prior to the . commencement of. the Act, which was the 25th December, 1918. Here the disposition was made long after the commencement of the Act. </para>
          <para>Lastly, ho advises that Part V. of the Administration and Probate Act 1915 has no ap- . plication. That Act enables the Supreme Court or a Judge to direct payment of an amount not exceeding half or a third of the income of the estate of a deceased person for the proper maintenance of the widow and young children, but it certainly does not enable the Minister to do so, and even a Judge will only do it after hearing both sides, and will not act on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements of the widow, nor where it is shown that the failure of the deceased to provide for the proper maintenance of the widow was justified by all the circumstances of the case. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, it only enables a Judge to give a portion of the income of the estate, and not any part of the <inline font-style="italic">corpus,</inline> to the widow. </para>
          <para>We have written to you at somewhat great length, as we are anxious to avoid litigation, and the cost consequent thereon, and we have stated our case toyou fully and fairly, in order to enable the Minister to reconsider his decision, and we propose to delay issuing a writ for one week from this date for that purpose. </para>
          <para>In the event of the Minister retaining his opinion and refusing to pay the amount claimed by our client, we shall be pleased to be informed whether you will instruct the Federal Crown Solicitor to accept service of process, in order to avoid personal service. </para>
          <para class="block">The writ has been issued. The solicitors feel that, little as they desire if, they are bound to incur the expense involved in action. The writ is awaiting service, and they have been asking the Crown Solicitor and the Department for Defence to accept service rather than that the Ministers should be personally concerned. Even at this stage nothing &#39; but formal replies have been received. The solicitors have discovered that a Bill is to be forced through Parliament which will have the effect of defeating their cause. It is a procedure which is against all principle ; it is not a &#34; fair go.&#34; Usually, when legislation of a retrospective character is introduced a clause is inserted to save existing rights and pending proceedings. This is <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> legislation of the worst type. I do not . attribute to the Acting Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> any personal blame or responsibility. I do not expect any Minister to carry in his recollection all the details of individual cases in which his Department may be involved. I feel strongly, however, that before this Bill receives the sanction of Parliament a case such as this, which was obviously pending, and in respect to which the Minister, together with the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> would have been served with a writ but for the courtesy of these solicitors, should be equitably provided for. A case such as this should receive some individual consideration rather than be dragged in with the whole of the general class of cases wherein people have failed to make any attempt to assert their rights, and, indeed, may not have been aware of their rights. Here, the parties concerned were aware of their rights. Thev take counsel&#39;s opinion, which was freely and fully furnished to the Department. The amount concerned is but small; too small, indeed, to justifythe solicitors in going to the expense of litigation. Small as it is, however, it is &#39;doubtless of considerable interest to the clients, and they desire to be freed from costs as far as possible. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has had notice that the will has been proved; and, in ordinary circumstances, the amount should have been paid long ago. But it was not paid, for the reason that theMinister has paid somebody else. The Department has taken the responsibility of paying some other party, in defiance of the will. The Department now claims greater rights in this matter, even than a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria ; who, in dealing with an unprovidedfor widow, would at least hear both sides; and who, if he decided to make an allowance to her, would naturally allow it out of the income from the estate, and would not hand over the whole of the estate itself. We will be doing a manifest and a grave injustice with our eyes wide open if we uphold the attitude of the Government by passing this Bill. Shortly after this measure had been introduced and reference had been made to it in the newspapers, a certain practitioner asked me if I could give him any information regarding it. I pointed out that I had not seen the Bill, and was not  aware of its contents. However, I promised to secure a copy and forward it to him. This I did, and he was thunderstruck to realize that the Bill was of such a character as to wipe out the claim of his clients. What if the clients had said to their solicitors, &#34; You have lost us our cause through your efforts to extend courtesy and consideration to the Ministers. Confound your courtesy ! Why did you not pitch into them?&#34; I do not know whether there are other cases of this nature; but, before the Bill becomes law, it should be amended by the insertion of a clause to save and except from its retrospective operation matters of the character to which I have drawn attention. </para>

          <para class="block">The measure is a. very simple one. When the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, one of the conditions of the agreement entered into with South Australia was that the Commonwealth &#39;should build a transcontinental line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In connexion with this condition, it was arranged that the Commonwealth should acquire the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and should grant South Australia equal facilities for the transport of goods and passengers over it, to those provided by that State, and at rates not exceeding those which were in force at the date when the agreement was made in 1907. Since then, conditions have considerably changed, and the. South Australian Government have been compelled to raise the freights and fares on their own lines. But under the agreement which was entered into on the occasion to which I have referred, the Commonwealth cannot increase its &#39;rates upon  this particular railway. An arrangement has, therefore, been concluded between the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth, under which the former will permit the latter to charge rates upon it equal to those which may be in force from time to time in South Australia. The Bill aims at ratifying this arrangement. As everybody is aware, since the original agreement with South Australia was entered into, the wages of railway employees have been increased, and the cost of coal - indeed, of everything connected with railways- has been considerably enhanced. As a matter of fact, there is not a State in which the railway fares and freights have not been materially increased since 1907. Yet the Commonwealth has been unable to increase the rates on this particular line, and the South Australian Government have now agreed to release us from this disadvantageous arrangement. We hold that, as the line is practically a portion of the South Australian railway system,  we  should be permitted to charge similar rates to those charged &#39;by the South Australian Government. The  line  has not proved a wonderful success, and the additional revenue which will be gained under this Bill will materially assist us in financing it. Upon most other lines, freights have risen 10, 12, and even 15 per cent. I believe that most honorable senators desire to see railways constructed, particularly in the more distant parts of Australia. But if we are obliged to run our lines . at rates which are obviously too low, we shall only succeed in piling up a debt which will seriously prejudice future railway construction in this country. </para>

However, the Bill is of much less importance, and I suppose that South Australia will have to defer her just claim to the fulfilment of the agreement under which the Commonwealth is pledged to construct that railway. I understand that the matter to which this Bill relates is the subject of an arrangement between the South Australian and the Commonwealth Governments. </para>

            <para>. -  As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which conducted an inquiry into this matter, I may say that this Bill is based upon one of its recommendations. It relates to quite  a  simple matter, which was overlooked at the time the agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australia, and, owing to- the insertion of a wrong word in that agreement, South Australia has always held that the CommonAvealth could not increase its rates upon the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. It is now recognised that the expenses of running the line are increasing each year, and that the losses upon it are becoming extremely heavy. Six months before it Avas taken over by the Commonwealth, a very small profit was made upon it by the South Australian Government. But ever since that time nothing but losses have been incurred, and these losses are rapidly increasing. </para>

              <para>- To the increased cost of running the line. The Public Accounts Committee dealt with this matter in detail. It is absolutely necessary that the rates charged upon it shall be increased. Of course, wehave been assured by the South Australian authorities&#39; that if the rates are increased traffic upon the line will fall off. However, we must be prepared to face that contingency. It is not the ordinary traffic upon the line which will pay, in any circumstances, so much as the cattle trade. Even with , the increased charges the line will not prove remunerative. But this Bill will enable the Government to levy increased rates, and thus to reduce the  loss which is being incurred by the Commonwealth to the extent of many thousands of pounds annually. </para>

            <para>. - I recognise that the principle underlying this Bill is&#39; a just one. &#39;It is; not reasonable to expect the Commonwealth to continue running, a railway like that from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta at a loss, or at different rates from those charged upon the line connecting with Terowie. Some honorable senators may recollect that a large portion of the traffic which used to pass over this line has been stopped. I refer to the number of cattle that used to be conveyed from Oodnadatta, even to the Melbourne market. There has been a large diversion qf this traffic, owing to the difficulty experienced in getting stock from the locality indicated, consequent upon the embargo placed upon its entry into South Australia from Queensland. It was this stock  traffice  which enabled the line to be worked at a profit. It is also well known that for some years South Australia has been suffering from severe droughts. These have made it very difficult for stock to reach Oodnadatta. Quite recently the South Australian Government have expended a large sum of money in sinking artesian wells along the recognised cattle route, so as to facilitate the travelling of stock. In view of these facts, I do not think that any honorable senator, can object to this Bill. Under it the Commonwealth will not be able to charge any higher rate than the South Australian Government . would be able to charge if they possessed this particular line. But I do hope that the time is not far- distant when we shall all recognise that the true terminus of the railway is Port Darwin. If such an extension were carried out I believe that the line could be worked at a profit. Until then it cannot be expected to pay. Even if it were pushed forward only as far as the Macdonnell Ranges&#39;, it would provide facilities for the working of that &#34;highly metalliferous belt of country, and would bring very much nearer to us an area which is admirably suited to pastoral pursuits. Some honorable senators may have visited Oodnadatta- </para>

              <para>- I thank you, sir, for your timely reminder. Yet it may be interesting to honorable senators to know the influences which affect the traffic upon this particular line. In summer, Oodnadatta is certainly a very dry place. But it was never the intention of the South Australian Government that Oodnadatta should be the terminus of this line. The far-seeing statesman who planned it and who authorized its construction to its present terminus - I refer to the late Honorable O. C. Kingston - intended that the line should go farther, and serve the western district of Queensland as well as the Northern Territory. It is because the original plan is incomplete that there is a possibility of honorable senators taking exception to its construction. When the original intention has been fulfilled I am certain that the line will be as valuable to the Commonwealth as the overland line between Melbourne and Adelaide. I well remember the time when the arguments that are being brought forward in connexion with this proposal were used in relation to the present connexion between South Australia and Victoria. It will be for those who follow us to draw attention to the wisdom of Parliament in passing this Bill, which will be the means of encouraging development, in that important part of the Commonwealth. There is nothing in the Bill which will be prejudicial to either State, as it embodies an agreement between the Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">The amendments of the War Time Electoral Act 1917 provided for in this Bill  arise from the changed conditions in regard to members^ of the Forces as a result of the cessation of hostilities and the return of the men from overseas. The number of men who will not have returned to Australia by the 13th December will be very small; 250,000 have already returned, S,000 are on their way  back,  and there are about 12,000 overseas. By the 13th December it is expected that all except 6,000 will have returned to Australia. It is, however, recognised that many of the unenrolled men will return to late to secure enrolment for the forthcoming elections, and that owing to sickness and other causes some who may have returned prior to the issue of the writs may not be enrolled, although every effort is being made to secure their enrolment under the provisions of the Electoral Act. The regulations will provide all necessary machinery. Where for any reason a returned member of the Forces is not enrolled as an elector at the time the rolls close for the purposes of the election, he will be able, on application, to obtain a certificate from the District Commandant. This certificate, after being indorsed  by  the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State with the name of the division for which the applicant is entitled to vote in pursuance of his military or naval enrolment, will enable  him  to  Vote  on polling day at any polling place in the State. If the applicant returned member indicates on his application that he is sick or infirm, absent from his State, or within his State,  but  more than 30 miles from a polling  booth,  he  will  be furnished with a postal vote certificate and the necessary ballot-papers to enable him to vote by post. Unenrolled members of the Forces who reach Australia from abroad at any time after the receipt of nominations for the elections will be enabled to vote before the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, or an officer authorized by him, at the first, or any subsequent, port of call, being the capital city of a State, or the port of such capital city. To this end the Defence authorities- will furnish the several Commandants with complete lists of the men on each transport, as soon after embarkation as practicable, so that certificates may be issued by the Commandants and indorsed by the Commonwealth Electoral Officers in the States in which the men enlisted and transmitted, prior to the arrival of the vessel, to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer. The Commonwealth Electoral Officer will take the votes, which, in due course, will be transmitted to the Divisional Returning Officers for the divisions in respect of which the men are entitled to vote, for the purposes of scrutiny. . Where it is found that returned men who arrive in Australia after the receipt of nomination axe enrolled they will be enabled to vote by post at the first, or subsequent, port of call of the vessel, before a Divisional Returning Officer. Lists of their names and particulars of enrolment will be forwarded to that port by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for each State concerned. Where returned men vote under this provision at any time up to and inclusive of polling day, their ballotpapers will be admitted to the scrutiny. These provisions will afford all concerned an opportunity of voting either as absent voters or by post, and the regulations will provide the necessary safeguards. It is proposed to repeal- sections 15 and 16 of the Electoral (War Time) Act, inasmuch as these provisions were designed to meet a possible contingency arising in connexion with party voting by men overseas which will not operate in the forthcoming elections. I- do not think that exception will be taken to the measure, because there are special conditions prevailing at present to prevent such men from enrolling. The Bill will also enable soldiers to vote irrespective of age, as it would be difficult to definitely ascertain whether they were eligible in that respect or not. </para>

          <para class="block">This is a Bill of a technical nature, and may be described as formal. At present, loans must be raised in accordance with the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act  Or  the Treasury Bills Act, but doubt has arisen whether those Acts are sufficiently wide to enable the Government to comply with legal requirements in connexion with borrowing outside Australia. For example, Dominion loans raised in London  are subject to the Imperial Acts known as the Colonial Stock Acts 1877-1900, and the authority of the Commonwealth Treasurer to borrow is set out in much detail in the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act. The latter, though in effect the same as the Colonial Stock Acts of Great Britain, is slightly different in verbiage, and the proposals now submitted to the Senate will prevent any clashing which may arise from the different wording. Exact compliance with the law of Great Britain is very important, because Commonwealth stock issued in London under conditions other than those set out in the Colonial Stock Acts could not be made a trustee stock, and if trustees could not&#39; invest in a Stock it would suffer great disadvantage. Another important requirement of English law is that the Legislature of the borrowing Dominion must have made due provision for paying money in accordance with the judgment of any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United Kingdom. The Bill includes provision in this direction. The Government are not asking for authority to borrow any money in addition to that which it is already authorized to raise. Honorable senators have my assurance that the Bill will give to the Government no authority exceeding that which it now possesses in relation to loans raised within Australia. Honorable senators will realize that a good deal of Australian stock is held in London and in other parts of the United Kingdom, and if there should be any doubt concerning the legality of holding it as trustee stock, it would influence values. Realizing, therefore that it is sound business to come into line in this way, I ask the Senate to support the passage of the Bill. </para>

          <para>Honorable senators will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> promised to bring the munition workers under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act, to enable them to participate in the benefits of our repatriation scheme. Nearly all the amendments proposed in this Bill are of machinery character, and such as the working of the Act has shown to be desirable. Many of them are of a technical nature, and can best be explained in Committee. There is, however, one important amendment proposed by the Bill, in clause 2, by which it is proposed to extend the benefits of the Act to munition workers and war workers. This amendment has been foreshadowed on mora than one occasion by the Minister for Repatriation, and will, I think, meet with general approval. It will affect 2,053 munition workers, including chemists and constructional draughtsmen; and 2,243 war workers, including labourers, fettlers, and navvies. Another new provision will curtail the use of the words &#34; War Service Homes &#34; in advertisements, &#38;c, by estate agents. Some of these advertisements are calculated to give the impression that the advertiser is carrying on his business under the authority of the Act or the Commissioner, and it is considered that the use of these words in this manner should be stopped. I do not think I can add any more. It is a simple measure, and one that I think honorable senators will support. </para>

          <para>A telegram, dated 14th October, was received, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> by the Minister for Home and Territories, the details of which, in fact, were published in the press, which refers to statements by those who attended at a deputation Upon the officers concerned, that certain revelations were made at the last Advisory Council, after which the deputation declared it to be absolutely criminal to allow the officers to remain in the Territory. </para>
          <para>The Minister telegraphed immediately, in reply, directing the officers to remain in the Territory, and stating that anything requiring investigation must be submitted in the regular way, and that no communication had been received as to the alleged revelations at the Council meeting. A telegram from the Director, in reply to this, stated that the alleged revelations were extracts from a personal letter written by him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> on the 8th July, .when he was out of the Service, that the letter was stolen either from the Northern Agency or Post Office, and given to Nelson </para>

It is stated, that it is impossible to send details without the context, but that a copy should reach the Minister before the end of that week. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> stated that he courted the most searching inquiry regarding the letter, and every action of his in the Territory in or out of the Service; that Evans was charged with permitting the Chief Protector of Aborigines, one Cahill, junior, to sell his old bicycle to the natives;  and that an official inquiry was being made into them.. </para>
