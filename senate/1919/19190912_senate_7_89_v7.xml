I will submit to my honorable colleague the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> the suggestion which I imagine is contained in the honorable senator's question for the removal of the exemption to which he refers. I assume that I shall be at liberty to assure the Treasurer that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will support such an amendment of the Act. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that speeches on the second reading of a Bill should deal only with its general principles, but as this is such an unprincipled measure I feel that I shall be out of order during the whole of my remarks upon it. There are no general principles in it, If it were characterized as a measure to annoy, disturb, and aggravate the community, that would be only a fair description of it. I realize that my remarks upon it will fall upon deaf ears when addressed to the majority who control the business of the Senate at the present time. It is customary on the eve of an election - and I take it we are supposed to be approaching very rapidly such an occasion - to say that measures introduced by' the Government are of a window-dressing character. I congratulate the Government on this occasion upon introducing a measure which is calculated to cause more annoyance to the people of this country than any measure previously introduced in this Parliament. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>What are we asked to do by this Bill? I do not wish to make any personal reflections on the Minister who introduced <inline font-style="italic">it;</inline> but <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> appears to me that some subordinate officer of the Public Service got hold of some war precautionary measure dealing with aliens passed in Great Britain during the war, and for war purposes only, and has embodied it in this Bill, which he expects this Parliament to pass.. I suppose that he knows the temper of this Parliament sufficiently well to feel assured that there will be no criticism of it so far as supporters of the Government are concerned. The only effective criticism of a measure of the kind is to be looked for from those representing the outside community, who hold definite opinions on the- matters which we are called upon to discuss here. When they put forward reasonable objections to Government measures, it is assumed that honorable senators on this side are merely carrying out perfunctorily the formal duties of an Opposition. But, after reading this Bill from beginning to end, I challenge any honorable senator opposite to give one justification for it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> failed to do so yesterday in introducing the measure. He said, incidentally; that we must have some means of regulating the introduction of undesirable aliens, but this Bill makes no attempt to provide such means. </para>

                            <para>- If we cannot find out where they are by some method more effective than that proposed in this Bill, then the ineptitude of the Government is better illustrated by this measure than I have yet known it to be. When the Minister was speaking yesterday, I was giving some attention, to the duties which will fall upon the Government in keeping the- records necessary to enable them to continue in touch with the whole of the aliens visiting this country in order that they may be iu a position to detect the undesirables ' amongst them. I take it that what the Minister has iu mind in introducing this Bill is that the Government shall be' in a position to deal with undesirable immigrants. I asked whether the Commonwealth Police- would be engaged for this purpose, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> in his references to the matter, seemed to convey the idea that that body, had gone out of existence. When I look more closely into the Bill, I find that it is not the: intention of the Government to engage an army of officials to carry out the work of its administration, but that the measure itself makes it an offence on the part of private citizen* not to do this work for the Government. Whenever I speak of shipping matters, I feel- that I may be trespassing upon the preserves pf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and, therefore, I ask the honorable senator to direct his attention to tha duties which this Bill will throw upon masters of vessels coming to Australia. I ask him,1 as a seaman's representative, and one having a knowledge of the duties of masters of vessels, whether he thinks it a fair thing that, under this Bill, 'we should. make it an offence on the part of the captain of a ship, not to register in triplicate the nationality and all the other particulars required to be registered under this measure of every one on board that ship? </para>

                            <para>- Clause 19 distinctly states that any officer may at any time arrest, without warrant, any person who he has reasonable ground to believe has committed an offence against the Act. I may have read it wrongly; but it does not say that any officer, on a charge that a person had committed an offence, could arrest him whilst he was coming down the street. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has interjected that there is nothing of the kind in the Bill, and then endeavours to twist the clause round and say that what I have said is not there. </para>

                            <para>- I am not at all surprised at the Minister's statement, because I have realized for a considerable time that this Government have lost all sense of proportion regarding the rights of the outside community and of themselves. They are wholly departing from the beaten track and interfering with the rights and liberties of individuals, instead of endeavouring to preserve them. The difference between the conditions under which we live and those that would exist if this Bill were passed is that now, if I am arrested without sufficient grounds, I have my redress at law, but the law we are enacting here is that, if, in the opinion of the officer arresting, he has reasonable ground for suspicion against n person, he can arrest. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not see the difference, although it must be clear. </para>

                    <para>But to try to prevent the introduction of legislation of this kind is quite a useless task with a Senate constituted as this is. The Minister did not give us any reasons for the introduction of the Bill; and, in my opinion, a measure that was passed in Great Britain for war-time purposes has been slavishly copied here now the war is over.Let us consider the inconvenience that will be caused to the people I represent, and to the people we all represent in the various States, and see what is likely to result. Before putting the community to an immense amount of trouble, reasons should be given for the proposed legislation. The Australian Labour party is sometimes referred to as a party which interferes with everybody's business; but the Labour party is not responsible in this instance The liberty of the individual should be interfered with as little as possible, consistent with the liberty of every other individual in the community. </para>
                    <para>Who is to- be the registrar to whom the shipmasters shall report? Are the Government going" to appoint special officers for that particular purpose? If we have an Act of Parliament compelling people to do certain things, we ought to put it on such a basis that the law will easily be carried out. Further, if we are going to compel every shipmaster to register in triplicate the nationality of his crew and passengers, there will have to be an officer to perform the work at every port. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for his information ; but if he will study the matter he will see that practically every port in Australia will at some time or another be the first port of call of some ship, and, therefore, registrars will be required there. I fully understand that a shipmaster has to register only at his first port, but for the reasons given it will be necessary to have an officer at every port. Vessels coming from India and the East will probably make Fremantle their first port of call, and most of the registration in that trade will be done there. We have to remember, however, that an incoming vessel may call first at Port Augusta and other such places, and. there would have to be registration officers there. There are also such outlying ports as Thursday Island, Port Moresby, and Rabaul, and we are creating, conditions that will necessitate registration officers being appointed at every port where a vessel is likely to make her first call. </para>

Seeing that the second read ihg of the Bill was only moved at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and; remembering what has since occupied the attention of members of both branches of thisParliament, I may be pardoned for presenting my views in a somewhat undigested manner, and, perhaps, for chewing over some of the proposals twice. Let me now direct attention to the effect which this measure will have upon our own people. Clause 13 provides - </para>

                    <para>Under this Bill the Government propose to impose on the lessees of all furnished or unfurnished rooms the obligation of keeping a register. Let us see what is to be recorded in that register. Hitherto it has been the practice in the closing days of a session preceding an election, for the Opposition to accuse the Government of " dressing the window." I do not intend to copy that example, but nothing will give me greater pleasure than to show the hotelkeepers of this country the obligations which the Ministry desire to impose upon them. Under the Bill it will be necessary for the proprietors of all large hotels to keep massive ledgers, which will involve extra clerical work. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly! The registrar must be correctly informed of the nationality of every man who stays at an hotel. If we make it an offence for an hotelkeeper to allow any American to stay at his hotel without registering his name, nationality, &amp;c; and if there are thousands of visitors to that hotel, we shall compel the hotelkeeper to inquire into the nationality of every one of them. Then there is a penalty for false reports. Look at the inconvenience to which a visitor from abroad will be subjected under this Bill? </para>

                            <para>-Let me suppose that, after this Bill becomes law, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> visits the Hotel Australia, in Sydney. What will probably happen? The manager will immediately say, " Here is a French gentleman. I know that from his appearance." The French gentleman will thereupon explain that he is of Irish descent. Then the registrar will probably be summoned, and the hotel manager will say to him, " Here is a suspicious case of a man who looks like a Frenchman, but claims to be an Irishman, and talks like a Scotchman." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> will then be asked for his passport. But he will not have one. He will say that he has only come from Brisbane. In such circumstances the hotel manager will occupy a most embarrassing position. Yet that is the position in which every hotelkeeper will be placed in relation to every visitor. In my opinion we have not yet reached the time when legislation of this character is warranted. The Minister in charge of the Bill has shown no necessity for its introduction. He has merely affirmed in a vague way that it is necessary to deal with undesirable aliens. I admit that it is. But merely because , an occasional undesirable alien comes to this country it is not necessary to make the lives of business people here almost intolerable by means of a foolish, petty, and unwarrantable interference with them.Under the Bill, what will be the position occupied by the boardinghousekeeper? </para>

                        would then explain that he is a well-known figure in the public life of Australia. But the boardinghouse-keeper would say, " That kind of - bluff won't do here. We paid a fine of £100 on account of a man who looked just as respectable as you do." Or, conceivably, he might say, "We narrowly escaped paying a fine only because the magistrate took a lenient view of our case, and said that we were justified in regarding the visitor to whom exception was taken in the light that we did."

Honorable senators who move from place to place must remember how inconvenient was the custom before Federation, of searching baggage at Albury when a person was travelling from New South Wales to Victoria. I can well remember how awkward this experience was when some polite Customs official came along and required me to turn out my bag to see if I was trying to smuggle something into Victoria.' That system was an unnecessary interference with the rights of people who moved from place to place, and the same objectionable principle is embodied in the Bill under notice. It is an attempt to introduce into Australia the continental system, under which a man may not move from one town to another without a passport, which somebody else might pilfer from him. </para>

Under this Bill every boardinghouse-keeper . and every hotelkeeper will be required to keep a register for the inspection of every officious policeman who cares to come along. A boardinghouse-keeper, perfectly reputable in every respect, might have lodgers who entertained a foreigner unawares, and if this came under the notice of an ambitious constable seeking promotion, he would immediately have the case before the Court. The magistrate might agree that there were mitigating circumstances so far as the boardinghouse-keeper wa3 concerned, but he would be guided by the intention of Parliament, and ask the lady of the house if she kept a register. She would probably reply that she did not know that the law required her to do so, and the .magistrate, recognising that ignorance of the law is no excuse, would be obliged to impose a penalty upon her. </para>

I am not concerned about aliens coming into this country. So far as their nationality is concerned, Americans are alien, and surely we can meet them as men and brothers ? </para>

I claim that we should not create offences and make offenders of a section of the community, allowing every other section to be unmolested. That is what this Bill will do. From the day that this Bill passes it will be extremely difficult for any traveller to obtain hotel accommodation without a prior cross-examination on the' part of an hotel-keeper, and that should be unnecessary in a freedom-loving country like Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but there are some hotelkeepers who think that the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and myself on the liquor question are indecent. Quite a number of excellent hotelkeepers view with disfavour all people who hold pronounced views on temperance questions. In this case, I think I am the only individual representative of total abstinence who is speaking on behalf of hotelkeepers ; but I am not thinking of their interests only. I am thinking of the interests of  the whole community. The war lasted for over four years, and although we have many thousands of enemy aliens in Australia, I do not think any honorable senator can say that, during all. those years, they caused any unnecessary trouble. </para>

                            <para>- I read one clause three times, and risked being pulled up by the  President  for tedious repetition. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mdllen</inline> will point to one statement of mine that was not directly dealing with the Bill, then, when we reach the Committee stage, I shall prove relevance by quoting the clause to which I was referring. The interjection has weight as it comes from the Minister, and it carries weight, also, when it remains in the press uncontradicted. But the cause which rests upon falsehood alone is doomed. One may carry on for a while by means of misrepresentation, but not for ever. The Minister did not attempt to justify the Bill when he introduced it.  His  action is merely tantamount to taking a. British war measure and implanting it within the statute-books of the Commonwealth.Its application in this country will prove an unnecessary, unwise, and unjust interference with the rights of the people of Australia. Does the Constitution make provision for the Commonwealth 'Government to interfere with the business conduct of a private person within any State? We have no more right to legislate with respect to what a hotelkeeper or a boardinghouse proprietor shall do within any one State than we have to coerce a ship-owner. The Commonwealth Legislature passed a law to grant compensation to men who became injured while working on board ships. In a certain instance compensation was granted, whereupon there was an appeal ; and the Courts held that the Commonwealth authorities had no right to interfere in a matter solely concerning shipping within the waters of one particular State. 'The Commonwealth Parliament may legislate as it likes in regard to aliens entering this country;but we cannot compel private citizens to become our agents, to constitute themselves the keepers of records and the furnishers of information. The Commonwealth authorities must provide their own staffs for such services, otherwise they will be exercising the same degree of tyranny as is wielded in some of the older countries of the world. </para>

Is it wise to strain our constitutional powers? What are our constitutional powers in relation to business conducted within any one State? The Minister may say that this measure represents only a small infringement of our constitutional powers. He may affirm that it only goes a little way in trespassing upon the Tights of private individuals and business people within the States; and that, for that reason, we should pass the Bill. The Minister adopts the attitude that no one will take much notice of this infringement. Section 51 of the Constitution Act states - </para>

                        <para>. -  However much one may admire the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> for the manner in which he carries out his duties with regard to the supervision and criticism of all measures coming before the Senate, I am bound to say that were he placed in a position of responsibility in connexion with immigration to-day he would be compelled to approve of the principle of registering those aliens who may in future enter Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in his ingenious and often thorough manner, has thrown into  relief some of the weaknesses of various measures debated in this chamber; but in this instance he and 'his colleagues must surely agree with the principle that for the future Australia should have more complete control over the introduction of aliens. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in his second-reading speech, remarked that similar legislation had been adopted in, or was being introduced into, the Parliaments, not only of the Mother Country, but of the United States of America, and of Canada, and of other British Dominions as well. I have had the privilege of seeing some of the methods employed with regard to alien immigration in the New World. I was in the United States of America when immigration to that great country was practically at its maximum.' That was during i907 and 1908. Those who " boosted " the country which some cynics occasionally describe as " The land of the wooden ham," were proud of the fact that they were receiving a net immigration, at that period, of nearly 1,000,000 persons per annum. They were proud, too, that their land was looked upon as the land of freedom. In conversation with certain . responsible leaders of thought in that great country, however, I heard grave doubts expressed whether this .wholesale policy of immigration should be permitted to continue. Already the. United States of America has one racial problem in its coloured population; and, by its policy of unrestricted immigration, it would seem, at any rate in the opinion of many thoughtful people, that America has gone dangerously close to inflicting upon itself another racial problem; I refer to that of the unassimilable peoples of Eastern Europe. We are apt to speak of the United States of America as an Anglo-Saxon community; but, roughly, that aggregation of about 100,000,000 people includes 10,000,000 negroes. About- one-third of the remaining population consists of citizens of Anglo-Saxon descent or birth; about one-third are of Teutonic and Scandinavian descent ; and nearly one-third - or 30,000,000 people - are of Magyar, Polish, Russian, or other Eastern European blood. The problems of the alien are extremely difficult. We do not read much , nowadays in the newspapers concerning the internal happenings of the United States of America; but even in that free land, and actually before the war, alien im-migration restrictions had been consider: ably tightened up. I spent a day at Ellis Island, New York, the great immigra-tion depot, and I noted that, but for the fact that immigrants were examined, regarding their worldly possessions and in relation to their physical health, there did not appear to be any disability, placed upon those - from no matter what corner of the world  they came - who sought to enter the United States of' America. I must add, however, that even respectable travellers from Australia were still subjected in the United States of America to a poll tax of $5 per head. I believe that tax is still" collected. If the United States authorities so carefully examine immigrants in regard to their physical fitness, it is reasonable to assume that, in view of our experience with aliens during the war, Australia should institute some form of examination with respect to the temperamental fitness of newcomers to live, amongst us. However slack the restrictions may have been- concerning immigration into Canada and the United States . of America during the .war, it must be. remembered that, owing to there being no restrictions whatever in the Mother Country, a huge problem of unassimilable alien population has arisen, particularly with regard to the population of the city of London. Before the war, an agitation against the so-called free trade in immigration iri the United Kingdom was assuming very large proportions, and, even had the war not come, some restriction would have been placed upon the entry into and residence of foreigners in Great Britain. I will go so far as to say that had the United Kingdom, Australia. Canada, and the United States of America provided before the war for some such restriction as was brought before this Parliament and the Parliaments of some of the Allies during the war we should have been saved a considerable amount of espionage and trouble that was built up for us by our then potential enemies, and which cost us probably thousands of live? and millions of money, if it did not bring the war very much closer to us than would otherwise have been the case. I therefore support this Bill most heartily. Honorable senators may consider some of its details redundant, and may not agree with all of them, but I heartily support the principle of the measure for the further restriction of aliens in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- During the war, this matter has necessarily been controlled by the military authorities. I think- that in some cases the military authorities, as they often are, were guilty of stretching the law to an extreme point I am glad to learn from the Minister who introduced the measure that its administration in peace time will be in the hands of civilian authorities. I have personal knowledge of the fact that disloyalty, if not an attempt against the safety of Australia, was chargeable against aliens in our midst during war (time which could not have been' checked  tot  kept within reasonable bounds but for the arbitrary, and autocratic control of these matters by the military authorities. Even some aliens who had married Australian women, and had had Aus-' tralian children born to them, during the  war  time trained those children to salute the Kaiser every day. That is not the kind of spirit I propose to stand for in this free land. Honorable senators opposite should remember that when peace is ratified, and the War Precautions Act expires by effluxion of time, this Bill will be administered by the civilian .authorities, and presumably by the Customs- authorities. I stand here for the principle of protection ;to your people and the products of their industry. I will no more stand for the dumping of the people of foreign countries into this land than I will stand for the dumping of foreign goods. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is extremely necessary, in the interests of Australia, in view . of the number of extremely undesirable persons who may be regarded as the flotsam and jetsam of the war who are floating about the world at the present time,' that the Government of the day, to whichever party they may belong, should possess stringent powers to enable them to keep such people out of Australia. America has undertaken restrictive immigration legislation ; Canada will do so; and the United Kingdom, for its own safety, cannot continue to permit the unrestricted immigration of aliens, which was proved to be such a weakness before the war. For these reasons, I heartily support the second reading of the Bill. It may be that in. Committee honorable senators will find that some- of the clauses are unnecessary. I am not here to impose unnecessary restrictions. I do not stand for' unnecessary interference with those who are carrying on legitimate business in Australia, but I do stand to prevent the dumping of aliens as well as the dumping of alien goods into Australia. </para>

To put up a skittle and then knock it down to his own satisfaction may be a pleasing pastime  £ot  the honorable senator, but it has no bearing upon the question now before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> as a Protectionist, to be logical, would oppose the importation of any foreign-made goods into this country, but neither the honorable senator nor any other supporter of that policy has ever advocated the adoption of that course. They want the foreign-made goods imported that they may be taxed to provide necessary revenue, and so avoid the necessity of a straight-out land, value tax. That is their objective, and it is easily understood by men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others, and accounts for the position they occupy in this Parliament. </para>

There is nothing in this Bill to prevent al most undesirable foreigner from making his home in Australia with a private citizen, and thereby escaping the necessity of registration, and the taking of his finger prints, and so on. The Bill is absolutely valueless to prevent the introduction of foreigners. </para>

                    <para>I quite realize that in America, through the greed of some of the big land-owners there in years gone by, in importing cheap black labour, they are now faced with a. problem which it will require a very great many years to satisfactorily dispose of if it is ever definitely solved. The Americans are not going to get rid of the 10,000,000 of black people in that country for a great many years to come. I realize also that America is faced with another very knotty problem, due to the wholesale importation of people from South-eastern Europe, who have no knowledge whatever of the English language, and who live in communities by themselves, and will continue to do so for many years to come. This Bill does not propose to prevent a repetition of that kind of thing in Australia. All' that it proposes is to throw a very great deal of unnecessary, useless, and costly work upon the whole of the hotelkeepers, innkeepers, and boardinghouse-keepers of this country. Every one of these will require to provide himself with a specially designed book, in which to record all the particulars concerning foreigners staying in his house which are required to be supplied under this measure. That will be, in my opinion, of no value whatever. If the Government are anxious to do what this Bill professes to do, the proper course for them to adopt is to introduce a measure to exclude entirely from Australia the kind of people with whom this Bill is intended to deal. But when they are afraid even to mention the names of certain nations, it is not possible to hope that the Government will do anything: at. that kind. I saw from the press the other day that a man was suddenly precipitated? from the upper part of a. fashionable; hotel, where, apparently, he had beentakihg snapshots of the surrounding locality Apparently he missed his footing, fell to the floor, and was killed. Very little was said about the matter in the press, but this man was a foreigner, and it was, of course, highly undesirable that he should be free to do what he was doing: Under this Bill provision would be made only for the registration of his name and nationality and other personal particulars to be made available for the police; but there would be no provision for the exclusion of such a person. I can see now useful purpose to be served by this measure. If the Government desire to exclude undesirable foreigners from Australia, there is a straightforward and honest course for them to adopt, and it is to bring down a measure to prevent their entrance into Australia. Once they are here, if they desire to remain as. citizens, to require their continuous registration in hotels and similar establishments will be only to subject the people conducting such places to a great deal of unnecessary trouble and annoyance. The Bill does not provide that the authorities shall have power to follow undesirables into private residences, which leaves them the best possible loophole of escape. If they are allowed to occupy private residences, they will be able to do more damage than if they remain in hotels or other public establishments. Under these circumstances the Bill seems to be quite valueless as a measure to prevent undesirables from doing mischief. I understand there is- a proposal to exempt certain people-. </para>

Why should they be exempt? What are. they here for but to spy and inform the Government they represent of the actual position in this country? These are people concerning whom we should be particularly careful if we are going to be careful about anybody. Quite an army is to be exempt, including all aliens exempted by or under the authority of the Minister, and the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government. If it is intended to deal effectively with these people, why should there be any exemption at all? There appears to be no justification for the exemption clause. </para>

                    <para>Had the Bill been submitted to us in the early stages of the war, I dare say it would have gone through without much opposition as did other similar war measures. The Government have failed completely, in submitting the Bill to the Senate, to show any legitimate reason for its introduction, and they would be wise if they withdrew the measure. It is the intention to exclude people from south-east Europe, including India, and also those from Japan. In fact, everybody excepting members of the British community are to be excluded, because the Bill will apply to all Americans, both north and south, excepting those of British nationality. If the Government intend to reserve this country exclusively for Britons they should bring in a Bill solely for that purpose. If this measure becomes law it will not prevent undesirables coming here, but it will throw upon hotel proprietors, boardinghouse-keepers, and others in similar businesses, a lot of unnecessary, vexatious, and useless work. I oppose the Bill. </para>

In Australia we are, fortunately the most British community of any in the world; more British, in fact, than the United Kingdom. The members of our small alien population are well-behaved, law-abiding citizens, and, in many cases, are a valuable addition to the body politic. This is a registration, and not a restriction, Bill.

It may be necessary, particularly in America, which is a cosmopolitan community, to have legislation to enable the authorities to follow up undesirable persons who arrive there. As mentioned by

                            <para>- Yes. If there is a necessity in the United States of America or in Canada, where there is a large foreign population, to have a Bill of this nature, I do not think there is any justification for the introduction of such a measure here. During the last 100 years we have not found it necessary to have legislation of this nature, and it should not be necessary now. I have not much objection to providing for the registration of aliens. Clause 6, which provides for the registration of aliens already in the Commonwealth, and of those who come to the Commonwealth in the future, appears all that is necessary, apart from the ordinary machinery provisions relating to the appointment of officers for carrying out the work. As already pointed out by Senators Gardiner . and Grant, the Bill will harass, hotel and boardinghouse keepers, and will also necessitate the appointment of unnecessary officers, without serving any good purpose. </para>

                    <para>It has been said that the measure will harass shipmasters in connexion with passengers coming to Australia. Under the Navigation Act, every master of a ship has to fill in a form, which includes these headings : " Port of Embarkation," "Name of Passenger," "Profession, Occupation, or Calling of Passenger." That form is divided into columns, wherein it has to be stated whether the passengers are English, Scotch, Irish, or foreign. It has also to be recorded whether they are  married or single, and particulars must also be given regarding children between the ages of one and twelve. Every ship bringing passengers to Australia has to complete that form in triplicate, and lodge it at the Customs House. What more are we asking for? Aliens who come to Australia should register, and, after they have registered, we should be able to follow them from place to place. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to seamen, and it may not be generally known that when a seaman signs on a ship's articles, he has to supply his name, town and ' country of birth, age, colour of hair and eyes, and height.

                        <para>. - The Minister should give 'us some information as to the number of registration officers likely to be appointed, and the probable cost. Discontent and dissatisfaction exist, not only in Australia, but throughout the civilized world, owing to unnecessary officers being appointed by various Governments from time to time. They are being highly paid, and they occupy secure positions year after year for the purpose of performing what is regarded as unnecessary work. . If the Government intend to appoint a large number of alien registration, officers the business is going to be a very costly one. If this clause be agreed to an enormous number of officers will require to be appointed throughout the Commonwealth. Not only will officers need to be appointed at every port of entrance' to Australia, but, in order that the Bill may be made effective, an officer will be necessary in every municipality, and if there are two or more large centres in a municipality, an officer will require to be appointed in each of them. It is evident, therefore, that many thousands of officers will need to be appointed throughout the Commonwealth. This opens up a vista of enormous expenditure. But perhaps the Government intend to throw the work of registration upon existing officers, a&gt;nd if so, I should like to know upon whom. I "am informed by postal officials that they do quite sufficient work for the remuneration which they receive. The police, too, intimate that their hands are pretty full, owing to the many and varied duties which they are called upon to discharge. If, under this Bill, the services of existing officers are to be utilized, do the Government intend to pay those officers for the increased duties which will be thrust upon them? Some days ago I inquired why the pay of the naval police was less than that of the Commonwealth police. Whereas the naval police are paid only 9s. or 10s. per day, the Commonwealth police receive about 12s. per day. If it is the intention of the Government to throw the work of registration under this Bill upon either the naval police or the ordinary police, the Commonwealth should undoubtedly pay them for the additional service thus rendered. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to call attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the answers supplied by Ministers to questions put by honorable senators. I have a list of four questions which I have asked during the past month, and which have been answered, I will not say untruthfully, though the answers given are not in accordance with facts. Possibly I ought not to, speak of one of these, because I took the answer to the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> who kindly supplied me with the official facts in regard to the number of men who have been deported. He ascertained that the reply which had been furnished to my question was not correct. That answer still remains in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> although everybody who is interested in the matter of deportation knows it to be untrue. My next question had reference to a departmental report in regard to the remount service; The reply of the Minister was that General Ramaciotti had informed him that there" was no such report in existence. Now, I. will stake my reputation, which I do not value lightly, that such a report was furnished to General Ramaciotti - a report in which it is stated that 1,800 horses are missing. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that questions can be answered in such a way as to obscure the object for which they are asked. But if there is in the Defence Department a report furnished by officers of that Department which discloses such a serious loss of horses as I have indicated, the matter should be investigated. Nothing is to be gained by a Minister supplying an answer that is calculated to lead honorable senators and the public to believe that there is no such report in existence. Unless I have been grossly misled, I will stake my reputation upon the statement that there is such a report in existence. At any rate, I have received a signed letter dealing with the answer which was furnished to my question. That being the case, it is the duty of the Minister to make further and full inquiry into the matter instead of remaining satisfied with an. answer which, though it may be technically accurate, is not correct. The essence of my question was that officers, upon investigating the remount section of the Defence Department, discovered that there were 1,800 horses unaccounted for, representing probably a value of £50,000. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the statement made 'by Senator  Gardiner as to the number  of  men deported, I wish to say that I directed his attention to the error which was made in reply to his question, end it was my intention, upon the motion for adjournment, to give the correct answer, in order that it might be embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> However, I promise to look up the papers relating to the matter, with a view to seeing that the position is made perfectly clear. Concerning his allegation regarding the remount section of the Defence Department, I have merely to say that if there is in existence 'a report such as he has referred to, I am not aware of it. I have inquired  for  it personally from General Ramaciotti, who denies the existence of any such report in the Department. Certainly, it has never reached me. FeaTing that there might be some .mistake in the matter, I sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> who was  chairman  of the 'Business Board' which investigated the affairs of the Defence Department, and through him requested the Board to make a full inquiry into the remount service, ' including the dep6t at Maribyrnong. I have taken particular steps to gain the- information desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> But in order that there may be no doubt on the matter, I will make further inquiries regarding it, and ascertain whether such a report is in the Department. Certainly I have never seen it. In  regard  to the  matter  mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> I shall bring it under the notice  of  the Minister for the Navy, with a view to seeing what can be done. </para>

                    <para>. - There is just one matter to which I wish to direct attention, because I consider that it is of a serious character. It arises out of the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that there has been a loss of 1,800 horses in the remount branch of the Defence Department. When the honorable senator made that statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> interjected that the same horses had been sold over and over again. </para>

But a great responsibility rests upon public men who make accusations of gross corruption, and they should accept it as part of their duty to help Ministers to sheet their charges home. This is the first time that I have heard of any such accusation; but, haying heard it, I shall place it before my colleagues, and also make myself familiar with the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> says he has already supplied, with a view to ascertaining whether it has any foundation in fact. If it has, I shall look to <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator McDougall</inline> to stand up to the very brave words which he has uttered. </para>
