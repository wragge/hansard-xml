                        <para>I ask the Acting Minister for Defence whether he has noticed that the report of Admiral Lord Jellicoe on naval defence has been laid before the Parliament of New Zealand. I ask why, after the report has been published in a sister Dominion, the people and Parliament of Australia are kept in the dark in regard to it? I ask the Minister, further, if it is a fact that in Lord Jellicoe&#39;s report it is proposed that a subsidy of 20 per cent. of the cost, amounting to nearly &#163;4,000,000, should be paid by Australia? I ask, also, when will Lord Jellicoe&#39;s report be placed before this Parliament?

                        <para>- I ask the Acting Minister for Defence whether, in view of the statements which we continually see in the press to the effect that in Australia we are not treating our soldiers as well as returned soldiers are being treated in other parts of the Empire, he will have a statement prepared snowing how Australia is treating her returned soldiers and how soldiers are being treated in other parts of the Empire. The latest information on the subject would be of great advantage to honorable senators? </para>

                    <para>. - I rise, at this stage, to protest against the suspension of the Standing Orders or the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the hurried passage of any measure through the Senate at the close of the session. When there is real urgency and the condition of things is such that it is essential for the Government to put their business through with extreme haste, then alone is there justification for the suspension of the Standing Orders. In this particular case I can see no need for extreme haste, unless it is the haste and hurry of the Government, who evidently have in their minds something which they will not intimate to Parliament in connexion with the holding of an early election. I say, advisedly, that they have not yet intimated it to Parliament. I have asked time after time in the Senate for a definite statement as to the date fixed for the general election, but so far I have no official answer from the Minister stating what date has been fixed. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> very properly reminds me that only yesterday the answer given by the Minister leaves a doubt in one&#39;s mind as to when the elections will take place. If Parliament is to go to the country, that would constitute a valid reason for &#34;the suspension of the Standing Orders, to pass without delay, any measure which might be regarded as one of urgency, but that would not justify us in making every measure a matter of urgency. That there is merely a limited&#39; time at the disposal of the Government is no reason why we should rush measures  through the Senate. The Minister has said that the Bills to be dealt with are machinery Bills, and we are very near the end of the session. The particular. Bill now under consideration, dealing with the ratification of the Peace Treaty, is not a matter of urgency. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to do the honorable senator any injustice. I had in my mind the enormous list of Bills which he read out, and I know . he referred to them as machinery Bills. I presume that the matters dealt with in the Bill now before us have already been discussed in the debate which took place on the Peace Treaty. That discussion need not be gone over again. I do not know the contents of this particular Bill or what bearing it has on the peace proposals. But I do know that the Standing Orders ought to be rigidly adhered to, and I see no reason why, because the Government , get into a hurry, we should join in their hurry. These Standing Orders, in most cases, have stood the test of many years&#39; conduct of the business in the Senate, and now suddenly it is found necessary to suspend them day after day, and in respect of measure after measure. During the last week honorable senators on this side have shown a reasonable amount of forbearance in regard to the discussion of the different measures that have come before us, in order that the Government may get on with business and terminate the session on the . date on which, from press reports and rumours, we understand it is likely to expire. I might reasonably complain that we have not been taken sufficiently into the confidence of the Government, because we do not know definitely when a certain event will happen. Because of this state of uncertainty regarding the conduct of the business, I do not feel called upon to go out of my way to expedite measures by agreeing to the suspension of the Standing Orders upon every Bill that comes before us, without, at all events, demanding from the Minister some reason for this expedition. We are not aware officially why it is desirable to rush&#39; business through, but I take it that the Government intend to push on with business as much as possible, or the Minister would not have taken this extreme course of suspending the Standing Orders. The <inline font-style="italic">Bill</inline> dealing with the Nauru Island agreement occupies a prominent place on the notice-paper. I am not sure whether the Standing Orders were suspended in respect to that measure. The Government would be well advised if they allowed us to resume the debate on that Bill this morning. I came here prepared to deal with it. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no complaint to make concerning the attitude taken up by the honorable senator, but I may point out that since I have been in charge of the Senate I have not used any power I may possess to unduly restrict debate upon the measures that have come before us. I have moved the suspension of the Standing Orders so that the passage of this Bill may be expedited, but it is not the intention of the Government to go on with it to-day. I regret I cannot give the honorable senator any definite information as to the date of the election, but it is quite obvious that an election is at hand. Certain legislation dealing with the Constitution had to be finalized. Every honorable senator knows that as well as I do. I can say that it is the hope and intention of the Government to finish up the business of Parliament next week, if possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I offer a suggestion which I think will expedite the passage of this measure. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to an agreement arrived at between Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand in respect of the island of Nauru, and I suggest that we resume consideration of postponed clause 3, in which I desire to move an amendment which I think the Minister will agree to, dealing with the claims of the natives. Another amendment to be moved will give Parliament an opportunity of agreeing or disagreeing to any expenditure before being finally committed to it. I do not want my manner to be taken as an instruction to the Government. I make the suggestion because I am earnestly desirous of seeing the Government business expedited. The amendments fairly open up the scope of the Bill, but I shall not occupy much time in dealing with the clause. It is not my desire to attempt to amend the agreement, but I would like a test vote on it in Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I have given this agreement a considerable amount of reflection since the Bill was. last before the Committee, and I also offer a suggestion, in effect much the same as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s,</inline> but for somewhat different reasons. I see the difficulty that might arise if the Senate amended any of the articles that have been subscribed to by the Prime Ministers of Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand ; but there is, I think, a general feeling that, the agreement should be adopted subject to some further control by the Commonwealth Parliament with regard to the money that Australia may be called upon to pay. I ask the Minister to resume consideration of clause 3, which, if passed, will practically approve of the agreement as it stands. My suggestion is to add the following words to the clause - &#34; subject to the amount of compensation to be paid under Article 8 being ratified by Parliament.&#34; If these words are added, it seems to me that all the objections to- the agreement will, be removed. </para>

The suggestion is that the Government are not to be trusted to undertake financial negotiations. Parliament must be supreme in financial matters. The Government have no power to appropriate money, and will not make any payment until Parliament has voted it. Here, however, the Government are in a difficulty. An agreement has been arrived at between the Governments concerned to ascertain what is a fair price to pay by way of compensation. When that fair price has been decided, the proposal will be submitted to Parliament.

                    <para>I do not intend to indicate to the House what we consider a fair price. If I gave too low a figure, I should mislead the House, and if I gave a figure higher than that which it is worth it would he used by the company in the proceedings before the arbitrator, or in their negotiations with the Secretary of State. I did, however, mention a figure to the Secretary of State, beyond which we are not prepared to go without consultation. If the matter comes down to a direct affair, and is not referred to arbitration, that figure, of course, will be presented to this Parliament, which can express its own opinion on it. </para>

                        <para>- I do; but I remind the honorable senator that this is not by any means an ordinary affair. The company with which we are to negotiate is not the company which held the original lease. We do not know the nature of the original lease. It was granted to a German company;the present company must be prepared to produce its documents. We do not know what its interests may be. Possibly it may. have none. Since the original title was vested in a company by the German Government, and seeing that all enemy property has been transferred, it may be discovered that the original lease is practically worthless. </para>

The Ocean Island people have recognised that, with Government competition in the future, if they do not altogether go to the wall, the value of their shares will drop; and they are anxious to negotiate in order to get rid of their property. The Prime, Minister has given the definite pledge that the offer agreed upon between, the Governments in partnership would be placed before the Federal Parliament. If the negotiations are not referred to an arbitrator, the sum decided upon will be announced to Parliament; and Parliament will be entitled to express its views thereon. The .Government are in the same position as any other Government with respect to financial responsibility. They cannot regard the amendment in any other light than as practically equivalent to a motion of want of confidence. </para>

I take it that, in the ordinary business&#39; way, those who are charged with these negotiations will endeavour to pay as little as possible for the proposition. &#39; But if we announce what the sum agreed upon is, the information cannot fail to get into the possession of the- private company concerned, a condition of affairs that is most undesirable.

                        <para>- That is so. But we knew that our soldiers were in possession of it, and resolutions had been passed by this Parliament demanding the retention of the islands of the Pacific which our troops had conquered. . The question is, therefore, whether the contract which has been entered into is to be honoured or not. If we could be sure that Parliament would be sitting when the negotiations are completed, I would have no hesitation in giving the pledge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> seeks. But let us suppose that the private company concerned turns down the offer of the Governments of New Zealand, Great Britain, and Australia, and thai the acquisition of its rights in Nauru becomes the subject of &#39;arbitration. Will the other contracting parties be prepared to negotiate on the basis of &#34;heads you win, tails we lose &#34; ? In my judgment, if would be much better for us to concentrate upon the nature of the arbitration proceedings. There is no doubt, however, that the money involved in the purchase of the company&#39;s rights in the island - or, at least, our share of it - will eventually have to be voted by this Parliament. If special conditions arise which compel the Government to take prompt action, they will not hesitate to do so, and they will, of course, have to accept responsibility for their action. In conclusion, I repeat the pledge that has been given by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Has proposal is that before any money is paid in connexion with the purchase of the company&#39;s rights in Nauru Island, the agreement entered into between all the contracting parties shall be ratified by this Parliament. The Prime Minister has intimated that if the matter be not dealt, with by an arbitrator it will be submitted to Parliament, but if it is dealt with by an arbitrator it will not be so submitted. If the rights of the company which- owns the phosphatic deposits in Nauru Island become the subject of arbitration, whatever the decision of the arbitrator may be, Australia will be bound to respect it, because the honour of her people will be at stake. But we -are now invited to send a representative from Australia to negotiate upon a matter, although we do not know within &#163;1,000,000 the amount of money that is involved in it. What is the proposal which has been put forward by Sena - tor Pratten ? It is that before any money is paid for the acquisition of a private company&#39;s rights in Nauru, the agreement entered into between all the parties shall be ratified by this Parliament. Our position, I submit, is analogous to that of a board of directors intrusted with&#39; the management of the affairs of a company, and we are not justified &#39;in accepting the manager&#39;s statement that he is going to enter into a conference with certain other parties at which he will be careful to safeguard &#39;our interests. My responsibility is that of a director, and on behalf of the people of Australia I demand that the agreement shall be submitted to this Parliament for ratification and that our representative shall not commit Australia to the expenditure of an unknown amount. The adoption of that course would strengthen the hands of the Prime </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> stated that before the Prime Minister left for the Old Country we knew perfectly well that the acquisition of rights in Nauru Island would be one of the big matters which would form the subject of negotiations later on. That statement has absolutely no foundation in fact. I well remember that when the Recruiting Conference was sitting at Government&#39; House, Melbourne, the Prime Minister was panic-stricken because &#39;he thought that our enemies would win the war. When he started for Great Britain he was absolutely panic-stricken with that fear. If necessary I can quote his remarks in proof of my statement. How idle it is, then, for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to affirm that before the Prime Minister&#39;s departure we knew perfectly well that Nauru Island would form the subject of subsequent negotiations. As a matter of fact, we did not know at that time whether we would be called upon to sign a triumphant peace or a dictated one. </para>

But I decline to make this question one of confidence in&#39; the Prime Minister. I am merely stating a business proposition when I say that before any money is expended by the Government in the acquisition of rights in Nauru Island, Parliament should be called upon to ratify the agreement entered into on its behalf. We know perfectly well that the Peace negotiations that were conducted on the other side of the world were submitted to this Parliament for ratification. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has stated that an amount has been mentioned. Why should Parliament be denied the right to know what that amount is? We can honorably negotiate with companies by speaking our mind freely, and I cannot see any reason for secrecy. If there has been an agreement - I understand there have been some negotiations - it must be remembered that Parliament is above the Government, and the members of this Senate are responsible to the various States which sent them here. According to the map I have in my possession the company owns about 500 acres. </para>

If that guarantee is to be accepted, there should  not  be any opposition to this safeguarding amendment, which is to add the words &#34; subject to the amount of compensation to be paid under article 8 being ratified by Parliament.&#34; The amendment does not ask the Government to make public the amount the Government are prepared to pay under the partnership, neither does it seek to lift the veil of secrecy. I agree  with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; :</inline> Gardiner, that secrecy is unnecessary in dealing with public matters. The amendment merely says that Parliament shall have the  Tight  to express an opinion in connexion with the expenditure of public money. Parliament will be invited to express an opinion on the merits of the deal when the proposed agreement has been made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Parliament, Government, and people. The people of Australia  will  have to step in behind the compact, irrespective of its merits or demerits, and  will  be asked to honour the arrangement. This is a pernicious system, and one that has been operating for generations. It is a system which has created wars, and enabled privileged people calling themselves diplomats to enter into compacts on behalf of their people and Parliaments, and when war has  been declared, Parliaments, Governments, and peoples have had to honour the compacts made without their authority. Pf the Government refuse to accept the amendment, that pernicious system  will  be followed in the commercial arena. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has stated, Nauru is not the only place where phosphates are obtained. .Iri Queensland some experimental work, which promises to be successful, has been undertaken, after a preliminary geological examination.&#39; On the small island of Holbourne, which comprises about 70 acres, and which is about 20 miles from the Queensland coast, there is a deposit of phosphate S or 9 feet in depth. </para>

                        <para>- Nineteen or twenty per cent. I am not putting that up against the phosphatic rock supplies of the world. A full report of the Queensland Government Geologist on the matter appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Government Mining Journal</inline> of March last. The opinion is held that With a further geological examination of the islands along the Queensland coast, particularly towards the approach to Thursday Island, it is likely that phosphatic deposits of greater richness may be discovered. It must also be remembered that in Queensland bone . manures  are extensively used, and there is not likely to be a great demand for phosphatic manure except, perhaps, on the heavy red soils&#39;. </para>

                        <para>- It might be used with advantage in the Bundaberg and other districts if increased supplies were available. A wrong impression may be caused by the fact that phosphatic rock produced on Nauru Island costs 30s. per ton, f.o.b., and some who have not gone into the matter may believe that it can be purchased at a price approximating the f.o.b. price. The phosphatic rock placed f.o.b. at 30s. pelton at Ocean Island or . Nauru Island, when crushed, treated, and loaded at Cockle Creek, is sold at &#163;5 or &#163;6 per ton, but there are distributing costs to be added to that. According to the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Agriculture,</inline> the manure used by the Department of Agriculture on its experimental farms costs about &#163;7 10s. pelton. The Article we are discussing is the kernel of the Bill, and an endeavour is being made to bind the people of Australia to the payment of a sum that has not been specified. In making the agreement,&#39; Parliament is net to be consulted ; but we shall be compelled to ratify what has been done. It has been pointed out during the debate that those who are dissatisfied with the agreement  have always favoured State control of industries. Ever since the birth of the Australian Labour movement that has been the policy of the party. It is asked why honorable senators, who believe in . the conduct of enterprises by the State, should be opposing this proposal, under which the Government seeks to make a State industry of the manufacture in Australia of superphosphates from phosphatic rock mined at Nauru Island. One of the principal causes operating against the success of State industries in the various States of the Commonwealth, and I admit that there have been instances in- which the States have carried on unsuccessful operations, has been the over-capitalization in the early stages of the enterprise. There have been instances in which enterprises carried on by the States have been so heavily handicapped by over-capitalization that success has been denied them from their inception. </para>

An Australian boy or girl will milk twenty cows before &#39;breakfast and trot off to school afterwards. It is a libel to say that it is the &#34; government stroke &#34; that has been responsible for the non-success of some State enterprises in Australia. The principal cause has been over capitalization and unsympathetic &#39; administration. I fear that over-capitalization of this concern will be a factor operating against its success, and that another factor will probably be unsympathetic administration. We have had many instances of persons placed in command of State enterprises having no sympathy with their success. They have carried on a system of scientific sabotage to insure their failure, which has given <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and other people the opportunity to speak disparagingly of the &#34;government stroke.&#34; The comparative failure of some of these State enterprises has been brought about by the scientific go-slow policy of those placed in charge of them. If I were appointed to investigate some of these enterprises . I should look for sabotage, not amongst the workers, but amongst the bosses, who work against their successful development at every stage. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment is to preserve to this Parliament what should be its most cherished power, and that is the power over the purse. I entirely agree with the honorable senator in &#39;that desire. Some things have been done lately by our very energetic Prime Minister that have been calculated to make our hair stand on end. Here, however, we are confronted with a definite proposition to purchase 42 per cent, of a company&#39;s interest in the Island of Nauru. I approve of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> simile that we are here as a Board of directors, and the Government are in the position of our managers. We are practically in charge of the funds of the shareholders, and we are asked to delegate a certain amount of power to our managers to invest in a specific enterprise. As a private individual and member of a board of directors I have often consented to the manager of a company - when, for instance, we wished to purchase a mob of sheep - being given the power to pay a certain amount per head for them. </para>

That is why the Government are not in a position to disclose the amount which they are prepared, with the Governments of Great Britain and New Zealand, to pay for the interests of the company in Nauru Island. </para>

                        <para>- No; but it asks that the agreement should not be ratified until it is sanctioned by this Parliament. The Minister has pointed out that Parliament may not be sitting, and it may not be possible to obtain its consent When it is required. We have been assured that there may be a very great profit from this investment. Information has been supplied bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> which goes to show that what is proposed will not be a good bargain. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is in possession of a great deal of information tending to show that it will be a splendid bargain. If it turns out to be a really good bargain we shall look very foolish if we decline to give our managers, the Government, the power they ask for to complete this contract. We know that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had to exhaust a great deal of energy, and go to a great deal of trouble to secure for Australia the right to claim a 42 per cent, interest in this investment, and no doubt the Imperial or New Zealand Governments . would be1 prepared to take the bargain off our hands at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>

                        <para>- I question whether any of us has really reliable information about the prospects of this investment. Nauru is a solitary island in the Pacific, and, with very few exceptions,. I suppose that the only people who have visited the island are the employees of the company. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that he obtained some information from a member of the guard there. I do not attach much importance to the statement that the phosphatic deposit is confined to 500 acres of the island. We have no information as to its depth. It may be 100 feet in depth; and, if so, it would be an enormous and very rich deposit. I do not wish to go into the facts of the matter. </para>

We should take the utmost care to see that a bad bargain is not made, and we have cautioned the Government, as our managers, that every possible care must be taken to see that we are not asked to pay too much for our share in the enterprise.

                    <para>. - When I spoke on the second reading of the Bill, I was not fortified with facts with which I have since made, myself acquainted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> produced a map, and told us that the company have&#39; rights over about 500 acres of Nauru Island. I learn from the <inline font-style="italic">Handbook of the Pacific Islands,</inline> published by Stewart and- Company, of Sydney, that Nauru Island is circular in form, and about 3 miles in diameter. There are about 1,284 natives on the island, slightly fewer now than there were in 1912. There is about. 4,500 acres of the island highly phosphatized. This gives us the size of the island, and the area from which phosphates may be gathered. In 1915 the exports of phosphates totalled 85,808 tons, and in 1916, 105,012 tons. It will be seen, therefore, that rapid progress was made in the development of the deposits. The imports in 1916 were shown at &#163;34,548, and the revenue in that year was &#163;8,402, made up as follows: - Customs, &#163;1,567; licences an.d internal, &#163;1,288; court fees and fines &#163;171; Pacific Phosphate Company, &#163;3,599; post-office, &#163;1,776. </para>

I find, from the <inline font-style="italic">Mining&#39; Manual and Mining Year-Book,</inline> 1919, an English publication, that the company obtains its rights from the Pacific Island Company, which in turn derives its rights from a company formed in Hamburg. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who lives in Sydney, will remember the quarrel that took place between this company and Burns, Philp, and Company with respect to shipping charges made in connexion with trade to this island. I need not state the number of directors of the company, but I may inform honorable senators that the  chairman  is the Bight Honorable Lord Balfour of Burleigh. </para>

                    <para>The company was registered on 18th April, 1902, to acquire from the Pacific Islands Company Limited, a licence from the British Government for ninety-eight years from 1st January, 1902, to deal with phosphatic deposits on Ocean Island (Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony), in the Central Pacific Ocean; also  a  concession from the German Government for  a  period of ninety-four years from 1st April, 1906, giving the exclusive rights of exploiting guano, phosphates, &#38;c, on Nauru (or Pleasant Island), Gaspar Rico, Bigar, and all other islands in the Marshall Group. The consideration was &#163;200,000, payable &#163;100,000 in fully paid-up &#163;1 first preference shares, and &#163;100,000 in fully paid-up &#163;1 ordinary shares.

The capital was increased from &#163;250,000 to &#163;500,000 in June, 1909, by creation of &#163;250,000 ordinary shares, which were offered to ordinary shareholders at par by way of bonus (being two for every share held), and increased to &#163;875,000 in May, 1910, by creation of a further &#163;375,000 ordinary shares, which were offered to ordinary shareholders at par (credited with 6s. 8d. paid) by &#39;way of bonus. In June, 1912, the capital was increased to &#163;975,000 by creation of 100,000 second preference shares, which rank for dividends and return of capita&#93; next to the first preference shares. It was increased to present amount in March, 1914, by the creation of a further 225,000 second preference shares, and 100,000 were offered for public subscription at par. </para>

McMahon, F.R.G.S., F.KC.I., &#38;c, which deals with the British phosphate enterprise, particularly in Nauru. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon</inline> alludes to the&#39; important fact that the moorings for vessels are the deepest and most costly in the world. I will quote now from another journal of high technical repute, namely, <inline font-style="italic">The American Fertilizer,</inline> of 19th December, 1913- </para>

                    <para>The Island of Nauru, belonging to the German Marshall Islands (longitude 165 degrees East, latitude <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> degree South) is, as far as can bc judged without any deep borings, a pure coral island built up on a basis of massive rock or volcanic tuffs; this basis, probably a hill, was submerged in the course of time, on which coral polyps have settled and built up the present island. This base is now sunken to a  great  depth, and is covered with a thick hood or stratum of coral  substance.  This coral  substance was originally carbonate of lime in the form of aragonite, but lias been converted into carbonate of lime-magnesia, in dolomite. By the eroding effect of the water, a dissolving of the carbonate has taken place. This has been&#39; the cause of the formation of large and small caves, and of the surface phenomenon of dolomitic  Karrenfelder  or  Schrattenfelder,  characterized as pinnacles,  dolines,  funnels, and  kalamms.  Every piece of the dolomite exposed to the atmospheric influences represents a &#34;  Karrenfeld  &#34; in miniature. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The dolomitic <inline font-style="italic">debris,</inline> gravel, and sand has been changed into phosphate of lime by infiltration of products of solution of bird excrements in the dolomite. The space between the pinnacles is filled in, to a large extent, with phosphate; also the greater part of the area&#39; of land is covered with phosphate. The stratum of phosphate, -mostly in the form of sand and gravel, and workable with a shovel, has a thickness of from 10 to 50 feet. Even at the present time, the forming and extension of caves and cavities takes place by dissolving the carbonates by rain water, while the formation of &#34;  Karrenfelder  &#34; practically has come to an end, as a cover of the overlaying phosphate prevents it. Still, the heavy rains extract much carbonate out of the island;  proportionally,  more lime than magnesia is leached out. The water. of the lagoon  Buada  contains lime and magnesia in the proportion of live to one. </para>
                <para class="block">I stress the point that the deposit has been proved to a depth of from 10 to 50 feet. The- article in <inline font-style="italic">The World&#39;s Work</inline> mentions that there is a railway cutting 40 feet deep, and that it- has been tested right down to the bottom. Also, a well has been sunk, and its waiter has been found to contain, phosphates. &#39; I have quoted the best authorities available, and I think I have established the undoubted value of the island. Since we must recognise that Ocean Island has proved of immense value, we have every right to be confident that Nauru Island will prove equally rich. </para>
                <para>The price quoted, namely, 30e. f.o.b.&#39;, is extraordinary; I cannot understand it. Under similar conditions, work is done in South Australia by means of some such apparatus as a steam shovel, and a cubic yard of material - practically, 1 ton - can be removed for 9d. At Nauru the material has to be conveyed no1 great distance, and the traction is electric. I fail to see, therefore, how the charge of 30s. per ton can be justified. If a practical man such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Timms, or his late partner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, were to get on the job, I feel confident that he would undertake to remove the product, and place it on shipboard for less than one- third of the price quoted. If we have the opportunity to secure the phosphate at anything like a reasonable price, and Australia should fail to ratify the agreement, we shall he missing one of the greatest opportunities ever placed before &#34; us. </para>

                        <para>- It was in relation to dividends that the honorable senator failed to do his subject justice. He quoted certain very large dividends, and inferred that they had been earned on the Island of Nauru. In the year in which the dividends totalled &#163;42,000, Nauru&#39;s contribution did not amount to &#163;16,000. The greatest output from Naura, as &#39; I have already stated, was 105,000 tons in one year. The company claims that its profits range from 5s. to 7s. .a ton. That is to say, the greatest annual output from the island failed to show a profit on the company&#39;s workings of more than &#163;35,000. </para>

There were several suggestions made previously, but no meetings. I really do not understand this. Now I want to come back to the mandate. We got over the first difficulty with regard to Britain holding the mandate. The next difficulty was the company, and Lord Milner sent me one &#39; morning the suggestion I mentioned; and, as a matter of fact, I lent him my copy of the report of the inquiry by the Inter-State Commission of Australia. That Commission had taken a lot of evidence, and had gone into the question exhaustively; and Lord Milner suggested that the only way to prevent the exploitation of the producers of New Zealand and Australia, particularly, was to buy the company out. We had a lot of correspondence on the subject, and I have no objection whatever to laying it on the table, as it may save time; and hie suggestion was that the property should be acquired compulsorily. New Zealand could not do that, nor could Australia - only Great Britain. He suggested that the property be taken compulsorily at a valuation. . . . </para>
                <para>Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and I agreed to it, and the draft was sent to me on the morning I left Paris ; but it all depends upon the Government so far as the completion of the contract is concerned - that is, upon the Government and the Parliament. </para>

                <para>The Right <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Mr. Massey.</inline> - Most certainly, we can. I do not know what we may have to <inline font-style="italic">pay,</inline> but the company- suggested their interest was worth ?3,000,000; but the buyer does not often take the vendor&#39;s valuation. By way of explaining the position, as far as Nauru is concerned, and the deposits of phosphates there, I propose to quote from reports on th&#39;e subject. </para>
                <para class="block">The time at my disposal will not permit me to read those reports. It will, however, suffice for me to point out that we are asked to accept this agreement as a matter of confidence in the Government, notwithstanding that one- of the New Zealand delegates who discussed this question has affirmed that that Dominion can get out of the agreement if it so desires. Personally, I am not prepared to shut my eyes and enter blindly into an arrangement of this sort. I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has substantiated my remarks regarding the utmost output of phosphates from Nauru Island. I stated on a previous occasion that, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> far, the maximum output had been about 105,000 tons, which represented a value of, approximately, ?160,000. These figures enable me to say that it would be possible to obtain cheap phosphates for our farmers only by increasing the output tenfold. </para>

                        <para>- Because there is only a limited demand for them. Unless we can make the price of phosphates cheaper, we cannot increase the output from Nauru Island very much. Under the conditions which formerly prevailed, we were obtaining 60 per cent, of the output of phosphates from Nauru, whereas under the proposed agreement we shall get only 42 per cent. The private company which has hitherto been exploiting the deposits there, controls but a very small portion of the island. If Nauru is so full of phosphates, why should we not work the balance of the island ourselves? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> proposal merely asks the Government to free themselves from suspicion by inserting in this Bill a clause providing that Parliament shall have a voice in determining whether the agreement shall be ratified or not. Such a provision, T contend, would strengthen the hands of Ministers immensely. Their representatives would then be able to go to the Conference and say to the representatives of the company, &#34; Any arrangement that we may make here is, of course, subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Parliament.&#34; What could more effectually prevent profiteering than such an announcement ? </para>

The full value of those phosphates - on board ship was only 30s. per ton; or, roughly, ?160,000. The company claim that they have ?750,000 worth of machinery and appliances on the island.

                        <para>- I do not. But those dividends were obtained from the phosphates produced on other islands. What is the use of claiming that huge profits are to be made out of this enterprise when it is patent that there are not, if we allow for working expenses and interest upon capital. In the case of the Commonwealth, too, those working expenses would have to be increased by the appointment of a Commissioner and his Staff. I am sorry that the time limit imposed upon our speeches prevents me from dealing exhaustively with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that the largest output from Nauru Island has been 105,000 tons a year. Of course, honorable senators opposite claim that that output can be increased considerably. I question that statement very much. We know that ships have to stand off the island some distance, and that the phosphates have to be taken out and loaded on to&#39; them by means of tenders. In such circumstances, it is impossible to obtain cheap phosphates. I know that the price of native labour is only 8d. per day; but I have had experience of that class of labour, and I say that native labour at 8d. per day is more costly than is Australian labour at 8s., or even 18s., per day. Upon one occasion, I saw a piece of machinery placed on board ship, at Sydney, by eight men, and when it arrived at Fiji thirty men were not sufficient to take it off the vessel. This is a proposition in which it is the duty of Parliament to safeguard the public interests. The taxpayers of this country ought not to be saddled with any monetary responsibility until Parliament has ratified the proposed agreement. Surely we ought to protect their interests by affirming that the National Legislature shall itself be the judge of whether the proposed arrangement is a fair one or not. </para>

                        <para>- Then, shall I say, with clue deliberation, as sometimes an independent supporter of the Government, I feel myself in an exceedingly difficult position? I do not propose to indulge in the somewhat extravagant language that has been used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner;</inline> but I wish calmly to place before the Committee the business principles which ought to be followed in connexion with the payments that will be made by the Government in respect of Nauru Island. If those payments are excessive, instead of superphosphates being cheapened to the farmers of this country, we shall compel the latter for all time to purchase dearer phosphates than they can purchase now. I am not speaking without my book in this matter. I have taken the trouble to understand it; and I can assure honorable senators that there is a very strong feeling abroad that if this Bill be passed&#39; in its present form, instead of cheapening superphosphates to our farmers, it may have an entirely opposite effect. I am sure that we do not desire to bring about any such result. That is the reason why I have risen to discuss the Bill as fully as it lies within my power to do. The Minister has refused a very fair suggestion which was offered to him when the debate opened this morning. The suggestion is contained in my amendment, and I am sure that many honorable senators on. this side of the chamber considered it fair. My amendment is to the effect that before money is paid by the Government - and any payment must eventually be a charge upon the farming industry - this or the next Parliament shall have an opportunity of expressing its approval or disapproval. I submit that that is returning to constitutional government. It is in accordance with the best traditions of government that Parliament should have supreme control over the public purse. I wish to continue my observations on Articles 7 and S, which read - </para>

                        <para>- We have heard that the company expects to receive about &#163;3,000,000 for their rights. There is nothing in the Bill about the money being paid after inspection, and Articles 7 and 8 are quite specific. I have my modest share of responsibility and duty as one of the custodians of the public purse. I am sent here to protect the interests of the farmers, and I owe my position in this Senate in part to the farmers of New South Wales. I am not going to see a possible imposition put upon the fertilizer industry of Australia. The whole trend of the debate has been in the direction that if certain things eventuate in connexion with the- company&#39;s right, title, or interest in this island, the phosphate rock will cost more f .o.b. Nauru than at present.  It will certainly cost the manufacturers of superphosphates more, and consequently they will have to ask more from the farmer. One &#34;step after another leads up to the farmer, who will eventually have to pay if this Parliament or Government makes a bad bargain. </para>

                        <para>- One of the Articles in the Bill specifically provides that if two parties to the agreement disagree the question must be referred to arbitration. I take it that it will be the usual arbitration, that certain arbitrators will be appointed on both sides who will mutually agree upon an umpire, and that the decision of the umpire will be final. We are committing ourselves to arbitration in the event of the company not accepting the price offered by the Government: . &#39;By so doing we are committing ourselves to accepting the arbitrator&#39;s award &#39; unless we specifically provide otherwise. Apparently, some honorable senators think that the only phosphate in the world is to be found at Nauru and&#39; Ocean Islands. It has been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that very large quantities are also obtained in America, Algeria, Tripoli, and in other parts of the world. In addition to those sources of supply, phosphate is obtained on the shores of the Red Sea, and on many islands in the South Seas which are undeveloped, including Makatea, which now supplies New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- Manatee has nothing whatever to do with the Bill under discussion. So far as I can ascertain, cheap phosphatic supplies are not a question of basic material,, because that is found all over the world in greater quantities than we can utilize. It is entirely a question of cost f.o.b. ports, where it is eventually converted into superphosphate. Let us analyze the figures. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the danger of continuing the policy of allowing any Government, or Leader of a Government, to enter into an agreement or contract without the consent of Parliament, it will be seen that, by Article 3, power is left in the hands of the Prime Minister to come to some arrangement with the other two Governments concerned in the administration of Nauru. There is a responsibility of committing the Commonwealth to the expenditure of a certain sum of money. Let me take honorable senators back to the occasion when the Prime Minister was in England, and took upon himself the responsibility, on behalf of the Commonwealth, of entering into contracts for the extension of the shipbuilding scheme. That was done, without the knowledge or authority of Parliament, and while I, as a member of the Labour party, viewed the result of the Prime Minister&#39;s action in that regard as right, in that it coincided with the policy for the construction of a, Commonwealth line of steamers, I realized the danger attached to such action- Those of us who know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will feel quite sure that he might have turned round and sold the whole Fleet. The Prime Minister is so constituted that he would do that in a moment. Such a responsibility should not be in the hands of one person, and it should not be in the hands of the Government without the consent or control of Parliament. The course of allowing the Prime Minister or the Government such power as is contained in Article 3 is not in- the best interests of the Commonwealth. To those who have great faith in the Prime Minister - I have not - and who contend that in business arrangements as in political, the right honorable gentleman can do no wrong, is it not reasonable that the community _ should be safeguarded? It will be admitted by the Prime Minister&#39;s most ardent supporters that he is only human, and likely to make a bad bargain. He has admitted that he is not a god. He has made mistakes, and it would be in the best interests of the Government and his party for the Senate to accept the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and place the responsibility on Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is warranted. We have a Public Works Committee which has to investigate and report on all public works proposals involving an expenditure of &#163;25,000 or more before they can be undertaken. Where is the consistency of giving the Prime Minister such power as we are giving in Article 2, and in committing the Commonwealth to the expenditure of an unlimited sum of money? Surely there is no reason for departing from the policy of the Commonwealth ? </para>

It may be possible to construct a dock at Nauru Island, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> overlooked the fact that that would add to the capitalization of this enterprise. I fear the over capitalization of the undertaking. In the course of a few years we may find that there is an increase in the price of phosphates to the farmers, and the control by the Government of the Commonwealth of the phosphate output of Nauru Island may be pointed to as another shocking- example of State control. Honorable senators opposite will be mounting platforms to condemn the system of State control of business enterprises. They will ask people to look at Nauru Island, and will say that Government control of the mining of phosphate rock there has led to an increase in the price of phosphates to the farmer. </para>

If, on the other hand, the Commonwealth, steam-ship line engages in this trade, and earns as much freight as it could earn in other avenues of trade, that must add to the charge for working the enterprise at Nauru Island. . </para>

                        <para>- If freights come down they will do. so all over the world, and not merely between Nauru Island and Australia, otherwise the Commonwealth line of steamers would be sacrificing freight in taking up this trade. Heavy capitalization of this enterprise will, reduce the margin which we are told there is between its. operations and those of the British Phosphates Company. For those who believe that economical working can be secured by the utilization of cheap native or indentured labour, I can quote the experience gained in the sugar industry in Queensland. At tone time kanakas were employed in the sugarfields of Queensland. They were paid &#163;&#38; per year, a. pair of moleskin trousers, a shirt, and some rice and sweet potatoes. To-day even those who advocated the continued employment of the kanaka are prepared to admit that the white labour now employed in the cultivation of the sugar cane is cheaper than the labour of the kanaka at &#163;6 per year. Though labour may be employed at Nauru Island at very low rates, it will not follow that it will be cheap or economic labour. </para>

                    <para>. -  Before the amendment goes to a vote I should like to say that the question narrows itself down to a decision as to whether or not the Government shall take upon their shoulders the responsibilities of carrying this transaction through without consulting Parliament. Constitutionally this Parliament, of which the Senate is a branch, has absolute and unchallengeable control of the purse. I realize that in connexion with some matters it is necessary that the Government should have a free hand, especially in eases where, if they are not in a position to act at once, we may let a golden opportunity, like sunbeams, pass us by. If. it can be shown that this is a matter of urgency, in connexion with which the Government should be intrusted with the carrying out of the bargain, I would not stand in the way. But I want to have it made clear to me that, unless we give the Government power to &#171;lose with this deal, we may be compelled to make a worse bargain later on. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This is not a small matter which may be regarded as child&#39;s play, because, if the company&#39;s terms are accepted, we shall be involved in an expenditure of something like &#163;1,250,000 for our share in the enterprise. Even that is not the gravest aspect of the case, which is the necessity for preserving and maintaining -the source of phosphatic rock for the cultivation of the soil of this country in the future. That is the all-important consideration, because if we have, not an independent source of supply our previous experience goes to show that the cultivators of our soil will be at the mercy of a company that will have a sole monopoly of the source of supply. If I thought there was any chance that such a position would arise I should be prepared to give the Government a free hand in this matter. If there is -no chance of that, this Parliament should assert the constitutional position, and its right to review any bargain struck by the Government, -who are only the mouth-piece of Parliament. It should not be forgotten that if the amendment be adopted, one effect will be that the company will understand that instead of having to deal with the Government alone in this matter they will have&#39; to deal also with Parliament. A vendor may more readily deal with one party than with two;, and  if  the vendors in this case understand that they will have to deal not only with the Government, but with the bosses of the Government, the Parliament of this country, they will be brought to their bearings very much more easily because of that knowledge. </para>
                <para>I quite realize that it is owing, in  a  great measure, to a special effort of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that we have this .proposition before us, but it is no reflection upon the Prime Minister, or his Government, to say that after all Parliament declines to abrogate its prerogative to review whatever may be done by the Government. Unless the Minister can show that there is special urgency in this case, as there certainly was in the case of the purchase of the Commonwealth steam-ships, and can assure us that the Commonwealth must be in .a position to close upon this proposition at once to make a good bargain, I shall not be disposed to give them a free hand. </para>

The only reference to such a sum which I have seen was in some statement by the company as to the value of their assets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is aware that, companies always open their mouths very widely at the first bite, but the Government may be trusted to have a sufficient knowledge of business not to give this company one penny more than they are entitled to receive. </para>

                <para>It should not be forgotten that this is not an ordinary negotiation between buyer and seller. The whole island of Nauru has been compulsorily acquired, and it is a question rather of the compensation to be paid to the company for disturbance. No one to-day knows exactly what agreement the company is working <inline font-style="italic">upon.</inline> It  appears to me that they have only a sublease, and the original lessees were the members of a Germany company. One of. the conditions of that lease was a royalty of one half mark on every ton, and for that &#163;25,000 was paid in one year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> asked me to produce the balance-sheet, but it is difficult to do so, because there have been so many estimates and calculations made concerning this matter. I could draw upon my imagination, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has done, to produce a balance-sheet. The honorable senator assumed a purchasing price of &#163;3,000,000, and he had no right to assume anything of the kind. I have given distinct assurances to the Committee, and I have not previously been accused of making loose&#39; statements. I am always conservative in any statements I make, because I recognise that it is the duty of a Minister, if he cannot give accurate information, not to make guesses. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable senator&#39;s correction. The purchasing price has been estimated at &#163;3,000,000. Interest on that would amount to &#163;150,000 a year, and with an annual output of 100,000 tons there would be a charge of 30s. per ton for interest. It has been estimated also that with 7s. per ton profit the output would &#39; show . a profit of &#163;35,000. I could produce another balance-sheet- from other and widely different estimates. One authority makes the statement that at Nauru Island there are phosphates sufficient to supply, for three generations, all the countries of the world, let alone Australia. . An analysis of the product shows that the Nauru Island phosphate is the richest in the world, and the output could be expanded to 300,000 tons a year. I happen to be in possession &#39;of some confidential information which shows that the profits are more than double the estimated figure, but I cannot give the information to the Senate as a fact. </para>

The principle in this agreement is very much, the same as that under which the Government compulsorily acquire land for public purposes.

Our only desire is to help the producers of Australia, and I think that, as a result of our experience during the war period, we should take every care to secure an effective control over the raw materials of production. Something has been said about the limitation of our requirements in this direction, but it seems to me that the amount has been largely understated. We should remember that 100,000 people are trying to book passages from the Old Country to Australia, and, therefore, a considerable expansion in our agricultural operations must take place if, as is probable, we double our population within the next twenty or twenty-five years.

                        <para>- My honorable friend&#39;s interjection that if it were half the price, double the amount would have been used, might be true theoretically, but I point out that we cannot expect to get phosphatic rock from Naura, Ocean Island, or anywhere else, c.i.f. Australian ports for much less than &#163;2 10s. per ton, seeing that it has to he mined, trucked, taken out in small boats to be loaded into the  ships,  and transported some thousands of miles to our shores. I am not going to weary the Senate by quoting much of that which is contained in the report of the Inter-State Commission  on  British and Australian trade  in  the South Pacific, but I refer honorable senators  to  pages IS and 19, where they will  find  details  in  connexion with this company. Lord Stanmore was the first Chairman, and when  he  died  in  1912  he  was succeeded by Lord Balfour  of  Burleigh, with whom were associated as directors Lord Grey, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lever, and other prominent British business men.

Some honorable senators have asserted that this amount can be largely increased for the reason that there are so many million tons contained in the island. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> argued that 23s. a ton was a ridiculous cost, seeing that black labour was used, with the assistance of modern appliances, and that the product was conveyed in trucks over electric railways to the jetty and the ship. The principal cost in placing it f.o.b. steamer is the lightering and the loading, basket by basket, into the ship&#39;s hold. On account of the adverse conditions at the anchorage, shipping cannot &#39; lay alongside the jetty. </para>

                        <para>- The loading is as I have described it, basket by basket. - With reference to the output of 100,000 tons, there is another reason why that estimate is reasonable. It is that the weather conditions are not favorable to loading for quite half the year. Respecting the profits of the company, the evidence which I have quoted confirms the figures presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> with the exception of the reference to the bonus shares. I will assume, that the 30 per cent., 35, 15, and 7&#163; per cent, profit can be averaged over the past fifteen years; and I will assume, for the purpose of argument, that the company has made on an average &#163;100,000 per annum during that period. That is the maximum which any honorable senator can claim on behalf of the industry. But all the figures show that not more than one-third of the profit was made from Nauru Island ; the most they can claim on behalf of Nauru, therefore, is &#163;33,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- It is useless to say that the Nauru phosphates are a few decimal points richer than those on Ocean Island. I am stating a broad business proposition to ascertain how much the Government should pay. The Minister will not accept my amendment. He will hamstring and leg-rope Parliament so fiar as the matter of the eventual payment is concerned. Those men in England who constitute the company are keen business gentlemen, and will take as much as we will give them, while it is our duty to give them as little as we can. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> mentioned that the German Government took 200,000 shares by way of payment for the whole of the island, and the whole of the concessions which we are now asked to buy. We lose sight of the fact that this is a raw material, and does not become superphosphate until it has passed through a secondary process. We have ten&#39; big factories in Australia turning out the product, and the capital value involved is at least &#163;1,500,000. Do the Government intend to build factories to treat the phosphatic rock? The companies at present working in Australia state that they will not be able to buy the rock from the Government c.i.f. ports as cheaply as they have been able to do in the past, because there will be a capitalization charge for interest, which will have to be added to the cost of the rock to the Government, and which the Government will have to get back in their charges for it. Phosphatic rock to-day is quoted at 42s. c.i.f. ports, from the Island of Makatea, in the Friendly group. The Japanese have huge deposits in the Carolines. There is practically no market outside Australia and <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Zealand for the products of our islands in the Pacific. We cannot send these products to Japan; nor can we send them to England. England has far better, opportunities of securing all her requirements from comparatively near at hand. America has all she wants; and it amounts to this, that wo shall be importing 200,000 tons of phosphatic rock, and must charge the cost to the farmers. I would sooner scrap this agreement altogether than be a party to paying a large capital sum to the present owners. To scrap the agreement would be more in the interests of the farmers, and they would get their phosphates more cheaply than they are likely to get them if the agreement is ratified. </para>

                    <para>. - I remarked in the earlier stages of the debate that the company which bought out the old German company paid &#163;500,000. Those figures are substantiated by the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> Prime Minister of New Zealand. He remarked that the company had been originally part German, and that, following the usual custom, the German shares were put up by auction and sold during the war, and realized &#163;575,000. I desire to place those figures side by side with my earlier statements in order to buttress my remarks regarding the purchase of the shares of the old company. </para>

                <para>The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratter</inline> merely asks that the amount involved in any arrangement which may be entered into for the purchase of Nauru Island shall be agreed to by Parliament beforehand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has shown unmistakably that there is little prospect of more than 100,000 tons being won from the island deposits in any one year, even with the most up-to-date equipment such as has been already installed. The fact that the industry on Nauru Island has been boomed during the past twelve months in so many tenth-rate magazines more than suggests that those articles have come from inspired sources. I recommend to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that he should consider the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey.</inline> All the information at the disposal of the Prime Minister of New Zealand was placed before&#39; the Dominion Parliament, together with a promise to lay the whole of the correspondence on the table of Parliament. Had the Federal Government acted similarly, far less opposition would have been shown to this Bill. I hope honorable senators will realize that the amendment is in no sense a matter of trusting the Government or otherwise, but an insistence upon knowing the amount of money to be disbursed before Parliament agrees to the purchase. </para>
