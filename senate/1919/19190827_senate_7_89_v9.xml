                            <para>- The statement that has appeared in the press, that the seamen's strike has been happily terminated', is-, I am glad to say, quite correct. Although the conditions under which the seamen have agreed to resume work have been published in the press, perhaps honorable senators would like me to repeat them. The arrangement arrived at was that, as the first condition of settlement, the men should man the ships. On behalf of. the Government, I undertook that the moment the unions concerned had passed a resolution to man the ships, summonses would issue convening a conference for. Monday next. The unionists have returned to work, ships are being manned in every State, and. consequently summonses convening a conference for Monday next have been issued. The other conditions were that matters agreed to at the conference were to be carried to the Arbitration Court to  be  filed and registered there. With regard to matters not settled', the unionists, having the right to proceed further with their claims, or abandon them, have elected to waive them. They will waive any points not settled at the conference. The agreement arrived at at the conference will be retrospective in effect, and both sides have agreed to abide by the decision of the conference. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely. They have the right to proceed further with them in the Arbitration Court, as any other litigant would have, or to abandon them, and they have elected to waive them, or abandon them altogether. At the same time, I consider that they are entitled, at the end of the conference, if they still wish to go further with claims which have not been agreed upon there, to take them into Court. In my view, they will be still free, at the conclusion of the conference, to do what other litigants can do - abandon their claims, or go into Court with them for further consideration. </para>

                    <para>There are two other conditions to which I should like to refer, though they are not set out in the written agreement. One as based upon the promise given by me, on behalf of the Government, that the. Conference will not be a mere formal gathering, but will represent a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> effort to examine the claims of the men, with a view to their determination on their merits. The other undertaking is that the men will not be asked to complete the complement of any ship on which non-union labour is employed. I have stated the whole of the arrangements made with the men. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the second question, whether other industrial troubles are brewing, honorable senators are aware of the long standing desire of the wharf labourers for a readjustment of the conditions under which they are employed. I 'am now engaged in negotiations with the wharf labourers, the ship-owners, and the loyalist wharf labourers, with very considerable hope that this difficulty, which has been so long standing, may be adjusted to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators must be aware of the need for this measure. I consider it of very great importance, but I desire to see a longer extension of the moratorium than that provided for in the Bill, so that people may recover from the effects of the war. This is one of the most essential and important Bills, in relation to the welfare of Australia that has come before the Senate during the history of this Parliament. We are told that in the interests of the future of our country, we must work hard and produce more than ever. But our workers and producers cannot do that if they are overwhelmed by the calling in of their borrowed money. In view of the importance of the measure I was sorry that it received such scaptexplanation by the Minister in charge when he presented it to the Senate last week. However, I read the debate following upon the introduction of the Moratorium Bill in another place, and was thus enabled to glean further information regarding the intentions of the Government. We were informed in the Senate that this measure was intended simply to extend the regulations having to do with the moratorium; that the first portion had to  do with, general borrowing, and the second part with borrowing in relation <inline font-style="italic">f-</inline> soldiers. If we simply required legislation to protect the individual, the Bill as it stands might be right enough; but this measure is for the protection of a class, and not an individual. It is necessary that producers and workers who have been compelled to seek the aid of financial institutions should be safeguarded. The producer and the working man were  Bailed  upon, not as volunteers to go to the Front, but as volunteers to put their money into, the various war loans. They had to borrow from the banks at the rate of 6 per cent., and even higher, in order to buy war loan bonds which are returning them interest at the rate of' 4^ 1/2 and 5 per cent. only. If the Government were now to say that in a few months' time the various financial institutions which advanced all this money would be free to charge when, how, and what rate of interest they wished upon the money they have lent, evil times would fall upon those people- who were compelled to borrow and put their money into the war loans. It is the duty of this Parliament to prevent that. I would like to see an extension of the -period of protection for at least six months, or a year, longer than the term set forth in the Bill. The Government might well take steps to- amalgamate financial institutions in order to insure that fair play shall be given all round. I refer to those mortgaging companies whose management, consider it their sole duty to obtain the return of dividends to shareholders. No matter how the individual borrower may be crushed, the mortgage company must pay  high  dividends. It is probable, of course, that numbers of the institutions which have advanced money  now  require it back again. The banks to-day are charging 7  per  cent.,  and  up to <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> and  8  per  cent, on overdrafts; individuals  are  lucky, indeed, to find their requirements met, even' at  that  rate. The banks  will not  touch  a  straight-out mortgage offer; the wouldb0 mortgagor, therefore, often  has  to go to  a  financial institution of a different character,  and  frequently he is compelled to  pay  unduly heavily  for  accommodation. When  that  unhappy  day  arrives, when their present measure of protection is removed, borrowers  will  be in the hands of the institutions which have advanced them money;  and  unless the period of " cover" is extended for  a  much longer term than the Bill proposes, the borrowing producer will find himself playing the part of an eternal debtor.  I  have been speaking with some of  our  small producers, and they have indicated that, rather than- shoulder the tremendous burden which is looming ahead, they  may  be forced to go out on the roads  ana  enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. . They will " put Matilda up," and will leave their holdings to the rabbits by day  arndt  the mosquitoes by night. As for the  man  who has done his duty to his country  and  to his Creator, and has taken upon  himself  the burden of a family, he will  le  borne down by worries, and will find  himself  counting the days for which his  protection  remains, just as a man counts  the  remaining hairs of his head when  he  begins to . get into the " sere and yellow." If the provisions of the Bill are  not  extended, I feel confident that production* will be- stifled. The measure provides  for  hard, cases being dealt with by the Court, but heaven help any poor devil who  may  have to go to a Court for assistance.  He  might as well give up the struggle  at  once. I am reminded of an experience of some friends of mine in this Parliament. Although they got the verdict <inline font-style="italic">ia</inline> a Court case, they were deprived  of the  results because of some rotten State  law.  Any small man who goes into Court  has  an uphill battle to fight. He might  get  justice in the1 end, but the procedure  is  very tedious and costly, and he might very well accept the advice given by a very well-known lawyer in New South Wales, who, upon learning that a friend of  his  had been threatened with an action  with  respect to- .the ownership of an overcoat, said to him - " Take my advice, and give him the overcoat." I may give  some  practical illustrations of the position <inline font-style="italic">ia</inline> which some men are finding themselves. I know of a returned soldier who paid a deposit of £75 on a property valued  by  the seller at £600. He applied to  the  Repatriation Department, and the  departmental  valuer estimated the value  at-  £200, so it was impossible for that  returned  soldier to place the mortgage  with  the Repatriation Department. He  had  either to forfeit his £75 deposit, or accept liability for a property valued  by  the Repatriation Department  at  £200, but which some land shark had sold  to him  for £600. This Bill will not assist men in that position, and I think  some  provision- should be made for them. </para>

The blame really rests upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> people who refused to give the Commonwealth Government authority to deal with these matters. * I feel confident,  however,  that the Government would be perfectly safe in introducing legislation along the lines of regulations made under The W.ar Precautions Act, and that the people will eventually give them full authority in this direction.. There is never a unanimous expression of opinion !&gt;y the Judges in any -appeal to the High Court, and on almost every  occa«ion  when an appeal is made to the Privy  Council,  the majority decisions of the High Court have been upset. We ha.ve six -different company laws in Australia. It is time the people of Australia gave power to the Commonwealth 'Government to deal with all national matters. Look at the huge burden the '5,000,000 people 5n this country have to bear. Next year We shall have to find £25,000;00Q- as interest on money .borrowed for war, repatriation, and war pensions, and other purposes. I am waiting with interest for  the  financial statement to ascertain how the 'Government propose to raise the money. I 'de- not think very much more can be expected from direct taxation ; and 1 do not know whether- the Government expect to get more revenue through the  Customs,  'but they must endeavour to get it 'from that source which, at present, is not feeling too severely the pinch of taxation. They must look to those people  who  are wasteful, for more revenue, and  also  find out some means of reducing the 00St of Government, not by discharging civil -servants, or cutting down salaries. - I shall never be a party to that method - -but, by .finding the square pegs in the -round holes; the occupations in which  six  men are employed doing the work of one main, thus cutting down our expenditure. </para>
                    <para>Last week one honorable senator opposite indicated  how  hundreds of thousands a year could he saved to the taxpayer. If the Government had the time and inclination to continue along the path of financial reform, I have no doubt that wit taxpayers could be relieved of nearly one-half their present burdens. No body desires that the Government should attempt to secure economy by the reduction of wages. It has been demonstrated, by the seamen's strike, that our  seamen.  have been poorly paid, even in comparison with the countries of cheap labour. The 'Scandinavian seamen were better paid. </para>

                            <para>- I am very sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but I read the report of the debate  in the other House, and found that very wide scope was there given, to the discussion of this Bill. .If I am  out  of order, I shall reserve any remarks om this phase .of the question for another occasion.. But I contend that as this Bill bears more .on the financial situation than any other I know of, I would be in order if I could show how money may he saved to this country. We"know that for every primary producer, there .are at least three men living upon his industry, .but who do nothing .for it. One may go into any rural town, and find hosts of land agents and jobbers at work. If .that business were nationalized, one  man would be able to do the whole of the work, and the primary producers would be relieved of some portion of their burden. One may go into- any city in Australia, . and find the same conditions prevailing. In the suburb where I am living there are twelve business places, and out of that number three are land agents, who are all making money ; some of them, :in 'fact, have retired on their means. All that tends to make primary producers suffer, and the business I have mentioned should be placed on a satisfactory basis so that it would not be necessary to have so much competition. The same applies to the distribution of necessary commodities ; hut I cannot deal with that aspect of the question just now, in view -of the President's ruling. Producers must be protected, and this measure will  safeguard .them to some extent until the time specified in the Bill expires. But when the financial flood-gates are open we shall find the position completely changed, and 'borrowers will 'be compelled to raise -money for business purposes at exorbitant rates, or to suffer foreclosures to satisfy the demands of financial institutions. It may be that the Bill will be tested and found to be invalid, but if that is so, I am sure the people of this country will be behind the Government. </para>

                    </continue><para>There was a case the other day in which a borrower was charged interest at the rate of 250 per cent., but in this case a widow was the lender, and not the borrower. What was the result? The lender merely heard all the Judge had to say, and was immediately let loose to again prey upon honest people. I know of another case in which a young man paid a deposit on some land, but was £35 short, and the financial institution with which he was negotiating charged him no less than £9 as interest for a loan of £35. It was one of the big Australian financial institutions that has branches all over the country, and although this legislation was in force, the New South Wales Mont de Piete - that was the institution concerned, and I am not afraid to mention the name - charged approximately 25 per cent, interest on the loan. When we hear of such cases under the regulations that have been in operation, and which were instituted by the Labour Government, we are justified in seeing that the people are properly protected from those who care not whom they crush. </para><para>The estimate given by a Minister in another place was that when the moratorium regulations expired the amount called up would be approximately £100,000,000. I have been endeavouring to ascertain from competent financial authorities if that estimate is anywhere near the mark, and have been assured that the amount mentioned will not cover one-fifth or one-quarter, of the money likely to be called up. The sum mentioned appears to be only a conjecture of the Government. According to </para><para>
                        <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs.</inline>
                        our private wealth is £1, 760^000,000, and the estimated value of land and improvements £1,106,000,000. If these figures are correct, and can be taken as a fair indication of Australia's wealth, the Minister is allowing for only 10 per cent, of the mortgages to be called up. If these huge payments have to be met, businesses, in many instances, will be absolutely paralyzed, and money will not be available for carrying on commercial undertakings, or to assist in starting new businesses. There is every indication oi the country being faced with a huge financial avalanche during the next few years. 1 regret the Government are not allowing borrowers sufficient time to recover from the financial strain caused by the war. Many borrowers have invested in various war loans, and it is unfair to those who have done their duty by assisting the Government in subscribing to weir loans to be unnecessarily hampered.
                    </para><para>Money is obtainable more cheaply in Great Britain than in Australia, and we cannot look to British investors to place their money in Australia if they can secure better terms in Great Britain. We must endeavour to conserve our own resources by unanimous effort, and it will be a fatal day when the financial flood-gates are opened and the financial institutions of the Commonwealth are allowed to do just as they like. I hope the Government will listen to reason, and will extend the times for repayments beyond those stipulated in the measure. </para><para>When the Bill is in Committee I intend to move that the word "' February," in the first line of the sliding scale. in regulation 13, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ' ' July ' ' . That would give the borrower a little more time in which to adjust his financial affairs. When the Bill was being discussed in another place, the Government were asked to extend the time of repayment by twelve months, but they refused. I hope, however, they will be prepared to grant an extension of at least six months. Finance is the backbone of every industry, especially in a young country like Australia! We are the richest country in the world in agricultural, pastoral, and mineral wealth, and can produce much more than we require We should conserve our own interests-, by producing locally all the articles we wear and the food we consume. I believe that we shall in due time be able to meet all our liabilities, but if something is not done in the direction I have indicated, financial chaos will certainly be brought about in this country. Times out of number the Government have been asked to assist Australian industries, and they have usually responded to the request in a very small way by providing for a bonus or something of that sort. I shall not trespass further on those lines, but will conclude by saying that I intend to support the second reading of the Bill, and when we get into Committee I shall ask honorable senators to extend the operation of its provisions until July instead of January. </para></speech>

                        <para>. -I shall be very brief in referring to this measure. I feel sure there is a feeling amongst honorable senators that the principles of the Bill are worthy of general approbation. For my own part, I heartily approve of the principles of the moratorium regulations and of the proposal under this Bill to extend their operation for a certain period. We must all. realize that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has pointed out, it is not possible for people who to a certain extent were in financial hobbles before and during the war, to extricate themselves from their difficulties immediately on its termination. They must be afforded an opportunity to put themselves right financially. I was very much interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> indicate his intention to propose in Committee a still further extension of the operation of the moratorium regulations beyond that which the Bill provides for. I would ask the Minister in charge of the measure to give earnest, and, if possible, favorable consideration to the suggestion contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> announcement. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There are two classes of extensions of the operation of the moratorium regulations provided for. One comprises what might be called extensions absolute; that is to say, extensions by the Bill for fixed periods. In the other class are the extensions for which, in individual cases, application is to be made to a tribunal.  The  whole of the circumstances have to be set out, and it will be for the tribunal to determine whether in all the circumstances the extension applied for in each case should be granted. If the Minister could see his way to provide for absolute extensions to be further extendible upon application to a proper tribunal, such as is already provided for under several of the moratorium regulations, that would, I think, be an improvement of the measure. So much for the general purpose and provisions of the Bill. </para>
                    <para>This measure is, in a sense, in the same class as the Commercial Activities Bill, which we have had under consideration. It is to enable us to "clear up," so to speak, after the war. This is a Bill to enable individuals who were placed in extraordinary financial relation when the war came upon us, or, perhaps, during the war, to clear up their financial affairs. The purpose of the Commercial </para>
                    <para class="block">Activities Bill is to enable the Commonwealth Government, as a Government, to clear up certain transactions and complete certain contracts entered into during the war, and for the purposes of the war. In speaking on the Commercial Activities Bill, I referred to the questionableness of its constitutional validity. I referred to the circumstances which, in my opinion, raised a question as to the competence of this Parliament to pass the Bill as a valid exercise of its legislative power in regard to defence. What I said on that point concerning the Commercial Activities Bill applies with equal force to the Bill now under consideration. If we have the power to pass  this  Bill, it rests upon the provision in the Constitution which in trusts to this Parliament legislative power in regard to defence and matters incidental to the exercise of that power. Our power in this regard is provided for by paragraphs vi and xxxix. of section 51 of the Constitution. From what was said in connexion with the Commercial Activities Bill, we know that there has been a test case in the High Court of the Commonwealth to. determine what exactly are the limitations of the powers of this Parliament in the exercise of the legislative jurisdiction conferred upon it by the constitutional provision which I have mentioned. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Farey</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Burvett,</inline> five Justices of the High Court took one view, and two another view, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> stated. Five Justices of the High Court held that the power in relation to the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth embraced such a matter as the fixing of the price of bread in various parts of the Commonwealth during a period of war. Two Justices of the High Court held that the power given to this Parliament to legislate with regard to naval and military defence had a very much narrower signification. Five Justices of the Court held the view that we have ample and extended powers to organize all our forces, of whatever character, during a period of war, for the prosecution of the war. Two Justices of the Court held that our defence power extends to the maintenance and equipment of the naval and military arms of our Defence Force and everything ancillary to such maintenance and equipment. </para>

Further, it was a legislative measure that was to have operation during the period of - war. Yet there was a difference of opinion of five to two amongst the Justices of the High Court as to the legislative competence of this Parliament .and of the power of the Commonwealth Government - the Executive and the  Governor-General  - to bring that legislation: into valid operation. "We are passing this Bill during a period which technically may be considered a period of war, hut which, in fact, is a period of armistice. So that in that respect eur case is weaker than- it was when the matter was previously considered by the High Court. We are  also  passing this measure to have operation during what will not be a period, of war, but will be an undoubted period of peace. In that further respect our case for the validity of this exercise of our legislative power is weaker still. </para>

                            <para>-Whether or not any State Parliament has exercised the power under paragraph xxxvii. of section 51 of the Constitution, I cannot, for the moment, say with certainty, but it is quite possible that a resolution passed by both Houses of a State Parliament would be regarded as a valid exercise of that power. It does not appear that the State Parliaments have been consulted in this matter. Perhaps it was not convenient for the Government to consult them. It might not have been possible to induce the Parliaments of all the States to refer the matter to this Parliament in sufficient time, but that is one of the ways in which our legislation on these matters might have been put beyond all possible doubt as to its validity. In view of the fact that the moratorium regulations have been operative for some considerable time, the Government might have reverted to the possibility of the termination of the war some day or another, and they might, some considerable time ago, have entered upon negotiations with the State Governments with a view to having this matter referred to this Parliament by the State Parliaments that we might legislate for the whole of the Commonwealth in a matter of such general moment. With my eyes open to all the possibilities in regard to the testing of the validity of this legislation, I am prepared to take the risk, and will vote for the second reading; and, if its validity can be upheld, no one will be more pleased than myself. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently there is a consensus of opinion that the principle underlying this Bill is that of necessity. I must, howver, maintain the position which I have previously taken up respecting the competency of the Federal Parliament to pass legislation of this kind. I regret that the easy course open to the Federal Administration was not availed of. The Government could have secured from the various State authorities an amplification or confirmation of its doubtful powers. If this measure is as necessary as it is generally regarded, no one can doubt that the State Parliaments would have granted the application of the Federal Government. I am sorry, therefore, that, instead of straining the powers of the Commonwealth Constitution, the Government did not approach the State authorities. </para>

                    <para>The war ended, so far as actual fighting was concerned, nearly a year ago. It is not as though the conclusion of peace had promptly followed the signing of the Armistice. It is not as though the ratification of the peace terms has been completed. Throughout this year, with the contingency always in view that legislation of this character would probably be necessary, the Federal Government could have approached the State Parliaments and Governments; but it preferred to stretch the powers which it doubtfully possesses. Why could it not have entered into friendly consultation with the States? </para>

                            <para>- I shall not take that for granted, but I believe that if the Commonwealth Government had made advances a ready response would have been met with. There is a greater chance of the validity of this legislation being challenged than, perhaps, there is in respect to any of the other measures which the Federal Legislature has passed upon the strength of its war powers. There is a constant undesirable, though, possibly, unconscious, tendency on the part of the National Government and Parliament to strain their powers at the expense of the reserved constitutional powers of the States. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the measure itself, honorable senators appear to be almost of one mind. I am not so sure, however, that the Bill is necessary, and that it will be of such all-round benefit as some honorable senators evidently consider it will be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> remarked that it was at present practically impossible to obtain money on mortgage. Why is that so? It is because that is a rather undesirable form of investment in view of the fact that money can be so profitably employed in other directions? That form  of investment is being further  discouraged,  because, by our legislation, mortgagees are being compelled to lend money on terms which are 40 and 50 per cent, worse than they could secure for it in the open market. Is there not many a property-owner who would be prepared to pay the ruling rate of interest if an opportunity to do so were given him ?  The money market is very much confused to-day by the existence of legislation of this description; and, while we may think it necessary and desirable to extend consideration to mortgagors, we may at the same time be hindering those who would take up accommodation at present rates of interest. I will not vote in opposition to the measure, but must express my regret that its validity has not been put- beyond question by the Government applying to the State Parliaments for confirmation of its doubtful powers. </para>

I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> to consider the difficulty of passing a similar measure through all of the six State Parliaments.. The honorable senator must appreciate that time was too limited to permit the Federal Government to adopt that course of action. The State Parliaments would have required to be assured of exactly what the Federal authority proposed. It would have been necessary for the Commonwealth Government to submit a specific measure to all the  State Parliaments; thus there could have been no amendment of that measure when it was introduced into the Federal Legislature. </para>

                    <para>Another point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was that one could not secure money from banks with which to take up a mortgage. Banking institutions have never made mortgage business their special affair. Money for mortgaging purposes nearly always comes from private sources, or from a few companies which do no other form of business. </para>
                    <para>I am of opinion that this measure, on the whole, will meet the necessities of the case. The sudden termination of the war may have put borrowers in a very awkward, position. In the schedules it is provided that a borrower, if he be hard pressed, can go before a Court, and explain his position. I am sorry that many people to-day are in a most unfortunate position with respect to their borrowings. I hope that in all such cases, if they are compelled to go to Court, leniency will be extended to them. If their position is examined by a stipendiary magistrate, the cost should not be large, and in all instances, I feel sure they will receive sympathetic treatment. </para>

We can surely thrash this matter out in Committee. It seems to me that in cases of hardship, and I know there are many, it is possible for a mortgagor to get considerable relief. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Bill provides for an extension of moratorium protection up to July, 1920., but it is within the power of the Court to give further protection, in hard cases, for another twelve months. The matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> is dealt with in the Bill. When there was difficulty in regard to shipping, it was possible for a wheat-grower to get into financial straits, although he had a good crop. The same remark applies to the fruit-growers of Tasmania. If it can be shown that any fruit-grower has been unable to meet his liabilities, even in respect of rent, because of war conditions and shortage of shipping, he cannot be ejected during the period of moratorium protection. We have been reasonably successful in making payments for wheat, and very few cases of wheat-growers will come under this special provision of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know if there is any serious objection to the word " one" being inserted after the word " twenty " in the last line of the clause. The Bill has been introduced to assist mortgagors over the disturbed condition into which the world has thrown them. I have considerable sympathy with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and think that an extension of the moratorium for another twelve months would be acceptable. </para>

                            <para>- Unless the Minister can advance some serious objection to an extension of the main provisions,. I do not think any harm would be done by agreeing to the amendment. There is provision, of course, for mortgagees receiving 6' per cent. on borrowed money, but I can imagine a case in which a mortgagor would find himself in a serious position if compelled to meet his liability, or renew his mortgage within twelve months after the declaration of Peace. It will be a considerable time before the financial affairs of the world get back to normal. </para>

                        <para>.  - I hope the honorable senator will not press his amendment, although as a private individual I may have no objection to an extension of time. After all is said and done, there is nothing sudden about the Bill, because when the moratorium was brought into operation, no one anticipated that the war would last so long, and there has been ample notice, since the signing of the Armistice, for mortgagors to make their arrangements. This matter has not been lightly decided. It was felt that we could not throw a proposal like that now made amongst the financial institutions after the strain of the war. Although the mortgagor himself has not been individually consulted by the Government, I think every genuine hard case will be provided for. There must be some terminating point. It might be a good argument to say that a community should have two years within which to settle down, but, as a matter of fact, it is possible now for hard cases to enjoy this protection for two years. Indeed, we have had practically since November last to prepare; so that in some cases there will be nearly three years' grace. It must be remembered also that lenders are not always wealthy men, and that an extension of the period might mean an injustice to them. I feel confident that those who have had . a close experience of the abnormal times, will welcome any attempt to get back to normal at the earliest possible moment. There are, of course, sharpers in every community, and I have no doubt that an odd person here and there will attempt to increase the interest rates against a man who is not able to meet his liabilities. Harsh cases will be dealt with in a sympathetic manner. I ask honorable senators to realize that mortgages are with . some  people perpetual, and that all the mortgages will not be falling due on the same day. Moreover, the banks will be able to accommodate borrowers by granting an extension of time. Judging by the recent returns for exports, it is clear that there is a fair amount of money in Australia. Honorable senators must also realize that there are two sides to the case, and, reviewing all the circumstances, the Government consider that they have arrived at a happy medium. It must not be overlooked that lenders have been awaiting their money for a long period. </para>

                            <para>- The rate is that fixed in the mortgage, or 6 per cent., whichever is the higher, and I do not think people will be able to say that lenders have bean profiteering, if they are to be judged by the interest charged. To all practical purposes the war is over, and seeing that all interests have been considered in detail by the Government, and that every effort has been made to protect the weaker members of the community, I ask honorable senators to pass the clause in its present form, unless it is their desire to extend mortgages indefinitely. The Senate should accept a fair compromise, because if we extend the time of repayment for another six months, there is every probability of a request being made for still another six months, and so on. In fact, some would like an indefinite extension. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is just as well for us to be clear on this matter. The Minister said the rate of interest was 6 per cent., or the original amount set out in the mortgage, whichever is the higher. That is quite correct for £2,000 or over, but for amounts of £2,000 or under it is the original amount in the mortgage, or 6 per cent., whichever is the lower. Millions of this money was borrowed before the war at something like 4 per cent., and those borrowers have been enjoying under the moratorium regulations a low rate of interest, and are now to be allowed to continue for another ten months below the market rate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> might take it into consideration that very often people who lend money are themselves borrowers, and may be greatly inconvenienced in not being able to recover from a more wealthy borrower. </para>

                        <para>-  I am entirely in agreement with the statement made by the Minister.I do not look upon this Bill as an important one so far as commercial interests are concerned, because practically all the money borrowed since the moratorium regulations came into force has been borrowed by the borrowers contracting themselves out of the provisions of the moratorium. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has stated, the Bill affects, so far as business interests are concerned, only the amounts owing when the regulations came into force. It seems unfair to the lenders that borrowers should go on paying a low rate of interest indefinitely, and  the  happy medium suggested by the Government has my hearty support. It is a reasonable proposition, and, considering that the regulations were introduced for  war  purposes, I think it should be accepted. We shall all be happier when we get back to pre-war conditions. The Bill provides that special consideration shall be given in harsh cases for an extension up to twelve months. The moratorium regulations have been applying to borrowers for a long time, and they have had ample notice of the date of their termination. I believe the Bill  will  have general support, and will be favorably viewed by the lenders, if not by some borrowers. It is time some finality was reached. I support the remarks made by the Minister, and if the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is put to a vote, I shall oppose it for the reasons given. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> because  I  believe that the time has not been sufficiently extended. Although the great international conflict has ceased, we  are  on the verge of an economic war. It  has  been said that certain mortgagees  will  not raise the interest to borrowers, but every one knows that, as soon as the opportunity presents itself, interest rates  will  be increased, because lenders do not advance money for the benefit of their health. I want the Government to control this business as they have done during the war, as that would considerably benefit a large section of the community. </para>

                        <para>. - I find a little difficulty in answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> query off-hand. It is always hard when people are called upon to pay debts, but there  mUst  be fair play in matters of this sort. Many mortgagees have gent without their money - in some cases for five years - and if there has been abuse under these regulations, which were necessary during the period of the war, there has been more abuse on the part of the borrowers than on the part of the lenders. Many borrowers have taken undue advantage of the moratorium provisions. The Bill extends the moratorium for an additional twelve months, and leaves it to the discretion of the Court to make an extension up to two years in certain cases. A mortgagor, perhaps, may have, lent his money on a few houses, to a man who has, perhaps, more than himself, for five years at a rate of interest that was, perhaps, acceptable during the war period, and we are now going to say that the wealthier of the two shall have the benefit of an extension up to two years. Such benefits could be further extended until we were inviting the community to actually repudiate their debts. There is a fair limit, and I do not see that it should be extended in the manner suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> seeing that discretionary power is provided. We have endeavoured to be absolutely fair in this regard, and as far as our limited knowledge goes, we have taken into, consideration various circumstances, and have tried to be just to all parties. We suspended the mortgage provisions during the period of the war, and now the war is over we are being asked to extend them almost interminably, which is veering towards repudiation. I am anxious to give fair play to all concerned. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not.. If a case has been extended by the Court, this Act will remain in operation until the last case is cleared up. In connexion with the soldiers, we have to remember that several hundred may remain in England for some time after demobilization has been completed. The Government will issue a proclamation saying that the war is over, and the Act will cease to operate, but the soldiers' interests must be watched. We have also to remember that soldiers' dependants have to be protected, and during the war period many benefits have been conferred upon soldiers and their dependants by the regulations. The Government have already agreed to an extension of time in the House of Representatives, and it is asking a little too much to expect that they will consent to a further extension. I therefore ask honorable senators to. be content with the compromise to which the Government have agreed. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support the amendment. The Minister has suggested that honorable senators should be actuated by the spirit of British fair play in dealing with the lenders of money; but I believe that they should be equally influenced by that spirit in dealing with the borrowers of money. In a great many cases, the borrower is a man who has sought the lender in a struggle to pay off indebtedness on his home; whilst, as a rule, the lender is a man possessed of surplus cash, which he invests at a good rate of interest. I know of a number of cases in which men have raised mortgages upon their homes for the purpose of taking up war bonds. Before the moratorium was proclaimed, and soon after that, a number of men took out mortgages on their little properties with a view to the purchase of war bonds, fully believing that the principal would not be called up until such time as the war bonds were liquidated. </para>

                            <para>- That would be a very just thing to do in many cases, though I quite realize that it would not be practicable. The fact remains that if the mortgagee closes down in the cases to which I have referred, it will be necessary for the borrowers to sell their war bands, at a time, it may be, when the market is not so good as it is at present. As &lt;a result, because of their patriotic action in mortgaging their property to lend  money to the Government, these mortgagors will be very great sufferers. I admit that it is not possible to continue the moratorium for ever, but I support the amendment, because it. will extend its operation till a later date than that provided for in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- No valid reason has been advanced why the moratorium should not. be extended for the very moderate period of twelve months. In submitting my amendment,  T  am not making any attack upon those who lend money at interest. I look upon mortgagees as very useful individuals in our commercial and industrial life. It is not my intention to classify them all  as  Shylocks who must have their full pound of flesh. The moratorium was agreed to to prevent financial disorganization, and possible ruin, to many persons who were committed to certain loans during an abnormal condition of the financial market owing to the war. If it is agreed that the principle of the moratorium is good, I want to know what harm there can be in extending it until a period at which we may reasonably conclude that we shall have returned to normal conditions. </para>

                            <para>- I did not assume that the Minister would accept that state.ment literally. There will of course be a period when it will not be reasonable to advance as an excuse for this kind of legislation that war conditions are still operative. But I say that there can be no doubt in the mind of any honorable senator that war conditions will be operative for the next two years, and will very seriously affect the financial conditions in the Commonwealth. Those who have lent money will suffer no injustice, since they will receive 6 per cent, on their money. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so in the case of small loans, but all lenders will receive interest on the money they have lent. I remind honorable senators that those who took up the first war loan are receiving only4½ per cent., and they are offered only 5 per cent. for further Government loans. There are many instances in which the mortgagors borrowing from private lenders have security that is absolutely sound, but not at its face value, and lenders would to-day probably not lend upon the same security at less than 7, 8, or 9 per cent. The mortgagees who have invested their money upon this sound security will receive their interest regularly, and if they were to force the mortgagors to renew their loans, it is possible that the latter would have to pay double the interest they are paying now, and that would mean absolute ruin in many cases. In view of the fact that the extension of the operation of the measure would do no injustice to any one, and might mean absolute financial salvation for a number of people, I shall press my amendment to a division. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has put the case very well to the Committee, and the Government, knowing the circumstances much better than we do, have, I believe, struck a happy medium. I think the extension of the operation of the moratorium regulations to 31st July next is a very fair proposal. I direct the attention of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and other honorable senators to the fact that hundreds, if not thousands, of persons have invested their money at a low fixed rate of interest. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that before the war took place a number of these investments were made at a very low rate of interest, and quite a large number of persons, including widows and children, are dependent upon incomes derived from those investments. Although their incomes are fixed, the cost of living has been going up, and in this way many persons of the middle class are today in more straitened circumstances than are the working classes, of whom we hear so much. If these people are called upon to renew their mortgages, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> says that they may be charged 8 or 9 per cent., but we know that 6 and7 are the ruling rates of interest at the present time. </para>

It is of no use to pretend that the harpies and sharps of society are going to ruin the poor mortgagor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and other honorable senators who bring sentiment into the consideration of the matter should recognise the position of small investors dependent upon fixed incomes derived from money lent at a low rate of interest. I consider that the extension of the operation of the moratorium regulations to the 31st July next will be satisfactory. If it is then found that things are in a very bad way, the Government may feel called upon to propose a further extension. </para>

                            <para>- I think that a very fair compromise has been agreed to by the Government. To further extend the operation of the moratorium regulations would, I think, be very unjust to the people to whom I have referred, who have no means of increasing incomes derived from the lending of money at low rates of interest. I shall vote against the amendment and against any proposal for a further extension than the Bill provides for. In my view, considering the confused conditions of financial affairs at the present time, the Government are proposing to legislate quite far enough ahead in this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - Since I have expressed doubt regarding: the validity of legislation of this character, I would be inconsistent if I were to support an amendment calculated to project the operation of this measure into a period when war conditions will be no longer existing. I shall not argue the merits of the measure; I am concerned only regarding its validity. If the Bill is essential in the interests of a large body of producers, what authority can be so cognisant of and sympathetic with the situation of those people as the Parliament of the State in which they are domiciled? I again express regret that the Commonwealth Government did not first consult the State Governments and Parliaments. </para>

                    <para>If the validity of this measure is taken for granted, I am of opinion that its operation will not be harsh. An applicant for extended consideration may go before a Court of law. There, no doubt, a sympathetic hearing would be given, and such relief as might be possible would bo granted. It is hot unlikely that by 31st July, 1920, the validity of this piece of legislation may have been challenged. If, thereafter, it were held competent for the Commonwealth Parliament to project the period of protection of mortgagors for a still further term, I would not be inconsistent in revising my present views and voting for such extension. </para>

If the Committee does not see  fit  to agree to it, it will be of no use for me to move subsequent amendments. It makes a great deal of difference to-day whether an individual desires to borrow or to lend. A friend of mine called on an agent with whom he had been doing business previously, and asked the rate of interest. The reply was, "7 or 7½ per cent. to you." The client said, "I want to lend this time, not borrow." The reply was, That is quite a different matter. I can only give you 6 per cent." I feel sure that so soon as the period of protection is ended a floodtide of trouble and depression will sweep over the country. The man. of humble means who has borrowed to put money into the various war loans is bound to be a severe loser. Personally, I do not think this is a valid measure, and I look forward to one or other of the States testing its validity . </para>

The particulars given to us the other day by the Minister were informative, because while some honorable senators may have an intimate knowledge of many agricultural industries, very few are competent to express an opinion about flax. I, for one, am not, and I should like to see the Government exercise a paternal control over this industry for the next ten years at least, because, after the speech made by the Minister during the. second reading of the Bill, I am much impressed with its possibilities. I trust the Minister will see his way clear to agree to an extension of control for another ten years. </para>

                    <para>. - I would have no objection to an extension of the period of control, because I feel satisfied that, if, properly developed, there is a great future for the flax industry; but the legal advice tendered to the Government with respect to this measure is that Parliament has no authority to extend what were the war powers of the Government beyond the time necessary for the fulfilment of -certain contracts; that is to say, we can only complete contracts originated during the period of the war. The British Govern»ment have contracted to purchase the output of the flax-growers in Australia for the "next two years. Personally, I would' be in favour of the Government exercising control over this industry for all time, provided there were reasonable adjustments in regard to prices. I shall do what I can to benefit the industry, but, as I have pointed out, it is not possible to extend Government control under this Bill. We cannot compel the British Government to contract for a greater period. Apart altogether from this Bill, I believe something will be done in connexion with flax growing, because the British -.Government are anxious to develop it'. Already they have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to encourage the industry within the Empire. It is one of the special subjects at present being studied in England, and I believe important developments will take place in Australia.' In view of what I have said, I ask the honorable senator not to press his amendment. </para>

They do not object to co-operative selling, and they have no objection to being organized, but they strongly object, many of them, to unnecessary interference by the Government. They object to a domination, sometimes an arbitrary domination they fear, by the Minister in charge of the Dairy Pool, and at a later stage, when we  are  dealing with some of the regulations, I shall endeavour by suggestion, and, if necessary, by amendment, to obtain for those engaged in the dairying industry absolute control of their own products. In their trade papers, from time to time, there is evidence that they are much concerned over this Bill, which gives the Government the right to sell their property at any price they choose, and also gives the Minister power to override any decisions of the Advisory Committee. I have a cartoon here with these words at the foot of it- </para>

There may be clauses under which this matter can be discussed more fully; I merely wish now to draw the Minister's attention to the matter. There is a difference of opinion on the clause under discussion, and I hope that the Bill will emerge from Parliament embodying the least possible Ministerial control, and with the maximum control left in the hands of the men who are being organized under this measure.

                        <para>- That is quite a different matter. The Bill is one of twenty-six pages, incorporating regulations under which it is proposed to act, and, consequently, these regulations will constitute a part of an Act of Parliament. This clause gives the Government power to repeal, alter, or add to, any of the regulations comprised in the Bill ; but it does not say that the regulations shall be in accordance with the principles of the Bill, nor does it say that regulations inconsistent with the principle of the Bill shall not be framed. The clause gives the Government the power to alter, repeal, or add to any regulation, or, in other words,  to interfere as they like with the principles passed by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Only so far as may be necessary for the purpose of completing contracts. The clause gives the Minister wider powers than have been given under any other Act of Parliament that does not include the regulations. Various Pools have been in existence for some time, and the regulations have been altered as the circumstances demanded. If there is anything to repeal or alter, and if the principles embodied in the measure are to be vitally affected, adjustment should be made  by  introducing an amending Bill, as is done in other instances. If we need to amend the Defence Act an amending Defence Bill is introduced, and, in the same way, if we have to amend our Income Tax Act, an amending measure is brought down. This measure deals with millions of pounds worth of primary products, and is just as important as any other Bill. I do not want to give the Minister power <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche,</inline> and that is what it means. </para>

"We have been legally advised that if Peace be signed before the Bill is passed, we have no power to do as he suggests, and, therefore, it would be impossible to carry out the policy he indicates. I might have explained the position earlier for the information of honorable senators. We must have power to frame regulations, because it is not possible to do all that is necessary by means of an Act of Parliament. If we encounter any difficulty,, we shall have no power to amend the Act. </para>

                <para>Improvements have been made in con-; trolling the Pool, as a result of experience gained, and frequently regulations have been amended when necessary for the more effective control of this colossal work. It would be ridiculous to hamper the Government in the manner suggested, because we would not have power to amend  the  Act. There has been no domination, and it is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to talk about Government domination, because, when ships were not available, and stocks of butter were accumulating, the producers were almost pleading with the Government to handle their  produce. There has never been any domination on the part of the Government; but there was a period when the butter producers had difficulty in finding a market for their produce, and asked for our assistance. We are merely co-operative agents, and have been endeavouring to organize in the interests of the producers. I am a strong believer in collective dealing, and the Pools were established to benefit  both  producer and consumer. Discretionary power has been given to the Government, and the next sub-clause will make my meaning clear. It reads - </para>

                    <para>. - There is no such thing as a written contract existing between the Commonwealth and the British Government for the purchase of the Australian wool clip. Everything has been done by a series of cablegrams. Briefly put, the matter is not difficult to understand. I repeat what I said on the second reading of the Bill. The British Government have purchased the whole of the Australian wool clip, less Commonwealth requirements, on identical lines as regards terms, conditions, and valuation as for the previous season. That is easily understandable. It is to say, that the Commonwealth Government determine what is the surplus, and we have absolute control of any wool required for any purpose within the Commonwealth without interference hy any outside authority. </para>

                        <para>- Wool for export is controlled by the Australian Wool Committee, but that control is exercised in full co-operation with the British Government. The reason for this is that, during the period of the war, we were engaged in more than actual fighting with our enemies. We were at war in matters of trade, and in connexion with the disposal of raw materials. The Australian Wool Committee, in the matter of sales of wool overseas, never make a sale without the fullest co-operation of the British Government. I consider that that was a very wise policy to adopt during tb period of the war. In connexion with wool required in Australia, the Government are entirely free to do just as they please. There was, of course, a parity established in connexion with sales of wool in Australia. Wool is sold at a parity of 15½d. per lb. on a greasy basis. This applies to all supplies of wool for Australia., subject to certain exceptions, , and also to wool on sheepskins. The Government have full control over all wool that may he used for any purpose within the borders of Australia. </para>

I trust that during the period of reconstruction after the war there will continue to be the fullest co-operation with the Imperial authorities in regard to these matters', because, not only are British markets involved, but Australian interests are involved in connexion with some markets. We have in this matter acted in co-operation with the Imperial authorities, and agreed upon a mutual policy with them. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister will pardon me if I say that the position is not yet quite clear to me. I understand that the Government reserve all requirements of wool for the secondary industries in connexion with this clip. The position is very clear so far as it affects manufacturers of tweeds, but it is not clear as it affects manufacturers of wool tops. A large quantity of the wool tops manufactured in Australia is exported. The wool top industry has been built up by reason of the bounty passed by this Parliament in 1907. It has cost this country £70,000 in bounties to build up that industry. I want to know from the Minister whether this is to be considered a secondary industry for which wool was to be reserved for the purpose of manufacture and export from Australia, as it had been  exported before ? In other words, have the British "Government control of the export of wool tops from Australia, or do the Commonwealth Government control it? </para>

                    <para>. - Wool required for any purpose, whether it be the manufacture of a tam-'o-shanter or. of wool tops, within the borders of Australia is within the complete and absolute control of the Commonwealth Government. I have pointed out that for various reasons connected with the war it was agreed that there should be control of the export of wool tops, so as to preserve a wool parity, because we did not desire to put people in other parts of the world on a better footing in this regard than Great Britain during the recent heroic struggle in which that country has been engaged. There are many things which I might say on that subject, but I shall not refer to them at this stage. I say that within the borders of Australia the powers of the Commonwealth Government in the matter of supplies of wool for local requirements are unlimited, but in the matter of overseas trade we act in co-operation with Great Britain, so that other, countries shall not secure an advantage as against Great Britain and Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter is of great importance to Australia. I am not here to criticise harshly the administration of the Wool Pool, but I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that four interests are concerned in connexion with the administration of the Pool. One interest is that of the wool-growers, which, of course, is predominant. Another is the interest of the financiers and brokers. A further interest is that of the secondary industries connected with wool ; and a fourth is the interest of the country. I want to say that, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the wool-growers are reasonably satisfied with the scheme. Although they know that very much higher prices are being obtained on the world's parity for Australian wool to-day, a number of them are not hypercritical in connexion with this matter, as they prefer a stabilized price to violent fluctuations. They say that it is better that they should get a reasonably good price, and prevent violent fluctuations, than that the industry should be up in the skies today and down in the depths to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- There is a good deal of criticism with regard to the price paid for our wool as compared with the world's parity today but I am not aware that there is any general feeling amongst the wool-growers of Australia that the Government have not made a reasonably good deal, on the whole. I do not think that the agents and brokers have very, much to complain about, because, from their balance-sheets, it is clear that they are doing better now than they ever did before. </para>

                        <para>- From the standpoint of the country, I want to say that one of the dangers of the continuance of the present arrangement is that, previous to the war, somewhere about 85 per cent. of the wool clip of Australia was sold, distributed, and financed through Sydney and Melbourne. Undoubtedly, Sydney and Melbourne were the centres of the world's wool control. There is a danger which has to be guarded against, and it is that the centre of wool distribution under these continued pooling arrangements may be shifted from Sydney and Melbourne to London. That is a danger to the country. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not apportion the blame. We are paying very dearly for the primitive development of Australian woollen manufacture. I have no fault to find with the treatment of tweed manufacturers by the Central Wool Committee. But I have heard what I deem to be unfair criticisms expressed <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this Chamber witS regard to those manufacturers. Certain honorable senators have quoted from a report of the Inter-State Commission, dealing with the so-called abnormal profits of the tweed manufacturers. No one, however, has been fair enough to draw attention to the fact that the tweed mills have been working  throughout the war at double and even treble shifts. No one has pointed out that the prices at which manufacturers have supplied their goods have been limited by the Defence Department. Although those manufacturers' profits upon capital have apparently abnormally increased, their profits upon turnover have increased but little. We have heard much about profiteering. I have taken the trouble to secure samples of locally manufactured tweeds, and I have ascertained the prices actually charged by the factories to the warehouses. Those prices vary. For some of the cloths the quotation is as high as 10s. 6d. per yard, while for others the price is only 6s. 6d. About 3$ yards are necessary for the making of a suit of clothes for an average man; thus, the material represents a cost of between £1 and 35s. for the very best tweed that Australia can produce. Yet imported suitings, similar to these Australian samples, are sold by warehouses at very little less than 30s. to 35s. per yard. Owing to the very high prices for wool and tops, and for everything else in connexion with the industry in England, British materials cost the Australian wholesaler three or four times as much as Australian tweeds. We are paying a toll because we have not' sufficient local factories to produce our own requirements, amounting to,  approximately, £2 2s. upon every suit 'of clothes we wear. </para>

I feel strongly that unfair criticism has been launched against our local manufacturers, and that no one has been fair enough to point out all the facts. Machinery to-day costs three and four times as much as before the war. Prices are only 40 per cent, higher, while material and wages have advanced by 40 per cent. Further, the factories have been working two and three shifts daily, and, at the same time, prices have been regulated by the Defence Department. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> might have continued his argument and explained just where these great differences in prices occur. The Australian manufacturer gets his wool at 13d. per lb. - 2d. a lb. less than the price at which the wool is put on the English market - and only 7 lbs. 3 ozs. of wool are required for the manufacture of an all-wool suit. Our returned soldiers are furnished with an outfit for 30s. I am speaking on the authority of the manager of the Commonwealth mills at Geelong. </para>

                        <para>- It is an ordinary suit of clothes, which any civilian might be glad to wear. No man could desire anything better, so far as the quality of the material is concerned. I saw a suit displayed in a window in Bourke-street yesterday; it was marked at £14 14s. The material could not possibly have_ been purer or better than that contained in the suits provided by the Government for returned soldiers at a total cost of 30s. Some one must be " getting at " the public. It is only fair that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> if he knows the facts, should expose the profiteers. We hear too many allegations about profiteering to-day, and too little truth. If the manufacturers are in the grip of the wholesale houses, and dare not sell their cloth to tailors at less than a certain price, then we ought to know it; and if an exposure is made, we ought to be well on the way towards remedying this evil of profiteering. What I have said with regard to the wool dip pretty well covers the whole position. There is no doubt whatever that the primary producer himself is doing a fair thing by the country. In the case of the wool-grower, he is providing at a reasonable rate the raw material for the manufacture of the cloth; but the manufacturer has not been sufficiently progressive. He is employing antiquated machinery. It is years since we passed a Tariff giving manufacturers high protective duties ; and when the war came, and the shipping difficulty became acute, the opportunity occurred for them to secure the whole of the Australian market for themselves. With wool available at 2d. per lb. less than overseas, it is not a question of more protection at all. The Government mills are turning out blue serge cloth at a maximum price of a little over 7s. per yard. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will look into the position, he will find that the Government have power, so far as the woollen mills are concerned, to extend operations. I am. reminded of the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was Attorney-General in, I believe, the first Commonwealth Government. He had submitted to him a question in connexion with the manufacture of iron, and his opinion was that if the Government required any commodity for their own use, the Constitution clearly gave them power to engage in its production, and to market any surplus. If the Constitution is read with common sense there is nothing to prevent the Government selling all their surplus stock not needed for our returned boys. I think they have had a sale' of blankets - why not surplus woollens? It will be seen, therefore, that the Government have power to extend the manufacture of woollen materials; and if they do so they will confer an undoubted good upon the community. The manufacturers hitherto have had every opportunity to improve their position. </para>

                        <para>- It is a mere subterfuge to say that the manufacturers could not get the machinery. If they had had enterprise and foresight, they could have done so years ago, but they have been content to move along in a slip-shod manner with obsolete machinery. We have heard a good deal about . profiteering, and in my opinion the Government should take the shortest cut possible to deal with the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not quite share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's pessimistic view concerning the manufacturing industry; but I think the Government should exercise what power they possess to deal with the increase in prices, f we take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> statement  as correct, that the price of cloth turned out by the Australian private manufacturer ranges from 6s. to 10s. 6d. per yard, then the cost for sufficient cloth for an ordinary suit of clothes would be, at the outside, about 30s. And if we take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .de</inline> Largie's statement as correct, that the cost of the unscoured  wool for a suit of clothes is about 10s., and if we assume that the Australian manufacturer is doing his bit of profiteering, the difference between the cost of the raw material and the manufactured cloth is but a small proportion of the immense margin between the cost of the manufactured cloth and the price of a suit of clothes. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. There must be enormous profiteering on the part of the middlemen, because, according to the statement o'f the manufacturers, they are getting only a fair return on their capital, although if they had taken time by the forelock and had obtained a better class of machinery years ago, they would have been in a better position to-day. It appears that they are only getting a small proportion of the added cost of material for a suit of clothes. Who is getting the balance? Only a small proportion of the increase is due to the added cost of labour. All the evidence points to the conclusion that an enormous proportion of the margin goes to the warehousemen or middlemen. </para>

                        <para>- We know, of course, that warehousemen pay very heavy rents, but they do not stock clothing only. They warehouse a large number of other commodities. There is no doubt that a great deal of profiteering is done by the middlemen. It is the duty of the Government to discover who is dividing up the difference between 30s., the cost of cloth from the manufacturer, and the £9 9s., or £10 10s., or £12 12s. which a tailor asks for a suit of clothes to-day. When they have discovered the profiteers they should deal with them. If the Government have not the power, it is their duty to ask for an alteration of the Constitution to give them the control which the States possess and do not use. It is clear that the Australian manufacturers referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie are profiteering, and are asking for more than a reasonable return on their capital outlay. If they are receiving only 30s. at the outside for sufficient of the very best class of cloth necessary to make a suit, the tailors in every city in Australia, and in many large towns, are asking from £7 7s. to £10 103. for the finished article. </para>

                    <para>. - Before moving an amendment I propose making the position a little clearer in connexion with the manufacture of tweeds. The information concerns tweed manufacturers solely, and has nothing to do with warehousemen, tailors, or middlemen. Colonial-made tweeds have advanced in price only to the extent of 40 per cent. since the outbreak of war, whilst the advance in the price of wool and wages has also been approximately 40 per cent. The prices of colonial-made tweeds sold wholesale in Sydney to-day range from 6s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard, and approximately 3½ yards are required to make a suit of clothes. Consequently, , the wholesale cost of cloth for a suit made from Australian manufactured tweeds ranges from £1 for the lower quality to 35s. for the very best. That is a rise of about 40 per cent. on pre-war prices, which ranged from 14s. for anything now selling at 20s., and about 25s. for the quality now selling at 35s. Therefore, the rise in the price of colonial tweeds sufficient to make a suit of clothes is about 6s. for the lower grade and 10s. for the higher grade. Whatever the price of a suit of clothes may be at the present time, it is not the fault of the local manufacturer, because the extent of his profiteering ranges from 6s. to 10s. per suit, and as a set-off against that advance it must be remembered that his raw material and wages bill has advanced 40 per cent. His plant has also been working two or three shifts per day, and the wear and tear has consequently been greater, whilst the price of textile machinery is three or four times greater than before the war. That is the position from the manufacturer's stand-point. I am unable to follow the matter up to the man who completes a suit of clothes, and probably some of the additional cost is caused by the extra price of trimmings. The fundamental cause of the increase in price is because we make only one-third of the cloth we use, and import the other two-thirds. There has also been a general increase in the cost of tailoring, and a considerable increase in the price charged for trimmings. I am not sure whether the whole of the cost of making clothes is not based upon the price of imported cloth, which is not 6s. for the lower grade and 10s. for the higher grade, but ranges from £3 to £5 per suit. Our tweed manufacturing industry has not yet developed to the point where we can supply all our requirements. If all our cloth were made in Australia, and supplied at the prices </para>

                    <para>. - It is to be regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is so reticent that he will not supply the information the Committee desire. .  His <inline font-style="italic">apologia</inline> on behalf of the manufacturers does not throw any light on the subject, and, instead of telling us the price obtained per yard by the manufacturers, he should have explained why there is such a wide margin between the price charged by the manufacturer and that asked by the retailer of the completed article. We have been told that the manufacturer gets his raw material at a lower price than any other manufacturer in the world. We are supplying the industry with wool at 13d. per lb. - it cannot be obtained elsewhere at anything like that price - and fully 90 per cent. of the raw material is composed of wool supplied at a very low cost. It would be interesting if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> or some other honorable senator, would enlighten the Committee and explain the difference in prices. If the consumers are not to derive some benefit it would be better to send our wool overseas and sell it at a higher price, because the producers and the Government would both benefit. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> wishes to throw any light on the subject he should supply the information repeatedly asked for. </para>

                        <para>- Wages have not gone up 40 per cent. There is not a firm which has raised the wages of its employees to that extent. There is not one award by the Arbitration Court which has increased wages 40 per cent. during the period of the war. On the contrary, men have been struggling for five years without being able to secure any redress. Many of them have not received a penny by way of additional wages. It is ridiculous for honorable senators to suggest that wages have been increased by 40 per cent. </para>

As  a matter of fact, I nave ascertained that the contract price from the factory in Bourke-street is 29s. 6d. I also obtained full particulars from the Defence Department, and I learn that out of that amount about 6s. is allowed for workmen's wages. I repeat that there has been no increase of 40 per cent. , in the wages of any employees in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- And did not they deserve the increase? We all know that profiteering is rampant in our midst. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> himself admits it. Nobody doubts where that profiteering is going on. It is the individual who does no work at all, and who never sees the goods which he sells - the man who, perhaps, has a typewriter and a clerk - who is the profiteer. The indent agents are the excrescences on the social system of this and other countries. They are the men who are profiteering. There is only one way in which to overcome this evil, namely, by organization, by preventing six men from doing the work which could be accomplished by one. A little while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke of seeing six shops in one short street all doing the same class of business. Why, in the street in which I live there are nineteen bakers' carts every morning, notwithstanding that all the customers there could well be supplied by one. It is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to tell us that the woollen manufacturers have not made a lot of money out of the war. They have, and they have admitted it. Anybody who chooses to read the report of the Inter-State Commission's inquiry will see that. They have told that body what their profits have been, and also what their profits would have been if they had not watered their stock. </para>

                        <para>- We are at the commencement of a great trade war. We know that there are men who are busily engaged in forming organizations with a view to keeping British articles off markets that they have held for years. These men are settling the prices to be charged for the different commodities, and are informing those interested in the trade that if they do not join the Combine they will be sorry - that means they will be crushed. Our manufacturers are therefore falling into line. We require some strong Government measure to grapple with the whole situation. We cannot get that in Australia to-day, because we have a divided Government. The people who own the woollen mills and who have sent their samples here have made enormous profits during the war. That fact is upon record. Yet the increased cost of the raw materials in a suit of clothes as compared with pre-war days is only1s. 9d. If anybody is to get an increased profit, I should like to see the wool-grower get it. </para>

                    <para>. - There has been a good deal of wild talk during this debate, and much of it has been due to the fact that some honorable senators did not know what they were talking about. Anybody who ch  00663  to turn up the official reports of the Inter-State Commission's inquiries will learn that, since the outbreak of war, the clothing factories in Australia have been fully occupied. Before the war the mills were not constantly employed, and the turnover of the mill-owners - at any rate, so- far as tweeds were concerned - was not commensurate with their outlay. But as soon as the Government took possession of the mills, and began to manufacture flannels for our soldiers, those mills were kept fully employed, and mw of them paid a dividend, which they had not paid before. When the Government had accumulated sufficient supplies, the mills were returned to the manufacturers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has produced samples of various materials of local manufacture. Certainly there is nothing extortionate about the prices of those materials. But from the stand-point of quality these Australian goods cannot be compared with the imported articles. </para>

                        <para>- For wear at work a man usually buys " slops." The manufacturer who produces the material which has been shown here this evening does so at a fail- figure. From the stand-point of texture and price his product compares favorably with the material which is produced at the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, at Geelong. At those mills, which possess up-to-date machinery, and are run by a capable manager, the price of the cloth manufactured varies from 10s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. per yard. But if one goes to a wholesale house, he will find that be has to pay from 15s. 6d. to 22s. 6d. fr yard for it. That is the price which t' e tailor has to pay. Every honorable senator knows that in most little townships th-pro is a tailor who is not in a position to carry any stock of cloth. He has to depend on the wholesale houses in the city to supply him with up-to-date patterns, which, by the way, are a rather expensive item. The purchaser of a suit of clothes from him selects the material he desires from amongst those patterns, and ' the tailor then sends to the wholesale house for it. He has to run a long line of credit with a wholesale house, because the majority of his customers for suits do not pay him until they are compelled to do so. Tailors have to oblige their customers, and the wholesale houses have then to stand behind them and keep them going. I can speak with twenty years' experience of the business, and if I told honorable senators how tailors are bled by the'.r customers, they would not have so much to say about the high prices charged for suits at the present time. Customers who pay their tailors have to make good the debts of those who do not pay them. If all the tailor's customers paid for their suits he could supply them much more cheaply. Honorable senators may smile, but the item of bad debts is a- very serious item in the clothing business. If I were  to tell honorable senators the number of  nien  who went to the Front with debts owing to their tailors, they would be astonished. These men joined the ranks of our soldiers,, and could not be followed up, and many thousands of pounds owing to tailors in Australia by men who went to the Front will never be recovered. I have asked merchants why they charged me such high prices for goods, and they have been unable to give a satisfactory answer. There is a big margin between the mill price and the price of the wholesale house. I may inform honorable senators that the woollen mills of Australia, by being able to get all the wool they require in this country at the price fixed, have received a gift of no less than £29,315 14s. Id. That should have been a b.'.g encouragement to them to carry on and produce a good article. </para>

                <para>Very high prices are charged to day for imported woollen goods/ and yet honorable senators call it profiteering when they are asked to pay £10 10s. or £12 12s. for a suit. One merchant showed me his bills of lading, his landing and warehouse charges, and proved that he was not so well off as in pre-war days, because of the. high prices charged for imported material. What the English manufacturers of woollen goods are doing I do not know. </para>

                        <para>- Many of the wholesale houses in charging such high prices as they do for imported goods cannot be accused of deliberate profiteering. They will show you the goods, and you can take them at the 1)11-ce they quote or leave them. Some houses are two years behind in their orders, and yet the warehouses in the Old Country will not accept fresh orders from them. I do not say there is not some profiteering going on, but it is <inline font-style="italic">nob</inline> anything like what honorable senators would have us believe when they talk of suits costing them from £10 10s.  to £14 14s. On almost every shipment of imported woollen goods there has been a rise of 2s. or 3s. per yard since the war began, and many in the trade would be only too glad to see prices brought down to the rates which prevailed under normal conditions before the war. Local manufacturers of woollen goods have been getting their wool at the flat rate of ls.  1½d.  per lb. I agree that the wool-growers have been doing exceedingly well, but T will admit that as a class, in view of the fact that, under other conditions they night have obtained a great deal more for their wool, because there has been a world's demand for it, they have, speaking broadly and generally, been very patriotic in their dealings with the Wool Pool. They have shown a patriotic spirit in making no complaint about a flat rate <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> ls. 3£d. per lb. for their wool when they know that in other countries wool has been fetching a very much higher price. </para>

                <para>I will say in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that the worsted turned out at the Government mills for naval officers' suits is a very good material of blue serge with a guaranteed indigo dye. The mill manager told me that he allowed for his percentage on those goods. They are the best of cloth, weighing 16 ozs. to the yard, and are sold at lis. 6d. per yard. Imported material no better in quality is sold in many places in Melbourne at from 27s 6d. to 30s. per yard. There are very few of the public or members of the Senate who could tell the difference between, imported and locally-made woollen goods. I can speak as an employer, a maker, and a traveller in the business, when I say that the average customer when he sees a decent piece of cloth takes it without any reason for his choice. He will usually pick the best piece from a bundle of patterns, although he has no technical knowledge of their quality. No one is more anxious than I am to assist local manufacturers of woollen goods. I should like to see up-to- date machinery introduced, and a bigger market for our products. If our local manufacturers and the wholesale people would come together with a desire to bolster up Australian industry, an impetus would be given to the trade which would keep it on its feet. I am in a position to inform honorable senators that in one of our mills last week they refused an order for 600 pieces of cloth because they were full up for the next twelve months, and they would not even entertain an order for the delivery of those goods six months  hence. </para>

                    <para>. - A curious discussion, characteristic of the times, has been tacked on to the consideration of clause 6 of the Bill. I am reminded by the remarks, that have been made of a statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and published in the press within the last week or so, to the effect that every one is blaming every one else for the evils of the times. In my view it particularly concerns legislators in times like the present that, in good Australian vernacular, they should " keep their blocks." I am not, perhaps, personally qualified to deal technically with the subject that has been discussed on .this clause, but I have lately made some investigations under the auspices of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> who is an expert in the clothing trade, and has been associated with it in a very large way for nearly forty years. Quite recently the honorable senator and I went to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and I saw there very much that I admired. The system seemed to be excellent, and was easily understood by me as an outsider knowing no more of the trade than the price he has to pay for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> suit of clothes. I obtained much information which throws light on the alleged profiteering. The manager of the factory stated that he made allowance for this, that, and the other in the ordinary commercial sense, and yet was able to provide for our soldiers a suit of ready-made standardized clothes at a cost of 27s. 6d. over all, plus, I think, ls. lOd. for a travelling cap. The soldier on entering into civilian life is thus able to secure a suit which, in the circumstances, may be regarded as a very good one, and at a very reasonable price. It is made of all wool, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> as an expert, acknowledged, is very well finished. But honorable senators should remember that these suits are ready-made, standardized suits made in certain sizes. They will find at the Factory fifty, sixty, or seventy folds of cloth, and a machine cutting from them fifty, sixty, or seventy pairs of trousers all of one size. Honorable senators do not purchase suits made in that way. That is not the kind of suit that the working man likes to wear. I am a working man, and I say that there is no one more particular regarding the Pt and set of a suit of clothes than is the hard-working  man who has a few pounds in his pocket. Honorable senators do not wear these standardized suits. </para>

                        <para>- Probably we shall have to wear sheepskins before it is all over. An honorable senator who wants a suit of clothes does not buy a standardized outfit. If he prefers a ready-made suit he can be accommodated in many an establishment at a price not greatly exceeding the quotation for the output of the Commonwealth Factory. Those soldier suits have not all been made in the Commonwealth Factory. There are other factories, which have been provided with the cloth and have turned out large orders. What does an honorable senator do when he requires a new suit? He goes to some place in the city which is paying a high rental, and he is met by an obsequious and courtly gentleman, who is adorned with a tape hanging over his shoulder. He is ushered into a cosy little room with plate-glass mirrors all round. That luxurious sort of thing has to be paid for, and the honorable senator makes his contribution when he buys his suit. Does he expect to get all those extras for nothing ? There is nothing ready made about this place of business. A tape is run over the honorable senator's Apollo-like form. The measurements are carefully set down upon a card or in a book. The cloth which he has chosen is not cut in any wholesale fashion, but is fashioned individually by a highly-paid person, who probably receives a salary in excess of that earned by the honorable senator himself. There is nothing wholesale about the putting together of this suit. It involves an individual operation from beginning to end. I dispute the assertion that any one pays £12 12s. for a suit of the same quality as the returned soldier's 27s. 6d. ready-made. The man who pays £12 12s. is buying' an imported material, and there is no locally-made cloth like it. In Bourke-street one may purchase a dress suit for £14 14s., but the cloth in that suit was not made in Australia. How do we know that profiteering is going on? I do not expect any one to run a business at a loss, whether it be a butcher's shop, a tailoring establishment, a lolly shop, or an out-back farm. I like to see people making reasonable profits. I am up against this so-called profiteering business in any general sense. I object to the "  cornering  " of  any commodity, but I like to know that the people of  Australia  are  making  good profits, no matter what may be their walk of life., Because an individual makes a profit should. I be fool enough to join in the outcry of "profiteer" and "villain <inline font-style="italic">" 1</inline> If I were to start a business tomorrow, and were to have so little regard for profit making as to land myself in the Bankruptcy Court, would I deserve anybody's sympathy? Would I get it?' But if I were to make a profit, should I not object to being denounced as  a  villain ? There is a shortage of most valuable and necessary commodities throughout the world. The Premier of Italy, the other day, told the Italian people that they could not expect cheap articles of food, seeing that 1,250,000 acres of the soil of Italy had gone out of cultivation since the outbreak of the war. </para>

                <para>What does the returned soldier very often do as soon as possible after receiving his civilian issue? He sells it; then he proceeds to a tailoring establishment, where he is measured, for an individual suit, for which he pays with the money secured from the bartering of his standard suit. All this wild talk with respect to our being charged £10 10s. and £12 12s. for a suit similar  to  the 30s. Commonwealth Factory ready-made is so much nonsense. The suit supplied to the returned soldier, although admirable in itself, is not very much cheaper than any similar ready-to-wear suit purchasable in any city in Australia. Let us discuss the whole matter, then, without frothing  at  the mouth about profiteering. </para>

                    <para>. - We are all profiteers. The trouble today is that prices for commodities generally can be fixed to the advantage of the manufacturer and producer, but that, at the same time, wages are not automatically raised. After listening to some honorable senators, one might be excused for arriving at the conclusion that profiteers will be hard to find in Australia. According to some of those honorable senators who have spoken to-day, everything in the world of trade and commerce is fair and legitimate. When we buy things we are not really adding to the hoards of 'the profiteers, but are merely paying the true value for every article we purchase! I have inspected the samples of tweeds which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has shown to the Committee. There is no better woollen material in the world than that manufactured from our Aus.tralian wool. The price which it commands in the American market proves that. In Australia, however,  Ave  are prone to depreciate the value of our own products. We say, or we hear, that the cloth produced in the Commonwealth is not- fit for making into suits, even for working men. I have been in the trade for thirty or forty years. I have known something of woollen materials since I was about twelve years old. I have had to do with all classes of wool and tweeds, imported and locally manufactured. Honorable senators will be surprised, perhaps, to know that the Albion Woollen Mills turned out material from our own wool which was sold in Flinders-lane, not as colonial cloth, but as the best West of England and the best French material. Of course, it was charged for accordingly, and the people unsuspectingly paid. Victorian whisky has been sold in a Brisbane club as the best imported spirits, and those who drank it, no doubt, smacked their lips over this excellent imported  liquor. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I have witnessed the process of manufacture in our Commonwealth Woollen Mills. Some of the tweeds turned out from our own grown wool are equal to anything imported, and the cost was only 5s. 9d. per yard. The cost of some of the material from which the samples on the table of the Senate were cut would be about 10s. 6d. per yard. After the addition of 25 per cent. by the wholesaler, a tailor should be able to turn out a suit for from £4 5s. to £4 10s., and make a satisfactory profit. Suits cut by £12aweek tailors are not made for working men. They are "built" for people who do no work. The ordinary cutter does not make a higher salary than an honorable senator. He is usually paid from £5 to £6 a week. In the Commonwealth Factory that is the prevailing wage for cutters. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator gets well paid for the work he does here. There are honorable senators who disparage Australian-made goods, and who prefer to praise imported manufactures. Until we change this attitude  About  our own goods, we shall not accomplish much. It is absurd to say we -cannot produce goods of a satisfactory quality from wool which the markets of the world are glad to get hold of. Prom the remarks of some honorable senators, one would think that we ought to be very  careful  before we talk about profiteering. Evidently there is an attempt to make it believed that there is not a great deal of profiteering going on at all; but when we look around and see the prices of various articles, and find that the sovereign has a purchasing power of only about 12s. now, it is evident that something is amiss. When I was in Sydney last week, I was informed that when the embargo was lifted off hides, they were purchased and repurchased for export, I believe to Germany; with the result that we shall be called upon to pay very much more for our boots in future. The sooner we realize the true position, the better it will be, so that something may  be  done to insure that the working man shall be able .to secure the full results of his labour, instead of being robbed, as at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to make one or two observations with regard to other subsidiary businesses connected with this, the greatest of our primary products. Tine fellmongering industry is wrapped up with the question of wool. Generally, it can he fairly said that, under this scheme, the wool-scourers have had more work than before, and that the present position is fairly satisfactory. But at Botany, unfortunately, a good many hundreds of men have been out of work, though I am' glad to say that quite recently matters have .revived somewhat, and at present in this industry there is not much cause for complaint. I should like to remind the Minister that in his second-reading speech he stated that we were treating now about 75  per cent, of the sheepskins in Australia, as against 25 per cent, before the Wool and Skin Pool was created. I do not know where the Minister gets his figures from , but I am hopeful, in view of his pronouncement, that, if the figures were perhaps a bit exaggerated,  the controllers of the Wool Pool will see to it that from now on at least 75 per cent, of the sheepskins will be fellmongered in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That does not essentially touch my contention. I hope that those in charge of the administration of the Wool Pool will see to it that these figures are maintained, because, so far as I can ascertain, out of approximately 3.000,000 sheep slaughtered in New South Wales during the first eleven months of this statistical year, at least 1,250,000 skin3 were exported. I am not complaining even of these figures. I am just drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that the administration of the Wool and Sheepskin Pool should be urged to give as much work as possible to the  fellmongeries  of Australia. </para>

                <para>I have a much more serious complaint to make with respect to the position of the wool- top industry. There is a case before the Court in connexion with agreements and accounts, and as it is <inline font-style="italic">sub</inline><inline font-style="italic">judice,</inline> one's (remarks, even about the industry itself, must be governed by good taste. I should like to say, however, that whatever may be the rights or wrongs of the present dispute, it seems almost a tragedy for Australia and the development of our secondary industries, that at Botany to-day there are literally acres of the finest wool top-making machinery lying idle. We have had an interesting discussion on textiles, and have been convinced that had we been in a position  to manufacture the whole of our woollens, the cost of living in Australia, so far as a suit of clothes is concerned, would have been materially reduced. 'We are suffering now, owing to the somewhat elementary position of the industry, which uses only about 3 per cent, of the total wool clip. There are only twenty-four mills in Australia, when work might be found for seventy-two, and owing to the elementary position of the industry we are called upon to pay extortionate prices for our imported clothing. Consequently it is an added pity that this rapidly developing wool-top manufacturing industry has had such a set-back. I am not going into the merits of the administration of the wool scheme » by the Central Committee, but I . am going to say, more in sorrow than in anger, that  one great blot on the administration is the present position of the wool-top industry. The following resolution was carried' at a meeting of the executive council of the Chamber of Manufactures in Melbourne on the 21st July, and was forwarded to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen:</inline> - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That,  in the opinion of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, it is a matter of vital national importance that the wool-scouring, top-manufacturing, and wool-spinning industries should not only be preserved, but extended, by due provision in the Bill " for an Act relating to the commercial activities carried on by the Commonwealth in time of war." </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I have bean through the Bill very carefully, and I do not see that we can alter the text to the extent of being able to come right into line with the resolution, with which I believe every honorable senator agrees; but I believe that, in the administration of the wool scheme, a great deal can be done to get over the <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> that exists in connexion with that industry. It will be remembered that in 1907 the Federal Parliament passed a Bill giving a bounty on the manufacture of wool tops for export. The bounty was paid for some years, and the industry, starting from nothing, in the seventh year of its existence was responsible for the manufacture of 3,635,000 lbs. of wool-tops, a result that fully justified the payment of tie bounty. A sum of, I believe" nearly £70,000 was paid by the Government to the various top manufacturers. I am sneaking now particularly of New South Wales, where, as I have said, there are acres of idle machinery, and where about 500 or 600 persons are out of work in consequence of the dispute. I would like to show the incidence of this dispute so far as it . affects not only the industry at Botany and the mon out of work there, but the wealth of Australia itself. In 1914-15 over 4,000,000 lbs. of wool tops were exported from New South Wales; in 1915-16 and 1916-17 nearly 5,000,000 lbs. were exported in each year; and in 1917-18 a little over 4,500,000 lbs. were exported. Owing to the unfortunate position which has arisen in connexion with the industry, only 2,200,000 lbs. were exported 'in 1918-19. If this unfortunate dispute had not arisen, the exports from New South Wales last year and this year would have approximated nearly 10,000,000 lbs., instead of a little over 2,000,000 lbs. The manufacturer of wool tops adds, roughly, ls. per lb., in labour, and doubles the value of greasy wool. Although I shall be met with a reply that there are other factories manufacturing wool tops, I have been given to understand that another factory in Sydney operating in agreement with the Central Wool Committee is doing about .1,000,000 lbs. per year, and that the Yarraville mills, recently started, are also working in a comparatively small way. The largest factory, at Botany, which could practically treble the export of wool tops, is in a state of idleness, and it is regrettable that the capital invested, and the machinery erected, should not be fully employed. </para>

                        <para>- No. There are at least three firms working in cooperation, on a poundage basis. Owing to war conditions, the price of wool tops overseas was very high, and was controlled by Great Britain. The excess profits, instead of going to the fellmongering establishments or wool top manufacturers, have gone to the Commonwealth Pool and on to the producers. Despite any criticism to the contrary, the Wool Pool has been of great benefit to Australia. </para>

I wish to read one or two extracts from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in connexion with the administration of the Wool Pool. On 6th December, 1916, the Prime Minister said - </para>

                <para class="block">We all agree with the utterances of the Prime Minister. The industry in Sydney, now closed down, had an agreement with the Commonwealth Government whereby they would take two-thirds of the profits, and the industry one-third. </para>
                <para class="block">It was further agreed, that the one-third of the profits so retained by the manufacturers were to be expended in additional machinery. I wish to commend the Prime Minister for establishing the Pool during very dark days, and for his utterances which I have just quoted in connexion with its administration. The Prime Minister appointed a Committee, and was responsible for the organization of the Pool, mid wherever the Committee departed from the Prime Minister's ideas they went wrong. If these industries are firmly established and work satisfactorily, it will mean increasing our wealth by at least £1,000,000 sterling per annum. We want to push on with the development of our textile industries, and in the manufacture of wool to,ps we must not lose sight of what is going on in Sydney, where 500 to 600 persons are out of work, and where valuable machinery is lying idle. I appeal to the Government to take this matter into consideration at a very early date. In, doing so I do not wish to say an unkind word about the past, but merely to put the position in the form of a business-like appeal. Seeing that the same principle is involved in the suggested amendment as was involved in a previous- amendment, I should like an assurance from the Minister in regard to the Butter Pool similar to that which he has given in regard to wool. </para>

His  credentials were such that the recommendation was approved by the Committee, and the appointment confirmed by the Prime Minister, the  Hon.  W. M. Hughes. The conditions embodied in the present contract cannot be altered. In the circumstances, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the audit provided in the contract is an audit as between the two parties to it. One of these parties is the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, and the other is the Central Wool Committee. I understand that some time after the Wool Committee had entered into the contract with this company, the Auditor-General, by memorandum or letter, explicitly complained that he was not permitted to audit the accounts of the company in its relation to the Commonwealth. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, the  Chairman  of the Board, that the contract to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has referred provided for the appointment of an independent auditor as between the parties to it. That is all right. But where do the public, and where does this Parliament, come in? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> report the result of his audit to Parliament? Have the public ever been furnished with any details by him? Nobody questions his qualifications. He holds a very high  position ia his profession as an accountant in New South Wales. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, adopting the czar-like attitude which has characterized so many of his performances, practically said to the late Treasurer, Lord. Forrest, and to the Commonwealth Auditor-General, " Stand back. I have arranged for an audit of the accounts as between the Central Wool Committee and F. W. Hughes and Company. Keep off the grass." That was the attitude which he took up. He did succeed in getting an auditor appointed as between the Central Wool Committee and the other party to the contract. But what I apprehend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> is aiming at is that the accounts of this company in its relation to the 'Central Wool Committee shall be audited by the Auditor-General and his staff, and that the result of such audits shall be reported to this Parliament, and through it, to the people of Australia. Unless some more substantial reason is advanced in opposition to the amendment, I feel disposed to support it, should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> press it to a division. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bussell</inline> has shown us that an audit is provided for as between the two (parties to the contract. But that is root satisfactory to this Parliament. It should not be satisfactory either to this Parliament or to the public. I kuow that it was stated in another place that when Lord Forrest, as Treasurer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Israel,</inline> as Auditor-General, proposed that the Auditor-General, through his Department, should examine and report upon these accounts, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgrns prevented it, and pointed out. as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has done to-night, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> is a very competent auditor, and he would not, therefore, permit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Israel</inline> or Lord Forrest to interfere in the matter. There may have been some understanding arrived at since, but if that is still the state of affairs, I shall stand by the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> and will insist that the Commonwealth Government shall have these accounts investigated by the Auditor-General's Department as accounts in which the Government and the people are directly involved. It matters little that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> is a man possessing an intimate knowledge of the particular industry concerned, because it will not be pretended for a moment that he will personally examine the stock of the company, and investigate the entries in their books. He will leave that to his staff. I am prepared to admit that if the Auditor-General is charged with the duty of auditing these accounts, he probably will not perform the duty in person, but will nominate some member of his staff for the work. But it will not be contended that the staff at the command of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth is not equal, in capacity for this particular work, to the staff employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> or any other accountant in New South Wales. We should be given some more satisfactory explanation than that which we have had from the Minister in charge of this Bill before we agree to put this particular contract outside the class of enterprises in which the Commonwealth Government are interested, and in respect of which this Parliament and the public demand investigation by the accredited Auditor-General of the Commonwealth or his staff. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said, but I was discussing one question whilst he discussed a wider question. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> what was the scope of his amendment, and he agreed that it referred to this particular contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has spoken as if the responsibility of the Auditor-General were interfered with in some way or other. But that is not so. Provision is made for a special continuous audit of the accounts under the contract. I do not suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> will personally carry out the audit, but he will be responsible for the audit to the Auditor-General and to the Central Wool Committee. </para>

I hope to confirm that in a few minutes, or withdraw the statement if I find it inaccurate. The'Yarra Falls Company were supplied by the Central Wool Committee with an officer to audit their accounts. Ho was lent by the Commonwealth Audit Office. It is necessary to appoint an officer to carry out the audit of these accounts, but their reports all  come into the central office, where a continuous audit of the whole of the accounts is carried out by the Auditor-General and his staff. The Auditor-General is alone responsible for the completed accounts on each of the different sections. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that very few are still working. It may be said that the proposal contained in my amendment is a very unusual one. That was the objection taken to a similar amendment moved in another place.  Most  of those who opposed the amendment in another place expressed sympathy with the object in view in submitting it. Under the agreement between the Central Wool Committee and the two companies referred to in my amendment, but for the lawsuit which has been entered upon, the Government, up to a very recent date, would have been entitled to profits amounting to £280,000. Twenty per cent. of that amount distributed, as I propose, amongst the employees of the company, would amount to something like £56,000. The big profits that have been made under the contracts with these companies are due to the fact that wool tops have been sold during the war at 6s. per lb., as against 2s. 6d. per lb., the price which they fetched before the war. A large number of the employees of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, who have been thrown out of employment, are girls, many of whom were earning very small wages, and it does not seem to me unreasonable to propose that the Government, as partners in a business which has earned such enormous profits, should recompense in some way employees of the company who have had to suffer, not because of any strike or labour trouble with which they can be charged, but merely because the Government and the company could not agree about the division of the profits. We have heard a good deal about profit-sharing, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> believes in that principle I offer him, by my amendment, an ideal opportunity to put his views into practice. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that I understand that, up to a recent date, the Government were entitled to some £280,000 as their share of the profits under the contract, and as the result of  what some people might call profiteering, since the profits were due to the fact that wool tops, selling at 2s. 6d. per lb. before the war, sold for 45s. per lb. during the war. No doubt we are all glad to find that the Government have made a profit at the expense of a foreign country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> with very good reason, no doubt, declined to enter into details in connexion with that phase of the question, and I shall not discuss it further. In all the circumstances I consider that the Government might very well show consideration to the employees of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company. A number of the employees were engaged in the fellmongering part of the business. I have no practical knowledge of the other work connected with flic making of wool tops, but in my. earlier years I had some practical knowledge of fellmongering. There are many pleasanter  occupations. I know of no industry where the work is more disagreeable. If the Government regard my amendment unfavorably, on the ground that it is without precedent, I will not object to the Minister promising favorable consideration to the granting of an unemployment bonus to those who have been engaged in .an industry which was described as a form of war work. The grant might well be named a war bonus. The employees concerned were told at one stage that they were engaged in very useful war work. </para>

I think I am right in stating that, some time ago, about £500,000 was divided among the cane-growers of Queensland. That was an amount of profit arising from the control and handling of sugar by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

That amount was divided because it emanated from profits made by the Commonwealth Government while in control of sugar. T ask the Minister to favorably consider the amendment. Is it not reasonable that the employees concerned should be gIVen the same consideration as the farmers in relation to the; Government's profitable control and sale of cornsacks, and as the cane-growers with? regard to the Government's profits out of the control and handling of sugar ? </para>

I  would  be inclined to&gt; think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in presenting his amendment, intended to be humorous. No one could feel greater sympathy than I do when men are out of work. This, however, is a proposal to compensate certain employees for the reason that there is a dispute between the Commonwealth Government and the woo! top manufacturers. If compensation is to be granted to one set of individuals for such a reason. I know of people who have been thrown out of work by reason of a dispute existing between the seamen and the Commonwealth Government who are controlling shipping. </para>

It has been said that because the Government were partners in relation to this wool top industry we were partners in the actual manufacturing business.

There was a natural monopoly' in Japan in regard, to wool tops, because that commodity could not be secured from any other part of the world. </para>

The amount stated to be due to the Commonwealth Government for the twelve months ended 31st August, 1918, in regard to the operations of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, was £323,142 4s. 3d. Twenty per cent, of that amount is equal to £64,682 8s. lOd. The wages paid by the company for the twelve months in question totalled £63,151 18s. 9d. Therefore, the proposal of

                        <para>- I should think the honorable senator would do so. In regard to Whiddon Brothers, the amount stated to be due to the Commonwealth Government for the twelve months ended 31st January, 1919, was £89,795 8s. 2d. Twenty per cent, of that sum totals £17,959 ls. 8d. The wages paid by the company for the twelve months indicated amount to £21,803 3s. 7d. Therefore, the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> would mean that for every £100 paid in wages te. the employees a bonus of £82 7s. 4d. would have to be granted. </para>

                        <para>- I say it is impossible to apply it. Let us examine the circumstances which have caused hundreds of people to suffer during the seamen's strike. Are those people to get no compensation ? What about the poor factory girls who sided neither with the Government nor with the seamen, but who, for lack of coal, have been out of work for weeks? They have been living largely upon Government subsidies. Are they not to receive a bonus for having been thrown out of work because the Government had a row with the seamen? What about the Colonial Ammunition Comp:,11 v' s 800 or 900 employees who lost their employment? They were engaged in work controlled by the Government. Are we to compensate them ?  </para>

Hundreds of people were thrown out of work at Botany as the result of this unfortunate dispute, upon the merits of which I say nothing. </para>

                        <para>- To start the works again, and to come to an arrangement to subsidize the unfortunate people who have been thrown out of work on account of the dispute. That is the commonsense view of the matter. If we were not so unfortunate as to have this establishment 600 miles from Melbourne, the position would be different. I venture to say that if what has occurred in Botany had occurred in Melbourne, under our noses, so to speak, so that deputations could come along to the Minister from day to day, the dispute would have been settled months ago. The Government do not realize what this means. I have been trying to restrain myself, and not to throw the blame upon anybody. </para>

                        <para>- I mean that the Government are making a profit out of this business, or they would be making a profit if the industry were operating at the present time. Whether the Government be right or wrong, it is a fact that 500 or 600 employees have been out of work for many months, and now,  unfortunately, they are scattered to the four winds of heaven. If this dispute had occurred in Melbourne it would not have lasted a month, but as it has occurred at Botany I feel it will continue until the end of the wool scheme. I come here as a representative of a State with big interests in jeopardy, and I appeal to the Government to try and find some way whereby the dispute can be settled and work started again. I have said more than once, and I repeat, that a good deal of sympathy should be evinced for the employees, who are in distress through no fault of their own, and I can only say that if both parties to the trouble were sensible, and displayed a little more of the milk of human kindness, it would have been settled in a way satisfactory to all parties and the country long ago. </para>
