The soil, which is' suitable for top-dressing, and similar to that spread in another part of the park used as a children's playground, was to be utilized for the purpose of filling in holes or depressions in the ground in close proximity to the sheds. </para>
                    <para>When the requirements of the New South Wales State Wool Committee were satisfied, the carter engaged deposited the earth immediately outside portion of the fence surrounding the sheds, for which the State Wool Committee was not responsible. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    raised the question, which is one of importance, -whether the rights of senators have not been imperilled, by a departure, from our usual practice which was made whilst the war was in progress. As honorable senators are aware, while the war continued we departed from the custom which had been previously observed of having at least one session of Parliament during each year, the result being that we had only one session during the life of each Parliament. That is to say, there was no prorogation at the end of each year. Instead, we merely adjourned until a date to be fixed. The consequence was that certain of our Standing Orders prohibited honorable senators from exercising their ordinary rights in regard to questions which had been 'dealt with by "the Senate during any debate of the previous year. Thus an honorable senator might be required to wait for three years before he could refer to any matter which had been dealt with by the Senate. "When this question was referred to the Standing Orders Committee it was fully considered by the members of that body, and they have decided to establish, as nearly . as practicable,  the position which would have existed if a session of Parliament had been held during each year. The proposed standing order will permit of any question - no matter how long . a 'session may last - which has been dealt with six months previously, being revived, so long as the session has lasted for a little more than a calendar year. The reason why a. period of fifteen months has been inserted . in the proposed new standing order is that we have already had experience of a session of that duration, and if a Tariff measure be introduced during the present session,  it  is quite possible that we may have a repetition of that experience.

It safeguards the rights and privileges of honorable senators, and I very heartily support, its adoption. This supplementary standing order is designed to meet the exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the commencement of the war. </para>

                    <para>. - When this measure was under consideration a fortnight ago, some little doubt was expressed as to the wisdom of placing the whole of the liability, for any damage done to our lighthouses or marine marks upon the shoulders either of the ship-owner, charterer, or agent of a vessel. It was thought that the clause was too rigid, in that it assumed guilt on the part of one of these individuals, even in the' event of a vessel being blown upon a lighthouse or marine mark by a storm. To meet the wishes which were then expressed by honorable senators, I have decided to strike out proposed new section 19a and to substitute for it a provision which will spare any of the individuals mentioned where he does not contribute by neglect to the destruction of a lighthouse or marine mark. The new provision effectually provides for this. </para>

                        <para>. - At last an opportunity is available to me to make a few remarks upon the Ministerial statement. On the whole, I approve fairly well of the actions of the Government, but there are two matters upon which I should like to say something. We have been told that the Lord lovett those whom He chasteneth, and if, in the course of my observations, I chasten members of the Government, they will know . it is because I love them so sincerely. The subjects to which I desire to direct attention are those relating to economy with efficiency in the administration of the affairs of this country, and profiteering. These are questions which may be dealt with at great length, but I do not propose to occupy much time. The question of economy with efficiency in the administration of our public affairs should engage the serious attention of every man in public life. It is a most serious problem, affecting as it does our manifold obligations. Our soldiers' pensions are mounting ' up. No obligation should be more sacred to the people of this country, but if we do not economize sufficiently in our administration I am afraid that, with a drought threatening the producing interests of the Commonwealth, our financial position will be most unsatisfactory. We shall be short of money. There appears to be a feeling among my friends opposite that taxation can always be shifted on to the shoulders of those who are supposed to be best able to bear it, meaning, of course, those people with the larger incomes; but I emphasize the fact ' they are already tremendously taxed. A friend of mine told me the other day - and he made no secret of it - that in his case taxation represented <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> per cent. of his income. It will be seen, therefore, that a man with about £2,000 or £3,000 a year is better off than many men with £10,000. </para>

                            <para>- He may not want to spend it on himself. I do not think that there is any vulgar display of extravagance in this country, such . as, perhaps, prevailed in some quarters prior to the war; but it must not be forgotten that a man with £10,000 a year income often has very many and pressing obligations. Possibly he may want a portion of the money to reduce his debts, and while taxation is bearing so heavily on the shoulders of such people, they will, not be able to do much in the way of reducing their financial obligations. I do not say that taxation on the higher incomes should be reduced; but I want to caution people, particularly our friends of the Opposition, that the limit of taxation 'on the higher incomes has been almost reached. Not much more money can be obtained from that source. </para>

In the case of a man engaged in the ' pastoral industry, his lambs, which do not represent actual cash, may have been valued at a certain figure, and die next year, with the result that his net income will have been so much reduced that he will find himself mulcted in taxation to the extent of 72 per cent.

                            <para>- Yes, it is large; I suppose about £10,000 a year. In the case to which I refer the taxpayer's income has been cut down to about £2,800. I do not suggest that £2,800 is not sufficient for a man to live upon; but the fact indicate that there is not much room for further taxation on the higher incomes. The real position of those who are supposed to be well off, is not always better than that of those who get £2,000 or £3,000 a year, because, although their incomes may be larger, they have contracted certain obligations, quite apart from taxation exactions of the Government, which must be met. </para>

                    <para>I have had prepared a table setting out in some detail the extent of our obligations. Commonwealth war pensions, on ' 27th June, 1919, amounted to £5,234,812, paid to 192,019 returned soldiers. The old-age and invalid pensions; on 31st December, 1918, represented an expenditure of £4,000,000, paid to 95,432 pensioners; and the maternity bonus, at the end of last year, amounted to £643,000, paid in respect of 126,888 babies. The Commonwealth also paid to benevolent asylums £59,060 for 2,788 inmates. These figures make up a total of £9,916,872 paid in respect of 448,128 persons. Of course we cannot look to any saving in respect of some of these amounts. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. If old-age pensioners were rightly paid the pensions which they received three or four years ago, they are logically entitled now to an increased pension, owing to the increased cost of living. I understand that the Government are at present considering whether the state of the Commonwealth finances justifies an increase in the old-age pension. I really believe that the maternity allowance should not be paid in the case of persons in receipt of an income above a certain amount. I never could be convinced that a man in receipt of a small income should be compelled by taxation to contribute towards this assistance to another man in receipt of a very much larger income. I direct the attention of Ministers to the advisability of reviewing the present system under which maternity allowances are paid, and to see whether something might not be saved in that way which could be used to increase the rate of the old-age pension. </para>

                    <para>The Federal and State Governments draw taxation from the same well, and I come now to consider the payments which have been made by the State Governments. For general hospitals the States contributed £666,589 for the accommodation of 476,279 people treated in those hospitals. That was in' 1916, the latest year for which I could obtain the figures dealing with this matter. To benevolent institutions the States contributed £256,616 for sheltering 7,258 people. The amount of State relief for neglected children was £535,419 for the care of, I was surprised to see, 32,381 neglected children in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">For hospitals for the insane the States contributed £688,000 to institutions dealing with 17,000 insane people of our population. For the protection of aboriginals the States contributed £97,000 in respect of 6,777 aboriginals. These. figures make a total of £2,243,624 paid in respect of 539,698 people. The total of the figures for both Commonwealth and States amounts to no less than £12,160,496, and this amount is paid in respect of 987,826 persons; so that nearly one in every five of the population is in receipt of some contribution from the Governments of the States or the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>We have to pay some £15,000,000' a year in the shape of interest on war loans. It is obvious from these figures that we need to be very careful how we spend our money, but I very much regret to say that I see no attempt on the part of the Government to really reduce public expenditure. They seem to go on increasing the staffs of public: departments and establishing duplicate departments, and in spending money as if the public purse had no bottom to it. I was very much surprised the other day to find that there has been an increase of 396 officers in the Public Service. I believe that such an increase is not justified. We should for some time to come keep the Public Service at least at no more than its present strength. Some honorable senators may say that it would be cruel to reduce our departmental staffs, but the fact is that if we do not reduce them now, when bad times come upon us, as assuredly they will before long, we may suddenly have to turn people out of the Government Departments at a time when it will be difficult for them to obtain employment outside, and in that way we should be doing them a gross injustice. </para>
                    <para>There is one way in which I think a great saving in public expenditure might be made, and that is by the amalgamation of State and Commonwealth Departments. There are several sets of Departments which might well be amalgamated. The first I shall mention are the Electoral Departments. There have been several Premiers' Conferences at which this matter has been discussed. At the Premiers' </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It astonishes me that, instead of amalgamating some of the State and Commonwealth Departments, the Government go on duplicating Departments. I have taken out some figures to show what this duplication of the Electoral Departments involves in the matter of expenditure. I find that for the year 1916-17 their total -cost was £168,1.21, of which amount the Commonwealth spent £113,190- </para>

                            <para>- That would be a mere nothing, as the Commonwealth expenditure was nearly three times that of the States. The Electoral Department is one in which. a very considerable saving might be made by amalgamation. </para>

                    <para>I come now to consider the amalgamation of the taxing Departments of the Commonwealth and the States, which has been promised year in and. year out for a long while. "We have had various State Conferences dealing with this matter. At the Conference held at Adelaide in May, 1916, it was resolved - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the several States shall direct their leading taxation officers to meet at an early date to prepare a uniform scheme for income tax (rates excepted), land tax (rates excepted), probate duties (rates excepted). The Conference re-affirms the desirability of uniform valuations for Commonwealth and State purposes being adopted as early as practicable, and that the necessary legislation and administrative steps in that direction be taken by the States. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That resolution was arrived at more than two years ago, but, apparently, we are no nearer an amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments. This' is a matter which requires the immediate attention of the Government, who should see whether this amalgamation may not shortly be brought about. It would not only do away with an enormous amount of expense, but it would obviate a tremendous irritation of the taxpayers, who have now to send in two schedules in respect of each tax imposed, and honorable senators know the great difficulty with which many are faced in making up those schedules. </para>
                    <para>I have taken out some figures to show what might be saved in this direction. I find that the expense of collection in Victoria, in 1917-18, of income tax, land tax, and probate duties, amounted to £40,445. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; all of which is an absolute duplication. In New South Wales there is no State land tax; but against that there is an enormous income tax to collect. For 1916-17 the cost of the collection of taxes amounted to £23,022; in Queensland, in 1916-17, the sum totalled £13,890 ; in South Australia the cost amounted to £18,260 for the year 1917-18; and, in Western Australia for 1914-15 - the latest year ' for which I could secure figures - the expenditure was £16,183. In Tasmania for the same year the sum of £7,931 was expended; and the total cost of all the State collections amounted to £119,731. Dur ing 1917-18 the Commonwealth had to spend £276,772 in the collection of its taxes. I am aware, of course, that it had the war-time profits tax to deal 'with, and that was a complex subject to handle. </para>

                    <para>Uniformity in regard to such matters as these will never be secured so long as we have Premiers' Conferences which meet and part as did the last' one. The influenza epidemic broke out, and the various State delegates scattered' in no time. On every occasion State Ministers say they must stick up for their own States, and that they cannot do anything, while the Commonwealth representatives reply that they must stand by the Commonwealth. Then comes the deadlock. I suggest that State and Federal authorities refer the whole project to a Commission to be appointed somewhat on the lines of the Murray Waters Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure about that; but I am convinced that a permanent Commission would solve our duplication difficulties and bring about economical amalgamations. The Commission could investigate the functions of both State and Federal taxation authorities. During the last election campaign I promised that I would do my utmost to bring about this much-desired reform. We wish for efficiency and economy, and we do and say all we can, realizing that there is a great deal to be done; but we get mighty little results. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to go into those points. I do not care which way uniformity is brought about so long as it secures economy. We have four land valuations to trouble us to-day. People under Victorian law have to concern themselves about unimproved values. Then there is a Federal Department, dealing with both improved. and unimproved values; while, besides those, there is a valuation for probate. I realize that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has no time to attend to details of this character, and I do not expect that the energetic Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> will have any greater opportunities after his return. Some months ago we learned that a Premiers' Conference had been called. There was an excellent luncheon provided for the delegates, no doubt, who made some agreeable speeches to one another; and then they disagreed; and soon after all scattered back to their homes, and nothing was done. The farce continues from year to year. If the Government means business, let it refer this subject to a Board. </para>

                    <para>We have two Police Departments in existence to-day - Commonwealth and State. Surely such an absurdity should be clone away with. We have two Savings Bank institutions throughout the land. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> indicated that a saving of £60,000 per annum. could be secured in doing away with duplication there. That is just one of a number of subjects that require most careful consideration, with a view to bringing about far greater economy. Apparently, we are now about to witness duplication in regard to scientific and industrial research. We are told that what is intended is co-operation; but it cannot be denied that it means the inauguration of still another Department. I do not object to co-ordination; but for two independent bodies to be going over the same ground, thus doubling costs to the general public, appears to be the height of folly. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the scheme for the housing of our returned soldiers, I strongly object to the proposal to ignore the splendid machinery provided by the various State Savings Banks. I believe that in all the States the Credit Foncier system is existent. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> said it was the intention of the Repatriation Department to use the State Savings Banks' machinery, and an agreement was actually arrived at. I know that in Melbourne arrangements were made for the extension of the State. Savings Bank premises in order to take the two top floors in an adjoining building. A hole was actually knocked through the wall, and workmen began on the job of making doors; and that is just how far the matter went. In conversation with a. friend who possesses excellent qualifications for knowing what he is talking about," I was recently informed that it is obvious that the cost of administering the War Service Homes Act <inline font-style="italic">must</inline> be greater under the Commonwealth Bank than if the administration were iu the hands of the State Savings Banks. The latter institutions have branches in all the principal towns and districts throughout the Commonwealth, by medium of which payments could be collected with little expenditure. The Commonwealth Bank, however, is represented only by post-offices, except in a few of the very large centres. Imagine a lady postal official in some country district being required to attend to a difficult and technical matter such as the soldiers' housing scheme! </para>

                            <para>- That is so. In Victori a and New South Wales there are long-established organizations in the State Savings Banks which have carried on the business of Credit Foncier loans on cottages upon lines similar to those of the old building societies. The new' scheme could be administered by those organizations with expedition,  and on proved lines, with certainty of success, because of their long experience. The Commonwealth. Bank has no such organization nor experience of this class of work. The staff to be organized must include experts to deal with valuations, buildings, accounts, title deeds, and the like, in addition to a staff of clerks ; and although the State Savings Banks would require additional clerks, and a few valuators, the expert supervision in every department would be in the hands of the existing staffs. Extra office accommodation would be necessary, but in regard to the State institutions, that would be limited, because the work would be largely done in the existing offices already devoted to the same class of work. Here, however, we. are about to build ur&gt; a new machine : we are about to start an entirely new Department. ' In Victoria, which would represent approximately one- third of the business done in Australia, the extra expenditure likely to- result from giving the administration to the Commonwealth Bank instead of the State Savings Banks would include extra cost of expert officers and premises, £2,500 a year; extra cost of collecting repayments, say, 150 men, on an average commission of £30 a year; or twenty-five men on salary of £180 a year - £4,500. This would make a total of £7,000 annually. As Victoria represents a third of the whole, this for all Australia would be , equal to £21,000 a year; and although the maximum expense would not be reached for two or three years, it would then continue for, .say, ten years, until all building was completed, and the number of payments began to be considerably diminished by the number of loans paid off by successful men. Assuming that the cost continued in full for ten years, the total extra cost would be £210,000. This is, of course, a very rough estimate, but probably a very conservative one. It may be added that the employment of postmasters or local agents on commission to collect arrears and to deal with difficult cases would ia all probability be found impracticable, as the local interest and daily personal contact with the soldier tenants or purchasers would render the local representative quite unsuitable for this class of work. I think that this matter ought to be reconsidered by the Ministry with a new to seeing whether they cannot adopt the common-sense method of dealing with the people who have had this' work in hand for many years. There is no need to glorify the Commonwealth Bank. We all recognise that it has come to stay. But before very long, by reason directly of the enormous increase in our expenditure, and indirectly of the tremendous losses which will have to be borne, we shall be faced with an extremely, difficult financial problem. But the chief point we have to remember is that the people of the Commonwealth and the States ire the same taxpayers. I wonder what would be thought of me if I put two managers on one station? Would not the Minister think that I was a lunatic? The same principle applies to all these matters. In my opinion, £50,000 per annum may be saved on the Electoral Departments, a further £200,000 on the Taxation Departments, £10,000 on the Commonwealth Police Force, and about £60,000 in connexion with the Savings Banks. The last-mentioned sum might very easily be saved if the Savings. Banks of the country were amalgamated, and my figures are based on the estimate given some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> Upon the Science and Industries Institute we might very well save £20,000 a year, and also knock out the £500,000 which it is proposed to spend upon a new university. </para>

                            <para>- I have tried hundreds of these so-called cures. The economies which I have outlined represent a total saving of £340,000 annually. Of course, we cannot save this amount by the holding of Premiers' Conferences. What we require to devise is a practical way of insuring that these economies shall be effected, and to that end I would suggest the appointment of a joint Federal and State Commission to investigate the matter. At the present time we have pretty well reached a dead-end. This saving of £340,000 annually represents 5 per cent, on nearly £6,500,000. Surely that is an amount which is worth saving. Then we know that the " meat axe," as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has designated it, might be effectively used in many other directions. I have been horrified to note the great increase which has taken place in the number of officers employed by the Commonwealth. According to the Acting Public Service Commissioner's report, 396 'extra officers were employed last year. </para>

                            <para>- The report states that " the permanent staff was increased by 396 men." I think that is most unfair. There is a drought hanging over Australia, and we are faced with an enormous expenditure upon pensions, in addition to an annual payment of £15,000,000 for interest on loans, so that presently we shall be up against financial chaos. </para>

During the war the people did not mind what the Government spent; but if such an increase had taken place prior to the war, half the populace would have been up in arms against such wasteful expenditure. This particular matter requires careful investigation, otherwise we may be compelled to do a grave injustice to our public servants later on. For the sake of the Public Service itself, nothing of that kind should be tolerated. Then we might very well dispense with our police force. We did very well without it prior to its creation. </para><interjection>

But, notwithstanding the immense buildings to which I have referred, the Commonwealth is now erecting a new structure for repatriation purposes on the St. Kilda-road at a cost of £46,000. </para>

                            <para>- When our Constitution was adopted, we entered into a compact, and I suppose that we shall have to honour it when the proper time comes. Seeing that both our defence and repatriation schemes are of a temporary character, the buildings already in existence at the back of the Victoria Barracks ought surely to have been sufficient for all requirements. In connexion, with repatriation, we have one building at Jolimont, another in King-street, and a third on the St. Kilda-road, the result being that the poor returned soldier will never be able to find the particular building he is looking for. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In my judgment, the structure now being erected on St. Kilda-road, at a cost of £46,000, might well have been dispensed with. We are, however, so accustomed to . dealing with millions, and to floating large loans, that we appear to have lost all touch with ordinary economical methods. I hope the Government will give consideration to this matter, and see what can be done, because it is causing much irritation, and unless we economize, by" saving every shilling possible, we shall not be able to do justice to our returned soldiers. We have not an enormous amount of reserve power in regard to direct taxation. That well has been baled out long ago. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that prices for various commodities are abnormally high, and that we ought to do our best to see how profiteering may be checked. On this subject I do not quite exonerate my honorable friends opposite, as I think that, if we deal with this question in a practical way, some relief may be afforded to the people. I noticed the other day that the Victorian Government secured tenders for various commodities to be supplied to their institutions at what I regard as quite reasonable prices. A 4-lb. loaf of bread, for instance, is to be supplied at 5.16d. That appears to be reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I am helping in every way; but the trouble is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, found out the other day, that the Trades Hall people decline to meet employers, in order to discuss these affairs. Why cannot we have things comfortable as we go along, whether we are moving in the direction of a co-operative Commonwealth or not? That is my way of looking at it. In the tenders for supplying the Victorian Government institutions, the following offers were accepted: - Butter, ls. 7d. per lb.; cheese, <inline font-style="italic">Hid.</inline> per lb.; oatmeal, 31s. per cwt. ; and meat (mutton, beef, and certain kinds of lamb), which, I suppose, is the heaviest item in the average workman's home, 5.82d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I notice, that the Government ordered an inquiry into the prices of a number of other commodities, and that, with the expiration of the War Precautions Act, authority devolves upon ' the State Governments to take action. I would like to see something done to establish co-operative institutions, which, I think, would be much better than price fixing. Irealize, of course, that the chief difficulty is in the distribution. A great many consumers cannot very well call and pay cash; but co-operative establishments would confer a direct benefit upon a large number of people who could call for their provisions and pay cash over the counter. The whole position bristles with difficulties. Only the other day I was instrumental in getting the embargo on the exportation of hides removed, and directly this was done the price of leather rose 9d. a lb., while the price of boots used by working men increased by 2s. 6d. a pair. That does not seem to be fair, and I make this statement in the hope that the tanners and bootmakers may be able to show why the increases were made when, as a matter of fact, they would not be handling the hides' in respect of which higher prices were charged for two or three months. </para>

Certainly, he has not been on a par with' the man living in the towns. A great deal of the best country is under the plough now, and in Victoria there is not one single man who owns 1,000 head of cattle, so the price of hides is not a squatters' question by any means. It concerns the small farmer, and if we are going to keep men on the land we shall certainly have to pay them higher prices than in the past. Coal, which is essential for all industrial enterprises, is, I understand, 17s. a ton at the pit's mouth, Newcastle; but when I looked at my bill the other day I found that I was charged £2 3s. per ton delivered for good Jumbunna coal, though I do not think the coal merchants are malting a great deal of money. The same, I believe, can be said of the butchers; and I have been told that many grocers have gone out of business. There is a big margin between the ' prices obtained by the primary producers and the prices paid by the consumers.

The Government ought to appoint a Commission to make a thorough examination of the whole problem, which is causing. more unrest than any other question to-day. Everybody is feeling the pinch. My sympathies go out most to those people, such as bank clerks and others with families, drawing a. salary of about £450 a year. They can see no prospect of relief by direct action, and they are the men who feel the pinch most. The cost of distribution at present is enormous. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- A working man told me the other day. that in a small street in which he lives, in Malvern, there are no fewer than nine different milk-cart deliveries, while only one boy distributes the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> I said to him, of course, that there was only one quality of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> only one quality of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and but one quality of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> while there were different qualities in milk and meat supplies. I think that if our tradespeople looked into .this matter it is possible that, by some . method of co-operation, they could bring down the cost of distribution to the consumers. In the old days:, when every industry was carried on by the cottage system, the working people were contented. When the day of the factory arrived, because of the difficulty of providing for an immense multitude of people tinder conditions of modern civilization, the factory hand, was employed under conditions that were not hygienic, and feeling himself to be merely a cog in machinery, he naturally became discontented. We desire that the working people should again, be made contented. I was very much disappointed that the offer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, for a round table conference, at which matters might be talked, over, was not accepted. An opportunity should be given, to see where we are drifting, and how the conditions of the life of the people might be made more bearable.

Five weeks ago to-day a very important and interesting statement was made in -this Chamber in order to publish to Australia generally the policy of the Government, and their intentions in regard, to most important legislation during the present session. That statement has naturally been overshadowed by occurrences which have since taken place, and which have grown more serious every day. It is doubtful whether the general public, in the circumstances, remember many of the matters which it was promised would be put before this Parliament for beneficial enactment during the present session. I am doubtful whether' anything which one may say now on the Ministerial statement will have very much interest either for honorable senators or for their constituents, if the latter should ever learn what is said here, for. I may say confidentially that not many people are addicted to the reading of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I aim afraid that those who do read it do so only for the purpose of discovering stumbling blocks with which to embarrass members of this Parliament at' some future date. </para>

                    <para>With these preliminary remarks, I wish now to say a word or two&gt; upon some important matters referred to in the Ministerial statement. One which strikes me as of first importance is referred to in the earlier part of the statement, the reference to which was probably prepared by the Minister for Repatriation. I find, the statement made - </para>

                        <para>With no lessons to be drawn from experience either here or abroad, a Department of Repatriation has been established. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to say with regard to the Minister who has assumed one of the most responsible and difficult positions to be found in Australia to-day that, though not destitute of ambition, I would not for ten times the salary exchange my position as a private senator for that held by the Minister for Repatriation. If there is one thing of greater importance than another at this time, it is the administration of the Department which he has undertaken. The Government are quite right in directing attention to the fact that he has taken charge of a Department in which he has virtually to create methods and ideals. My sympathy goes out to him, and to other members of the Government, who, without previous training, have had to discharge the very serious and important duties inseparable from Commonwealth administration in connexion with, the war during the last five years. We are all, I suppose, most prone to criticise, and find fault, but the work which the Minister "for Repatriation must face in- connexion with the serious and difficult task before him should bespeak for him every sympathy. </para>
                    <para>One may ask, " What is the best policy to adopt with regard to our returned soldiers?" The question is a most difficult one to answer. Our soldiers have done their duty nobly, and have made a name in history for Australia which it will never lose. They have come back to us covered with glory; but many, unfortunately, will never be the men they were before they went to the Front, and, unfortunately, many of those who went to the Front will never return. The first thing of which our returned soldiers should be seised - and. the man is an enemy to Australia who would instill any other idea into their minds - is that the public of Australia, irrespective of political or religious creeds, have the most kindly feeling towards them, and the most sincere intention to do what is right by them. It is very regrettable that, from time to time, one should see evidence of a deliberate intention to instill the cursed spirit of discontent, which is the ruin of Australia, into the minds of our returned soldiers. That is a feeling which the Minister for Repatriation will find it very difficult to combat. In the circumstances, . I am not surprised to learn that he is not in the best of health, because of the work which he has been called upon to do. </para>
                    <para>The State Governments are, to the best of their ability, assisting in- the work of repatriation, and I am proud to be able to say, from actual experience, that the State of Tasmania, in proportion to its size, has accomplished more practical good in the matter of the settlement of returned soldiers than has any other State of the Commonwealth. I am also proud to say, for the glory of that small State, that, not merely proportionately, but actually, the largest number of Victoria Crosses won by our soldiers in the </para>

                    <para>We are right in the middle of possibly the worst industrial crisis with which Australia has yet been faced. So far as one can see, there is no way .out of the difficulty without recourse . to some very serious action indeed. I am one who complained a few weeks ago of the passivity and inaction of the Government. We were told then that there was a possibility of a peaceful termination of the struggle. We have been told so several times since. We have been told, also, that if it could not be ended peacefully, then it must be ended in some other way. The Acting Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> made a statement some two months ago, to the effect that he was not going to permit this flouting of the law of the country - a law enacted by a democratic Parliament elected on the broadest franchise on earth, and 'passed intentionally to benefit the working man; The Acting Prime Minister said that he would not allow that law to be flouted, and the industries of Australia to be held up. I desire to learn from some member of the Government what the Acting Prime Minister intended by his statement. I want to know what was behind it, and what was behind; the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> a fortnight ago, and at the same time by his colleague in another place. We were informed that if a peaceful settlement could not be brought about, something else would be done. What is going to be done? Is it not time that we knew what is going to be done? In my journeys through Tasmania shortly before coming over here, I passed through the apple land of Tasmania, in the Huon district. Driving along the roads in that district I saw magnificent apple trees, the branches of which were loaded to the ground with the finest fruit to be seen in any country in the world. That fruit is absolutely rotting to-day. In the various ports on the coast qf Tasmania - Hobart, Launceston, Devonport, 'Burnie, and </para>

                            <para>- We have not enough people in Tasmania to eat it. I wish we had. It is rotting there at the present time, and apparently it is likely to remain there. I have not come into this Parliament to be a party man; but I must tell the truth, and will say that the Government have not shown strength in handling this question. When I talk on this subject I am reminded by some other senators that I must tread lightly, and should speak in a whisper; but this industrial struggle has now been going on for weeks and weeks, and we are just where we were when the Actin 2 Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> made a certain statement about eight weeks ago. Immeasurable loss and mischief have mounted up ever since; and when will the trouble end? The Arbitration Court has been flouted. I remember the frequent use of the expression, some years ago in this Chamber, that Wages Boards were a failure because of "the lack of sympathetic treatment." No one can fairly charge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins with being unsympathetic towards the working man. He has had to bear blame from the employing classes on the ground that he has been more than fair to the working classes. To-day we find two sections of the community - the extreme Conservatives, and the seamen themselves - united in telling us that arbitration has been a failure. If it is going to be a permanent failure, will any one suggest that there can ever be a cessation of industrial strife? Will the granting of all the seamen's demands settle things ? Unquestionably  not ! Recently, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> determined to settle a threatening position in regard to coal in New South' Wales. He did so by giving the men everything that was asked for. What is the consequence ? It was stated - whether truthfully or not - that- Mr:- Hughes had sent a Judge to Newcastle in order to give the miners everything they asked for. It is a fact that the judge gave the miners everything that was wanted ; and before the* award had expired, another demand was made. </para>

I listened to interesting statements made in the Senate when the Arbitration Bill was being discussed. It .was going to put an end to all strikes. Within seven years, and. in the course of one year, there were 536 strikes in Australia; and the Arbitration Court was sitting all the while. Are we to do nothing? When we enact fair laws, let us have the courage to enforce them. )If Walsh deserved to be gaoled .at a certain juncture he deserved to be put into prison six weeks earlier. Why was he not imprisoned then? If the <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Wainui</inline> .could be. provided with crews at a certain time, why could not crews have been placed on board those ships at an earlier date; and why cannot other boats be provided with crews to-day ? 1 am satisfied that crews can be found for a good many other boats if the Government desire to find them, and have the courage to try to do so. But we are told to speak with bated breath, and to walk silently, and not to do this or that, in case we bring the miners out. What right have they to come out without a grievance? </para>

I know that there are serious circumstances to be faced, and serious things to be done; but, in my opinion, the sooner those serious things are faced and done, the better for Australia. And they are not being faced  at this time. I am doubly sorry for the ill-luck which has overtaken the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> whom I regarded as a man full of courage and particularly fitted to meet a crisis such as this.

                            <para>- Since the subject of elections has been introduced, I shall deal with that, following upon reference to the same matter in the Ministerial statement. There, it is notified that  Ave  are to have a Bill in relation to the method of voting at elections for the Senate. I understand there is some uncertainty regarding the nature of the principle which we are to be asked to adopt. Probably it will originate here in. order to enable this Chamber to first express its views in regard to the method which should obtain in respect to the election of its members. This question should not be made a party one. Although I am an anti-Labour man, I would sincerely like to see a larger number of honorable senators upon the opposite side of the Chamber. The Senate would be strengthened if it did not contain quite the present number of Ministerial followers. </para>

                            <para>- A strong Government such as the present one, because of the number of their supporters, must have a greater degree of responsibility cast upon them than a weak Government. I have felt this ever since I re-entered the Senate. What ought to be- done is this. We should first decide the principle of election that we intend to adopt, and then provide efficient machinery to give effect to it.1 Under the present system of electing members . for- the Senate - a -system which is supposed to be a democratic one - a majority of the electors may return not merely a. majority of the senators, but the' whole of them, provided that the block vote on a particular side is sufficiently strong. That result is not always accomplished, for at the Senate elections in 1914, on the occasion of a double dissolution, the smaller proportion of the. electors secured the return of the greater number of senators. </para>

                            <para>- I was taking the Senate elections in Tasmania in 1914 as a concrete example. On that occasion 236,000 votes upon the one side captured' only two seats in this Chamber, whereas 234,000 votes on the other side secured four seats. That is an actual fact, and it shows that the existing law does not always make provision for the majority vote being effective under our so-called democratic system. Personally, I do not regard the existing system as a democratic one. A. democratic elective system, to my mind, is one that will insure a Parliament which will reflect fairly all important sections of political opinion in the State. </para>

                    </continue><para>In the other branch of the Legislature a man cannot represent a constituency under any circumstances unless he has more than half the voters in that constituency behind him. That is a vast, improvement upon the system which obtained previously, when men wore rejected owing to the operation of the split vote, but I take it that the Parliament of the country should be a reflex of the electors  outside, and should not merely represent a majority of them, a majority which may at times be a very small one. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I have always done so. I believe in the proportional system of voting, because, in my opinion, it provides for a democratic representation in Parliament. I do not call a system which permits of the representation of only one class of people a democratic one. But whatever principle we may adopt, for goodness' sake let us provide the machinery to give effect to it. This can be done. There is- nothing to stop it. It can be done as simply as possible by means of the preferential method of voting. </para>

But the Hare system of voting does bring about a definite relation of representation to the strength of different parties. As a matter of fact, on the occasion to which I refer, it worked rather kindly to the weaker body, because the Labour party, which won thirteen seats, was really entitled to only twelve seats. I shall be very pleased at a later stage to explain more fully to honorable senators the working of the Hare system in Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, if profiteering is regarded as making money out of my business. Whenever I could make a profit, I have felt justified in doing so. But,  under present circumstances, it is very difficult to say to what extent excessive profits are being made V- the various wholesalers and retailers of Australia. One thing which has struck me in passing through the streets of Melbourne is the high prices charged by the tailoring trade as compared with the prices being charged in Hobart to-day. Either the prices charged in the shops in Bourke and Collins streets are too high, or there is some reason for them which I do not understand. </para>

                            <para>- Rentals never yet prevented successful competition. I have seen a sac suit quoted at <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> 10s. at a shop in Bourke-street which was certainly not a first-class establishment. That fact suggests to me that there is a tendency to exact higher prices than are justifiable. But when one goes from shop to shop, and finds that certain classes of goods - for example," cotton goods - are invariably high in price, and learns that in some cases calicoes are costing three or four times as much as they did fifteen or twenty years ago', he begins to seek for some other reason for high prices than that- of excessive profits. In a great many cases', the cost of the material has gone up, and to make a living a tradesman must sell at a profit. If he cannot buy at a price low enough to enable him to do this, he must get home on the consumer in some other "way. </para>

                    </continue><para>I have lived a few years, and I know how this question of the cost of living is affecting the community. I was one of a rather large family, and remember, away ' back in 1S65 or 1866, being one of ten or twelve that sat round my father's table. My father was a mechanic. He was paid, I believe, about 14s. a day, which is about the present rate of pay for that class of workman; and he had to feed, on an average, ten children, as well as himself and my mother. At that time, bread was 6d. per 2-lb. loaf, flour was up to £20 a ton, and meat was nearly as dear as it is at the present time. Many a time I went to the butcher's for beef or rump steak, and had to pay lid. and ls. a lb. for it. Ready-made clothing, also, was about as high as at present, and the quality was not so good. Notwithstanding the size of our family, I do not remember ever going to bed hungry; and although I was pretty hard on clothes, I was generally dressed well enough to go to school and earn some commendation for respectable appearance. Things are totally different to-day; and incidental to the present strike, I may mention that in mv earlier life I was brought into contact with sailors, and know that the wages of an able seaman was about £4 a month, while an ordinary seaman got from £3 to £3 10s. per month. Wages paid to the' crew on the Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company boats in 1860 ranged from £5 to £6 per month.' Sailors then had to live on salt junk and hard biscuits. They are not doing it to-day. I am not saying that the seamen have not legitimate grievances. Their conditions are hard ; but yesterday I saw four miserable " cabbies " sitting out in the cold, biting rain on the cab rank alongside Parliament House, and I felt then that their conditions are just as hard as those of the seamen. By all means, let us try to improve the conditions of our working people; but let everything for the benefit of 'those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow be done on common. sense lines, and in a manner fair to everybody, else. We are faced with enormous financial difficulties in the Commonwealth.. I did not quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> remarks concerning the proportion . of taxation paid by men with larger incomes, because the position of Australia' demands that the men who can pay shall pay, whoever may  be the Treasurer, and whatever section commands the government of this country. </para><interjection>

Speaking generally, I indorse the opinions of speakers who have preceded me to the extent that I. consider the statement in the main satisfactory, and that the Government have reason to be proud of their achievements, during the past few years. When criticism is being hurled at the Government from all quarters, I suggest that the critics should bear in mind the strenuous times through which we have passed.  -  </para>

                    <para>I commend the Government for the repeal of a large number of regulations made under the War Precautions Act. I rejoice in the fact that peace has been proclaimed, and that in the future this Parliament will be in a better position to voice the opinions of the people than during the past four years. Honorable senators will now feel under less restraint than during war time, when possibly the free expression of their views might have led to international complications. During the war honorable senators were almost obliged to indorse practically everything that the Government did, but for the future, speaking for myself, I shall feel free to criticise the Government, when necessary, in connexion with measures which I do not agree with. </para>
                    <para>The first and most important question dealt with in the Ministerial statement is that of repatriation. The Government may be congratulated upon what has been achieved to date; but we must not lose sight of the fact that there are pin-pricks in the administration of the Department, and that a large number of men are not quite satisfied. Many complaints have come under my notice, and although in some cases misunderstanding has arisen through men expecting what they are not entitled to, in a great many cases they have genuine grievances. The Department would be well advised to appoint a complaints officer in each State, as was done by the Defence Department some time ago. such officer to be free from official direction, with authority to inquire into al'l grievances and suggest the remedy. It is provided in the regulations that if a man was not in business prior to enlistment, he cannot now obtain monetary assistance from the Department to enable him to enter into business on his own account. I brought this matter under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> notice some time ago, and the Minister pointed out then that it was not possible to make every man a shopkeeper on his own account; but during the war a large number of men have had practical experience in the control of businesses overseas, managing, farms and similar concerns, and they are now in a position to carry on a business on their own 'account. A number of cases have been brought under my notice by Local Committees. They are what- may be regarded as first-class propositions, and there is no doubt that if money were forthcoming, the men for whom, they are intended would be successful. At present,- however, it is not possible for the men to obtain monetary assistance. There are other returned soldiers who are willing to put up a portion . of the money themselves. </para>
                    <para class="block">Many a mam who has been careful during a period of service, and has saved £200 or £300, and also a fair amount of his deferred pay, is prepared to put up a certain amount if the Government will help to the extent of £1 for £1. If the scope of the Act were enlarged to provide for these cases, men would be assisted to become prosperous citizens, and the fact that the Department was interested in the venture would in itself be a safeguard .against unwise speculation by the soldier, because the staff of departmental experts would be able to make all the necessary inquiries, to be satisfied that the proposition was a genuine one, and safe from a repatriation point of view. I commend these suggestions to the Minister in the hope that he will be able to assist men who can submit good propositions, and who are desirous of starting in business for themselves, but who cannot get the assistance they require at present, because of the wording of the Act. </para>
                    <para>I desire for a few minutes to deal with the housing scheme for returned soldiers. In this connexion I intend to quote some important statements from reports of the Inter-State Commission. The information contained in these reports is so valuable that I should like a copy of them, if that were possible, to be placed in every home in Australia. So far as Queens-, land is concerned, the housing scheme has not yet made a great deal of headway. I understand that this is mainly due to some hitch that occurred between' the Commonwealth Government and the State Savings Bank. The fact remains that although the War Service Homes Bill was passed by. this Parliament at the end of last year, we are now well advanced in the present year, and it was only the other day that we received invitations from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to attend the laying of the foundation stone of the first house to-be erected under the Government scheme. In view of the shortage of house accommodation, and the impatience of many returned soldiers to secure homes, I urge the Government to push on with this work as fast as possible. </para>
                    <para>I was approached a little time ago by Messrs.. James Campbell and- Sons, of </para>
                    <para class="block">Brisbane, a large firm of master builders, on the subject of the purchase of material within Australia for the erection of soldiers' homes. &gt; Although the letter 1 received from this firm is fairly long, I propose to quote it for the information of honorable senators. It is as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We understand it is the intention of the Federal Housing Commissioner to go past Australian merchants for materials required for the erection of the homes for returned soldiers, under the new scheme. In Queensland alone it is announced that from 2,000 to 2,500 houses per year will be required, and if the merchants of Queensland are deprived of the business that will come from the erection of these homes, it will be a very serious thing for them and their employees. It seems nothing less than cruel that while we are deprived of portion of our hard-earned profits tq provide taxes and contributions to war loans and patriotic funds, when the Government has an opportunity to lighten the burden caused by the depression that has existed, since the outbreak of war, in the Wardware trade, by distributing their business to merchants, it should take the opposite course and contribute to the .continuance of the depression by placing the orders in other countries. </para>
                        <para>We know that a good deal is made of the argument that the material will be brought out in Commonwealth Government ships free of freight, and will be admitted into the Commonwealth free of duty; but we are at a loss to understand where the saving is going to come in, because the steamship line will then lose the freight and the Customs Department the duty. If it is desired that the soldiers should be provided with their materials at practically oversea cost, then an arrangement could be made for a drawback of duty by the Customs, and a remission of freight by the steamship line. It is a. matter quite easy of solution if it is desirable that these items should not be included in the cost of the soldiers' homes, but while wishing to give the soldier every advantage, we are at a loss to understand why this is necessary. </para>

                    <para class="block">When I was in Brisbane recently, a number of members of the Master Builders Association interviewed me in regard to the large amount of work to be done in Queensland in connexion with the building of soldiers' homes. I pointed out to these gentlemen that while I did not desire that any firms should make undue profits out of the erection 'of soldiers' homes, I felt that in view of their experience in the business, and the machinery and facilities they possessed, the Government would do well, at any rate, to have some consultation with them, and to see whether they were not in a position to submit a proposition which could be accepted. If they make a proposal which is not sound, and there is evidence that they desire to make huge profits out of the erection of soldiers' homes, the Government will be in no way bound, and can turn down their proposal. These firms have a large number of employees, the building of houses is their special business, and the Government would do well to consult them and see whether they may not be of material assistance in this matter. So far as I know, none of these firms has yet been consulted. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to let con-  tracts to contractors who are returned soldiers, and, if that is not possible, to build the homes themselves, on the day labour system. If the Government policy of preference to returned soldiers is the  obstacle in the way of securing the assistance of established building firms, that might be overcome by making it a condition of any contract with them that they shall give preference to returned soldiers. The Government inspectors could easily see that that policy was carried out. These established firms might erect soldiers' homes more cheaply than the Government could erect them under the day-labour system. When- I cite our experience in connexion with the transcontinental railway, and some of the work done at Canberra, it will be ad mitted that Government work under' the day-labour system has not been very satisfactory. I hope that we shall have no similar experience in connexion with the erection of soldiers' homes. </para>
                    <para>The principal matter to which Campbell and Sons direct attention is- that the Government are going overseas for the timber required for the erection of soldiers' homes. We hear everywhere that we should support our own industries, and it is somewhat inconsistent that the Government should propose to go overseas for the timber required for soldiers' homes. </para>

I remind the honorable senator, however, that the tightest Ring in Australia at the present time is the Timber Ring, and if the Government desire to obtain Australian timbers at a reasonable cost they must first break down that Ring. If they propose to do so by importing material for soldiers' homes from overseas, I should like to say that, in my opinion, that is the wrong way to go about the business. Surely there are other means which the Government might adopt. </para>

                        <para>The Combine rigorously enforces the condition that a builder must take all his supplies or none from members. A witness gave evidence that while building a large business place in the ci'ty he needed black face-bricks. He found that another builder operating near-by was obtaining them from a Arm in the Combine. On ringing up to place an order he was asked where he was getting his other bricks, and was then referred to the Metropolitan Brick Company (the "holding company" for the Combine). The latter company asked the same question, and the answer was " the State Brickworks." It was then discovered that the Combine had no black face-bricks for sale, and, though the person giving this answer claimed to have been misunderstood, the occurrence is an illustration of the condition frankly admitted. </para>
                        <para>The price of common bricks rose from 45s. per 1,000 in 1014 to 50s. in February, 1917, at which figure it remained stationary UP to the time when evidence was given, though the present  president  of the association, popularly known as the Brick Combine, forecasted a further rise at the beginning of this1 year (1910). This rise has since been announced in the press, and amounts to 2s. 6d. per thousand. The number of bricks ordinarily used in a brick cottage of four rooms and kitchen, &amp;c, is said to be about 35,000,. and, therefore, the added burden on this account since 1914 would be £13 2s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>The principal manufacturers of roofing tiles in Victoria are' combined in an association, which has a very close control of at least GO per cent, of the trade. The association fixes prices for the supply of tiles, and its method of working is to give prices for roofing, which ' include the fixing of the tiles by the suppliers.  While not absolutely refusing to sell tiles to builders to be fixed on .roofs by the purchaser, the association makes the price so high (£20 per thousand) as to be admittedly" prohibitive. Two reasons are given in justification of the association's action in keeping not only the supply but the work of fixing of roofing tiles in their own hands, the one which is most emphasized being that they prefer to do the fixing in order that they may be sure that the work is satisfactorily carried out. (One witness stated that it is usual to give a two years' guarantee that the roof will be weatherproof.) The second reason is a frank avowal that the fixing insures a certain amount of added profit. Some, at least, of the competing companies outside the association sell their tiles outright,- and do not quote any prices for fixing. A witness representing one such company said that his charge is £18 per thousand at the yard. In Sydney the manufacturers sell the whole of their tiles outright, but take uo part in the fixing. </para>
                        <para>In order to provide a safeguard against breaches of the rules fixing the prices of tiles, the association requires members who measure up roofs for the purpose of tendering to furnish the association with a copy of their measurements. More than one member may measure up a job, and in that way the association obtains a check by comparison. </para>

                    <para>I take it that the reason for that procedure would be to insure that a builder could not possibly obtain more tiles than were to be actually used upon the job in hand. There would be no chance of his getting enough to undertake another job - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It would appear from the minutes that this precaution against breaches of the rules is carefully observed, as there are frequent entries showing that reports of measurements are submitted to -the meeting, a proportion only of which are passed. In one instance, for example, forty-four reports of measurements were dealt with, and thirty -four passed; the balance, according to the secretary's evidence, would have been held over for investigation. Each member deposits £100, and the association has power to impose penalties in cases of breaches of the rules. </para>
                        <para>One important company, which is a member of the association, is located at Ballarat, but competes in the metropolitan area,, and explains its capacity for that competition by two facts, namely, .that it has an advantage in .the clay, inasmuch as it is using slimes that have already been treated by mining operations, and the material is therefore in a partly prepared state; and also as its manufactures are delivered at the Spencer-street Railway Station it is better situated in supplying many of the suburbs than are some of the suburban manufacturers. </para>
                        <para>A resolution of the association, passed in July, 1016, provides that -the minimum rates for Ballarat within a 5-mile radius of the Post Office shall be the same as Melbourne for private work only; all Government work to be at country rate. So far as the private work is concerned, .it was explained in evidence that this resolution was passed to protect the Ballarat company, and give it the control of busin nesa within the area where it is located. With regard to Government work, the reason for the provision was said to be that Government contracts are often much larger than .those of private individuals, and it was thought reasonable that the Melbourne manufacturers should have the opportunity of competing. The effect, however, is that if the Government desired any tile-roofing to be done within the Ballarat area, even though the work were done by the local company, the price would be raised by adding to it the cost of freight from Melbourne, which on the scale adopted by the association is 17s. 6d. per square, or nearly 30 per cent, addition to the standard price at the present time. Witnesses questioned on this subject protested that there was no intention to penalize the Government, but that is obviously the result, and although they further stated that there was practically no Government work of the kind going on at Ballarat, it is clear that the terms of the resolution were intended to have some meaning. </para>
                        <para>While, as stated above, the association only controls about 60 per cent, of the trade, the members comprise owners of all the old-established businesses. Several new companies have been formed within the last few years to manufacture tiles outside the association, and there is some evidence that their competition takes the form of making a slight reduction in prices. Owing to the present demand, however, this competition has had no effect in checking the output of any of the association companies, or causing them to lower their prices. </para>
                        <para>The dearness of galvanized iron .has led to a great demand for tiles. Before the war these were either imported from Marseilles and' sold on the wharf at £12 per 1,000, or else were made locally and sold at £11. The selling price of French tiles increased in 1915 to £15 5s, in 1916 to £22 5s., and in 1917 to £24 10s. per 1,000, at which price importing ceased, as no business could be continued. </para>

                        <para>Local tiles rose during the war from £11 to £18 10s. None of the witnesses examined could give any reason for an advance of 50 per cent., at any rate, in the case of businesses whose plants were installed before the war. The pressure of demand, however, was so great that several new yards were opened, two of them on a large scale, and these new businesses had to incur great additional expense in installing machinery. It was. mentioned in the Tariff Report on Slate Slabs, Tiles, &amp;c., that the local tile industry before the war was already so prosperous .that none of the tile manufacturers opposed the then suggested reduction of duty. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That local manufacturers raised their prices by 50 per cent, because of the opportunities afforded by the war conditions indicates a clear case of profiteering at the expense of the general community. Building material generally has so in- , creased that it has become almost impossible to erect a house; and there has been this additional factor, that- rentals have increased considerably. If the Government are compelled to buy their materials from Combines of the nature mentioned in the report, and at the prices indicated, homes for our soldiers will cost a disproportionately high figure. When, in a few years, competition has again reduced prices to about normal, houses for soldiers will be built more cheaply, and thus the parties who purchased during the present period of abnormally high prices - that is to say, in the early stages of the scheme - will have been penalized. </para>

                    <para>I now wish to deal with the vexed question of the high cost of living. I recognise that it is not possible for the Government under our present limited constitutional powers to effectively deal with this question, .and I therefore 'hope that on the first -available opportunity they will ask the people of Australia- ito endow them with larger powers. The people are looking to the Government to dead -with this question an the future. There is no ,doubt that 'profiteering .is being practised, -and the reports of the .Inter-State Commission dearly 'demonstrate that there are --a number of unscrupulous traders in this community who 'are, ito some extent .at least, responsible foa' the industrial unrest that obtains here. I admit that various industrial troubles must also share a degree of responsibility for :the high east of -commodities. The seamen's strike, for example, has been the means of raising the prices mt goods, because articles which were previously carried by sea have now to fee transported by rail, and have to pay, perhaps, four times the freight that they formerly .paid. This is one of the -reasons why the cost of living is on the upward grade.. Nevertheless, it .is manifest that profiteering is going on, and this -I shall clearly demonstrate before I resume my seat. If the Government -wish to .retain the .confidence of -the electors they must endeavour to secure -the constitutional powers necessary to -enable them to effectively 'deal with this matter. One item -which is .almost as important as that of foodstuffs is the item of clothing. The exorbitant prices which are being charged for quite a number of articles of everyday -use are responsible for  a  considerable amount of the discontent which exists amongst the  Tank  and file of the community. Upon page 7 of the Inter-State Commission's report, No. 11, dealing with clothing, I find the following: - </para>

                        <para>It was urged by importers that an appreciable contributing cause to the increased cost of clothing .and of materials for its manufacture is the heavier actual burden of Customs duties paid by the consumer since the war. As the .average import values of clothing and piece goods, &amp;c, have increased nearly 100 per cent, since 1914, the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties have involved heavier amounts being paid on "the same .articles. Whilst war conditions render the amount now levied much in excess of that necessary for the protection of local industry, such excess may be fairly -considered as necessary indirect .taxation to meet the financial emergency -arising .out of the war. It .does, however, constitute a heavy addition to the cost .to the consumer of all imported goods which are .dutiable according to value. </para>

                    <para class="block">In spite of this, the Customs duties which have been levied during the past .four years have not increased to anything 'like the .extent that the cost of . commodities  has increased. Where there may have been a 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. increase in Customs duties, the manufacturers have increased the prices of their goods by 15 per cent., and even more. The figures quoted by the Commission, comparing the prices which ruled in 1914 with those which obtained at the time it conducted its inquiry, clearly demonstrate this fact. </para>

                            <para>- They have practically had prohibition during that period. The manufacturers have taken advantage of the consumer, but have failed to supply him with a better article. They have taken advantage of the conditions which have obtained, not to benefit the people of Australia, but merely to exploit ' them. As the price- fixing regulations have now been swept aside,, and it is apparent that the States cannot deal effectively with this particular question, I hope that the Government will take action to limit the profits made by these various enterprises. If Ministers will only seek the powers that are required by them, I think the people will readily grant them. Upon page 10 of the Inter-State Commission's report on clothing, some very valuable information is given as to how this condition of affairs may be overcome. </para>

I brought this matter under the- notice of. the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> soon after my election to the Senate, and he pointed out that just prior to my representations' this subject had been mentioned to the Government, and that the Defence Department, through the High Commissioner in London, had made an arrangement with the Imperial Government for the export to Australia of a certain quantity of wool at a moderate , price. No doubt as a result of that action, Red Cross Societies throughout Australia were materially benefited. </para>

                            <para>- I attribute a great deal of the existing unrest to the fact that the cost of living, and the cost of clothing particularly, has increased out of all proportion to the advance in wages. In proof of this, I point out that, according to the Inter-State Commission's report, the price of men's all-wool undershirts increased from 36s. per dozen in 1914 to 84s. per dozen in 1918 ; woollen sweaters, from 48s. to 96s. ; cardigans, from 72s. to 130s. The report contains a long list of other articles of clothing which have similarly advanced in price. We cannot, therefore, blame altogether the labour market for the increase in the cost of living, and consequently we have to look for other reasons. I sincerely trust the Government will, at the earliest opportunity, endeavour to secure from the people those powers which will permit them to take some action to .check this damnable increase in the cost of articles of wear and the necessaries of life. </para>

                    <para>I want now to turn to the question involved in the transfer to Australia of German New Guinea under the terms of the Peace Treaty. I hope it will not prove another white elephant, as has been the case with the Northern Territory, where money is being poured out for very little return. I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> N. Leach, whose article appears in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> for information and figures giving a comparison between German New Guinea and Java. These figures are of great importance, in view of the fact that in the near future Australia will take over an extensive area formerly under the administration of the German Government. I lay stress on the fact that, so far as New Guinea is concerned, the climatic conditions and geographical situation are practically identical, and that Java to-day is probably one of the most flourishing countries in the world. Under sane administration, the new territory should be equally as profitable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leach</inline> states - </para>

                        <para>German New Guinea has an area of 74,200 square miles, while Java has only 50,000 square miles. Yet the population of Java is given at 36,000,000, including 76,000 white people and 563,000 Asiatics, while German New Guinea has about 500,000 natives, 500 Asiatics, and 1,000 whites. The exports -from Java are valued at £72,346,378, while from German New Guinea they are £604,340. Both countries are in the same latitude, have similar soils, climate, and natural conditions. Why, then, should not German New Guinea be developed into a prosperous condition equal to Java? It is only a matter of generalship ( in another word, intelligence ) that is called for. </para>

                            <para>- But we knew what the Northern Territory was- before it was taken over, and that South Australia was making- a. very good bargain with the Commonwealth. I remind the honorable senator that the  Hon.  Staniforth Smith, in his report upon Papua, pointed, out that many things that Australia is in need of can be produced there, so there should be. no need to go to the other side of the world for them. In one particular case, a returned soldier mentioned to me the question: of cocoanut plantations.. He said that although' the proposition is not altogether a good one on the mainland, because of the longer period before a return can be expected, there are a great number of- small islands, situated round the coasts of Papua, where plantations can be developed at a lower cost:,, and which in a few years should' show a consider stole profit. He says - 1'hc main point for consideration, is the difference between growing: cocoanut on the small! islands and on the mainland of Papua, islands: such as. the Torlesse Group and others! being specially suitable. Of recent years the Governor of Papua has, for some reason un' known to the public, persistently refused to grant leases of these uninhabited islands, which are so suitable for cocoanut growing, and so well adapted to the " small " man with limited capital. </para>

                    <para>In the hand-book on New Guinea, published by the  Hon.  Staniforth Smith, there is a reference to cotton, which is a commodity used extensively in Australia at the present time. He reports generally that cotton-growing would be a paying proposition in that part of the world. If it were undertaken- it should serve to reduce the price of cotton in Australia at the present time. According to the report of the Inter-State Commission, this commodity is practically controlled by a large English Combine. The Inter-State Commission reports that the high cost in Australia is not due to the expense of produce tion, but merely because we are here  completely in the hands of a large English Combine.

                    <quote>
                        <para>The supply and distribution of sewing cotton are almost entirely in the hands of two great British groups of' companies, one of which - the Coats group - is represented in Australia by the Central Agency Limited, and the other - the English Thread Company - by Richard Allen and Sons Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, and Direct Agencies Limited, Sydney. </para>
                        <para>The Central Agency - .the British company - is the distributing company for what is popularly known as the Coats Combine - an amalgamation of companies consisting of J. and P. Coats Limited, Clark and Company, Jonas Brook, Chadwick's Limited, and Kerr's Limited. </para>
                        <para>The English Thread Company originally consisted of fourteen firms, but other large firms were subsequently included. </para>
                        <para>Two of the constituent companies within the Coats amalgamation, viz., Chadwick's and Kerr's, are separately represented in Australia, the agency of the companies having been continued with the firms who were acting at the time their principals joined the group. This separate representation, however, does not imply any actual competition, for the prices are determined by the British head-quarters in Glasgow, and are kept uniform throughout. The English Thread Company, also, though it originally appeared to have been formed as a separate and competing group, has evidently become merged in the larger combination, as may be inferred from the fact that the superintendent in Australia of the Central Agency is also the superintendent of the English Thread Company, and that all instructions regarding prices in Australia of both companies' goods are issued through him. This powerful combination, which manufactures both in Great Britain and in the United States, is represented all over the world, and is everywhere dominant in the sewing cotton trade. The Australian superintendent said, " There is always opposition, but I admit it is of a minor character." In the household lines of sewing cottons, viz., 200 and 300 yard6-cord sewing cottons, the control by the Combine appears to be particularly rigid, though the lesser group, the English Thread Company, is permitted to sell its cottons at a small reduction of1s. to 2s. per gross below those of the Central Agency. The reason for the special attention given to these lines is no doubt partly because of the great volume of trade which they represent, and partly because, as they are found in every home, and must be distributed through retailers, competition may be more readily controlled. In the case of machine cottons and threads used only or chiefly by manufacturers, the possibility of these trade buyers, with their command of capital and knowledge of trading facilities, obtaining direct supplies from smaller competing manufacturers is obviously a consideration which affects the views of the company, and which is not present in the case of cottons, the principal sale of which is purely for household purposes. </para>
                        <para>Instances were given by- several witnesses of the manner in which the Central Agency uses its power to prevent the introduction and sale of cottons manufactured by producers outside the groups it controls. </para>
                        <para>One witness, a departmental manager in a large softgoods warehouse, said that, some years ago, when serving under another company,  negotiations were entered into for supplies of British cottons by an independent manufacturer, and the Central Agency threatened to cut off supplies. The result was that the negotiations with the competing company were abandoned. The same witness said, that later on. when he was manager for Thomas Brown and Sons, of Brisbane, he took up a line of British cottons outside the Combine, with the result that the chief representative of the Central <inline font-style="italic">Agency</inline> interviewed him personally, and said that the company's account would be liable to be closed unless the purchases of new cotton were discontinued. The same witness, who is now with a Melbourne company, stated that during the last two years samples have been forwarded from time to time from English manufacturers outside the Combines, but his  company has been unable to entertain . their offers, in view of the attitude taken up by the Central Agency representative. The chief representative of the Central Agency, when questioned subsequently as . to the interview above mentioned, said, " I do not remember that, and know nothing about it; it is most unlikely, and  I deny it absolutely." </para>
                        <para>An indent merchant deposed that during the last few months he had submitted samples of Japanese cottons to wholesale houses, and was told that the purchase could not be entertained, as, if the company bought any such cotton, it would be boycotted by the Central Agency. The wholesale witness just previously quoted said that he was one of those to whom the Japanese cottons in question were submitted, but he did not purchase, although the prices seemed very, favorable, partly because of the absence 'of experience of Japanese cottons. "The governing factor in my mind," he added, " was that, if we touched those lines, the Central Agency would take care to make them unprofitable for us sooner or later. I based that opinion on my previous experience." </para>
                        <para>The representative of another wholesale firm said he also had been approached recently with regard to the purchase of Japanese cottons, but declined to take them up, chiefly for the reason that there would probably be conflict with the Central Agency. He continued, " That opinion was based on experience obtained some twelve years ago, when my company took up another English line of cotton. The Central Agency made representations to induce the company to desist from importing outside English cottons, and it was intimated that supplies would probably be cut off." Finally instructions were issued by the London office of the purchasing company not to send orders for the outside line of cotton. </para>
                        <para>The witness said that in this case the competing cotton was of British make, and a perfectly good article, at a satisfactory price. </para>

I appeal to the Government to sanely administer that Territory so that it shall become wealth-producing rather than a burden on the taxpayers of Australia.

                    <para>I desire to deal briefly with the office of the High Commissioner in London. On account of that official being only a public servant, without executive authority, he possesses very limited powers. I suggest that the occupant of the position should be the possessor of a portfolio in the Commonwealth Ministry. Then the .Commissioner would be vested with authority to deal with all matters relative to Australia, and when an intricate question arose, it would not be necessary to send a Minister from Melbourne to London. The up-keep of the office of High Commissioner is costly, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> is performing his duties admirably, his position is both difficult and unsatisfactory. </para>

I hope the Government will either turn the InterState Commission into a Tariff Commission or will appoint another Commission to insure that the Tariff is properly regulated, so that where an industry is granted protection, the manufacturers will not be afforded an opportunity to pile up prices upon the consumer. Prior to the war, Australian-made articles were kept just a few pence below the price of imported goods. When freights became scarcer and scarcer, and the cost of production in England had vastly increased so that the prices of such commodities as were imported here had vastly increased, Australian manufacturers , saw to it - wherever they could - that the prices of their wares still remained just a few pence below that of the imported article. </para>

                        <para>.- One cannot enter upon a discussion of the particulars contained in the Ministerial statement without making some reference to the glorious change which has recently taken place in Europe, whereby our Empire and Allies have returned to a condition of peace after the terrible holocaust of war. Probably in the history of the world there has been no such welcome change as has now come to the peoples of to-day. It is natural that one should take a retrospective view of the situation from which we have emerged in order to give due credit to those responsible for the wonderful transition. It is very- hard for the&gt; average Australian, so far removed from the seat of war, to realize what this continent has escaped by a victory for the Allied arms. The conduct of the enemy has been such as to convince us that no people among the whole of the belligerent nations would have been forced into greater sacrifices than Australia had our arms been unsuccessful. Numbers  of 23eople  think that England, France, Italy, and other countries, being in closer conflict in this terrible struggle, would, have been the greater sufferers, but I want to bring home to the people of Australia the fact that not only would their worldly goods: have been confiscated - not only would they have suffered the  same  financial difficulties as the people of European Empires  - but they would  also  have had to submit to what would inevitably have been tyrannical control and slavedom at the hands of the enemy. It would not have been so with other countries. Those which are more densely populated would offer little room for the German surplus population, but in sparsely-populated Australia there was the great opportunity, which would" certainly have been embraced, for the settlement of the enemy's surplus population. There is, therefore, little doubt that,  as  the result of defeat, Australia would have lost more than any of the other peoples engaged in the conflict. It has been advanced over and over again that Australia did wonderfully well in the war. Credit should go to whom it  i8  due. Australia did not do over well in the war. The 413,000 of Australia's sons who went to the Front did well. They created for themselves a name which will never die: they made sacrifices which no man could" exceed. Over 50,000 of them will never return. Those men did well, but the credit due to them is not reflected upon the eligible man who was equally able togo, but refused to do anything for the defence of Australia. I strongly object to the credit due to the men who did the work and made the sacrifice being taken by those who have done nothing.  I  noticed in a Labour paper not long ago that considerable credit was taken on behalf of a union that had 1,000 members. </para>

                    <para class="block">To  prove their loyalty, patriotism, and self-sacrificing disposition, they said they had sent 400 of their members to the Front. But the other 600, at one of the most crucial periods in the war", came out on strike on a matter which did not concern them, and in which they had no grievance. They came. out in support of a band of men who created a revolt in the New South "Wales Government Workshops in 1917, because there had been introduced into the workshops a card system, which was already operating in Australia in concerns owned and controlled by the Labour movement, and was even operating, here when I was a boy. Among those who, supported that strike was this very union which had. sent 400 men to the Front and had only 600 members left behind. To use the common phrase, those men, when they, went on strike., blacklegged on their comrades who were fighting for the liberty, of the world. No credit is clue to that union, or to any such organization. No credit is due to the shirkersof Australia for what pur men did in this great, war. It might come home more forcibly if . I asked whether it would be any credit to , the eligible members of, the Melbourne Club if, out of a membership of, say, 500,100 went to the Front. No credit, would be due to the eligible members who remained behind. The credit is due to those who went and did the work.I heard a very forcible speech , from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Gardiner, the main trend of a part of which was that in. the armistice terms and the terms of Peace, there was evidence of a desire to be harsh, and even cruel, towards the enemy. It is, a singular thing that men widely read, who have given consideration to all the incidents -of the war, should find it necessary to devote a, considerable portion of their time and energy to obtaining leniency for a nation which has been sp distinctly brutal .

It was methodically organized and carried out by the German nation. Yet we find public men, with great responsibilities, delivering speeches which, if they serve any purpose at all, can create only discontent within Australia with the conditions forced upon that nation by the Peace terms. No matter what, the Allies did to Germany, they could never be severe enough to meet the ends of common justice. I believe Germany will never pay the indemnity which the Allies have levied upon her, and am not looking forward with any great hope to the payment of that debt. But even if the indemnity were ten times as large, Germany could never redeem her name or compensate for the damage she has done to the civilized, world. </para>
                    <para class="block">  I wish to make brief references to the discontent and disaffection existing in Australia to-day.. It is one of the unexplained facts that social, and. industrial discontent and disturbance always follow a war. If any country in the whole world ought to realize the absolute necessity for its people to pull , together, toproduce,and build up its resources, it is Australia. There is. no other country in which unanimity . and, industry are necessary to the same extent, and in which the absence of them will be so speedily felt. The opponents of. the Government, . and . some who seem, like . the Irishman,. to. be against every Government, make a point of creating discord and discontent. Go -where you like . at the -present -time, listen to the speeches, delivered, and you will hear on every hand the advocacy of a classconsciousness.You will hear the workers told that they must recognise that they belong to one class, that there is another class which seeks to use and exploit them.  and that the only way in which they can bring about a better condition of affairs is to become class-conscious, and declare war on the class which is exploiting them. One of the prime factors in the furtherance of this class war at the' present time is the cost of living, which has been referred to by every speaker in this debate. There is not the slightest doubt that good cause for complaint exists. The prices of scores of articles among the necessaries of life have risen out of all proportion. The production of such articles is not at all affected toy war conditions, or by any conditions which might have been created subsequently by the war, and, therefore, we cannot see why these increases have taken place. There can be no just reason assigned for them, and I agree with those who say that an effort should certainly be made to check the unreasonable increases which have occurred in the prices of commodities in Australia, and thus bring home to those persons who are exploiting the public unreasonably - who are profiteering - the fact that this practice will not be countenanced. </para>

                    <para>Then they would be in a position to say to their competitors, "You must either sell your articles at a certain price or we will do so." But in the matter of the increased cost of living Australia occupies the best position of any country in the world. According to the latest statistics, there is only one other country which possesses almost equal advantages. I have been at some pains to obtain the increased cost of living in various countries from the end of 1914 up to different dates in 1918. I was unable to get returns to a uniform date. From these figures I gather that the increase in the cost of living in the United Kingdom up to November, 1918, was 133 per cent., in France up to May it was 132 per cent., in Italy to April it was 136 per cent., in Portugal to February it was 133 per cent., in the United State of America to June it was 59 per cent., in Canada to August it was 81 per cent., in Australia to June it was 32 per cent., and in New Zealand to July it was 39 per cent. Of course, some . people urge that because Australia is a producer of raw materials there can be no excuse for the increased cost of living. In this connexion it is worthy of note that in New Zealand the cost of living was 7 per cent higher than it was in Australia during 1918. In South Africa the increase in the cost . of living to June, 1918, was 32 per cent., in Germany to April of the same year it was 127 per cent., in Austria to December, 1917, it was 273 per cent., in Norway to August, 1918, it was 184 per cent., in Sweden to August of the same year it was 184 per cent., in Denmark to July, 1918, it was 97 per cent., in Holland to June, 1918, it was 87 per cent., and in Switzerland to June of that year it was 130 per cent. These figures show that, all the countries which I have enumerated were worse off from the stand-point of the increased cost of living during the period of the war than was Australia. Now let us turn to the Commonwealth. It is natural that the opponents of the Government should expect that in the State of Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, the increase in the cost of living would be less than that in any other State in Australia. That is a very justifiable assumption if the arguments advanced by some honorable senators upon the opposite side of the chamber are well founded. But first let us see how the purchasing power of the sovereign has declined in the various cities of the Commonwealth. Taking the average of the years from 1901 to 1911, we find that the purchasing power of the sovereign has depreciated in Sydney by 14s. - that is to say, it cost <inline font-style="italic">£ 1</inline> 14s. to . purchase what could have been obtained for£ 1 in 1911- in Melbourne by l1s. 3d., Brisbane by 14s. 2d., Adelaide by 13s., Perth by 10s. 10d., and Hobart by 13s. 10d., an average for the entire Commonwealth of 12 s. 9d. In other words, the sovereign has depreciated in Brisbane by 2d. more than it depreciated in Sydney, and by ls. 5d. more than its average depreciation over the six capital cities of the Commonwealth. I do not suggest that the Queensland Government could have prevented this. But the fact remains that a Labour Government in Queensland failed to prevent it. Consequently it is scarcely fair for our opponents to affirm that the Commonwealth Government are entirely- responsible for the diminution of the purchasing power of the sovereign which ' has taken place -throughout Australia. We get similar results if we refer to Knibbs' statistics, which show the average of the increased cost of living throughout Australia for the five years 1914 to 1919 inclusive. Taking 1,000 as an index number, and referring to five cities in each State, I find that New South Wales starts in 1914 at 1,165, and ends in 1919 at 1,734. That is an increase of 48.8 per cent. Victoria starts with 1,106, and ends with 1,566 - an increase of 41.7 per cent. Queensland starts with a weighted average of 1,082, and ends with 1,734 - an increase of 60.3 per cent. South Australia starts with an average of 1,247, and ends with 1,652 - an increase of 32.5 per cent. Western Australia starts with 1,412, and ends with 1,656 - an increase of 17.3 per cent.; whilst Tasmania starts with- 1,201, and ends with 1,693 - an increase of 41 per cent. The average for the whole of the Commonwealth starts at 1,164, and ends with 1,666 - an increase of 42.7 per cent. Yet the increase in the case of Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, is 60.3 per cent. We find, therefore, in- all the comparisons which we institute, that the increased cost of living in Queensland during the period of the war was greater than the increased cost of living in any other State. These figures should be carefully considered by the workers of Australia. There is no doubt that the latter are roused almost to the point of rebellion by the representations which are continually being made to them to the effect that they are .being exploited to a greater extent than any other people in the world. They are assured that they are being robbed by profiteers,' and that the Government are responsible for this. That is the argument of the peace disturbers from start to finish. 'They tell their hearers that nothing short of a revolution will bring about an equitable settlement to the workers of this continent. It is well for the workers to know that, although nobody attempts to justify the increases which have taken place, in Queensland, where a Labour Government have been in. office for some years, the greatest increase has taken place. . I do not suggest that the Queensland Government are responsible for this. On the contrary, I hold that they could not avoid it. But it is certainly illogical for our opponents to urge that the Commonwealth Government are responsible for the increase which has taken place in. the cost of living. Such statements are calculated to. lead the workers of Australia into an entirely false position. </para>
                    <para>Now, I desire to further stress the unwise doctrine preached by those who endeavour to create a class consciousness. The individual who lays himself out to create between man and man a class war is an enemy of- the people. I have always recognised that there has been throughout history a war of the classes. But we are now reaching an age when such a condition of affairs, especially in a country like Australia, is absolutely unnecessary, and entirely unwise. I have long argued that much of the disagreement existing between employer and employed at the present time is in a large measure blamable to both sides. There is no doubt whatever that there is a class of employer who has not the redeeming features always to be found in a slave-owner ; the man who seeks to squeeze every ounce of profit from his employees, and who is absolutely indifferent as to their conditions of life. . On the other hand, there  are employers who are ever solicitous of the welfare of their employees, and anxious always to treat them equitably as men. I know that the reading of extracts is rather tedious, but I should like to read  extracts from a speech, oil this question, delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, H.</inline> W. Gepp, now gene- ralmanager of the Zinc Extraction Association, and carrying on extensive works in Hobart, Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp,</inline> although an Australian has had a very extensive training in America in the handling of large bodies of men and in the supervision of big works, and, therefore, words from him on the question which I am discussing will carry more weight and be more convincing than anything I could possibly say; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline> has a very fair grasp of the conditions existing between employer and employee, and I believe he offers the only sound solution of the problem.

                    <para>An excellent idea is to adopt a definite line of organization as regards the relation of the various members of the staff to one another as soon as possible, So that all members know to whom they are responsible, and to whom to report. So as to avoid too much of " red tape," which a rigid organization sometimes gives rise to, it is advisable to form what is known as a " general staff," to which various members of the regular staff are appointed in view of their special knowledge. </para>

                    <para>One of the most interesting essentials of this kind of work is the development of the right spirit in the staff and men by the chief officials.

                    <para>Whyisthepresentpositionsoextremelydeplorable? It seems to be because the employer is totally ignorant of the attitude of mind of the employee, and the employee equally ignorant of the true standard of the employer. Further, they have no common ideas or ideals, and no common meeting ground. And who is, say in the case of a big company, the employer? The employee regards the employer as a big fat man, who does not care how he gets more as long as he gets it. What is the actual casein a public company, where the shares are well distributed?

                    <para>The representatives of all these interests, the directors, are regarded by the average employee as the sole owners of the concern, and it is generally considered that they are getting all the benefits. Of course, this is not the case by any means. </para>
                    <para>But, how does the employer regard his employee? In some instances, as a man who is trying to do as little work as possible for as much ashe can get.

                    <para pgwide="yes">Admittedly there is ignorance and faults on both sides, and, being pretty close in touch with both, it is difficult to say on which side the faults are greater. What is required, though, at the present crisis is not criticism so much as constructive suggestion, and, to my mind, one main idea is basic, viz., we need to abandon the theory that a minimum wage is essential, and adopt instead the conviction that there should, and must, be a minimum amount of happiness right throughout the community,withas much over and above and to the good as the united brains of the community can, by proper co-operation, evolve and develop. </para>

Surely we possess enough constructive ability and ideas to be up and doing - to say to our fellow-citizens, " Let us- adopt certain basic facts, and talk matters over impassionately, realising that our mental attitude towards life is changing, nay, has already changed, and that all desire to reach a better understanding, and cooperate for the good of our country and for the benefit of our depen- dants." </para>

                    <para>Australia imagines she is ahead in industrial conditions, but this is sadly not so.

                    <para>How shall we endeavour to attain to this position?The answer is by co-operation in all matters - by employers taking a keen interest in , the lives of all their employees - by developing a spirit of civic and industrial citizenship so that a man will guard his job just as he would a public garden running down the centre of a street, by inaugurating co-operative councils, who, with the assistance of the employers, will reduce cost of living to a minimum, and, by means of which education in general economies will gradually percolate through the whole community to its lasting good. </para>

We have had too often controlling a body of men the class of man who looks upon them, merely as chattels, employed as cheaply 'as possible for certain work, and out of which he must get as much as he can. That attitude on ' the part . of 'the employer necessarily creates a desire in the worker to get as much as he can and do as little as he can. This is an absolutely suicidal policy on both sides, and must, if persisted in, result in the bankruptcy of Australia. </para>

We must see that our -house is . in order before we invite others ito share it with us. We have to face in the ifuture.an enormous load of interest on our debt, and the only -way in which we can 'hope to meet our responsibility in this (regard is by increasing our population. Whilst we continue to set up and extend class hatred and indulge in industrial disputes, and, in a word, whilst we continue to be a divided people, there is no hope for us either from increased production or increased population. Hence I hope that in the very near future we shall have very much improved social and industrial -conditions in Australia . </para>
                    <para>I shall make -only a passing reference  to -the . present lamentable industrial disturbaoice. We have now, after many years' hard fighting, obtained for the settlement of industrial disputes a lawful and impartial tribunal, and I hope that better counsels will prevail, and that the dispute which is now paralyzing Australia will very shortly be settled. Some of the opponents of the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes tell. us that the Arbitration Court is too slow and too costly. I am not quite sure about the time, but I venture to say that the strike now existing will cost more than all the appeals to the Arbitration Court within the next forty-five or fifty years could possibly cost. It is safe to  say that there are from 50,000 to 75,000 men out of employment in Australia to-day in consequence of this industrial war. The loss of the wages of these men, and the loss of their wealth production to the country, amounts to a sum which I hesitate to estimate. To say that any system of arbitration to settle a dispute and avoid this kind of turmoil, with its accompaniment of suffering to innocent people as well as to the parties to the dispute, could be more costly than the method now being adopted, is absolutely absurd. </para>
                    <para>There is one matter I wish to bring under the notice of the Government. We are aware that Ministers can do nothing unless they are supported by Parliament and the people of Australia. The cost of government at the present time in this country is lamentably high. It has been published throughout the Commonwealth that the various Governments in this country  are costing over £33.,000,000 annually. That seems an enormous sum to be devoted to the government ' of 5,000,000 people. I am not responsible for their accuracy, but I give the following figures, which have been published broadcast throughout Australia: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="088332191907304_42_1.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I realize that this enormous expenditure would probably be very little increased if Australia had a population of 10,000,000. The cost of, governing a small population is out of all proportion to the cost of governing a large population. Australia .will have to consider immediately whether she will take steps to increase her population or to decrease the cost of government in this country? </para>
                    <para>In addition to the figures I have given, there is to be considered the cost of maintaining the Governor-General, the Governors of the different States, and the Federal and State Parliaments. Other expenditure will also have to be met. We know that, without taking into consideration the gradual repayment of our war loans, our annual interest bill will be very large. Great as the present expenditure is, we know that we shall have to spend more money on old-age and invalid pensions. I believe that it will be necessary for us to spend more money also on war pensions. I hold that a man who has been disabled in the service of his country ought to receive a reward which will insure to him all the comforts which it is possible for him to obtain. In my opinion, it is wrong to say that a man who has been crippled should try to supplement his pension by earning something, unless he is personally disposed to do so. If a man be blind, or if he should have lost his legs or an arm, it would, no doubt, be a good thing for him to take ; up some industry which would occupy his mind. But, unless he desires to do so, I say that the country owes to him a sufficient sum of money to enable him to secure all the comforts he is capable of enjoying for the rest of what must, at best, be a miserable life. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I would make a last appeal that a special effort be put forward in this time of stress. Australia is a new-born nation. We have received the baptism of blood. It remains to be seen whether the country advances or remains stationary. It will be difficult to do the latter. A people must either advance or recede. There is an opportunity to-day for Australia to become great and influential in the world's affairs. Australia has gained fame as the result of the deeds of her soldiers, and as the outcome of their contact with men of other parts of the world. I desire,  also, in this regard, to give credit to our brilliant Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> now on his way home. Australia has recently become a known territory, in the world, and here is the occasion for our people to prove their determination and their worthiness to become a great and prosperous nation. If they do not accept the opportunity, I can see nothing ahead for years but a mere existence, when we shall be dragging along beneath an almost unbearable load of debt - practically a failure. If our people will accept their responsibilities individually and collectively as citizens', there is no reason why Australia should not become one of the great nations of the world. </para>

                    <para>.- I have to complain concerning the unexplainable inactivity of the Defence .Department, and of the Postmaster-General's Department, in regard to a matter in which both are concerned. ' During the war our soldiers on active service were not called upon to pay postage on their mails. Some time ago, a number of returned men were quarantined, practically at the back door of their Tasmanian homes. Those troops were naturally discontented, and there was very nearly a little mutiny. A citizen's Reception Committee in Hobart, comprising' men and women who have spent their own money and collected from others to provide our boys with a fitting welcome home, took the course, in order to pacify the discontented soldiers, of advising them to spend much of their time in quarantine in writing home. The Committee told the lads that they need not trouble about postage, but that they - the members of the Committee - would pay for the stamps if the Commonwealth authorities saw fit to charge postage. ' The Committee spent more than £30, which was considered a very unfair levy; and its officials asked for a refund. Subsequently additional returning men had to be placed in quarantine, and the matter became more acute. I have repeatedly applied for the extension of. the free postage concession which the troops enjoyed while on the other side of the world, but I have been unable so far to secure a satisfactory answer. A letter to the honorary secretary of the Citizens' Reception Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> S. Nettlefold, from the Postmaster-General's Department, reads - </para>

                    <para>In reply to your communication of the 9th inst., I desire to inform you that if the letters from soldiers in quarantine at Barnes Bay are indorsed with the usual notice that they are on " active service," such letters will be transmitted in the same manner as letters from the Front.

                <para class="block">It was quite right that, while bur men were at the Front, indorsement of their correspondence should be insisted upon; but here were numbers practically back home again, kept in quarantine because of the influenza epidemic, and so placed that no one but the men themselves could have participated in the advantage of having their letters franked. Why, therefore, does the Department insist that the officers with those troops should be called upon to indorse all letters sent out? The men cannot secure indorsement by their officers; and, since they have no stamps, they are compelled to intrust some one else to attend to the matter.

                <para>That might be correct enough in some big question, but, if these were no communication by boat with Tasmania, does the Postmaster-General argue that there should be no communication whatever between Tasmania and the mainland simply because the laws of Australia must be uniform? If the transcontinental railway ceased to run,, surely Western Australia would be entitled to&gt; some means'- of communication which' could not necessarily be given to the whole of Australia.

He was so impressed by the case I put before him, and the documents from- business people showing that a fortnight, and- sometimes three weeks, elapses between mails, both those delivered in Tasmania and those' delivered here from Tasmania) that he did not turn down' the request that the system of business lettergrams - should be reinstated,' but promised to bring it before the Postmaster-General -immediately upon his return from Sydney: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> came' back'. from Sydney a- day. or two 'later, and ' special consideration &lt; was given to Tasmania's request.. But, after "all, we got only the stereotyped reply, that in the interests of economy the system could not be reverted to. Many requests have been put forward by Tasmanian members in both Houses, and by dozens of business people in Tasmania, for better mail facilities, and one reason given . in every reply is that it would not pay to re-establish the system of business lettergrams. An other reason put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> or his officials' is" that under the Constitution no facility can be granted to one State more than another, no matter how strong or urgent the case. I recognise that there may be a constitutional difficulty in that regard, but I believe I was right in pointing out that, if these facilities were' reinstated in the case of Tasmania, the other States would not press the Department for them. They would be satisfied that Tasmania was' suffering under unique disadvantages. </para>

There may- be- some way of getting over the difficulty, and, if there is no other' way,' the re-establishment of business lettergrams all over Australia would only mean that Mr. Webster would have to show a slight loss in his bookkeeping transactions for the Postal Department, and would not be able to cut -such a figure as 'he hopes to cut before the people of Australia- by showing that he is-niaking the Depart-' ment pay. The- Postal Department is one of the bigactivibies-of Australia, and was, established as much for the convenience of the people as to show a ledger profit. I believe that is the view that will be taken by the big majority, of the people, and in extraordinary times like the . present, when m'ail facilities are blocked, in some cases to the ruin of business people, even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> although he seems determined to show a large pro fit oh . the year's transactions of the Postal Department, would be justified in re-establishing lettergrams for. business purposes.

                            <para>- I do not care what the attitude of the Opposition is; I am going to make my own attitude clear. That is my concern, and is, to me, second only in importance to my concern for the welfare of the Parliament and the nation. I shall not lightly condone any action on the part of the Administration which abrogates in any particular the right of this Parliament to enforce the law which has been placed upon the statute-book to deal with Inter  state  industrial disputes, that is, with disputes of a national character. I am not going to condone any action which will result in the setting aside of our Arbitration Court, which has been established under Australian law that is not yet twenty years old. That tribunal is not the offspring of any ancient system of oppression - it is the offspring of a desire to do everything which can be done to promote the welfare of the industrial classes of this country, and to avoid disturbances while disputes are being settled. If, during the period over which it is proposed that the Senate shall adjourn, the Government unwisely sets aside the law, I will not lightly pass over such action. I have assured the Ministry of my support, which will be continued to them in every particular ; but I call upon them to write, a lesson in letters which will be legible to all who flout the law which has been enacted by this Parliament. Anything which may be conceded by Ministers must not abrogate the rights of this National Parliament. I am not one of those who are anxious to secure a triumph over any class of the community, but I am anxious to completely vindicate the institutions which have been established under laws enacted with the assistance of this Chamber. We know that compromise can very easily effect the temporary settlement of a dispute. But we have already provided a system of compromise in connexion with industrial disputes. The. Arbitration Court represents that compromise. If we set aside that institution, we shall get into a position under which we should have to excuse the attitude of a Parliament of nearly 300 years ago had it conceded to King Charles the principle of levying ship money. Any compromise which abrogates the sovereign right of the people to give expression to their desire through the Courts which' have been established in the interests of all classes, will not have my support. </para>

There is evidently some mistake in regard to this matter; though nobody has a greater appreciation of the work done by these pay clerks than I have. They have devised a system which enables us to pay demobilized soldiers more rapidly than any other country in the world. Most of the men in that Pay Corps are returned soldiers. I shall make inquiries in regard to the distribution of the badges, but before the honorable senator accuses the Department of giving badges to men who have not been to the Front he should be sure that his charge is well founded. Having paid this tribute to the splendid work done by the Pay Corps, I promise to look into the matter. </para>
