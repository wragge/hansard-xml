                        <para>- I desire to ask another question 61 the Leader of the Senate. I ask the honorable senator whether he personally arranged to be absent from the chamber when the adjournment of the Senate was moved last evening, knowing that that was the first occasion on which I would have an opportunity of replying to a statement made in the Senate with regard to the shipping trouble; and that he also arranged for honorable senators to walk out if that matter were referred to, so that the Senate might be counted out, and, I might be deprived of an opportunity of discussing the matter? </para>

Speaking for myself, I had very urgent departmental business to transact, and I deemed that I would be better employed in dealing with that business than in listening to the honorable senator. I presume that other honorable senators were moved by the same feeling. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a very serious matter, but still it is one which affects members of the Senate. I wish to refer to a report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of this morning of what occurred when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made his statement of policy here yesterday. As honorable senators are &#39;aware, it was made in such way that it was not open to discussion. I am not complaining of that, but the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> gives a version of what occurred which, to my mind, is most misleading and unfair. It goes without saying that that is usual for the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline></para>

If a newspaper is, in his opinion, acting improperly he can proceed by way of a motion that the reporters of that newspaper be excluded from the chamber until such time as the proprietors of the newspaper make&#39; an apology or promise good behaviour  for  the future. The matter he raises is not. a question of privilege. It would be beneath the dignity of the Senate to say that any criticism by a newspaper, or misreporting, which did  not  go beyond the limits I have already specified, would be a deprivation of the liberties of &#39;the Senate, or of any member of it. The honorable senator would be in order in dealing with the matter by way of a personal explanation. </para>

I am giving reasons why the Standing Orders should be suspended. I say that the reports of Parliament should be reports of the proceedings in Parliament, and comments on Parliament should appear as such. To mix up reports and comments upon honorable senators in this way is to my mind an interference with their rights. It is an undignified way of reporting the proceedings of Parliament, and I ask honorable senators to permit the Standing Orders to be suspended, when I think I can make out a good case to show that action should be taken in the matter by the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- I shall leave that aspect of the matter, because I feel confident that the good sense of this Chamber is with me in the view which I have expressed. May I point out that assent to the specific motion which is now before us would reduce our proceedings to the level of a farce? But the Senate has not yet assented to the motion, and, therefore, I hope I have not given <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> an occasion for a further effort to prolong these proceedings. The suspension of our Standing Orders is only intended to meet cases of urgency - cases for which they do not make other provision. Upon neither of these grounds can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> claim to have made out a case. The suspension of the Standing Orders to-day is not urgent, because the practice to which he refers has been in vogue for a long -while, and because it will not make any difference whether we arrive at a decision upon it to-day or tomorrow. Moreover, it was open to the honorable senator to move the adjournment of the Senate if he wished to bring this question forward. When our Standing Orders indicate that a certain course should be followed when an honorable senator desires to deal with a particular matter, it is obviously absurd to suspend those Standing Orders to enable him to deal with it. There are half-a-dozen ways in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> could have brought this question before the Senate. I do not propose to tell him what they are, although it is manifest that he does need a little instruction.It is a misuse of our Standing Orders to ask for their suspension when they clearly provide a means by which the honorable senator may attain his objective. </para>

                                <para>- The closing: remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> were impudent and uncalled for, especially in view of his conduct in this chamber since the resumption of business after our six  months&#39; holiday.  His  observations &#62;were entirely out of place, and I hope that he will withdraw them. Nobody is more ready to get on with the public business, than are honorable senators upon this side of the oharaiber. Episodes such as occurred last evening -are a perfect Godsend to the Government, because the latter &#39;have no business to go on with. </para>

                                <para>- The Opposition have no desire , to waste time, and in submitting this motion, I took steps to avoid any waste of time: In the first place, as a matter of privilege, I called&#39; attention to the manner in which our proceedings are reported by the newspapers. If the Senate had agreed with me, the matter would have- ended there. Then  you, sir, pointed out that I had another means of achieving my purpose, namely, by way of a personal explanation. In passing, I wish to say that I am not concerned with the personal aspect of. this matter. It is the parliamentary aspect of it with which I am concerned -the placing of brands upon honorable senators, brands which are uncalled for and unwarranted. The Minister, in his reply, charges us with wasting time. I followed your advice, sir, and asked for the right to make a personal explanation, which would not have been lengthy, nor would it have involved debate ; but, owing to the action of the Government Whip, who in these matters is as -responsible as the Government, I was prevented from taking that course, although the Government Whip, I admit, was quite within his rights in objecting. </para>

                                <para>- As an officer of the Government, the Whip, within this Chamber, is as responsible for the despatch of business as any member of the Ministry; and they must take their share of the responsibility&#39; for preventing me from adopting the shortest method of dealing with the matter I had in mind. A personal explanation would have presented me from making a general complaint, which I desire to lay, against the press. I claim that if the Senate is seized with the proper sense of its own dignity, it will nip in the bud this offensive method of reporting the debates of this Chamber. I do not mind the freest criticism and the fullest publicity in the form of comments or leading articles being given to any remarks which I may make; but I maintain that the press are infringing the privileges extended to them by publishing, as they have been doing of late, what purports to be a report of the proceedings of the Senate. I ask honorable senators to permit me to deal with this matter now. It can be gone into fully, and if the discussion has no other effect than to bring the newspapers - which should be dignified organs of pub lie opinion - to a sense of the fitness of things, I shall be satisfied. I think some good will be the outcome of a discussion. The state of the notice-paper indicates that no urgent business will be interfered with, and, as far as the Senate is concerned, action may be taken to check this pernicious practice. I can promise honorable senators that, if permission be granted to me, I shall handle the subject in such a way as to insure their unanimous support in preventing newspapers from misrepresenting what is being done in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is&#39; taken practically from the Imperial Navigation Act. The point was raised, however, whether the owner of a boat which was alleged to have damaged a buoy would be able to prove that he was not guilty. I understand that he would have the right to resist any application for damages on the part of the Commonwealth authorities; he would be able to put his case practically without limitation. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The . words &#34;deliberate and wilful,&#34; originally contained in the British Act, have been omitted from this clause, for the reason that there are no witnesses of damage where buoys are isolated. In the northern waters of Australia it is quite a common practice to make use of buoys for anchoring. That should be prevented wherever possible. The Bill is intended practically to apply the Imperial Statute in our territorial waters, subject to the slight amendment which I have indicated. </para>

                <para>Another point raised was in regard to damage done to a buoy, after which the ship proceeded to a foreign port. If it is a British vessel it must report to the Board of Trade, and its log must be produced if requested, after which, Court proceedings might follow in the ordinary course. But if the ship were a foreigner, and did not return to Australia, it would be beyond our reach, and we could take no action. If the vessel ever returned to Australia, however, there would be full power to collect any damages which might be awarded. </para>

The alternative would be to admit that nobody should be liable; which would be absurd. </para>

If reference to the agent is included in the Act there may be cases of individual hardship, but it would be exceedingly unwise to delete all reference to the agent. If we make the owner alone responsible, how can we hope to secure damages from such an individual when he is resident in a foreign country? Some one in Australia must be responsible. Who else can be but the agent for the vessel? </para>

An agent is appointed to transact the business of a ship while she is in port, and not while she is at sea. The agent completes his business prior to the sailing of the vessel, and presents&#39; all accounts and documents at the Customs House, whereupon the Customs authorities give him an absolute clearance to permit the ship to go to sea. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point at all. Not 50 per cent. of the ships trading with Australia are equipped with wireless. Why does the Minister imagine that a sailing ship may have wireless telegraphic apparatus installed on board? The only way to make such an installation would be practically to turn her into a steamer. What does the Minister consider the cost would amount to in such a case ? I am not prepared to admit that the day of the sailing ship is over yet by a. long way. The agent is in only the same position as a lumper. A lumper goes on board a ship and does his duty there while the ship is in port, and as soon as he has finished his work the stevedoring company by whom he is employed have completed their contract. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose a charter terminates on the delivery of goods, the question arises as to who is to. be responsible under this Bill for damage occurring after the vessel leaves port. The Minister says that he cannot collect from foreign owners, and therefore some one else must be held responsible. We should not leave such a matter to the tender mercies of those administering the law. It is not a question of generous or ungenerous administration, but of a strict interpretation of the letter of the law. </para>

The clause leaves the matter very doubtful, and would permit the Government to claim damages from the owner, the captain, the charterer, or the agent.It makes the owner, agent, and charterer responsible for damage, even though it may not have been wilfully done. </para>

                        <para>- The clause makes an agent or charterer responsible for damage, no matter how it is done. A man may charter a vessel to bring one line of goods. The goods are landed, and when the vessel is leaving port ah accident occurs for which the charterer is in no way responsible, but under the clause he might be held liable for the damage done. I want some assurance from the Minister&#34; that he will accept amendments. I think it is a fair thing to ask the honorable senator to draft an amendment which will make the matter clear. The responsibility under the clause is spread over four different persons, and the person first to be held responsible is not defined. There may be a case in which an owner, a master, an agent, and a charterer will all be interested in a vessel which causes damage to a marine light, and we should know against which of these persons the Department will proceed. </para>

                        <para>- Let me suggest, the mistake which I think the Minister is making. It is a mistake which is frequently made. I venture to say that it will be a very exceptional case in which a foreign-owned vessel will be the cause of damage to our buoys or lighthouses. In the circumstances, why should we try by our legislation to deal with &#39; extraordinary and exceptional cases? To do so is a fundamental mistake. According to the Minister, we have no redress in the case of foreign owners and charterers. I am not at all sure of that, but that is no reason why we should throw the responsibility for damage done upon persons who are in no way responsible. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would make an agent or a charterer criminally responsible for the wilful act of a foreign shipmaster, though their interest in the vessel would have ceased when she left port. Either the Minister has given scant consideration to the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and others, or he is determined to press the Bill through without amendment. The clause exhibits very loose draftsmanship, and there is a real danger to be apprehended in agreeing to it in its present form, merely upon the assumption that it will be rightly administered. After the amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has been disposed of, I intend to move the omission of the word &#34; charterers,&#34; because I hold that if we make the master,&#39; owner, and agent of a vessel responsible for any damage which she may inflict upon our lighthouses or buoys, we shall be going far enough. I object to straining after the impossible. </para>

                    <para>. -  I trust that the Acting Minister for Defence will recognise the wisdom of accepting the amendment &#39;submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn.</inline> In its present form the clause is very involved, and  it  is altogether out of harmony with the draftsmanship of our earlier Commonwealth enactments. It seeks to impose liabilities upon two distinct classes of persons. For instance, a man may be out yachting, and, from sheer wantonness, may destroy a light by means of firearms. Obviously, he would not be the &#39; &#39; master, owner, agent, or charterer of a vessel.&#34; Yet it is manifestly desirable that he should be made liable for the damage which he has done. Why not keep such cases entirely separate from the other cases which are provided for in  the  clause. The Minister will certainly lose  nothing  by accepting the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to the wording of the clause, and I suggest that all the words be struck out except those which will leave the authority for permission to use theRoyalCoat-of-Arms with the Commonwealth Government alone. I have no idea of reflecting upon members of the Royal Family, merely because there may be some shallow suggestion for their having any such authority. I think that, as reasonable, sensible people, living in this twentieth century, the time has  long since gone by when, in the drafting of - legislation, members of the Royal Family should be presumed to possess rights equal to those of the Government. But I want to make it clear, at the same time, that in seeking to have the words struck out, I have no desire to cast any slight on the dignity or the importance of the Royal Family. My contention is x that authority to use! the Royal Coat-of-Arms should be granted by the Government alone. If  His  Majesty the King desired that some firm or company should use the Royal Coat-of-Arms,  he could communicate his wish to the Government, and the permission would, of course, be granted. My chief objection to the clause -is that it follows too closely the antiquated and old-fashioned wording of earlier legislation in Great Britain, when the occupant of the Throne &#39; exercised a  power  which has not been invested in him for a great many years. This  limitation of power has . been an advantage, because the occupant of the Throne has thus been removed from criticism which might have brought the. Throne under ridicule. The real power is in the Parliament in Great Britain, and, whenever&#39;- there has been a test between the two Houses, it has been established that authority rests finally with the House of Commons, as representing the will of the people. Bagehot, a well-known authority on constitutional history, writing about fifty years ago, said that the Government of Great Britain is a republic, disguised as a monarchy. He was not reflecting then on the Royal House of Great Britain, but was merely stating what, to every clear thinker, is an actual fact. Every one realizes that our limited monarchical system is &#39;really a republic disguised as u monarchy, under which the Sovereign is safeguarded from that interference which, in the case of other powerful  monarchs  who sought to impress their will on the laws of their country, often led to the extinction of the Royal Households. But all this is bv the way. I merely want to show how absurd it is to retain antiquated phraseology in legislation in this distant Dominion, where the ideas of the people are all in the direction of absolute  legislative independence. The authority. to use the Royal Coat-of-Arms should rest with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- It is the King&#39;s Coat-of-Arms because the Parliament of England have permitted him to rule. If to-morrow, by resolution of both Houses, the present King were removed from office, the same coat-of-arms would be used by his successor, and, therefore, it is the property of the nation. We have to look at the facts, and I say that, as far as the Commonwealth Government are concerned, they should exercise this judicial power in regard to the use of the coat-of-arms. If State &#39; Governments heretofore have been exercising this authority, I would not take that right from them, but I maintain that in future they should be required to make application to the Commonwealth Government. In a democratic community, the will of the people must prevail; but it may reasonably be argued that something more is required to constitute safe and continuous government, and quite a number of people reason that, the monarchical system, which appeals to the imagination of certain classes, makes for safe, continuous;, and dignified government. I regret that my imagination will not permit me to indorse that view. I prefer to get down to the practical point at issue, and in this  case I maintain that authority for the use of the Royal Coat-of-Arms should be exercised only by the Government. Those ancient phrases appearing in so many British Acts of Parliament have long since lost their meaning. </para>

Little information of a definite character could be secured regarding this directory, and no one seemed to know what authority, if any, had been given the compiler to use the Royal Coat-of-Arms.

This is purely a Trade Marks Bill. There is a Royal crown, and although its use has not been very much abused, some traders are in the habit of using imitations of the Royal crown which very nearly resemble it, and the use of which is intended deliberately to deceive purchasers of their goods, and to lead them to believe that the traders have some Royal warrant. That kind of deception is undesirable. The following is the existing provision dealing with the subject :  - </para>

                <para class="block">That provision is useless, because it is impossible to prove what people believe. Apart from the question of the Royal Arms, it is most unfair that people should be permitted to make use of an imitation for the purpose of deceiving consumers. The use of the Royal Arms was never intended for the sale of a bag of potatoes, a suit of clothes, or a piece of jewellery. Honorable senators are aware that under the letters &#39;&#39;&#34;A.N.A.&#34; articles are sold in this country which are manufactured in enemy countries, and the letters are used to lead consumers to believe that the article sold is of local manufacture.

                    <para>. - I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to give the Senate some information regarding comparatively recent happenings in New South Wales under the Housing Commission. I should not have ventured to occupy the time of honorable senators over a matter which, in a sense, is unimportant, except that there appears to be a prevailing tendency now, the moment any statement is published in the press reflecting upon a public Department, to accept it at its face value without investigation. A good deal of publicity was given to what has been called the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> the  Deputy  Commissioner for New South Wales under the Housing Commission. I wish to place before the Senate facts which will enable honorable senators to decide whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> statement on the subject was correct, and whether that gentleman was, or was not, dismissed from his office. I wish also to give honorable senators some particulars regarding a matter which excited some comment in relation to a contract for the purchase of a certain area of land. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The facts are simply these: <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> announced in the press on the 25th of last month that he had resigned his position as  Deputy  Commissioner because of disgust with the methods under which the War Service Homes Act was being administered, and because of his strong and pronounced determination that the interests of the returned soldiers should not be jeopardized by the administration of his chief. I wish to say, first of all, that no such letter of resignation from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> has ever been received. But what the papers do disclose, supporting the facts I propose to give, is that on the 20th June, five days before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> made any announcement to the press, the Housing Commissioner wrote a letter to him terminating his services. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has a copy of a letter, I understand, from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> these dates will be of interest to him. This letter by the Housing Commissioner was written and dated on the 20th June.  Colonel Walker  told me then of his intention to dispense with the. services of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> and stated that he proposed to go over to Sydney and personally deliver his letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> and install his successor in his place. He did so, and delivered the letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> on the 24th June, a day, honorable senators will notice, before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> intimated to the press the fact of his supposed resignation. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit to honorable senators that for a gentleman who received a notice of dismissal, which he acknowledges in these terms, to next day pretend that he resigned because of disgust with&#39; the methods of administration, is to- make a demand upon their credulity which is not likely to be responded to. I owe an apology to the Senate for bringing these matters up here; but those who read the Sydney press - and, necessarily, as a New South Welshman, I study it somewhat carefully - will have seen that a good dea&#39;l of publicity has&#39; been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> statements and claims. </para>
                <para>I feel it necessary also to make reference to a land transaction, because that, likewise, is not only occupying some of the time of those who discuss public matters over there, but has within it the possible germs of litigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> like all deputies, was empowered under a power of delegation- to purchase land &#39;for the War  Service Homes Act up to&#39; &#163;1,000 in value, without reference to any one. If he thought it desirable to purchase land an&#39; excess of that sunn, he had to remit the matter, with his recommendation, to the Commissioner. The Commissioner himself, by the terms of the Act, can purchase only up to &#163;5,000 worth. If he wishes to purchase in excess of that value, he must seek Ministerial authority. That power of delegation to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> which was given  to him in common with all other deputies, was in these terms, &#39;&#34; To make, sign, and execute contracts for the  acquisition  of lands ,and dwelling houses, to  be  limited to &#163;1,000 for each transaction.&#34; I stress, also, the point that the Commissioner himself has no authority to complete a single contract in excess of &#163;5,000, because it has a bearing on the question. Without any previous communication with this office, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> entered into a contract, duly signed by him, for the purchase of a parcel of land at Bexley, known as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr .Bardwell,</inline> for &#163;25,000. That in itself was greatly in excess of the authority, not only of the  deputy,  but also of has chief, and it was  done without reference to the Commissioner. The first the Commissioner knew of it -was when he received a letter from  the &#39;vending firm, asking him to name the solicitor who would complete the transaction. The Commissioner had not even seen the contract at that time, and it was only on putting the matter into the hands of the Grown Solicitor that we obtained from the vendor a copy, and the full details of the whale transaction were known. Acting on the Grown Solicitor&#39;s advice, we are refusing to acknowledge that contract. It is because we are declining  to  recognise the document as a contract, it having been made by an agent in excess of his authority, and because the vendors still suggest the possibility of .their invoking the aid of the law, that I referred just now to the possibility of litigation. When the Commissioner was made aware that the contract had been signed, he naturally looked into it, and caused certain valuations to he made. One of these &#39; was &#34;by the gentleman .who has been for nine years the valuer of the municipality in  which the   land is situated, and who is also . retained !by the Railways Commissioners for valuations in that district. It may, therefore, be assumed  that  he is a gentleman of both knowledge and reputation. He. values the land at &#163;7,750, and, in addition, affirms .that in no circumstances ought this land to be purchased, because of its unsuitability for the purpose for which the Housing Commissioner would want it. In addition, the Department of -the Valuer-General was applied to. New South Wales has created a Department, the purpose of which is to value all the lands of the&#39; State, and those valuations, becoming a public record, are .available for municipal, State, or other purposes, and would also form the basis of resumption should the State at (any time desire to acquire any parcel of land. That Department puts the  value  of this land at &#163;6,225. In . view of the publicity &#39;given to the matter, the Commissioner also directed his officers in Sydney &#39;to invite representatives of the Returned Soldiers&#39; League&#39;, and the secretary of the Soldiers and Citizens&#39; Political party, to accompany the.  Deputy  on a visit of inspection to the land. One of those gentlemen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis,</inline> happened to be a licensed surveyor. </para>

                <para>I feel that I am under some obligation to go a little further in this matter. When an officer exceeds his duty in entering into negotiations, and shows himself willing to pay &#163;25,000 for a property which is valued by independent and non-interested parties at from &#163;6,225 to &#163;7,750, I am entitled to say that he has to answer the charge of being either a fool or a rogue. I shall leave the Senate and the country to make their own selection, but I am not prepared to believe that any competent officer actuated by <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> motives could ever have made that deal. I have gone into the matter a little more thoroughly, because of the tendency, to which I have referred, On the part of many to assume at once,, when some one makes a complaint against the Department, that the Department is animated by foolish or worse motives. I felt justified, therefore, in investigating this matter thoroughly, and ascertaining who composed the firm with whom this transaction was made. It is the firm of Myers and Company. That, in itself, was merely an indication, and we looked then to see who composed the firm itself. My information, which comes from authoritative sources, is that one of the members of the firm- and here, no doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> will be interested - is a gentleman known as Earle Hermann, who has obtained a reputation of some kind or other as a company promoter. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure the valuation will rather confirm the two others I have mentioned than the price which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> agreed to pay. Having put these facts before the Senate, I am confident that the decision will be that, in this case, it was not the local officer - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> - who was right, but the central authority -  Colonel Walker  - who was justified in declining to proceed with the transaction. A great deal has been said on the other side about that action having been taken because of the &#34;pernicious Melbourne influence.&#34; I have gibed a bit myself at the tendency to centralize, but in this case the centralization justified itself. If it had not been for the central authority having the right to veto that transaction, certain soldiers would have been saddled with a debt of &#163;25,000 for land which is worth about &#163;6,000 to them; because under the terms of the War Service Homes Act the money which the Commissioner spends in buying land or erecting houses does not ultimately come out of the Consolidated Revenue, but is charged to the soldier. If the Commissioner pays an unduly high price for any parcel of land, he cannot leave portion of that excess at the Treasury door, but must charge it to the soldier who occupies the land. The effect would have been, but for the interposition of the central authority, that a soldier would have been called upon to pay three times the value of the land if ever he desired to occupy a holding thereon. </para>

                <para>An effort has also been made in regard to the transaction at Lithgow to assume that the tendency to centralize everything in Melbourne is at fault. There is not the slightest objection to taking all the help that the Sydney Town Planning Association or any other body is willing to render. Not long ago the Commissioner sent out circular directions to his deputies specially stressing the fact that they were to court and seek that cooperation. But the moment this offer was suspended from Melbourne it was stupidly assumed that it was because of some Melbourne prejudice against the utilization of the services of a body existing in New South Wales. The facts are simply these: The Commissioner is bound to charge to the soldiers any cost to which he is put in preparing land for their settlement. When a block of land is offered to him, he is bound before he&#39; accepts it, or any obligation in regard to it, to see that the soldiers will ultimately get a square deal out of the transaction In this case 35 acres was offered by a gentleman at Lithgow, with the.&#39; stipulation that the Town Planning Association of New South Wales should have the task of laying it out.  Colonel Walker  and myself have shared a good measure of abuse because that offer was not immediately and blindly accepted. Before it can be accepted the simple duty rests on the Commissioner of seeing that he gets something which will represent value, because the soldiers will ultimately have to pay for it. It may be said, &#34; Well, the land is costing you nothing, and, therefore, you need not look a gift horse in the month.&#34; But, in this case, we have to see what the gift carries with it. There are 35 acres there, and I do not pretend to know what it will cost to put that land in the condition in which the municipality will he prepared to take it over. I have had experience of cases in which it has cost as much as &#163;400 an acre. Assuming that the cost in this case would be much less than that, the Commissioner has to consider whether, when that expenditure has been incurred, the land will be cheap or dear. I do not presume to say what it will be. But I do say that the Commissioner ought not to accept it until he has satisfied himself on these points. Then there are questions relating to light, sewerage, and water facilities. </para>

                        <para>- Not very far from the railway station. It is very low -lying land - so low-lying that not long since the owner obtained &#163;1,500 compensation from the municipality because its sewerage works had flooded the area. It is even now liable to inundation after heavy rain. It is necessary, therefore, that the Housing Commissioner should ascertain what it will cost to put ordinary town facilities there - facilities such as those of water, gas, and sewerage - and also to determine whether the authorities who control these public utilities are willing to extend them to this area. The Commissioner is also acting wisely in seeking to learn whether the municipality will be prepared to take over the land when all these facilities have been provided. It is possible that inquiries may show that the gift is an excellent one. But the Commissioner would have been criminally foolish had he taken over the land before making these inquiries, and before ascertaining that he would be in a position to offer land to the soldiers on that block upon quite as advantageous terms as he could acquire it elsewhere. I need scarcely remind honorable senators that the Commissioner is not given power to solve the housing problem of this country. Many persons appear to think that his job is to build houses anywhere. But the authority which is conferred upon him under the Act is to build homes for soldiers. It necessarily follows that he is not entitled to build more houses than they will require, or more than they are likely to require, in a particular locality. &#39; The 35 acres in question will cut up into about 250 homes. The Commissioner, therefore, before incurring the expenditure that will be inevitable in preparing this land for soldiers, is bound to ask himself,  &#39; How many applications am I likely to receive for homes in this locality?&#34; At the present time, there are only two applications in from Lithgow. I have no doubt that we shall get many more. But even if we receive a large number of applications from Lithgow, it does not follow that every soldier will be content to have his home established on this particular block. For various reasons many will desire to select other localities near the township. Consequently, the difficulty of determining what area the Commissioner shall prepare for the settlement of soldiers in this particular locality is no light one. If he took over the 35 acres and spent the money necessary to prepare it for 250 homes and it subsequently transpired that there were only 100 applicants for it, the entire cost or the lay-out would be charged to those applicants. In this connexion it must be remembered that what might be a fair charge in the case of 250 applicants would be an excessive charge in the case of 100 applicants. It would, therefore, be entirely wrong for the Commissioner to allow himself to be stampeded by popular clamour into accepting the gift of a block of land without first knowing what all these conditions will be. In the present case he is taking the necessary steps to ascertain how far the land will suit his purpose, and to what extent the expenditure attendant upon the acceptance of it would prove advantageous to &#39;the soldiers who might be settled upon it. Should his inquiries show that the cost will be a moderate one, undoubtedly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> offer will be accepted, and the New South Wales Town Planning Organization may have the business of directing the lay-out. </para>

                        <para>- It is open to anybody. I have never shut my door to anybody who comes on departmental business. Of course, I do not deal with individual cases; but, in matters of- this sort. I have always endeavoured to give an interview to the principals. I have put these matters before  the Senate so that honorable senators may understand that the Department has not acted without forethought - and in this case, I think, with commendable forethought. I trust that the public will .understand that neither I nor  Colonel Walker  can possibly have any wish to obtain for our soldiers anything save the best that is going. But we should be inflicting a hardship upon them if we did not look before we leaped, and, if by not doing so, we placed upon their&#39; shoulders a burden which it was unnecessary for them to carry. I submit that I have made out a clear case in answer to the criticisms of those who are so ready to believe every statement which is made outside, and I hope that in future they will at least hold their peace until they have ascertained whether the Department has anything to say in reply to such statements. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened carefully to the statement just made by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator. Millen).</inline> I am surprised beyond imagination at the attitude which he has adopted.  His  statement justifying the dismissal of a certain officer bristles with direct attacks, not only upon that officer, but upon other gentlemen whom I do not know. I am always suspicious of statements which depend for their justification upon the abuse of individuals. In this chamber I had occasion to refer a little while ago to the refusal of the Government to accept this gift of 35 acres at Lithgow. When I did, so, I had in my mind the fact that a handsome gift had been offered bv Mr.&#39; Brown, of Lithgow, in the form of a valuable town property there. I am even satisfied now that, so far as the Government are concerned, they have no intention of accepting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> offer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining of the Minister acting promptly and decisively, but I am complaining of the manner in which he acted. So far as nipping in the &#39;bud questionable land transactions is concerned, the honorable gentleman will receive cordial support from me. He knows that the very moment the War Service (Homes) Bill was submitted to this Chamber, I emphasized the desirableness of appointing to administer it men who would be well paid for their services. What I am complaining of is that the Minister turned the Ministerial statement into an attack upon others, and that, to my mind, does not do the Minister justice. </para>

I am not claiming that he should be held personally responsible for anything that any of his officers may do that is not within the law or honorable; but, as head of the Repatriation Department, he cannot shift his responsibility, and he has no right to attempt to do so. </para>

                <para>Let us deal with this matter coldly, and without any feeling. If a wrong has been done by an officer of his Department, does it make the Minister&#39;s case any stronger merely to show that an officer made a bad bargain with a company the members of which are not known too favorably because of their company-promoting proclivities? What sort of a bargain was it? </para>

As a matter of fact, I get very little chance of saying what I want to say in this chamber, I am so fully occupied answering interjections. The Government would have done better if they had laid these charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> before he was discharged from the Public Service, because, no matter how complete an accusation may appear to be, when looked at from on&#169; side only, there is usually another side. In this business the Government have acted in a manner calculated to bring them into disrepute. If the Minister&#39;s statements regarding the value of the land are right, well and good; but the Minister appeared to have been quoting opinions which are contrary to fact. </para>

The same conditions may hold good at Bexley, or the cost may be more; but the Minister has made a grave mistake in the viciousness with which he stated his case. Smarting under press and other attacks, he is not only trying to make good his own case, but to make that of those whom he is fighting bad. </para>

                    <para>.- We should be glad that this exposure has followed so promptly upon the great outcry arising from the discharge of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans. Senator Gardiner,</inline> however, instead of complimenting the Minister, has criticised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the whole subject, and he has admitted knowing nothing about it. It is becoming his constant practice to talk and talk, without knowing anything about the business he is endeavouring to discuss. Evidently, too, he is prepared to do the same outside this chamber. He states that he defended me against a charge for which there was no foundation. He tried to justify something which I did not do - of which I was not guilty - and he did so in the name of friendship, or so he says. Rather, it was in order to talk. We are getting so &#34; full up &#34; of his talking here that it is surprising that we should put up with it.  His  voice is the first we hear when the Senate meets, and the last we hear before we adjourn. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator gave us to understand that he had defended me while he was under the impression that I had land there - that he had defended me for having done something which would have been a perfectly proper thing to do. &#39; The facts are, if honorable senators care to hear them, that I have a son on the land, who had been there for years. &#34;While seeking land in Western &#34;Australia he applied in the usual way through the Lands Office, and secured land on the transcontinental line. He is not the only Federal member&#39;s son who has done so; nor am I the only Federal member whose name has been connected with land along that railway. When my sou was seeking land he had not a single acre, although he has been on the land ever since, and is now making a success as the outcome of his efforts. He secured that land along the line, and subsequently examined it, but be found it unsuitable for his purposes, and, therefore, abandoned it. So general was that abandonment that every one who applied and took up territory there abandoned the whole area. It was found quite unsuitable for agriculture, and not nearly so good as had been supposed. My son had simply applied for land on which to make a living, and when he ascertained that it was not .suitable, he bought land elsewhere, and is living on it to-day. Even if I had taken up land along the railway I would have been quite entitled to do so. It was competent for me to apply in the usual way. One fault which <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> have to find with honorable senators opposite is that they are not sufficiently plucky to go and try the same thing. If they did so they would learn a great deal more about the hardships of the man on the land than they evidently know to-day. They would also be able to put their money into an honest endeavour to help to develop Australia. Such a course would give .them sense; they would not continue to indulge, in nonsense about land taxation. They would know how hard is the lot of the man who goes right out hack, as did my son.- When he and his partner - two young lads straight from Dookie Agricultural College - had obtained a team of horses, they loaded all they possibly could on to their vehicle, and took up an agricultural area , 80 miles from the railway. They played the manly part, and endured the hard life of the pioneer. More adverse comment could not have been made had I secured him a parasitical and easy billet in the .Public Service. I regret that I should be obliged to give particulars of this private business, but I had no option except to defend myself. It is disgraceful that such matters should have been brought into the light at all. </para>

                        <para>- On. a point of order, I call attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is insinuating that I said something against him and his son. It is fair that I should state that the honorable senator asked me why I was taking up a certain attitude in defending some one; and I replied that previously I had defended him against charges levelled by the same party. The charges  to which I referred had to do with maps which the Liberal party had issued, charging him with having taken up land under conditions which suggested that he possessed foreknowledge regarding where the transcontinental railway was to be laid. I defended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and I certainly did not insinuate anything against him. I object, therefore, to his saying now that I have said anything of such a nature regarding him. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw any insinuation of the kind in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remarks, but I want to emphasize that the date on which my son&#39;s land .was taken up along the transcontinental line was about two years after the survey had been made. At that stage any one &#39; could easily have ascertained the projected route of the railway. Indeed, years before that there was a general knowledge concerning the route. It was no secret. That land had been lying- unusued  for countless generations, and is still &#39; waiting for some one to take it up and use it. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not correct in his remarks regarding .what the newspapers stated -about the matter. </para>

                <para>Reverting to the subject originally under discussion, the Senate ought to be well satisfied, considering that Australia is just setting out upon a very big scheme for housing her. returned soldiers. It was, in fact, most fortunate that&#39; at such an early stage the Minister for Repatriation should have dropped upon what was apparently a &#34;job &#34; or a blunder. But who is going to pay for such blunders ? Who but the very soldiers for whom we want to do everything possible. Instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> disputing with the Minister and talking generally as he has done against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> he. should have been the first to compliment him. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to the Bexley Estate transaction, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> has been involved. I hold no brief for that gentleman, but I have known him for fifteen years, and I cannot agree with the remarks of the Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> is either a rogue or a fool. T know that he is no fool. I have never known him to do a dishonest action, nor have I ever known him to do anything calculated to harm anybody. It is only right that I should make such a statement, when this man has been attacked in his absence. I am not taking the stand that he should not be dismissed if he has done something in opposition to the terms of the Act under which he was working; but the Minister has made a statement by which, if. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> does not get a chance to reply, his future will be damned. Not only that, but the reputation of his wife and family will be damaged. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was called upon to explain, the whole situation should have been placed before him in just as strong language as the Minister has used to-day, so that he could have put before the public his side of the question. I have never heard a stronger statement made against any citizen than that which has been uttered by the Minister &#34;to-day. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> statement, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> said that he had discharged his duty to the members of the Senate. The honorable senator has another duty to discharge, and that is to at once give <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> a chance before an impartial tribunal to put his side of the transaction. Surely we cannot, in this Senate, constitute ourselves judge, jury, and executioner of any man. I do not know whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> signed the document agreeing to pay so many thousands of pounds for land which the Minister has stated, on the evidence of other people, is worth so much less. </para>

I do not indulge in the cynical remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is guilty of, and has been guilty of many a time before, in this chamber. I am appealing now for ordinary justice for a man. No member of the Senate would .like to be accused without having a chance to reply to his accusers, &#39; and put his side of the matter. Are we, because we are elected members of the Senate, to put ourselves in the position of judge, jury, and executioner in one? I say that we are not. I know nothing of this transaction, but I do&#39; know <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> and I appeal to the Minister for Repatriation, who has made a statement which is going to damn <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> future, to give him a chance before an impartial tribunal to put his side of the. case. In asking that, I ask merely for simple justice. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not desire to take up the time of the Senate unnecessarily at this hour. I  have been anxious during the last two or three days to bring certain matters under the notice of the Government, but so large an amount of the time of the Senate has been occupied during those days by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that no other honorable senator has been able to get a word in edgeways. In spite of &#39;the hour, therefore, I must bring under the notice of the Minister one or two matters which are of importance to the State I represent. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that there are members of the Senate who represent States other than New South Wales. The honorable senators from that State have monopolized the time of the Senate, and have held the floor in this chamber, during the last four days. </para>

                <para>We are adjourning early to-day in order that we may take part in the celebration of the great victory over Germany and her Allies. I had on the notice-paper for to-day a question as to the intentions of the Government with regard to many members of the Australian Imperial Force who are at present undergoing terms of imprisonment for crimes committed during their service with the Forces. If the Leader of the Senate can make some announcement as to the action the Government propose to take in these cases, and that it is their intention either to remit the sentences altogether or to very considerably reduce them, many people in Australia will be able to take part in the Peace celebrations with far lighter hearts than they will otherwise have, We know that in certain circumstances men will commit crimes which under military law are regarded as serious, though they were committed on the spur of the moment and under abnormal conditions, and which they would probably never commit in their ordinary civilian life. Now that the safety of the Empire is set beyond doubt, and that we and our Allies have emerged victorious from the war, the Government might, as a Peace offering,  seriously consider the advisability of releasing all the Australian Imperial Force prisoners now undergoing sentences. </para>

The whole of Australia and our Allies will be rejoicing in the fact that we have come out of the great struggle triumphant, and I appeal to the Government, in connexion with the celebration of Peace, to see whether something cannot be done which will bring peace into homes in which there is now much suffering because members of the family are undergoing imprisonment for offences committed during the time they were in the Australian. Imperial Force. From my own short experience in the Forces, I know that many men, probably because they were unused to discipline, or because they had men over them who in some cases were disposed to treat them like dogs, did things which they would never have thought of doing in civilian life. </para>

                <para>There is one other matter which I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation in connexion with the administration of the War Service Homes Act. When the Bill was under consideration in the Senate, the Minister stated that it was intended to work in co-operation with the State Savings Banks for the advancement of moneys, and with State Departments in connexion with surveying and other matters necessary to be dealt with under the Bill. During the last few weeks we have seen statements in the local press to the effect that the Government do not now intend to co-operate with the State Savings Banks in the way previously suggested, and that the financing of the housing scheme is to be carried out by the Common wealth Bank. During the time the Bill was under consideration, I believe that Senators Guthrie and Crawford joined with me in asking the Minister for Repatriation why the Commonwealth Bank should not undertake this work in the first instance. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the Minister&#39;s interjection, I shall not further allude to the matter. I should, however, like to know whether it is the intention of the Government to create fresh departments for carrying out the work of survey and inspection under the War Service Homes Act, or whether the State Departments will be utilized for that purpose, and so prevent unnecessary expenditure? In every State there is an army of public servants whose services might be availed of for this purpose. In Victoria, there are such men employed in connexion with the Credit Foncier, and in Queensland with the workmen&#39;s dwellings grant. Although the negotiations with the State Savings Banks for financial operations under the Bill have fallen through, I hope that the Minister for Repatriation does not intend to allow the negotiations for utilizing the services of other State Departments to fall through in the same way. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not intend to say anything on the motion for the adjournment, but as the Minister for Repatriation has been good enough to mention my name in connexion with one of these speculations, I wish to say that I know nothing whatever about the matter, or about the gentleman referred to. I believe that he is waiting for me with a club. When the War Service Homes Bill was under consideration, I pointed out that trouble would arise through giving the Commissioner too much power in the appointment of his staff. Some honorable senators advocated that appointments should be left in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner, and if that course had been followed we would not have been required to consider, as we have been today, the appointment to an important position of a gentleman who, apparently, was not fitted to fill it. </para>

                <para>I wish to make an appeal to the Government on behalf of the mothers and fathers of the boys who were punished for a little indiscretion on board the H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> I asked last week that the Government might do something in the matter. The Minister for Repatriation promised to place the matter before the proper authority. I suppose that he has done so ; but the time is fast approaching when the joy-bells will be ringing in celebration of Peace, and I am anxious to know if anything is to be done on behalf of these people. The boys who have been so severely dealt with were guilty of a simple indiscretion, and it should not be forgotten that they responded to the call of duty in the raid upon Zeebrugge, though they knew that there was only a hundred to one chance that they would ever come back. One of them won distinction for courageous conduct&#39;; and yet, for a little indiscretion at Fremantle, he is in gaol to-day. I appeal on behalf of the fathers and mothers of these boys, who live not far from me, and who are to-day broken-hearted over this affair, for some consideration of their case. I do not suppose there is an honorable senator in this chamber, or a single person in this country, who, if his life&#39;s history were written, would not like to have one or two pages of it gummed down and hidden from the public gaze. I again appeal to the Government that when the joy-bells ring out they should bring joy to the homes of the fathers and mothers of these boys. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know what the Government desire to. do, but I do not think that I should be called upon to forego my opportunity to reply to certain statements that were made here to-day. I must enter my protest against the manner in which the Senate is being treated at the present time. When on Friday afternoon honorable senators from South Australia have to catch a train at 4.30 o&#39;clock, they have sometimes very little consideration shown to them by honorable senators who are remaining in Melbourne. To-day I am in the happy position that it is not necessary for me to catch a train at 4.30 o&#39;clock, and I should like to give some of those honorable senators a taste of their own physic. We should be given an opportunity to reply to some of the statements which were made here to-day. I want to say that I commend the Minister for Repatriation for the statement which he made. It was made in the calmest possible manner, and in a way that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> had he been here, could not possibly have taken exception to. That statement has been characterized by the Leader of the&#39; Opposition as a savage statement. There is no man in Australia to-day who makes such savage statements and charges against the Government as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> We were told here only last week that he had said at a public meeting that the members of &#39; the Federal Cabinet should be hanged - one each week. If, that is not calculated to arouse feelings of resentment and rebellion in the minds of the people, L do not know what is. He also said last week that members of the Senate, sitting .behind the Government were not fit to be members of the British Empire. This was after he had spent the whole afternoon in defending the traitors who are in internment camps in Australia. Only a few months ago, when the Government, compelled by necessity, undertook to secure land at Leichhardt for the erection of Ordnance Stores, honorable senators opposite called the Government everything. They said the people of Sydney were almost in open rebellion against the acquisition of that land. The Public Works Committee went over there, and I tried my hardest to find one man who had a word to say against it in Sydney, but I could not find one. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should take the same interest in the re3t of the people as he does in Commonwealth employees. I do. We were told in evidence at Lithgow that single men were living eight and ten in a room, and that that part of the population which could get no accommodation was living on the outskirts of the town in humpies not fit for a blackfellow. Where does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> generosity come in? That piece of land is lying there, and is, I believe, of very little use. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> were the generous citizen he pretends to be, he should have built cottages on this swamp for the people who cannot find homes in Lithgow. Whatever action the Government take the Opposition find fault. If the Government do not detect a. crime before it is committed they are condemned. If they denounce a crime after it is committed they are condemned. I tell honorable members of the Opposition that their conduct for the last few months is not raising the tone of this Parliament to any extent, and is not making this Parliament popular with the people. No intelligent person can show from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records of the work of the Senate since we  met on this occasion any instance in which the Opposition has done one tap to assist the Government, good, had, or indifferent, in the legislation of this country. It is time that kind of thing was put a stop to. It is time the Government took advantage of their position, and saw that the business was proceeded with in a proper manner. </para>

                    <para>. - A few facts stand out most conspicuously in connexion with the War Service Homes Act. The measure was passed with the almost unanimous consent of both Houses of Parliament nearly seven months ago.  The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> was given full authority. No restriction was placed on him. He had the right to engage whomever die desired, in order that at to be earliest opportunity the homes so urgently required by returned soldiers &#39;should be provided. He cannot point to-day to one house anywhere in Australia erected under that Act. That fact alone is the strongest possible condemnation, not of the action, but of the inaction, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If that measure had been placed under the administration of a competent firm of contractors, and funds made available to them as they have been to the Minister foa- Repatriation, houses would have been up by the thousands throughout the States in far less than six months. I am forced, reluctantly, to the conclusion that the. Government are determined to waste time. and to do nothing in the way of erecting houses. Had they been honest or determined, they have had ample opportunity to have at least some houses under way inside the seven months that have passed since the Bill went through. The conclusion is irresistibly forced upon me that the Government are determined, for some reason of their awn which has not been disclosed, to do nothing whatever in the way of providing accommodation for the returning men. It is quite true that it is not the function of the Commissioner to provide homes for other than returned soldiers. But when the men return, unless these houses are available for them, they must occupy some other premises. To Hie extent to which the Commissioner erects houses for them, other people will be able to secure more accommodation than they now have. The Minister should get a move on, and see that some &#39;houses are put up in at least some of the .States. I was speaking recently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Ryan, M.L.C., of Lithgow, who has taken a keen interest in this proposal, and on whose word we can rely. I have not seen the land in question, but it is a short distance past the Lithgow railway station, on the right-hand side of the line. This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> writes to me - </para>

                    <para>The land was given free by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> L. Brown in response to the request of the local repatriation executive, as represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chas.</inline> Stewart, honorary secretary. It was unanimously accepted by the executive, and subsequently the  Deputy  Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans.</inline> Every one here who knows the land regards the gift as a generous one, and well suited to meet the housing needs of thesoldiers. </para>
                    <para>The value of the land has been roughly estimated at from &#163;1,500 to &#163;2,000. Personally, I have no doubt that if a speculator got it at the former price, cut it up., and sold by allotments, he would realize anything up to a couple of thousand on his bargain. </para>
                    <para>The condition attaching to the gift - that the whole lay-out be in charge of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales - seems reasonable to us. It would involve neither expense nor delay; whereas the central authority in Melbourne would not, perhaps, be able to complete the work for throe months. </para>
                    <para>There are about a thousand returned soldiers in the area controlled by the Local Committee, that is, the Lithgow Municipality and Blaxland Shire. Of these,- it may -be estimated that about GOO live and work in Lithgow. </para>
                    <para>Up to date, eighty applications have be&#233;n received by the local executive from soldiers and others eligible under the Act who desire to secure homes. But the flow of applications has ceased during the last couple of weeks owing to the block interposed by the authority in Melbourne. </para>
                    <para>No one in Lithgow doubts that the gift was a good one, which should have been promptly accepted. Personally, I regard the action of the Department as a classical example of the evil of centralized administration. Not only has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> gift been turned down, but also the advice of the local executive, who have no interest except to secure the soldiers&#39; welfare. </para>
                    <para>The local executive has invited the Minister to visit Lithgow, believing that he could settle the whole business in an. hour or two. It is inconceivable that any man whose common sense has not deserted him could reject such an offer on the flimsiest of grounds. </para>

                <para class="block">We are told by the Minister, who would give us to understand that he is supplied with the latest information on the subject, that up to date only two applications have been received from eligible people for housing accommodation at Lithgow. That may be the Minister&#39;s latest advice on the subject,  but  I have just read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan&#39;s</inline> statement, and every one who knows him can thoroughly rely on him, that up to the time he wrote  eighty applications had been received from&#34; eligible people. Not only that, but,  through,  this gift having been held in abeyance, the flow of applications has ceased during&#39; the past few weeks. We may safely conclude that if the gift had been- at Once accepted; at least 100 applications would now be in hand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Newland</inline> has- told of the existing housing conditions at Lithgow, and, from what I know of the land there, an offer of land worth, apparently, about &#163;2,000 ought not to be lightly turned down by the Minister. I agree with him, however, that the gift ought to be made unconditionally, although I am not opposed to the Town Planning Association laying out places. I am further informed that the land on the western and eastern sides of the block is already built on ; that the northern side is bounded by a creek, and the south .by the railway; so that the statement that this block of land is portion of a much larger area can hardly be correct. In view of the acute shortage of houses at Lithgow, this offer ought to have the immediate attention of the Government. If it can be accepted, it should be accepted without delay. I wish, also, to place upon record a statement which I understand has been furnished <inline font-style="italic">uy</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Major</inline> Evans to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline><inline font-style="italic">Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and in which he puts the facts connected with his retirement from the Repatriation Department from his own viewpoint. He has personally assured me that he handed in his resignation to  Colonel Walker,  and that  Colonel Walker  afterwards gave him notice of dismissal. If that be so, it puts quite a different complexion on the position from that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Millen.</inline> In regard to the valuations placed upon the land at Bexley, while I am inclined to accept the valuations of the- State valuers, and while I am also- disposed&#39; to give credence to valuations made by the local governing authorities-, I have learned from long experience that the appraisements of land around Sydney are notoriously low.&#39; It is only when an attempt is made to purchase such lands that one realizes what the vendors really ask foc them. Only the- other day a lady whose land had been valued&#39; year after year at &#163;100 per acre, had- her valuation increased, as the result of a re-appraisement, to &#163;200 per acre, and upon appeal, this amount was reduced to &#163;190 per acre. It is not wise, therefore, to place too much reliance on the valuations made either by&#39; the local councils or by the valuers appointed under the State Land Valuation. Act. </para>

                <para>The- question of the recent purchase of the Mount Bardwell estate, near Bexley, by the War Service Homes Commission has been raised in certain, quarters.- </para>
                <para>Let me state; at the outset,, that this matter had neither a direct or indirect bearing, on my retirement from the position of  Deputy  Commissioner of this State. I court the fullest official scrutiny into the circumstances of this transaction. </para>
                <para>The estate in question, situated within the 5-miles radius of the Central Railway Station, about 700 yards distant from the Bexley tram, about three-quarters of a mile from Banksia Railway Station, about 2 miles from Brighton-le-Sands, occupies an elevated plateau,, running, northerly from the Salvation Army Boys&#39; Home, and contains 31,000 feet of selling frontage. The old Mount Bardwell homestead - a fine stone residence, containing, eleven rooms, outhouses, stables, and orchards, occupied by the owner - forms part of the estate. Official instructions were issued from Melbourne that, in the purchase of estates- for soldiers&#39; homes, areas containing, approximately 100 acres elevated, capable of- drainage, &#38;c, at valuations, wherever possible, at  about  30s. per foot, should govern all land purchases. This estate conforms in- every detail with these requirements. The original offers of the estate were made to  Colonel Walker,  in Melbourne, on 27th February last and 3rd March, for &#163;31,000. The area in question had been previously inspected by  Colonel Walker,  and I was urged by the Commissioner, at the end of April, to push the matter through. On 25th March, the vendors were advised by Commissioner Walker that the matter would be dealt with by the  Deputy  Commissioner when appointed. After protracted negotiations, an offer was made by me, on 10th June last, of &#163;25,000 (&#163;6,000 below original offer), being at the rate of 16s. per foot of saleable frontage (with the homestead, valued at &#163;1,500, and four reserves for recreation thrown in). This was accepted, on the 21st, by the vendors - the contract of sale was completed on 24th inst. I might mention <inline font-style="italic">en passant</inline> that sales on this estate have been actually effected, and this is easily verified, at prices ranging from 35s. to &#163;6 per foot. Good building material - blue and white metal (for road construction and &#34;aggregates&#34;) - are available on the spot; six substantial cottages were recently erected on the estate without any difficulty or additional cost in their construction. They are all tenanted by their respective owners, with water mains on the ground. The Hawkesbury sandstone formation is strongly in evidence at Bexley, Bellevue Hill,&#39; North &#34;Sydney, Bronte, Vauclusc, Lane Cove, &#38;c, and naturally one must expect to find a certain percentage of precipitous ground included in an area of 125 acres. The difficulties presented from a builders&#39; stand-point have hitherto been overcome in the popular suburbs referred to. Messrs. Griffin and Harrison, well-known civil engineers, sworn valuers, and licensed surveyors of the city, designed the estate, and possess a high opinion of its value. </para>
                <para>Regarding access. - The Salvation Army Home, the various occupiers of residences on the plateau, were evidently not greatly dismayed by the temporary difficulty of access (if it may be regarded as such) when deciding to erect houses. The suggested grades for avenues of access, from an engineering standpoint, offer no serious difficulty. I need only mention that portion of King-street, City, possesses a grade of 1 in 10. </para>
                <para>The difficulty in accepting local-authority valuation as a basis for negotiation is universally recognised amongst valuators and real-estate people. One has only to instance the Clontarf lands (owned by the Sydney Ferries Company), valued for taxation purposes at &#163;11,200 - which, after negotiation for its acquisition as park lands had failed, were subsequently put on the market recently - half of the estate only realized something in the neighbourhood of &#163;30,000. </para>

                <para>It must be remembered that in Sydney alone there are applications for about 3,000 homes. But despite that fact, not a single home has so far been erected. Of course, it is obvious that if the Government erect a large number of houses around Sydney, they will seriously interfere with the enormous rents which landlords are extracting from their tenants. That is the reason why the Government are not vigorously pushing forward the housing scheme for soldiers. I ask Ministers to recognise that our returned soldiers must be provided with homes, and to proceed vigorously with that scheme. I am told on very good authority - indeed, the statement has been published broadcast in the press - that only the other day the timber merchants of Sydney held a caucus meeting, at which they resolved that after the following Monday the price of timber should be advanced 3s. per 100 super feet. I am also assured that before Christmas the price is to be still further advanced by 6s. per 100 super. feet. These are matters with which the Government ought to deal. It is not fair to foist upon our returned soldiers houses the purchase of which will subject them to such charges. The Government should obtain all the Oregon that they require for building purposes direct from America. In view of the large number of homes which will be erected within the metropolitan areas under the &#34;War Service Homes Act, Ministers should  take steps to erect brickworks of their own, and to equip them with the latest labour-saving appliances. If they do that I am satisfied they will save our soldiers many thousands of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to enlarge upon the question of Canberra at the present time, but I say without hesitation that if any private firm owned the lands which we possess there, together with the Commonwealth brickworks which have been established there, thousands of our returned soldiers would have been settled in the locality long ago. The reason they have not been so settled is because the Government are afraid of vested interests. </para>

                <para>I enter my protest against the unreasonable delay which has taken place in the Defence Department in the matter of providing some of these returned men with artificial arms. I brought under notice the case of one young man who wanted to be equipped with a Carnes arm, at a cost of about  &#163;50.  A very great deal of correspondence has passed in connexion with this matter, but so far nothing has been done, so I appeal to the Acting Minister for Defence to see that this young man&#39;s requirements are met. He was one of those lads who heard the call, and went overseas to fight for his country, and he has come back without an arm. It is scandalous that he should be making application month after month in vain. </para>

                <para>I am informed that a number of native-born Australians who were in Great Britain when war broke out desired at that time to enlist in some Australian corps, but were informed by the authorities in the High Commissioner&#39;s. Office that this course was impracticable. They were advised to join up in a regiment composed of overseas men, but for a long time they declined to do so, and though they could have come back to Australia to join up in this country, the difficulties in securing passports were almost insurmountable, with the result that some of the men joined the British Forces. They feel that, as native-born Australians, they should be entitled to the Australian rate of pay. I ask the Acting Minister for Defence to look into this matter, and see if it is not possible to accede to their request as part of Australia&#39;s Peace offering during the forthcoming celebrations. A number of British reservists who were in Australia when war broke out joined up in the Commonwealth at the Australian rate of pay, and they are being repatriated to Great Britain, still on the Commonwealth pay-rolls. Those native-born Australians who joined up with the British Forces are fully entitled to the Australian rates of pay, and I hope the Minister will give this matter favorable consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Very few. Honorable senators know that it had to be put through in one sitting. The opportunity for debating the Ministerial statement of Government policy has not been afforded to honorable senators ; we are sitting only for a couple of days a week. Does not the Leader of the Senate realize the responsibility of the Government to  see that the business of the country is proceeded with ? Very often a free discussion of the various matters indicated in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, or, as in this case, the Ministerial statement, is regarded&#39; as a waste of time; but, as a matter of fact, it not infrequently happens that such a debate proves most valuable. I know that frequently the drafting of Bills has been largely influenced by the attitude of speakers in that debate. </para>

It will not be long before the other House will expire by effluxion of time, and some honorable senators will also be required to go before their constituents &#34;next year. But there is still a great programme of measures to be dealt with. We have been told that we are to have a Customs Tariff debate. </para>

                    <para>. - At this stage I do not want to take up much of the time of the Senate. The statements made by honorable senators will receive careful attention. With regard to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> concerning the progress of business, I am inclined to think that, when we get to the measures to be submitted by the Government, he will be sorry he spoke. The programme outlined for this session has been delayed somewhat by the motion of no-confidence in another place. Before Christmas I think the honorable senator will be crying for mercy, and not looking for work. It is the intention of the Government, at any rate, that that shall be the case. I ask leave to withdraw the motion, which, if it were agreed to, would involve the sitting of this Chamber &#39;to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>. - I oppose the motion, especially after having listened to such speeches as those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> They object to such a long adjournment, and, at the same time, condemn honorable senators on this side for interfering with the business of the country. I had made arrangements to be in Melbourne next week, and I am not going to Sydney to-night. It makes no difference that I am in a position to go home any day next week. I realize, of course, that I am differently placed from honorable senators representing Tasmania. The accusation that we are delaying the business of the country is without foundation. When an honorable senator sees fit to stand with his back against the other side of the door of this chamber, and will not enter the Senate in order to help form a quorum, he ought to be the last to complain about interference with business. I never saw such a disgraceful thing in my life as last night&#39;s occurrence. </para>

If the Government had any business to place before us, would they not be here to-morrow and on Tuesday and Wednesday next? The very fact that the Government have asked us to adjourn until the end of this month is an admission that they have no business.

I ask the Minister if he will intimate the nature of the business likely to be placed before us when the Senate reassembles, so that, in the meantime, we may have an opportunity to make ourselves acquainted with it. I shall assist the Government in every way to deal with the affairs of the country, but it is about time this present farce was ended. The Government have no business to present, although they furnished a long Ministerial statement announcing what they were going to do. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not intend to speak at any length. I should be in an ideal position to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> as to the business of the Senate if he could tell me what honorable members an another place propose to do. I am aware that the honorable senator was not present when I made a statement as to the intention to adjourn until Wednesday week. That proposal was made at the general request of honorable senators. The Government were prepared to meet again next Wednesday. I have always endeavoured to be courteous, and to meet the wishes of honorable senators, but when I make an arrangement with the Leader of the Opposition I do not care to be ridiculed for doing so by other members of the Senate on the other side. I do not desire that I should be placed in the position of having to ask the Leader of the Opposition, when he gives me his word in connexion with an arrangement proposed, whether he speaks in the name of the party opposite. If honorable senators desire to do so, the Government are prepared to meet next Wednesday, but as an arrangement in connexion with the matter has been made, I think we had better adhere to that arrangement. </para>

As a matter of fact, I did not do so, as I had an important matter to attend to after leaving the Senate. During the day to which the honorable senator refers, I was very anxious to make some remarks on the financial position of the country, and, from my experience, to advise the Government in connexion therewith, but I had to sit for three and a half hours listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The man who, after a trial such as that, is mentally fit to deliver a financial statement must be a stronger man than I am. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> told me that if he had known that I wished to speak, he would have made way for me, but he did not know of my intention. I might have had an opportunity yesterday to say what I desired to say, but I waited here the whole of the day, hoping that we would reach the consideration of the Ministerial statement, when I might make some remarks, which I consider important, on the financial outlook and the need for economy in Commonwealth expenditure. That is the most important matter before us. I trust thatSenator Russell will impress upon the Leader of this Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that a day should be set apart for a proper look into our finances, and that it should not be monopolized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

                            <para>-  I think that the limitation of speeches is a very good practice. I agree with a good deal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> says, but I also disagree with much that he says, and I think that his remarks might be advantageously condensed, so that other members of the Senate might be given a chance to say something. I have had a good deal of business experience, and, as a member of the Senate, I have felt that I might assist by indicating to the Government a way in which a great deal of money might be saved. We shall need every penny we can save before we get out of our financial troubles. It is of no use for us to have won the war if,&#39; as a result, we are to fail financially. I repeat my hope that the Government will arrange for one day upon which we may criticise their policy. The Ministerial statement has been referred to as camouflage, but it includes references to financial and other matters which deserve the earnest attention of every member of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>The matter to which I wished specially to refer on the adjournment was the case of the unfortunate boys who were sentenced for breaches of discipline on. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> I have already made a reference to that matter. I wish to refer now to the alienation of park lands in Sydney, in the suburb in which I live, and in which I have spent most of my life-time. I asked a question the other day in regard to the rubbish that is being tipped close to the wool stores at Wentworth Park. The Central Wool Committee have had the audacity to steal that park from the people of the district, and have erected unsightly wooden stores upon it. There was no occasion at all for such action, because the Government have plenty of land along the railway line at Liverpool which could have been used for the purpose, or they could have utilized sites at railway stations, where wool is appraised. Instead of adopting that course, they preferred  to  take the breath of life away from the people of the slums. They took Wentworth Park, which was the only place in which the people of the surrounding district could get a little fresh air, and they have covered it with hideous buildings, in which they store wool. . While the war was on, I would not have said a word if the Government had made use of all the parks&#39; in. Sydney; but I contend that it  is their duty now  to  remove the buildings erected at Wentworth Park. I find that rubbish is being carried there now  for  the making of the streets, and that leads me to the conclusion that the intention is to keep the wool stores where they are. I appeal to the Government to see that those buildings are removed as soon as possible. There is not one member of the Senate who will not sympathize with such an appeal. Our race in this country will degenerate if something is not done to prevent the race suicide that is going on to-day. Under our laws we fix a living wage as the amount necessary to keep a man with a wife and two children. What is the man with a wife and eight or ten children to do? The fact is that people will not have large families if the living wage is to be fixed at that necessary for a man with a wife and two children. The National Government must look to the future welfare of the country and the necessity for building up a superior race. We should not allow the race in Australia to degenerate by failing to provide the conditions of life which should be the heritage of every man in this country. </para>
