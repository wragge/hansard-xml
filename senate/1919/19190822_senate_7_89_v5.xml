                        <para>. - When the debate was adjourned yesterday I was dealing with the world&#39;s supply and requirements of sugar. I mentioned the fact that the yield for the year ended 30th June, 1904, was between 13,000,000 and 14,000,000 short tons of sugar. That increased during the next ten years to 20,000,000 short tons, and yet the world&#39;s requirements were not over supplied. As compared with the year before the outbreak of war there was a reduction in the output of sugar in the principal producing countries of the world of no less a quantity than 2,000,000 tons. To arrive at the exact shortage, allowance has to be made for the normal increase in consumption of over 500,000 tons annually which should have taken place. If that were allowed for there would be a shortage of, not 2,000,000, but over 5,000,000 tons. It is difficult to see how that shortage is going to be made up for some time to come, and, consequently, it should be in the interests of the sugar consumers in Australia - domestic and manufacturing - that the cane and beet sugar industries should be encouraged in every way by the Commonwealth and State Governments. There is nothing in either industry to make the cane and beet sugar industries hostile to each other. On the mainland of the United States of America, and on the island territories, the production is at present 1,250,000 tons of cane sugar and 750,000 tons of beet sugar. Australia has practically the same climatic conditions as the United States of America, and there is no  reason why the cane and beet-sugar industries should not flourish side by side here. In 1911, when the Fisher Government were in office, a Royal Commission on the sugar industry, of which I was a member, was appointed, and in a minority report I presented on that occasion with reference to the beet-sugar industry I stated - </para>

                        <para>All that need be said concerning the sugarbeet industry in Victoria is that it should be encouraged as far as possible. In present circumstances, it is not likely that the sugar requirements of Australia will be met by the production of cane sugar in New South Wales and Queensland for several years to come. I have no sympathy with the suggestion that, on political grounds, the Victorian beet-sugar industry should be sacrificed to the cane-sugar interests. It must be admitted, however, that the evidence did not disclose any earnest desire on the part of Victorian farmers to extend the cultivation of sugar beets. </para>

                    <para class="block">W!hat I stated then I stand by now. It is to the interest of Australia that, so far as possible, the Commonwealth should be self-supporting and self-contained. During the period of the war, although sugar, unlike wool and wheat, has not brought large sums of money into Australia, it has saved the Commonwealth from being forced to send abroad very large sums. Those amounts would have totalled approximately &#163;40,000,000 had we been compelled to buy the whole of our sugar supplies overseas. Taking the estimated production of this year into account, Australia will have produced from 1914 to 1919, inclusive, 1,300,000 tons of sugar. But for that grand total of production the price of sugar would have been very much higher than the figure at which it has been quoted in Java during the years of the war, for the reason that had we been compelled to secure 1,300,000 tons from outside sources that quantity would have more than equalled the surplus of sugar stocks stated to have existed in Java last year. If Australia had been a buyer to that huge extent our people would have been forced to pay whatever price the Java producers cared to ask; and, owing to shipping difficulties, there can be no doubt that consumers in Australia would have been rationed in just the same manner as the people of almost every other country in the world. </para>
                    <para>The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> recently published what it described as a grocer&#39;s bill for one week during the month of July, 1919. The prices paid in that period were compared with those paid by householders in the month of July immediately prior to the outbreak of war. The very first item in this comparative statement is 6 lbs. of sugar, which cost, in July, 1914, 1s. 7d.; and in July, 1919,1s. 9d. The difference amounts to only 2d. in the retail price upon a quantity of 6 lbs. The next item relates to the purchase of two tins of jam. These, I presume, would be what are known as 2-lb. tins, which really contain only 27 ozs. The price for the two tins in 1914 was ls. 5d., and in 1919, 2s. In July, 1914, 3 lbs. of oatmeal cost only 8d.; in July of this year the same quantity cost1s. 4&#189;d. - a rise in the retail price of no less than 100 per cent. A parcel of 3 lbs. of soap cost 10&#189;d. in 1914 and ls. 6d. in July last. One lb. of candles, which could be purchased for 7d. five years ago, cost1s. 6d. this year. </para>

                            <para>- And at the same time the price of a Queensland product has only been allowed to advance by about  12&#189;  per cent. I am making no complaint concerning the price of sugar, but it appears strange that although some of the products of Victoria have risen in price 100 per cent., very little by way of complaint is heard; while, at the same time, there has been constant outcry against the comparatively slight advance in the price of a Queensland product. </para>

                        <para>The evidence reveals that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company occupies a commanding position in the industry, secured by steadily pursuing for a long course of years a policy which has won for it the confidence and good-will of practically the whole of those with whom it has had business dealings. There is nothing to indicate that any one of the company&#39;s transactions have been in the slightest degree of a predatory character. Amicable relations subsist between the company on the one hand and the manufacturers of raw and the purchasers of refined on the other. That the company earns large profits, both within and without the Commonwealth, appears to be entirely due to the volume of its business, the command of adequate capital, the complete utilization of by-products, thorough organization, able administration, and high efficiency in every department. </para>

                    <para class="block">Any business in regard to which those statements may be truthfully made should be encouraged in every possible way, and should be permitted to earn reasonable profits. It must be borne in mind that the transactions of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are very large, not only in the Commonwealth, but beyond the shores of Australia. It should be remembered, too, that most of the profits which the company earns outside of the Commonwealth come into Australia and are spent here. During the past four years the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has refined and placed upon the markets of Australia about 1,000,000 tons of sugar - an average of 250,000 tons a year. In addition, it has a refinery in New Zealand ; it has six sugar mills in Queensland, three in New South Wales, and, I believe, three in Fiji. </para>

                            <para>- In the evidence given before the Royal Commission in 1912, the company set down the cost of its refineries at ?1,600,000. That was the cost of its refineries in Australia, of which there are four, namely, one in Brisbane, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, and one in Adelaide. Western Australia is supplied from Adelaide, and Tasmania is supplied chiefly from Sydney. The company refines in Australia and New Zealand some 300,000 tons of sugar yearly; and at its twelve mills in Australia and Fiji it turns out in a normal year about 150,000 tons of sugar. From these figures, it will be seen that the company does a very large business indeed, and that if it obtains anything like a reasonable profit on its turnover, its profit in the aggregate will be a big one. </para>

                        <para>The refining business is carried on by two companies. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is much the larger concern, having refineries at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Auckland. The last-named was beyond the scope of the Commission&#39;s inquiry. The capital outlay on the company&#39;s refineries in Australia was ?1,401,110, and the refineries now stand in the company&#39;s books at a value of ?1,163,404. </para>

                    <para class="block">Complaint has been made by fruit-growers that the prices of fruit for preserving purposes in Australia have been depreciated by the high price of sugar. Quite a number of jam manufacturers were examined upon this point by the Royal Commission in 1912. The evidence of the whole of them was to the effect that the price of sugar had practically nothing to do -with the price of fruit - that the price of fruit was controlled by the law of supply and demand. It has also been contended that under Federation the fruit-growers have suffered an injustice. I propose to quote the testimony of a few witnesses upon these two points. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Jones, of Hobart, in giving evidence, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Notwithstanding the complaint last year that, owing to the increase in the price of sugar from &#163;24 to &#163;26 per ton, the export trade would suffer severely, the fact remains that the price received by the fruit-growers of Victoria, and other States, during the past season was higher than it has been for a great many years. That was due partly to the very good market there was for our export trade, and also to the fact that, in certain classes of fruit, there was a comparative failure in &#39;the crop. It has been argued that there should be an extension of the Government&#39;s activities in regard to the fixing of prices, and it has been said that the Queensland Government are taking action in that direction. They have been encouraged to do so, we are informed, by the success which has attended the State meat shops in Queensland. But there is one thing about those shops which, perhaps, may not be known to honorable senators, and to the public generally, namely, that there has been a strike in connexion with every State meat shop in Queensland, and that had it not been for the butchers&#39; shops, conducted by private enterprise, there would have been a meat famine in quite a number of centres. </para>

It has also to be remembered that the whole of the meat for the State butchers&#39; shops in Queensland is obtained from the meat companies. It is all frozen meat, and none of it is derived from the stations which are owned by the Government. In regard to profiteering, which is alleged to be rampant throughout the Commonwealth </para>

                            <para>- I know you are a close observer of the Standing Orders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but I was not aware that you were a mind reader. I admit that I was going to say something about the new standing order, which you now tell me I would have no right to say. I may, however, be permitted to express the hope that, in the very near future, there will be a reconsideration of the procedure of thisSenate, making it possible for an extension of time to be allowed in the case of interesting and instructive speeches, such as we have had during the debate upon this Bill, so that further useful information may be disseminated amongst honorable senators. On three occasions during this debate it has been necessary to ask for an extension of time in order to allow honorable senators speaking greater opportunity to deal with the various matters affected by the Bill. I should like to have had more information from the honorable senator who just resumed his seat, because we all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Craw</inline> ford lias made a special study of, and is intimately associated with, the sugar industry in Queensland. We know also tha\t <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has made a close study of the various subjects dealt with in the Bill, and yet in the course of his speech he was able only to refer to one of the four or five questions with which the measure deals. We have heard a great deal about wheat; a most interesting subject; but we have heard little or nothing about other commodities which it is proposed further to control.  One very interesting subject is the wool industry of Australia. I do not profess to have made a close study of that industry, because the State I represent exports only a small quantity of wool. Naturally, the larger States, and particularly <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales and Queensland, are more directly interested in the subject. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that some startling statements have been made, not only about the  operations  of the Wheat Pools, but in connexion also with the wool industry. I should like the Minister, either in the course of his reply or during the passage of the measure in Committee, to give some further information bearing on the, statements made in another branch of this Legislature, and in the press, regarding the transactions in wool. A little while ago a pamphlet was circulated by Messrs. John Bridges and Company, of Sydney, making certain statements with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox, one of the officials of the State Wool Committee, who, it is alleged, has allowed private interests to interfere with his public duties as a member of that Committee. Some pretty damaging statements were contained in Mie pamphlet. </para>

                            <para>- The pamphlet issued &#39;by the Overseas Central Committee states, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox is not, and never was,  chairman  of the wool administration.&#34; It does not say he was not a member of the Committee, and, in view of ;the statements contained in the pamphlet issued by Bridges and Company as well as in the pamphlet issued by the Overseas Central Committee, the Minister might think it incumbent upon him to give some information, because this matter affects the general public, and particularly those interested in the wool business. The statement was made in the press and by members of Parliament, particularly during the discussion of &#39;this Bill in another place, that the fellmongering industry of Australia had been very much injured, if not practically ruined, for the time being because of the sacrifice of public interests to private profits by certain companies or firms which have been granted some sort of control. This is rather a startling statement. It is said that the fellmongering industry has been seriously injured as the result of the action of some persons to whom the Federal Government have given control of the sale and export of wool. </para>

If these statements are true, it is time that the public of Australia knew it. I ask the Minister to tell honorable senators whether there is any foundation of fact for them. If there is, there should certainly be an inquiry by a Royal Commission into the whole of the management of the Wool Pool. </para>

                            <para>- I am asking whether the Minister will, later on, in his reply to this debate, answer the statements which have been made? In discussing the Bill, honorable senators have dealt chiefly with the question of wheat. Surely, in view of the evidence given before a Royal Commission in Sydney recently, and the statements made by responsible Ministers in the New South Wales Parliament following the publication of that evidence, the Minister will agree that it would be only a fair thing for the Federal Government to appoint a Royal Commission, consisting of a Supreme Court Judge, to inquire into the whole of the transactions under the Wheat Pool, and the action taken by State Wheat Boards, firms, and individuals given any control in connexion with the sale and export of wheat. </para>

I have not gone further than other honorable senators have gone hundreds of times in this chamber. It is somewhat remarkable that an honorable senator cannot make statements of general public interest without being subjected to interjections suggesting that he is after somebody&#39;s scalp. That is not my purpose in asking the Minister whether the Government, in order to satisfy the people of Australia, will have a full inquiry into these matters. </para>

                            <para>- Action by the Federal and State authorities in these matters has been so hopelessly intermixed that it would be impossible to have an inquiry into Federal action without at the same time inquiring into action by the State authorities. The Minister knows the evidence submitted recently in Sydney in connexion with wheat transactions, and I remind him that some complaint was made also in Adelaide only a little time ago, which showed that the people of South Australia are not satisfied that everything in connexion with the Wheat Pool has been as it should be. I do not draw inferences against any individual, but I do say it would give satisfaction to the public . if a full inquiry were made into all these matters. </para>

I know hundreds of individuals in Tasmania who have been adversely affected by the way in which the business has been managed, and they complain thai they have not had a fair deal from the Committee in charge of it. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister knows also that charges have been made in connexion with the management of the Wheat Pool, and it is not necessary for me to repeat them. I am asking that, in view of the charges made, the Government shall appoint a Royal Commission to investigate them. In connexion with the metal industry, I think it should be possible for the Government to issue a clear and simple statement covering all the transactions in metals during the last two or three years, showing the Committee in control of the purchase of metals in Australia, the prices at which metals have been sold, to whom they have been sold, and where they have been sold, and what deductions, if any, have been made for reduction and smelting charges. I have been brought into intimate association during the last few months, in my own State - which is a metal-producing State - with numbers of men who are getting their living in the mining industry as individuals or as members of small co-operative companies mining for tin. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not trespass any further on those lines. The difficulty is that it is not so much what is in this Bill as what is left out of it that would give room for profitable discussion. I should like to he entitled to say something about the fruit industry, which is of great importance to the State I represent, but that is not dealt with in this Bill. The measure seeks to extend the operations of the Government under the War Precautions Act in respect to certain commodities for a certain time, but there are a number of matters not dealt with in this Bill, the management of which, in my opinion, the Government should control. Perhaps I may be allowed to say that it is indeed a great pity that a number of other provisions, that might reasonably have been included in this measure, have been omitted. </para>

                            <para>- Information can always be obtained from Ministers, but it is the continual circulation of innuendoes concerning public men that is so injurious. Recently a pamphlet was issued to the people of Australia on the wool question, but it had nothing whatever to do with the Wool Board. The broad question before us at the present juncture is one of great importance to the people of Australia. The various Pools dealt with in the Bill were established for the benefit of the primary producers, and in spite of a good deal of criticism, and statements brought forward from both sides of the Senate, we all realize that the Pools have been of great benefit to the primary producers, as well as to the whole of the people of Australia. If it had not been for the action of the Government in taking  in hand the purchase and distribution of many primary products, as well as the advancing of money to the producers, we would have all been in a ver*y precarious position. As legislators we have to view the question broadly, and consider it, not only from the present, but from the future stand-point. I have listened to nearly all the speeches on this Bill, and despite the pettifogging charges laid against the various Boards and Pools, I frankly admit that these have been of great benefit to the producers of Australia, and have saved many from absolute ruin. What would have become of the wheat-growers of Australia if the Government had not taken in hand the purchase and sale of their wheat? In view of the ravages by mice and weevil the great bulk of it would have been sold for chicken food, and in many cases farmers would not have been able to keep sufficient on hand for seed purposes. What would have been the position of our </para>

                    <para class="block">Australian people if the Government had not taken the matter in hand and arranged with the Imperial authorities to purchase our wheat at a reasonable rate? Notwithstanding the mistakes that have been made,, the wheat-growing industry would have been practically ruined. </para>
                    <para>The same applies to oar dairying industry, which is one of our most important industries at the present time. As a result of an increased production of dairy produce, and the establishment of a Pool to handle it, many thousands of families have been considerably helped, and in some instances actually saved. Many of the Pools were established on the spur of the moment as an absolute necessity, and the Government are to be complimented on the way they have handled those colossal transactions. Mistakes were only natural in controlling such huge undertakings under abnormal conditions, and we know that even the Senate, in all its wisdom, makes mistakes. </para>
                    <para>Frequent reference has bean made to the actions of combines and profiteers, but the war has brought it home to the people of Australia, and almost every other nation engaged in the great world conflict, that private enterprise up to the time of the war had more or less strangled itself. Owing to keen competition numerous firms were driven into combination for their own protection. Combines have been one of the greatest blessings we have had during the present age, in spite of all that honorable senators opposite may Say. Combines are an absolute necessity, not only for handling large quantities, but for producing at a cheap rate. </para>

                            <para>- We have combines growing up all around us, and we must not overlook the combination of labour which has been organized to protect itself against other combinations. With commercial combines on one hand and a combination of labour on the other the consumer is at the mercy of both, and that is one of the features we have to face.  In the United States of America there are examples of combinations of. capital and labour which work harmoniously, but which have been the means of shifting the burden on to the consumer. When such a state of affairs exists it is the duty of the Government to step in and control the prices charged on both sides. The public is absolutely at the mercy of combines, and Parliament provides the only machinery we have for the protection of the people. Instead of senators in this chamber, and people outside, objecting to governmental control, they should support the Government and give them the necessary powers of control. It is on this account that I intend to support the passage of this Bill. Our very existence is at stake, and the Government will have to secure additional powers to enable them to deal with these important problems.&#39; At present, the shipping industry of Australia is in idleness because the seamen have certain grievances. The interests of the people have been absolutely throttled. We are at the mercy of the employees. Whether they are using their powers rightly or wrongly, I may not now discuss; but my point is that the very circumstances governing industrial affairs in Australia to-day are forcing the Government to expand its activities in regard to the control of commodities on behalf of the people. The necessity for Government control is growing every day more urgent. When the war broke out, Commonwealth control was instituted in relation to certain commodities, for the national welfare. Upon the declaration of war all classes in the community were called upon to make sacrifices, and the response was magnificent. If we could only put into our social, industrial and commercial life to-day that same spirit in the cause of the nation, if we could only answer the call as we did when Germany was menacing our existence, if we could only draw employers and employees together in the spirit in which they joined forces in those dark days, there would be nothing to fear for our future. It is the lack of the sense of public duty, of public obligation, which has brought about many of our industrial troubles in these latter times. Unless the spirit of citizenship is fostered and expanded we are bound to suffer. Our burdens, as the outcome of the war, are huge enough, surely, to bring all classes of the people to their senses. </para>

                    <para>Australia&#39;s wool industry was controlled at an early stage, and for everybody concerned in wool production the operations of the Pool have proved satisfactory. The pastoralists are content, and the prices which they have received have been very good. Australian manufacturers of woollen material, however, have not responded as they should have done. They received concessions which outside manufacturers were not granted. The Australian industry was given concessions, during the period of the war, amounting to &#163;29,315 14s.1d. That was the outcome of Government control. But local manufacturers failed to give corresponding concessions to the people. Business orders to-day are so huge that manufacturers are refusing further orders, even for six months ahead. The prices which they are charging for some of their productions are extortionate. Our Government woollen mills are turning out as good a material as may he seen anywhere in Australia. Any one who has inspected the materials of which our soldiers&#39; and sailors&#39; uniforms are made, and who has been at the same time familiar with the price at which those materials have been furnished to the Government, must realize the unsatisfactory conduct of private manufacturers. The material produced in Government factories at 5s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per yard cannot be beaten for quality; but if any one bought such goods in Flinders-lane, or elsewhere, he would be charged 17s. 6d. to &#163;1 a yard. </para>

                        in the course of his remarks upon this measure, said he was here in the interests of cheaper food supplies to the people- Control of our foodstuffs is another project upon which the Commonwealth Government might well enter. We cannot secure improved conditions in all directions, and at the same time sustain the cry for cheap food. The producer desires as much as he can get for his product. He wishes to be left alone, and to secure a good return for his labours. The man whom he employs wants as high a wage as he can possibly secure; and thus the conflict between the interests of the producer and those of the consumer is always raging. The only authority capable of fairly and adequately handling and controlling the foodstuffs of the people generally is the Commonwealth Government.

                            <para>- The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has never declared wonderful dividends. In recent years, at any rate, 8 per cent. Has been about the average. We are apt to overlook the huge turn-over of this concern. The very magnitude of its operations has permitted it, upon a slight margin of profit, to return dividends amounting to about 8 per cent. If other and far smaller concerns were to operate on so fine a margin of profit, they would probably be compelled to cease activities. </para>

                    <para>The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has assisted to place thousands of farmers upon their feet, and I still say that, despite everything which may he urged against it, that company has been a bene-&#39; factor to the State of Queensland. My honorable friends opposite are always inveighing against Combines. Now, instead of fighting Combines, I desire to control them. My own conviction is that, no matter what political party may be in power, we shall be driven to adopt that course. To enable this to .be done, it is absolutely essential that this Parliament should obtain greater constitutional powers. A good deal has been said about the sugar industry  and  about the way in which it has been bolstered up. Some of the fruit-growers have been making a great, noise in this connexion, and quite recently in Victoria an association was formed with .the object of arousing the people of Australia to the manner in which the sugar industry has been coddled.  I think that <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Crawford,</inline> in his very excellent address - and I freely acknowledge that there is nobody in this Chamber who is better qualified to place the real position of the sugar industry before the &#39;people - has given a most convincing reply to these charges. Since they settled their contracts with the fruit-growers, the jam makers of the Commonwealth have been using the fruit-growers and the general public as instruments with which to attack the sugar industry. In my opinion, that industry is the only one which has yielded a profit as the result of Government control of it. </para>

                            <para>- The jam manufacturers, after having completed their contracts with the fruit-growers, are using them and inducing them to squeal. Next year I hope that the fruit-growers will demand some of the profits which the jam manufacturers are making. I am in favour of the Bill, and I think that the demand for the control of Combines will prove to be a growing one. I believe that it will be forced upon our attention, whether we like it or not, and consequently I trust that the Government will  be successful in their endeavours to complete the contracts into which they have already entered. I am in favour of extending their powers of control, not merely to our primary industries, but also to other industries, so long as such extension is likely to prove beneficial to the nation. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is absent from the chamber, because I think that we ought to have a rarer atmosphere in this - chamber than is likely to be created by some of the statements which have been made during the course of this debate. I take no exception: to any honorable senator making a charge, providing that he formulates a definite one. I have no objection to supplying any honorable senator with any information: that he may desire. Since I have been a member of this Chamber I have never declined to furnish an honorable senator with information without asking the purpose for which he desired it. But the practice of saying that there is such-and-such a rumour afloat somewhere in South Australia in regard to the Wheat Pool, thus re-affirming idle tittle-tattle, without giving Ministers an opportunity pf answering a specific accusation, is reprehensible in the extreme. Nevertheless, certain serious charges have been made which warrant a reply. I allude especially to the dispute about wool-dumping in Sydney. The first charge was that, as  Chairman  of the Wool Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox did certain things. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox was never associated with the Wool Board except as an ordinary trader. But there was a Board which was organized by what is known as the wool-dumping companies. In the old days it was a practice to take away wool bales packed or dumped rather loosely. The shipping companies, recognising that this method could be improved upon, established companies for doubling dumping bales in order to save space. But the wool-grower and the wool-seller had nothing to do with the dumping. Indeed, some of the men would not countenance the double dumping. After the shipping companies had established a number of these dumping plants, when- the wool came in John Bridges and Company established a similar plant for the purpose, they alleged, of assisting in the rapid handling of the wool. The shippers themselves, after charging .a shipping rate for wool, always allowed 3s. per bale for dumping, but probably the shipping companies saved 6s. or 7a. per bale in shipping space. Personally I object to restrictions in any shape or form. But the shippers said, &#34;We will do our own dumping and take the 3s. per bale.&#34; As <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> result, a dispute arose, and they declined to cany the wool dumped by John Bridges .and Company. Now, if John Bridges and Company have a right to do this thing, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner, Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> or anybody else has an equal right to participate in this good thing - this dumping of wool at 3s. per bale. The dispute has not yet been decided. </para>

                            <para>- We ought to be fair to one another in these matters. It has been stated that the Government should have appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into wheat matters in New South Wales, but I point out that this Government have no power to inquire into what are properly State functions. The Commonwealth might as well be asked to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the best method of growing potatoes in Victoria, or of sugar in Queensland. The Australian Wheat Board controls only overseas sales. It is not responsible for the handling, collection, stacking, and preservation of the&#34; wheat. That is distinctly a State function, over which I, as chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, have  no  control whatever. My responsibility begins when the wheat is delivered at the ship&#39;s side for overseas sales. If I were to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame,</inline> the Minister in New South Wales; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake,</inline> the Premier of South Australia; or any other State Minister how to stack wheat, I would be asked to mind my own business. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that matter in a moment. By virtue of its constitution, the Australian Wheat Board is limited in the same way as the Commonwealth Government. The Board is not dominated by the Commonwealth, but is controlled by the States and the Commonwealth, and the State Boards have their distinct functions in just the same way as the State Parliaments have. </para>

                    <para>I have been asked about the Georgeson contract. I am not going to offer any criticism of that matter. The subject of oversea shipping came up in connexion with losses from mice and weevil, and it was a debatable question whether we should utilize shipping&#39; fpr inferior wheat instead of reserving it for f.a.q. grade, so we called a conference of accountants connected with the State Wheat Boards, to see if we could arrive at a common basis for action. In connexion with this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame</inline> sent me the following telegram, dated 3rd February, 1919 :- </para>

                    <para>I have to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 4th inst., stating that the replies of the other States in connexion with the above matter have not yet been received. </para>
                    <para>In view of the delay that has occurred, and the evident reluctance of the other States to come to a decision in regard to &#34;the report of the Committee&#39; of Accountants which was given to them on the 20th December, and considered at the last meeting of the Australian Wheat Board on the 21st ult., I feel that, in the interests of the New South Wales growers, the time has now arrived for definite action on my part. </para>
                    <para>As you are aware, the State of New South Wales is more vitally interested in this matter than the other States owing to her heavy stocks of inferior wheat. Efforts to sell this wheat have been much hampered by the system of pooling objected to, and which places any State having the largest quantity of inferior wheat at an unfair disadvantage. </para>
                    <para>I would remind you that during the last sixteen months, and ever since the Conference held in September, 1917, when the matter was considered, I have objected to the proposed method of pooling, and have always held that no motion was passed which would give authority for such a method. A close examination of the verbatim report of the Conference proves this to be the case. </para>
                    <para>This matter has lately been given the most careful consideration by me, and I have now to inform you officially that I cannot accept or be bound by the method which has been condemned by the Committee of Accountants. I also desire to give notice that all future export sales of inferior wheat will be made without reference to the Australian Wheat Board, and that all such sales since the inception of the Pool will be treated in the New South Wales account, as on the same basis as local sales. </para>
                    <para>It was the original intention of the Board only to handle matters in connexion with the export of f.a.q. wheat, and as no method of pooling inferior wheat has been devised - acceptable to all the States - I now contend that only f.a.q. can come under its control. </para>
                    <para>I replied as follows :  - </para>
                    <para>Your letter of 6th February noted. Am waiting replies from Victoria and South Australia. </para>
                    <para>Following upon that telegram, I sent this letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame,</inline> under date 13th February, 1919:- </para>
                    <para>With reference to my telegram to you of 10th inst., I beg to inform you that the States of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have declined to approve of the adoption of the accountants&#39; report on the question of the overseas sales of inferior wheat. Before the next meeting of the Wheat Board, a conference of officers will be held as previously arranged. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt</inline> will submit to this Conference a proposal which, while affording substantial concessions to all States exporting inferior wheat, would retain the general principles of this scheme. As regards the penultimate paragraph of your letter of 4th inst., I can only say that unless and until the Board agrees upon an alteration of the present system, the right of any State to make overseas sales of wheat cannot be recognised. </para>

The correspondence I have read explains the action taken by .the Australian Wheat Board. I believe that sales of wheat were made by the New South Wales Wheat Board which should not have been made except through the Australian Wheat Board. There was no power under its Constitution to enable the Australian Wheat. Board to prevent such sales, but we effectively dealt with the matter under the Customs powers exercised by the Federal Government. A conference took place between the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and I can say now unhesitatingly, on- the part of the Government, that, in future, there will be a prohibition of the export of wheat or flour from Australia, unless the sale has received the approval of the Australian- Wheat Board. </para>

                    <para>In connexion with the constant requests made for information as to the operations of the Australian Wheat Board, I appear to have reached a dead end. I have endeavoured by the use of every means to give the Senate and the public of Australia the fullest possible information without reserve, excepting only such confidential communications in regard to shipping as it was considered should be kept secret owing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> war conditions, and at the dictation of the Imperial Government. I have here a tabulated list of quantities of wheat, which accounts, so far as we know, for every grain of wheat in Australia). We have, not, of course, been able to check the quantity of wheat eaten by mice or destroyed by weevils. I have also a full statement of cash receipts and disbursements. There is a record of all receipts and all expenses. There is only one item of information missing from this statement, and it refers to contracts which have been entered into in respect of wheat which has not yet been delivered, and for which payment has not been received. I made a statement on this subject to the Senate only a few days ago. These reports in complete form have been handed to the press of Australia every week. since my connexion&#39; with the Wheat Board. I am unable to compel their publication in full by the newspapers. The reports have often been condensed by the newspapers, but that is not my fault. I make the statement also that any member of the community interested in the matter may have a full statement of the same kind sent to him week by week. </para>

I do not claim that the administration of the Pools has been perfect. In the conditions under which we have been living it would have been wonderful if it had been so. Not the least of the difficulties which have had to be contended against has been the tremendous work thrown upon members of the Government. Let me say quite candidly that we have not had a sufficient number of Ministers to do the work of Australia during the war period. I make no secret of that. I feel that I have personally done all that was humanly possible for me to do, but on thousands of occasions I wished for more time than was at my disposal to look into different matters. </para>

                    <para>We have been told that Australian wheat farmers have been greatly disappointed when they have read of the guarantees given to wheat-growers by the Governments of the United States of America, Canada, and Great Britain. I have always considered that the Australian Government did not get quite as much for Australian wheat from Great Britain as possibly we ought to have received. I may have been biased in that view by my connexion with the Wheat Pool. But I ask honorable senators what power we had to compel the Imperial Government to give us a higher price than they offered for our wheat. We had to sell our wheal at the price offered, or hold it, and wc could not afford to hold it. Reference has been made to the London parity, and I want to say that we were selling  wheat  as low as 4s. per bushel to Frande at one period in 1916-17, when it was being sold locally for 4s. 9d. per bushel, or 9d.  over  the London parity. If the wheat  farmer  wants the London parity for his  wheat  all the time, and believes that the price should change with every fluctuation of the Loudon market, he must consider the fairness of a request that he should return to the local consumer the 9d. per bushel above the London parity which we extracted from him at the time to which I have referred. I say that we tried to do justice to the local consumer, and secure for the wheat farmer the London parity if possible. The price guaranteed by the United States of America has been quoted, but we should have the whole story. I could give Australian wheat farmers a guarantee of the same price as was guaranteed by the United States of America if this Parliament would consent to do what was done in America, namely, vote thousands of millions of dollars to make up the loss, or, in other words, give a direct subsidy to the wheat farmers as was done in Canada and the United States. I believe that in Great Britain, in trying to maintain cheap foodstuffs during the war, no less than &#163;1,080,000 was paid directly by the Imperial Treasurer. Are we prepared to do that in the interests of wheat-growers? We had to deal in wheat under the worst commercial conditions that ever existed in the history of the world. </para>

                        We all agree now that that was a very wise purchase. Those vessels were not purchased for the carriage of wheat alone.

                        on his first visit to England, sold 200,000 tons of wheat to France. This was in 1917, and the wheat was taken to France by the Commonwealth steamers. The French ports were disorganized, and, as a consequence, there were long delays. The steamers further, had to go many miles but of their way to dodge submarines, and all this added to the expense and the insurance charged. Our ships were employed for twenty-two months in conveying wheat to France, and the cost involved was not met by the farmers, but by the wheat purchasers in France, who obtained supplies at a fair price.

                            <para>- About 120s. per ton. Our ships were a mere drop in the ocean compared with the world&#39;s available shipping. The British Government subsequently requisitioned all British shipping, and, feeling that we were in the war as one people, we fell in with the arrangement. Although our ships were not requisitioned, we complied with the principle of common control during the whole period in regard to conditions and freights. We did not determine the freights. It has been said that we made profits out of the farmer. The freights obtained enabled us to make a very reasonable profit; but the bulk of that was made in back loading. What could be done with the ships? At the time of the 1917 strike, a vessel returning from Great Britain was offered and accepted a cargo of coal for Port Said, at a freight of &#163;6 per ton. Could we refuse it? Seeing that a big strike was in progress, those controlling shipping suggested that the vessel should carry a cargo of coal from Colombo to Australia, or a cargo from Colombo to San Francisco. We knew very well that if the boat came here she would not be unloaded, and we therefore arranged that she should be despatched with a full cargo from Colombo to San Francisco, at a freight rate of 90s. per ton. When the vessel reached San Francisco, and had completed her discharge, she proceeded to Vancouver, and from there returned to Australia. I think we made approximately &#163;60 per ton profit on the round trip, and that, and other such profits have gone into the shipping business. </para>

                    <para>Questions have been asked as to why there is an embargo on the exportation of flour to certain countries, including Egypt, and why private individuals have not been allowed to charter freight. If private individuals had been allowed to charter, the States would have wanted to do likewise, and the competition for space would have made rates very high. For that reason, freight arrangements were put into the hands of the Commonwealth chartering agents. There were hundreds of cases where private individuals endeavoured to secure freight, and when permission was refused we were subsequently able to secure space at about half the rates previously quoted. We requisitioned vessels, I think quite legally, but a case has been brought against us for &#163;50,000 for requisitioning two Finnish boats, which we did with the full consent of the Russian authorities. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> was anxious to know details of our agreement with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. We purchase raw sugar of 94 per cent, net titre at &#163;21 per ton, but the average strength of the sugar is 96 per cent, net titre, which is higher than that stipulated in the contract, and, therefore, there is an added cost of 8s. lid., making the total cost of raw sugar f.o.b. &#163;21 8s. lid. per ton. The Government recoups the company for the actual cost of freight, &#163;1 12s. 8d., which includes marine insurance, harbor dues, exchange, sacks, wharfage, and landing charges. The refining charge of &#163;1 7s. 6d. per ton includes wages, coal, charcoal, water, delivery of refined sugar in towns, cartage, lighterage, and fire insurance. The cost of packages is lis. per ton. The selling charge is 7s. per ton, and includes salaries and contributions to staff and wage- earners&#39; provident funds, office rents and rates, exchange on refined sugar, remittances and charges, as well as taxes. Over and above that, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company receive a managing charge of &#163;1 per ton to cover the use of the company&#39;s services and its capital, and provide interest thereon. </para>

                        <para>He <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Senator Russell)</inline> regarded it as imperative to&#39; place on record the real facts on account of the pessimistic note that had been struck by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and the unsteadying   effect it would have on the value of wheat scrip to the farmer. &#39; The rail freights, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> explained, were assumed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to have been omitted from the expenditure shown as having been met by the various Pools. Everybody could, of course, recognise that the Railways Commissioners were not philanthropists, and they* insisted upon prompt cash for wheat transport. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has based his deduction on the assumption that railage had still to be added. This would only be the case where wheat had still to be hauled. These erroneous assumptions made <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> figures valueless. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had stated that of the balance of the 1915-16 wheat 3,821,000 bushels were represented by dust and ashes. This was entirely erroneous. This wheat was now being treated, and in some cases without treatment was being accepted by the British Wheat Commission as f.a.q. wheat. There was, of course, some loss, which would not be ascertainable until the stacks were cleaned up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had further stated that the South Australian 1916-17 Pool showed a loss of 4,000,000 bushels. He <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> was not clear as to where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> &#39;had got his data, as he was not in a position to say what the outturn would ultimately prove to be, or what proportion of the loss would be chargeable to the British Government. The losses were not likely to be anything like as heavy as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had estimated. On the South Australian 1917-18 Pool <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> claimed that the loss would be 2,000,000 bushels. There would be no loss on the 1917-18 Pool, apart from slight damage by .weevil. There was every reason to believe that this would be more than compensated for by the gain in weight. For example, 3,000,000 bushels had been shipped from South Australia, and only 10 per cent, had required treatment. Of this 10 per cent, the loss had been less than 1 per cent._ </para>
                        <para>The estimated loss in New South Wales was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> at 6,000,000 bushels. There had been no such admission by the New South Wales authorities, and it was confidently believed that the loss would not approximate anything like that figure. On the New South Wales 1917-18 Pool the loss was estimated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> at 3,000,000 bushels through weevil. This was ridiculous as the following statement issued by th&#60; Wheat Board on 11th August of this year would show. The total amount received &#34;into the Pool, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> said, was shown a-. 33^715,000 bushels. Shipments represented 10,752,000 bushels, and the deliveries to millers  20,522,000 bushels. The millers&#39; stocks were 785,000 bushels, or a total of 32,059,000 bushels. The balance to be accounted for was 1,656,000 bushels, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had said that 3,000,000 bushels had been lost. The shippers had substantial quantities in hand, which could only be determined by the cleanup. </para>
                        <para>The Victorian loss was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> at 4,000,000 bushels through weevil. This was absolutely wrong - no such loss had taken place. The known gain in weight on the 1915-16 Pool was shown as being 725,000 bushels on the deliveries made here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> stated that from &#163;1,000,000 to &#163;2,000,000 was still owing to the growers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had overlooked the fact that on the 1915-16 Pool a payment of 4s. 9d. per bushel had been made in Victoria and New South Wales, and 4s. 7&#163;d. in South Australia and Western Australia. Not only had rail freight been deducted, but also handling charges and substantial dockages. The rail freight appeared to have confused <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> This was the only varying charge made against growers, and it was adjusted as soon as possible, so that all growers might be placed on an equality for future payments. For the 1915-16 Pool an adjustment had been - made on the third advance, which, was ls., less rail freight and handling. For the 1916-17 and 1917-13 Pools the adjustments had not yet been made. For the 1918-19 Pool a substantial advance, which was considered to be at the time the approximate value of the wheat, was made. The rail freight was adjusted in the first advance, except in the case of New South Wales, where the State Government had pledged itself to make an advance of 4s. net, irrespective of rail charges to the seaboard. Financial statistics were issued weekly by the Australian Wheat Board on receipt of advices from the States, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> continued, and they were on a cash basis. Therefore they could not reflect the true position of the individual Pools as a profit and loss account would. They showed all &#39; the cash expenditure to date. For example, all the rail freight paid was included, and also the bank interest. Of course, future expenses were not shown, nor rebates to country mills for rail freight. On the other hand, the expenditure of a capital nature on items such as iron and timber was included. Their value could not be stated until the time came for realization. Some States had extensive plants, and they were also included. As he had endeavoured to show by interjection while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was speaking, the moneys <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> considered still owing to growers were practically covered by all the dockages made on delivery. On the New South Wales 1916-17 crop it was well known dockages were very heavy, owing to much of the wheat being pinched by the weather, and this fully covered the amount the senator stated was still owing. It was the intention of the State Boards to make public the position as regards the losses as soon as could bc done with some degree of real accuracy.. Hitherto it would have been futile to attempt to do so, and any statement would have been liable to be most misleading. The general effect of the mouse plague on the 1917 crop was well known; but until the stacks were within a reasonable distance of being cleaned up it was incapable of being estimated or even approximated. There must be some disappearance, and there must be some loss through damage; but ill-considered statements did not help to throw the faintest glimmer of light on a very difficult question. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill has been described by the Minister as &#34; five Bills in one.&#34; Within the period allotted by the new standing order, no member of this Chamber could have been expected to present all his views upon even one of the five features of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> gave a most interesting address in which he confined himself almost entirely to the topic of sugar. He received an extension of time, and even then was cut off in the middle of an important statement. Honorable senators, therefore, should not be impatient if I now take advantage of the opportunity to speak for a quarter of an hour in Committee. </para>

                            <para>- It is not quite fair, but I place the responsibility for the unfairness of the&#39; position upon the shoulders of the Minister. He availed himself of the opportunity, under cover of the new standing order, to introduce a measure which he himself admitted was five Bills in one. He held the Bill back until such time as the Senate would be forced to consider it under the limitation of the new standing order. That is an unpleasant fact, which will take a lot of explaining away. Even at this stage I am to be permitted to speak for only a quarter of an hour. I hope, therefore, that I shall not be interrupted. </para>

The only thing that surprises me with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> is that since he &#39;has been in this Chamber he has not appointed himself either  President  or  Chairman  of Committees. He always strikes me as regarding himself as a personality of such importance that he must set himself up in control of the business of the Senate, and must tell every one how to conduct that business. </para>

                            <para>- What commercial activities are we to. engage in during 1919 ? My objection to the short title is that there should have been no Bill at all. Neither a short title nor a long title, nor any single clause dealing with these subjects, should have been introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> pointed out that the only thing which constitutionally justifies the introduction of this measure is that it seeks to empower the completion of certain contracts which have already been entered into. If there have been contracts entered into, there are already powers under which the Government may carry out these contracts, and there is no need to ask .Parliament to pass a Bill as to which there is a doubt concerning our constitutional powers. </para>

                    <para>Seriously, however, I desire to address myself to the short title of this Bill. How is the title of any measure decided upon ? Is it not by using the phrase which will most briefly and best describe the subject-matter of the Bill itself? I repeat that I will be in order in discussing the whole Bill while basing my remarks upon the short title. If the  Chairman  is of opinion that such is not the case, I shall be instantly prepared to contest his ruling. I invite him to say &#34;No.&#34; What will follow? My dissent from his ruling will be placed before the  President.  The  President  - one may be quite certain - will uphold the ruling of the Chairman; and that attitude, in turn, will be supported by the majority of honorable senators. Nevertheless, I will be right, and the  Chairman,  and the  President,  and the majority of honorable senators will be wrong. If we are to discuss the short title, surely we will be in order in endeavouring to ascertain how the short title is decided upon. The basic motive is that the short title shall be descriptive of the measure. This short title does not accurately describe the Bill, and there is not a clause within its pages which I may not review when dealing with the short title itself. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> rule that I am not entitled to proceed in that manner, I shall certainly dissent from your ruling. Then, what will happen? We will go through the farce of witnessing your appeal to the  President.  That is to say, the appeal will go from a biased  Chairman  to a more biased  President,  whereupon the  President  will appeal to be backed up in his attitude to a still more biased Senate; and, thereupon- </para>

                    <para>I desire to say that it possesses the disqualification associated with the last measure we were considering, in that it really consists of two Bills. It relates to the extension of the general moratorium, with which most honorable senators are familiar, and also to  the  special moratorium in the cases of men who have been engaged on active service. Everybody recognises that during the period of war a condition of things arose which was disconcerting to most men, and which particularly affected obligations of a financial character. It was necessary to insure  that  our business community should not be harassed by financial obligations falling upon them at a time when such happenings would have resulted _ in general chaos. When the moratorium regulations were introduced, it was decided that they should be terminated either upon the  ratification  of peace or three months thereafter. Now it is recognised that it would be unwise to make all mortgages fall due upon one particular date. That would  probably  produce financial chaos.. Consequently, it has been decided to establish a graduated schedule, which will enable these debts to be honorably met, and which will, indeed, facilitate their payment. The dates suggested in the general moratorium upon which the principal sum secured by mortgage shall become due for repayment are as follows: - For the period before the 1st January, 1915, February, 1920; for the period between 1st January and 31st December, 1915, both dates inclusive, March, 1920; for the period between 1st January and 31st December, 1S16, both dates inclusive, April, 1920; for the period between 1st January and 31st December, 1917, both dates inclusive, May, 1920; for the period between 1st January and 31st December, 1918,  both  dates inclusive, June, 1920; for the period between 1st January, 1919, and the date of the termination of the war, as declared by proclamation, both dates inclusive, July, 1920. </para>

Cases in which lesser amounts are involved may be decided by a District Court, a County Court, or a Local Court presided over by a stipendiary magistrate. These are the principles underlying the general moratorium. In regard to the protection of those who have been engaged on active service and their dependants, the Bill extends even to the hire-purchase system, under which the great majority of our working people purchase furniture. Such persons are protected to the extent of &#163;100 in regard to their personal belongings. Again, there are many men who, while they may have been in possession of valuable assets during the war period, were not able to realize upon them owing to the lack of transport. This measure will prevent such men being driven through the Courts. The Bill is very technical, and I do not propose to attempt to explain its provisions in legal phraseology. Any explanation that may be desired will be forthcoming in Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I embrace this opportunity to refer to the statement which was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> during the course of his speech in reply, upon (the motion for the second reading of the Commercial Activities Bill. The honorable gentleman, in that statement was good enough to confirm what I have affirmed several times at public meetings in Tasmania during the past few months. What  he said relates to a matter of very great importance to that State. Ever since the inception of Federation, it has &#39;been the custom for each State to be represented in the Cabinet, Seeing that there are only six States and that there are  about  twelve Ministers, obviously, each State should have at least one representative in the Ministry. Owing to the fact that Tasmania has had no representative in the Cabinet during the past eight months, it has not received that amount of consideration to which it is entitled. During the period in question, many matters of grave importance to Tasmania have been dealt with by Cabinet. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> frankly confessed that there is a necessity for the appointment of more Ministers to enable them to cope with the multifarious duties of government, especially since the activities of the Commonwealth have been increased to such an enormous extent.  His  statement emphasizes the need for the Government immediately considering the position as they have been urged to consider it by the electors of Tasmania. &#39; The remedy is in the hands of Ministers themselves. Both in this Chamber and the other branch of the Legislature they h,ave quite a number of supporters from whom they could choose a worthy Ministerial representative of the State of Tasmania. In the Senate they have three followers who have had Ministerial experience either in the State or Federal arena. In another place they have four supporters, any one of whom would be able to discharge the onerous duties of Minister equally as well as do the majority of the present Ministers. This is a matter of vast importance to Tasmania, and I urge the Vice-President of the Executive Council to bring it before the Cabinet. I- quite agree with him that Ministers are only human, and that they have to work long hours. During the recent recess, I believe that some Ministers were called upon to give close attention to their duties daily for thirteen hours out of the twenty-four. This condition of affairs can be corrected if Ministers wish &#39; to correct it, and I submit that it is their duty to remedy the existing anomaly as soon as possible. </para>

                    the other day, when I pointed out that many of these men, upon their return to Australia,&#39; found themselves in a very difficult &#39; position by reason of the fact that they were unable to obtain any assistance from the Repatriation Department, because they had not been members of the Australian Imperial Force. As a matter of fact, while the recruiting campaign was in progress, quite a number of these men endeavoured to enlist, but were rejected owing to some minor physical defect. Thereupon they offered themselves as war-workers, and their services were eagerly accepted by the Australian Government on behalf of the Imperial authorities. The Minister for Repatriation asked me to bring before him some definite case of this kind. I have here a letter from one of these war-workers who resides in Gympie. For obvious reasons I withhold his name, though I shall be glad to sup ply it to the Minister privately, if he desires it. The writer says -

                    <para class="block"> I am an Australian war worker. I served two years in England under agreement with the Commonwealth Government. We were treated disgracefully by the officers in charge of us at Australia House. We were put to work with a firm called Holloway Brothers, where we could only earn from &#163;2 17 s. 9d. to &#163;3 2s. 6d. per week, and it cost us from 30s. to 40s. per week to live, and pay 3s. 6d. per week for the huts we lived in, and they were not fit for pigs to live in, let alone human beings. We men petitioned our officers in charge for a transfer to better work, and were refused on the ground that a couple of our fellows did not play the game, so the rest of us would have to suffer for it. Then I returned to Australia to starve. I am home five weeks, and can get no work and no assistance. I have a wife and five children depending on me. I went to the Secretary of the Local Repatriation Committee, and was refused any assistance. I must state to you that the treatment we received on our return home could not be worse in Hun-land or any other country. I must state that I enlisted for the Australian Imperial Force, and failed owing to deficient vision, so I then enlisted as a war worker. I must state that the Government was very pleased of my services, and after doing my bit I can go to the devil, while a lot of cold-footed curs, that did nothing for this country, are sitting back in good billets laughing at us poor, starving beggars.

                        <para>. -  I desire also to bring under the notice of the Minister a grave injustice which has been perpetrated upon the relations of some unfortunate soldiers whose bones are lying on Gallipoli or in Prance. Some of the men who enlisted in Australia were Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Irishmen whose parents reside in the Old Country. The case I have in mind is that of a young Londoner who enlisted in Australia and lost his life. When news came of his death, those intrusted with the management of his affairs found that, in Sydney, he had two trunks full of articles and curios which he had collected in different parts of the world. They ascertained that his father and mother live in England. They are poor people, his father being a gardener by occupation. We know what that means in the Old Country. The friends of the deceased soldier desired to send his belongings to the parents, but the Government have refused to bear the cost of transport. I do not think that any Minister, or even any of the military authorities, indorse this attitude. The misunderstanding seems to be due to some silly military regulation which cannot be overcome except by Ministerial direction. It is an outrage that these belongings cannot be sent back to the deceased soldier&#39;s parents, especially in view of the fact that if the man had come through the war safely, and had married in England, the Government would have borne the cost of transporting his wife to Australia. Or again, if wounded he would have been brought back to this country at great expense and cared for here. Simply because be lost his life, the two chests which belonged to him cannot be returned to his parents. Under the military regulations there is not enough co-ordination between the different Departments, because we find that one Department contradicts another in the matter of discharges, pensions, Medical Board awards, and so on. People interested in these matters do not know where to go. I hope something will be done, because there are other similar cases. I believe the official answer is that any parcel exceeding 11 lbs. in weight must be paid for. This is ridiculous. It cannot be expected that the poor people who are looking after the affairs of this deceased soldier could defray the cost of transport. In other directions we have wasted millions of pounds, and, no doubt, many more millions will be spent. I feel confident that if the Minister looks into this matter he will instruct that something be done. </para>

                        <para>. -  I desire to make a complaint about the manner in which two sets of questions which I asked this week were answered; the reply from the Ministers being that the matters mentioned were of a confidential nature and secret. I say emphatically that neither of the questions should have been answered in that way. One question had reference to a communication from the Imperial Government regarding a secret treaty which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lansing,</inline> in America, declared had been made between Great Britain and Japan. I asked him when that secret treaty came into the hands of the Government, and what Government dealt with it. There ought to be nothing secret about the time such a communication came to hand. If a person holding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lansing&#39;s</inline> position in America states that he is aware of a treaty which was entered into three years ago, surely there is no reason why the Government should make a secret of the time when the information came into their possession. More real danger may be apprehended from secrecy in international documents than from legitimate publicity in respect of them. If the Australian Government received a copy of this secret treaty three years ago, there is no reason why this Parliament and the public of Australia should not know of it. But I can see the prospect of very grave danger if a treaty, supposed to have been in existence for three years, is being discussed in other countries, if the Australian Government, which are most interested in it, know nothing about it. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is not in the chamber just at present, but I know an important en gagemeut claims his attention elsewhere. The other question to which I refer was asked of the Acting Minister for Defence, and it concerned the report of a Board presided over by Inspector-General Ramaciotti, appointed to inquire into and report upon the remount section of the Defence Department. The reply was that the information could not be made public because it affected Government policy. If the Government could prevent these things from being made public I would not mind their attempt at secrecy; but I know that when information comes to me on any matter, the whole world - that is, the world interested in it - knows all about it before I do. I do not expect the Government to give me information with reference to policy, but I maintain that if public money is being paid to a Board to investigate the administration of any public Department, there is no reason whatever for secrecy. In this case there is no justification for secrecy, as the question only asked whether or not the remount section of the Department for Defence was being administered economically. Such a report should have been furnished to the Senate. We must remember, also, that a large number of people are concerned in a report of that nature. I know departmental officers are to be trusted, and that they thoroughly understand their duty; but it is not possible to prevent men in the same branch of the Government service from discussing these matters, and occasionally discussions of this nature reach the ears of other people. I shall not always be satisfied with Ministerial statements to the effect that the laying of reports upon the table of the Senate would be a disclosure of policy. In this case my question concerned the management of our largest spending Department. Referring again to my first question&#39;, I repeat that no secret would have been given away by the Minister stating whether it was the first, second, or third Hughes Government, or the Fisher Government that received and. considered the treaty referred to. I trust that we shall not get too many answers of this kind in future. </para>

                        references to the position of Tasmania in the Cabinet practically indorse my own views, so it is hardly necessary for me to say anything in reply to them. Concerning the war workers mentioned by

                        I may say that I have given a great deal of attention to their position, but it is impossible to lay down a general rule, because some munition workers occupied good positions, and were able to save a considerable amount of money.

                            <para>- That is so. Some were lucky, but many others appear to have had a bad time. The Government have been very liberal on the whole in regard to all applications, which, of course, must be considered on their merits. We have appointed a Munitions Committee in each State to deal with these cases, and if the honorable senator will furnish me with the particulars I shall forward them te the proper quarter for consideration. I am not familiar with one of the matters mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and do not know what the report contained, but I will see if it can be made available to honorable senators. I know of no reason for keeping back reports on departmental files  unless  a Minister desires details for the elaboration of Government policy. In those circumstances it would not be fair for private members to drag matters of policy from the Government in anticipation. </para>
