          <para>That the Senate places upon record its profound sorrow at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin ; its appreciation of his lifelong devotion to duty, and his great public services ; and its sincere sympathy with his widow and family. </para>

        <para class="block">In submitting this motion I share in the feelings of sincere regret with which I am sure every member of the Senate regards the occasion for it. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin was known to many of us, and, speaking for myself, I was, as a boy in Victoria, impressed by his outstanding position in the politics of this State. Subsequently he was known in a wider area as an. Australian statesman who displayed great ability in his endeavours, in co-operation with other great Australian leaders of the movement, to bring about Federation. For over thirty years he was in politics, but, although he had many differences with others in regard to political principles, it was said of him that he never had a personal difference with any of the political colleagues with whom he was associated, either as members of a Ministry or as members of a Parliament. </para>
        <para>If his death was not directly attributable to his long public, service, there can be little doubt that he sacrificed many years of his life on the altar of public duty. He was considered to be one of the most eloquent men Australia has produced, and certainly the most eloquent man of his time. His reputation as a statesman extends beyond Australia. He has been recognised throughout the length and breadth of the Empire as an orator, statesman, and gentleman. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>work was of a very high character indeed. However much he may have differed from others upon details, he always endeavoured to strike a high humanitarian and national note.  His  work is now accomplished, and the circumstances of his death once more illustrate the great strain imposed upon the men who are compelled by choice or circumstances to devote a considerable time to public duty. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>would have adorned any Parliament in which he sat. He was always gentlemanly, courteous, and brilliant, and at all times ready to sacrifice himself in the interests of his country and of his fellow-men. By his death Australia has lost one of her finest examples of manhood, both in private and public life. </para>
        <para>To those whom he has left behind to mourn his loss we extend our sincere sympathy; to his widow, who has herself done noble public service, and to the daughters of the family who, we may hope, will continue to follow his very worthy and inspiring example. </para>

        <para class="block">Wales) &#91;3. 4&#93;. - It is with the deepest feeling of regret that, on behalf of honorable senators on this side; I associate myself with every word that has fallen from. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> as Leader of the Senate, in submitting the motion which is now before us. By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin Australia has lost its greatest. Australian, so far as the public life of this country is concerned, for the past quarter of a century. I always looked on him as the soul of honour and as a leader who stood unchallenged, with a high regard for not only his own personal character, but also for the character of the Parliaments in which he sat. </para>
        <para>The parts which he played need not be enumerated, but I remember how proud my young Australian heart was when the Australian delegates who took the Convention Bill to Great Britain left the shores of this country, because Alfred </para>
        <para class="block">Deakin, Edmund Barton, and Charles Kingston were the men deputed to carry that measure to the Home Land. The manner in which their distinguished services were carried put was what might have been expected from men who could measure themselves with the world&#39;s best. </para>
        <para>For the loss of a great man Australia mourns, and we participate in that mourning. I join the Minister who submitted the motion, and the Senate, in extending our deepest sympathy to the loved ones who have been left behind. </para>

          <para>. - I, too, with very sincere regret, rise to support the motion so ably moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. I ask leave to say a few words because of my long personal, and also of my political, association with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin. It must be now some twenty-two years since I first made his acquaintance in my native city of Hobart. He was then in Hobart for a session of the Federal Council, and I presided at a meeting in the local Town Hall which he addressed. On the morrow the Premiers of the six Colonies of Australia were to assemble with a view to take some action to further the cause of Federation. I well remember the speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> delivered on that occasion. It was the first speech which the people of Tasmania had the privilege of bearing from his lips. In that address <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> with the true vision of a prophet, outlined almost everything that was done by&#39; the Premiers on the next and following days, which ultimately resulted in the Federal Enabling Bill being submitted to the several Legislatures, the Federal Convention being elected, and the draft Constitution being framed and submitted to the people. From that time onward I had a close personal friendship with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> Later, when I entered political life, I did so with the extraordinary advantage and privilege of that friendship, and also of a friendship with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, who was then Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council and Leader of the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>With all that has been said by the mover and seconder of the motion I associate myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was a man of very high ideals and of magnificent and noble character. Always chivalrous, and generous to a. fault, he might well be called the Bayard of Australian political life. Although Providence had endowed him richly with great outstanding talents and abilities, and with great qualities of mind and heart, it seemed to me that in respect of his talents and qualifications he always regarded himself merely as a trustee for his country, Australia, and his countrymen, the people of this Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>In whatever he did in public life he was animated by a sincere desire for the prosperity and progress of Australia and Australians. When abroad he achieved the wider reputation to which the Minister has referred, but he still seemed to think that every tribute paid by the people of other countries to his great outstanding abilities was paid, not to himself, but to Australia and Australians; He accepted every mark of appreciation of his services as bestowed on him on behalf of the people of Australia. Great as was his capacity, he was always modest, always unassuming, and always most careful of the feelings and susceptibilities of others. He fought many strenuous fights, but he left no personal antagonisms. I am thoroughly satisfied that the motion which has been submitted to the Senate expresses the sentiments of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, not merely in respect to the memory of Alfred Deakin, but also in respect to the sympathy which we seek to extend to his noble wife and his family, for, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has already said, they, too, have taken a creditable part in the public life of Australia. I sincerely believe that the high ideals which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> held, and the conduct which characterized his life, both public and private, may always be regarded as the highest exemplars for Australians to cherish and follow. </para>
