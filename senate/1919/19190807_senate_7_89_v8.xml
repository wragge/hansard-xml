I desire to know whether it is competent for any honorable senator to discuss a report which we have not heard read, and of which we do not yet know the purport ? It is impossible for anybody to say to what this motion relates, other than the printing of a report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I submit, is entirely out of order, because he says that the report relates to the proposed curtailment of honorable senators' speeches. Is it in order for him to refer in such terms to a report which has not been read to the Senate? </para>

I realize that interjections lead to disorderly conduct, and therefore I shall not pursue this line of argument further. I question whether a time-limit on speeches will assist us in the despatch of business. Already this session the Senate has passed three Bills, in their entirety, and we have scarcely met. I suggest to the Minister that he should get the Government to bring down their financial proposals at an early date. </para>

                        <para>.- I feel I may crave the indulgence of the Senate, in view of the extraordinary turn which affairs appear to have taken this afternoon, to say a few words. The course followed in submitting the motion is the usual course on the presentation of reports of this nature. . It is the invariable practice to print the reports from Committees, and to set aside a day for their consideration, the object being to enable every member of the Senate to be furnished with full information concerning the nature of a report when the motion for its adoption is under consideration. If I had come here to-day, and asked the Senate to consider this report without first having moved that it be printed, my honorable friends opposite would immediately have had a grievance. They would have said, "How can we be asked to proceed with the consideration of this matter without knowing what the document contains?" I can quite understand, of course, the natural perturbation in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline><inline font-style="italic">alias</inline> Sherlock Holmes, concerning the nature of the report. </para>

                            <para>- My remark still stands good. That report may be against the limitation of speeches; and only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> by that acute detective knowledge and skill which he is developing, or else as the result of a communication from that Committee, can be in a position to know what the nature of the report is. The matter is very simple. If the Senate does not desire that the document be printed, honorable senators will still be faced with the responsibility of considering it; and the question is whether they would be better armed to proceed with that consideration with, or without, a printed copy in their hands. If the Senate does not want the report printed, it will not matter; but the usual procedure is for every honorable senator to be possessed of a copy of a document of this kind. I deprecate that there should be any divulgence of the voting in a Committee. The Senate appoints members as a Committee to do certain branches of work which the Senate itself recognises that it is somewhat incompetent to perform. If we were to invite Committees to undertake certain duties on behalf of this Chamber, and were then to challenge their methods of voting, it would be unfair to ask honorable senators to accept positions upon them. </para>

                        <para>. - At the adjournment yesterday, I was making a comparison between the Government institutions of Papua and those proposed in the Northern Territory. I do not propose to go into the matter further, nor do I intend to detain the Senate at any length, because I think I have made it perfectly clear that the Ordinance now being reviewed by the Senate is entirely unsuitable and opposed to our notions of democratic government. I have endeavoured to show - and I think I have succeeded - that this Ordinance, framed to control affairs in the Northern Territory, is really placing all power, not in the hands of six or seven gentlemen, but in the hands of one man, which makes the administration more autocratic than ever. Whilst we could, in a sense, appreciate a straight-out resolution in favour of autocratic government in the Territory, I do not think the Chamber will agree to a proposal, which appears to be democratic, but, in reality, is an autocratic step, such as we have never  previously  witnessed in Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I desire that the Northern Territory shall have representation in this Parliament. I am not concerned whether there shall be representation  in both Houses, as that is a matter for the Government. Whatever proposals the Government may introduce in this direction will have my consideration, and," if suitable, my support. I am anxious that my fellow-citizens in that part of Australia shall be represented in this Parliament, just as are the citizens in other parts of the Commonwealth. It is useless to make comparisons between the Federal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, as those in the Federal Capital Territory are quite near to the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, and have opportunities of ventilating their grievances from day to day. Moreover, they are not living under the disabilities of those people in the Northern Territory, who are without representation. I ask the Senate to carry this motion, because the Council to be called into existence by this Ordinance will be an undemocratic form of government. It is undemocratic in its creation, because Parliament should have a voice in such a drastic change of policy. In the interests of the residents there, such a proposal should have been submitted to this Parliament to enable honorable senators to discuss it before it became law. </para>

                            <para>- This Parliament can deal with any legislation brought forward by the Government. There are no constitutional difficulties to prevent the Territory being represented in this Parliament; I was informed so by the Minister, in reply to a question. This Parliament can deal with any part of the Commonwealth, so' far as its government is concerned. It is undemocratic for the  chairman  of the Advisory Council to have absolute power to say what shall be discussed. Power is given  to the Minister to " pack " the  Council  any time he may think proper. For these reasons, I contend that the provisions of the Ordinance are unsuitable, undemocratic, and not likely to encourage good government. Its provisions are not likely to make the people of the Northern Territory more satisfied with the Federal Government than they have been during the past six or seven years. I submit tie motion for the consideration of the Senate, so that honorable senators who profess to be believers in democratic government may have the opportunity of supporting it. </para>

                        <para>. - In seconding the motion, I wish to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> opening remarks regarding, not only the advisability, but the absolute necessity, of members of. the Federal Parliament becoming more closely informed regarding Northern Territory affairs generally. I intend to confine my remarks to the Ordinance, and not to deal with the Northern Territory generally. During the recess, I had an opportunity of visiting the Northern Territory, and, contrary to belief, found that I knew comparatively little concerning; the true state of affairs there. I had hoped, on the reassembling of Parliament a month or so ago, to put my impressions and opinions of the Territory generally before honorable senators with a view to their guidance in the consideration of its affairs. Fate and the influenza decreed otherwise, but I shall take an early opportunity of conveying to the Senate the views concerning the Territory which I- formed as the result of my visit. I believe that I shall be able to put before honorable senators some aspects of the situation up there which previously have not been sufficiently ventilated. </para>

                    <para>Owing to its peculiar situation the Northern Territory has not, so far, been able to obtain representation in the Federal Parliament. Various means have been proposed to overcome that disadvantage, either by direct representation, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> or by the division of the Territory into districts to be attached to various Federal electorates, to which they would be contiguous. It does not appear that anything practical in that regard is likely to be achieved in the very near future. The idea of the residents of the Northern Territory in advocating the appointment of an Advisory Council was that it would be elected by the people on an adult suffrage similar to that exercised in the election of members of the Town Council at Darwin. The very name of the proposed Council indicates that it would have no authority to act in opposition to the Department or Minister controlling the affairs of the Northern Territory, but would merely advise him as to the views and desires of the residents. The fulfilment of the half promise given by the Minister for Home Affairs at the time things were unsettled, particularly in Port Darwin, was looked forward to with some hope by the residents of the Territory. They thought that an Advisory Council would be elected on the lines I have indicated, but we find that the Ordinance providing for the Council does not make provision for anything 60 democratic as was expected . </para>
                    <para>This Ordinance- No. 8 of 1919- in section 3 repeals Ordinance No. 2 of 1911. At the time of the issue of Ordinance No. 2 of 1911, the 3rd April of that year, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> as Minister for External Affairs, had charge of the Northern Territory. I had not the opportunity or the pleasure of being associated in this Parliament with that gentleman, but I have been informed that he was very enthusiastic about the future of the Territory. We can well understand that, in April, 1911, there may have been some justification for the issue of an Ordinance constituting an Advisory Council on the lines embodied in Ordinance No. 2 of that year. That Ordinance, which is now repealed, had at least the common honesty to set forth that the body it created was a nominee body, and could act only in a purely advisory capacity. That Ordinance of eight years ago is 'repealed by the Ordinance now under discussion, and I am firmly convinced that the latter Ordinance, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> desires should be disallowed, is less democratic than is the Ordinance which it repeals. I think I shall be able to show that the Ordinance now under discussion is retrogressive, and gives greater power to a single individual than was given to the Administrator of the Northern Territory by Ordinance No. 2 of 1911. Under the Ordinance of 1911 a purely nominee Council was appointed, and the Administrator alone was authorized to bring business before it for discussion. No member of the Council was empowered to suggest any business to it. Section 7 of Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 reads - </para>

Under this Ordinance of 1919, there is no such right of protest given to the members of the Council of Advice. The initiation of business is entirely in the hands of one man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> stressed section 5 of the Ordinance of 1919 in connexion with the constitution of the Council, and I can add to what he said that, in sub-section 2 of section 5, it is provided that. - </para>

                        <para>The Council shall consist of a Chairman and seven members, of whom three shall be the Government Secretary, the Director of Lands, and the Director of Mines, or the officers for the 'time being acting for those officers, and four shall be non-official members. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be clear to honorable senators that provision is there made for three Government nominees - the Government Secretary, the Director of Lands, and the Director of Mines - and four non-official members, out of a Council of seven. It has to he considered that, in addition to these seven members, there is provision made for a permanent  Chairman.  It has been stated publicly that the recently appointed Director of Affairs in the Northern Territory is to be the permanent  Chairman,  6o that the Council of Advice will consist of three Government nominees, and the Director as permanent  Chairman,  and these members will be pitted against the four non-official members. The Director, as permanent <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline> will, of course, have a casting vote, and so will be able to carry things all his own way. The clause to which I have referred practically provides for a safe Government majority on the Council on every question, and so the introduction of the four non-official members has 'the appearance, rather than the reality, of representation. There is little or no difference between such a body and a straight-out nominee Council. </para>
                    <para>Sub-section 5 of the same section gives to the Minister the power to add additional members to the Council to put through any special business. On this point I can add to what has already been said : that if the Minister .desires any particular matter put through he will act only on the advice of the Director. It therefore appears to me that this provision is included to guard against the possibility of any one of the three Government nominees, the Government Secretary, the Director of Lands, or the Director of Mines, proving refractory and not consenting to fall in with every proposal submitted by the Director. ' The Government Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans,</inline> I. know, is credited with not having been wholly swallowed by the previous Administrator. The Director of Lands has not been in the Northern Territory sufficiently long, perhaps, to enable them to form an opinion as to the extent to which the Director will be able to use him. I repeat that, in my opinion, the provision to which I have referred is included in the Ordinance to enable the permanent  Chairman,  who will have all power under this Ordinance, to do just what he desires. It may be that some honorable senators will consider that I am drawing the long bow when I say that the Minister will take action in making additions to the Council of Advice for the purpose of putting through any special proposal, only on the advice of the Director of the Territory; but I can only judge the Minister and the Department in Melbourne on their record during the last four or six years. During this period the Department has slavishly followed every recommendation from the Administrator of the Northern Territory as against representations made in this and in another place. I regret that the Minister has, to a far too great extent, taken the advice of the departmental head in slavishly following the recommendations received from Darwin. In the circumstances, I am justified, I think, in saying that the Minister will add members to the Council of Advice to put through any special business only <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the advice of the Director. </para>

I 'have forced upon me the grave suspicion that it is not intended to do very much in the way of putting business before this Council of Advice. Of the many objectionable features of this Ordinance, perhaps the worst is contained in section S. ' I have stated previously that under section 7 of the old Ordinance, the Administrator alone was empowered to bring forward business for discussion. A member of the old Council of Advice had power to put in writing any proposal that he desired to submit to that body, and if the Administrator refused his consent, the member could make known the desire to the Minister. Even this semblance of redress is denied to any member of the Council of Advice under this Ordinance. No member of that body will have the right to bring forward any matter for discussion unless the  chairman  consents to his doing so. Who in this Chamber can stand for that sort of thing?

                                - No ; but we can dissent from his ruling, and our rights are declared and protected by the Standing Orders. A member of this Advisory Council cannot bring forward any business in or out of order unless the  chairman  consents to his doing so. In the light of the experience of the Territory, I have no hesitation in saying that under such an Ordinance only that class of business which is favorable to certain interests will be discussed. Then a member of the Advisory Council is required to give to the Government Secretary seven days' notice that he proposes to make a suggestion in regard to the business of any meeting. But he has no power to do even that unless the  chairman  consents. It is manifest, therefore, that no real power is to be vested in the members of the Council, although it is being created purely for advisory purposes - that is to say, for the guidance of the Minister. Seeing that the Director is to be clothed with such authority, will he not advise the Minister only upon such subjects as he chooses? How powers such as will be conferred by this Ordinance can be reconciled with democratic rule is beyond human understanding. Owing to the peculiar situation which existed in the Territory, a desire was created to provide the residents with some means by which they could ventilate their grievances. That desire aimed at the creation of an elected Advisory Council.  That was the nearest approach which could be given them to the exercise of  a voice in the management of their own affairs. But that consideration has been denied them under this Ordinance, which practically vests all power in the hands of the permanent  chairman  who has recently, 
been appointed Director of the Northern Territory.

                                complained that under section 10 this body will have no power to authorize the appropriation of any public money. That condition, I take it, is regarded as an additional precaution. It was not embodied in Ordinance No. 2 of 1911, which is now being repealed. Section 10 has been inserted, I believe, for the purpose of preventing the Council of Advice from appropriating public money.

                            <para>- I' think that the honorable senator made a good point in connexion with section 8. But I would remind him that when I was in the Territory I received a deputation, which asked me to spend £11,000,000, and that deputation represented only twenty-two persons. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, an elective Council of Advice might be charged with the responsibility of appropriating money for public purposes up to, say, a few thousands of pounds. I' agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that to endow it with unlimited power in that respect would be just as unwise as is this Ordinance. We see, therefore, that no satisfaction will be given to the residents of the Territory by me constitution of the proposed Council. I am sorry that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> has not a better grasp of the situation which obtains there. He certainly should have, because the position has been repeatedly pointed out to him. But it seems to me that, like his predecessors, he is quite content to accept whatever advice the departmental head chooses to tender him. Evidently it is intended to confer upon the Director of the Northern Territory sufficient power to enable him to continue all the evils of the Gilruth <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> What has transpired in the Territory during the past four or five years would provide material for a speech of considerable length. When I investigated the position first-hand, I found that it was much worse than what was generally conceived. Only a few weeks ago I noticed that the Minister for Repatriation, in answer to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> stated that it was the desire of the Government during the next three years to carry out the policy which they h'ad been formulating in regard to the Territory. When I read that I at once scented the intention of the Government to permit of a continuation of the policy which has operated there during the past three or four years. When such unlimited powers as are conferred by this Ordinance are vested in a single individual, it is natural that we should focus particular attention upon him. When we do this, what do we find ? We find that the permanent  Chairman  of the Council of Advice, who has recently been appointed Director of the Northern Territory, went to Port Darwin in 1912 as Private Secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> at a salary of £300 a year. He was not a man of wide reputation at that time, but lie seemed to suit those who were carrying out the Gilruth, policy, and since then his ascent in the. way of emoluments and responsibility has eclipsed anything of which' I have ever heard in any public  service in Australia. A few years after he went to the Territory as Private Secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> when the latter set about ridding himself of all the old South Australian officers who refused to bow down before him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holtze</inline> as Government Secretary, at £500 per year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holtze,</inline> of course, exhibited some backbone, and refused to fall in with every scheme that was initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> About these schemes I shall have something to say when the discussion will not be limited to one matter, as it is on the present occasion. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. As illustrating the meteoric career which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> has had in the Northern Territory, I may mention that soon after his arrival there he was made Government Curator, Government Auditor, and Chief Accountant. Some of these offices carried additional emoluments, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Strang</inline> - man resigned his post in disgust at <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth's</inline> high-handed interference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was made superintendent of the hospital. He was also <inline font-style="italic">ex-officio</inline> head of the Police Department and the gaol. Then when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> Director of. Agriculture, resigned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was made head of - the Agricultural Department. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rylands</inline> resigned the Directorship of Lands, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was made  Chairman  of the Land Board, and shortly after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stretton</inline> resigned the Protectorship -of Aborigines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was made Chief 'Protector. - Then when the Government started the Federal steamer service, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was, of course, put . in charge, and following the departure of the Sheriff for the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> became Sheriff also. The onerous duties of Federal Censor were also thrust upon him, and when the German raider <inline font-style="italic">Emden</inline> threatened Darwin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> assumed control of the Defence Forces, summoned the principal officers of State to a hurried consultation, and as Commander-in-Chief he directed the local Defence Forces. He also attended to the Administrator's correspondence, and arranged who should, and who should not, have private audience with  His Excellency.  He directed what should, and what should  not, be done for Vestey Brothers, and he was Acting Administrator when "  His Excellency  " spent six or twelve months in Melbourne, which was not a rare occurrence. </para>

It is well known that if a man was at variance with the Administrator he could not expect to succeed in the Northern Territory Civil Service. This man, who has now been appointed permanent  Chairman  of the Advisory Council, was so favorably worked by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> that he was appointed practically to everything that was going, because he was " Pooh Bah " to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth's</inline> " Mikado.

                    <para class="block">Director for Vestey Brothers. In reply, let me point out that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was Government Secretary at £600 a year he suddenly resigned and took up a position under Vestey Brothers at.£800 a year. Just about that time communications received from the Northern Territory related certain rumours in regard to leniency in official matters, and an investigating officer was sent from Melbourne to make inquiries. While he was there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was away down south on behalf of Vestey Brothers. When there was some talk of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins being appointed a Commissioner to inquire into what had taken place in the Territory during the past few years, the feeling was strongly held there - and it was firmly grounded - that if it had been necessary Vestey Brothers would have made arrangements to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> was all right. If the Minister wants my opinion in plain language I have no hesitation in saying that I believe that the present Director of the Northern Territory is nothing more than an agent for Vestey Brothers Limited, and that they are the American Beef Trust. On the last day of the sitting, just before the Christmas adjournment, I made inquiries as to a number of holdings that had been acquired by Vestey Brothers in the Territory, and was informed that they held sixty-four pastoral leases. </para>

                            <para>- And the fact that they are holding it is, in my opinion, one reason why the Northern Territory has not progressed. It was the aim of the late Administrator not to allow it to progress. Every effort made at development was retarded by the late Administrator in the interests, I believe, of Vestey Brothers. Obstacles were placed in the way of developing the mining, agricultural, stock-raising, dairying, pig-raising, rice-growing industries, and land settlement generally, with the aim, so the people in the Northern Territory believe - and they are on the spot, and ought to know - of keeping the Territory back " so that Vestey Brothers may have the clear run in the Northern Territory without interference from any other industry. </para>

But with the cunning of the clever, with- the precaution- of the scheming, every one of these transactions has been so well covered up that probably if these statements were investigated, it would be very hard to sheet home responsibility. But everybody knows that these things have occurred, and that these men who set out designedly on such a policy, have left no traces behind them. </para>

Seeing that the people 'there are anxious to have some say in the  management  of their own affairs, surely the' Minister could have met their wishes by the constitution of some public body', which would have enabled them to ventilate their grievances. In the past the chief complaint has been the consistently unsympathetic administration, resulting iri numbers of people being driven out of the Territory.

                            <para>- But they will have 'no power. When we realize what has been going on in the past, we must regard the position as dangerous. I ask the Minister to withdraw the Ordinance; because it will not satisfy the people of the Northern . Territory, and it will not bo of the slightest use. In fact, it will lead to autocratic control, and be retrogressive in comparison with the Ordinance of 1911. Surely, after an interval of eight years the Government will not seek to put upon the people of the Territory an even more autocratic form of rule. The citizens of that part of the Commonwealth have been gravely misrepresented. After the terrible things I had heard about the Territory, I found things, upon my visit, very different from what I might well have expected. I met men in all the various callings represented there. And it was not only the meat worker - with an axe, as depicted in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> - who was after Gilruth. At least 95 per cent, of the community were against him. Surely that must indicate that there was something really wrong. The people could no longer tolerate a continuation of his rule. But I fear that this Ordinance will confer upon his successor the power to carry on and prolong the evils of the past three or four years. In fact, if the Ordinance is put into effect, we shall be handing over the Territory to Vestey Brothers. They will have the power, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> to secure just what they may desire, an precisely the same way in which they gained their ends during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> I cannot conceive of any honorable senator failing to view with concern the proposition of the Government for vesting such power in one individual. </para>

                    <para>I intend on a future occasion to say something respecting the Department itself, in Melbourne. It has been swallowing  holus  bolus every recommendation received from the administrative authority on the spot. If the party who has been appointed  Chairman  of the Council were a civil servant - had he been the Government Secretary - it would have been a different matter. That official had to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> directed, or get out; yet he left the impression upon the minds of the people that he was not altogether subdued. That gentleman struck me as having some force of character, and I do not think he would unthinkingly, and with blind obedience, do everything <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> ordered. I fear, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> will do now as he did while under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> I am afraid that the power which will direct him will be the power wielded by Vestey Brothers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt will receive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey's</inline> recommendations, and will agree with them, and will approvingly forward them to the Minister for authorization. </para>

                            <para>- I remarked a few moments ago that that firm has a great hold of the Territory, and another three years under the proposed <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> will give Vestey Brothers such a grip that they will be able to snap their fingers at the Government so long as they hold their pastoral leases. A' few days before Christmas last I asked a question in -the Senate regarding whether the Minister had any knowledge of discontent in the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> replied, on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> that the Department knew of no discontent; that all the trouble it knew about had to do with a dispute regarding the price of beer. That reply, no doubt, was intended to make honorable senators laugh. I myself laughed, but for hardly the same reason as did other honorable senators, perhaps. If the Department in Melbourne was not aware that there was anything more seriously wrong than a dispute concerning the ,price of beer, then there waa something wrong in the Department itself. I am prepared to borrow a phrase of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and to say that if the chief responsible official at administrative headquarters had no .more information than that concerning the Territory, he must have been either a fool or a rogue. If the official did not know what was going on, he should have known ; and if he did know what has been occurring during the past three or four years, then he has no right to continue in occupation of the position which he fills to-day. One Minister after another during the past few years has accepted the advice to hand from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> which advice was originally received by that gentleman either direct from Vestey Brothers or in the interests of Vestey Brothers. On the contrary, every representation made by the people to the Minister has met with an unsatisfactory response. Honorable senators have good grounds for refusing to ratify this Ordinance. </para>

                            <para>- The Government could bring in an Ordinance to provide for the constitution of a Board of Advice, whose members would be elected by the people on the basis of adult suffrage. Such a body, I admit, would possess power of advice only; but its recommendations, at any rate, would be made to the Director for forwarding to Melbourne, or would be sent direct to the Minister, and perhaps to members of the Federal Parliament. And if the Government were sensible it would not dare to refuse to entertain such representations, df they were at the same time duly ventilated here. The point is, however, that representations from the Territory cannot receive ventilation if they are not made, in the first place; and they are not made to-day because there are no opportunities for making them. </para>

                    <para>I trust that the Ordinance will be disallowed, not only in the interests of the Territory itself, but for the good of Australia as a whole, and for the honour of good government. We desire, even at this late stage, that the Territory shall be given a chance. 7/t is all very well to speak of it as a white elephant and as a sink for public money. It has been so under the conditions which have ruled there - designed to make a failure of that Territory, and to retard its settlement. That is why I advise the Government to present an Ordinance which will constitute an Advisory Council upon the basis of adult suffrage. A Council of that character, I know, would not afford a great measure of self-government, but it would at least provide scope for the residents to voice their grievances and ventilate their wrongs - of which, unfortunately, they have only too many. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire briefly to review the position with respect to the Northern Territory. Concerning much which has been said to-day of the possibilities of the Territory, I am in agreement. But the Ordinance is only a stop-gap, an attempt to bridge an immediate difficulty arising from the war. It was agreed, if not by the vote of Parment, yet by common consent, to go slow in that part of the Commonwealth ; which action, while very unfair to the Territory itself, was enforced by war conditions. </para>

                            <para>- It was, unfortunately, necessary for the Government - for financial " and other reasons - to go slow there. The very fact that a new system of administration has been promulgated may be accepted, to a large extent, as an apology for things that have happened in the past. With a good deal of what Senators Newland and Ferricks have said, I am in agreement. If we were setting out to confer independent government upon the Territory, I would agree also with their remarks regarding adult suffrage and the like; but so long as the Territory is without a Parliament, and has no institutions by which its citizens can wield control over its financial affairs, I do not see what better proposition can be advanced. The limited population of the Territory must not be forgotten as a factor. Its inhabitants number only  1,800  European adults; and not all of them are British or Australian born. No honorable senator present would care to give such a small body of citizens full power and freedom in connexion with the financial affairs of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Some one must be responsible. It has been the policy of the Government that the Commonwealth Parliament, through the Minister concerned, shall accept responsibility. We have not, as a matter of fact, seriously tackled the problem of the Territory ; but I hope that the day is not far distant when a real attempt will be made to thoroughly develop that portion of Australia. The Government do not propose, under this Ordinance, to create anything like an independent Council. The Minister must retain the responsibility, and this body will have no other than advisory powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> spoke of limitations; he stated that the  unofficial members of the Council would have no powers of initiation. They will have powers of initiation, but those will be limited by the judgment of the chairman. Surely honorable senators wilt not ask the Government to establish a body which might be in -direct conflict with the Federal Parliament, responsible as it is for the administration of the Territory ! </para>

                            <para>- If we gave the right of' representation to returned1 soldiers in any Council for the Northern Territory, we equally should give that right to special representation to returned soldiers in this Parliament. I do not believe the returned! soldiers want special representation' in any of our public institutions, but they want the full rights of every other citizen in connexion with powers of election. This is a big advance, because previously there was a nominee Council-. </para>

                            <para>- Four members are now elected to represent special interests. The mining representative is to be selected by the leaseholders and those possessing miners' rights in the Northern Territory. It was impossible to have a selection made by the pastoralists, owing to their interests being so scattered, but when they are ready they will be allowed to submit the name of a nominee to the Minister. The Labour interests in the Territory are to be represented by a- nominee chosen by a plebiscite.. The alternative' is an election on adult suffrage, and the question is. open to. debate whether we should have the interests represented in a small community controlled by a body elected in. tha way I have described or oil adult- suffrage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> knows,, and we all know, what would happen if we elected, a .Council on the basis of adult suffrage.. It would mean that the Port Darwin- community would run- the whole show), and that, the outside interests would  be totally unprotected. It is the desire of the Government to preserve some representation for the miners- oat-back, for the1 pastoralists, and for1 the various other sections'. The Ordinance is- different, also, in- this regard from that which is- being repealled, because the previous Council1 was comprised of civil servants. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it is more by good luck than anything else that we generally get varied interests represented in a Parliament of this sort; but such would not be the case in a small community like Papua or the Northern Territory. This is an Advisory Council and not a legislative body, and it is not expected to carry the responsibility which rightly belongs to the Minister for Home and Territories. Certainly some trappings will disappear, and I do not think that any of us regard that with displeasure. I would like to see a wider extension in this direction, as it would be the means of saving a good deal of money. Whilst the Minister is responsible I do not see how we can have any other system. We cannot delegate the whole of the power to the Administrator of the Territory. Possibly we might get a man who was born for the job, and one to whom we could give unlimited powers ; but, judging by the few men we have been able to get for these positions in the past, that is not likely. I do not speak in a derogatory sense. The wide powers previously given to the Administrator of the Northern Territory were mot acceptable to the local people. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> is to blame, as he has simply done what any honorable senator in this chamber would have done. Vesteys recognised a capable man, and as such individuals do not grow on mulberry trees, they offered him a higher salary than the Government were prepared to offer, and he transferred his services. </para>

                            <para>- The representation of the various parts of the Commonwealth has already been provided for in the Constitution ; but perhaps a system could be arranged whereby a northern Queensland member could have the Northern Territory tacked on to his constituency. It might mean that such a member might take more than a passing interest in its affairs ;but I do not think it can be done under our Constitution. If we were to do that in connexion with the Territory, we would be compelled to do it for other parts of the Commonwealth with a similar population. Strong objection was taken to section  5  by two honorable senators, and, personally, I do not think that section expresses what was really intended. The object of the section was to give the Minister power to appoint additional representatives for any special interests for a short period. Under present conditions the position is very unsatisfactory, particularly in the case of an industrial dispute. I had the experience of handling one, and I found it  very difficult to secure a neutral mind anywhere. If the parties concerned did not object to the Judge, there was always some one else to whom they objected. It is difficult, sitting at the end of a wire in Melbourne, to administer the affairs of the Northern Territory. In connexion with one dispute, there were fifteen suggestions, and as rapidly as new ones were brought. forward they were altered; it was difficult to get an independent mind. Before a decision could be arrived at, we were always sure to meet with opposition from the- other side. The object of the section is to give power, in connexion with industrial disputes, to appoint a local representative on the Council. It may be desirable to ask the manager of Vestey Brothers, as well as the secretary of the Australian Workers Union, to confer at the council table when industrial disputes arise. I  believe  in round table conferences, and the principle of bringing the contesting parties closely together. If parties conferred more, there would be fewer disputes, as very often the difficulties are not so great, and can usually be overcome when discussed in a business-like way. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> very well, because I met him only on one occasion for a short time, but he went from here, not with the power to originate a policy, but to carry out his duties as working administrator under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> As an officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> had no responsibility other than the carrying on of his work under instructions from his superior officer. Where questions of policy were involved, he may have had his own opinions, and there was nothing immoral in carrying out a policy - although it may have been contrary to his own - of his superior officer. </para>

                    <para>The Ordinance may not be perfect, but it goes as far as I think we ought to go until such time as a clear-cut national policy for the development of the Northern Territory is submitted, and that, I hope, will be in the not far distant future. With regard to the various functions carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> I believe that Ministers of the Commonwealth hold as many titles and carry out as many functions, though the business connected with them may not occupy more than an hour or two in a day. In the case of a great m,any of the positions held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> the work involved was merely clerical administration under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> The work, for instance, to be done by. this officer as Director of the Botanical Gardens and under other titles might not occupy more than a few hours in a year. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has to perform certain functions under sixty or seventy different titles. I have had to do the same myself. I was Minister in charge of flax. I had never grown flax, but I had the advantage of the advice of a good scientific committee, who did all the work. It may be that once in three months I signed certain documents or an Order in Council, but I did not on that account profess to be running the flax industry of Australia, although I was nominally responsible 'for the way in  which the industry was conducted. In a place like the Northern Territory one officer will necessarily have charge of a great many different matters. He may be Director of Lighthouses, and, as possibly there is only one lighthouse at Port Darwin, he would not have very much work to do  in that position. In the circumstances, it is to the credit, rather than the discredit, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> that he was appointed to all these positions, as that indicates his administrative ability. </para>
                    <para>I do not put the Ordinance forward as a perfect instrument of government, and I do not desire to force it upon honorable senators. The government of a country is a very serious matter, and this Ordinance is not submitted in a party spirit. It ds our desire to secure the best form of government possible for the Northern Territory. If honorable senators wish to go into the matter thoroughly, I am prepared to listen to any suggestions they may make, and if they desire further time for the consideration of the matter, I am willing that a little more time should be given for that purpose. As an Australian, I have felt that we have not been doing sufficient to develop the Northern Territory as  it  ought to be developed. When the financial strain, due to the war, is at an end, I shall be prepared to assist in the fullest development of the Territory, and in securing for  it  the most democratic form of government that can be proposed. It appears to me that we should hesitate to confer very wide powers of government upon any body in the Northern Territory, where there is such a small white population, the members of which, unfortunately, are not all British. If they were all British, we might take a more liberal view of the powers with which they might be intrusted. </para>
                    <para>I hope that honorable senators, in discussing the Ordinance, will not . go at length into what individuals may have done in the past. None of us have done well by the Northern Territory, and it is not to the credit even of this Parliament that it should remain in its present undeveloped condition. We all recognise that Australia cannot expect to continue to hold an unoccupied Territory without developing it. There is room for great development in the Northern Territory, and I  hope  that we shall be in a position to insure its development by white men. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators are under obligations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> for bringing this matter up <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> discussion. I listened with great interest to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that it would have been better if this Ordinance had been brought before us in the form of a Bill. I take it that we have to accept it or reject it as it stands. We cannot amend it. On this account <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has complained that it has been brought before us in a rather undemocratic way. Perhaps the Minister has submitted it in this way in order to save time. It may be that there is not a great deal in the appointment of a Council of Advice, and, personally, I think there is not, but the difficulty is to suggest anything to take its place. I assume that in discussing the Ordinance, even though1 we should reject it, our idea is to let the Government know what we think should take its place. Senators Newland and Ferricks have, at considerable length and with a good deal of ability, discussed the Ordinance, and we are indebted to them for doing so. I point out that each has made one suggestion to take the place of the Ordinance under discussion, and these suggestions differ from each other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> suggests that there should be direct representation of the Northern Territory in this Parliament by two members in the House of Representatives and one senator in this chamber. Not bad representation for about 4,000 European residents. I do not know whether the Constitution would permit of the representation of the Territory by one senator in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> suggests that there should be an elected Council of Advice. Those are the only two alternative suggestions which have been made, if we reject the Ordinance. I confess that at the ,present time I cannot see my way to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> proposal that the Territory should have two representatives in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that, it has a. very important bearing- upon it. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> is not prepared to ask for- anything more than a Council of Advice. The difficulty I am. in is- that the Ordinance is placed before us and we must accept or- reject it, whilst none of the proposals so far made seem to me to be satisfactory alternatives for what the Government have proposed. In the circumstances, I feel that I must support the Ordinance as it stands. </para>

                            <para>- I still hold to my opinion of him. I do mot know sufficient about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> to say whether he is likely to make a good, bad, or indifferent Administrator. But it is extremely unfortunate that the Government should have lowered the prestige attaching to his office.  His  predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> was paid a salary of £1,750 a year, together with an allowance of £500. Now the Government 9ay that £1,000 a year is a sufficient salary, and I understand that, in addition, they intend allocating to the newly appointed director of the Territory a sum of £70 annually, either for entertainment purposes or to cover the rental of his residence. These facts suggest that Ministers are losing faith in the Northern, Territory. I .was very glad indeed to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> say that the last report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> waa of a most optimistic character. I am pleased to note the way  in which the Territory has developed during the past year or two. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> is the proper man for the position to which he has been appointed, he certainly ought not to receive a less salary than his predecessor. If the mere reduction in the salary attaching bo any. office is the .only way in which the Government can economize, the position is, indeed, a peculiar one. Let me point to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank  by way of analogy. A Labour Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller,</inline> Governor of that  institution at a salary of £4,000 per year. Now, I believe that a manager could be obtained to run it for £1,500 a year, and doubtless the services of other _ managers could be secured for a salary of £600 a year. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; that is my point. I do mot think that £4,000 a year is too much to pay ito the .Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dennison</inline> Miller is worth every penny of it. So if the Government appointed a man in his place at .a salary of £2,000 annually, would that be true economy? No one would think so for a minute. 1 </para>

                    <para>Then, I take it  that .to .attempt 'to manage the affairs of the Northern Territory from Melbourne is one of the biggest farces imaginable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> spoke of the Government being controlled by a single person in the Territory. Whilst I occupied the .position of Minister for External Affairs, to a very great extent that was the position. I may have .been wrong in my selection of a gentleman to fill the post of Administrator, but I had implicit trust in him, and consequently I said to him, " Go to the Northern Territory and see what you can do with it, and, as far as possible, I will support you." That is the position which I took up. Now the present Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> amongst other things, writes quite a lot of pamphlets. The writing of these pamphlets occupies a great deal of his time. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that the Government should have lowered the prestige attaching to the position of Administrator by appointing a man to succeed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> at a decreased salary, and evidently with the idea of managing the affairs of the Territory from Melbourne. I have listened attentively to the objections which have been urged to this particular Ordinance. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> made a very fair point in his condemnation of the provisions of section S of it. Under that section nothing can come before the Council of Advice unless with the chairman's consent. That is rather a pity. Whilst T do not think that the Council need waste time in discussing political questions, there may be some matters which the people of the Territory earnestly desire should be brought before it. After all, the Council is created purely for advisory purposes, and the Government are tinder no obligation to accept its advice. </para>

                        <para>. -  To my mind, there is no reason why the Government should not consent to withdraw this Ordinance, in order that it may be made to conform somewhat to modern ideas. Under it, Ministers propose to entirely ignore the views of a majority of the residents of the Northern Territory, and to place in the hands of a  single official the power to make recommendations to the authorities in Melbourne. The proposal is that the Council of Advice shall consist of a  chairman  and seven members - three official and three non-official members. The appointments, I take it, are to be made by the Minister. Would it not be far better if the people of Port Darwin were allowed to elect their own Council, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> on the basis of its adult population? Such a Council would be able to make recommendations which could either be accepted or rejected by the Minister. But as matters stand, the Minister will elect whom he thinks fit to the Council of Advice, and later on a number of other gentlemen will be nominated to it. In other words, the will of the people will have no play whatever. Seeing that the Council has no legislative authority whatever, but will be possessed merely of the power of recommendation, of what is the Minister afraid? Why does he not agree to the withdrawal of the Ordinance, in order that it may be recast upon lines which will permit of the election of a Council of Advice upon an adult population basis? If effect were given to my suggestion, it does not necessarily follow that the residents of Port Darwin would dominate the Council. As a matter of fact, it might result in the election to that body of persons representing all the interests of the Territory. This Parliament, for example, is elected on an adult suffrage basis, and yet all the interests of the Commonwealth are represented in it. Why, then, does the Minister fear that a Council of Advice, elected upon similar lines, would not faithfully represent all the interests of the Territory? This Ordinance clearly indicates that it is the intention of the Government to ignore the will of a majority of the people of the Territory, and to insure that certain interests shall have undue representation upon the proposed Advisory Council. When these gentlemen meet, they will make recommendations to the Minister in their own interests} and, armed with this authority, the Minister will formulate' new Ordinances, and still further strengthen the autocratic hand of the Director. I have not yet had an opportunity of visiting Darwin. It is a great pity that all members of this Parliament do not take advantage of the facilities offering to make themselves personally acquainted with that portion of Australia. If they visited the Territory they would be in a better .position to give an expression of opinion regarding the situation than can possibly be given from the perusal of annual reports drafted by the Administrator. These reports are long enough, but not very many of them are interesting, and certainly they do not contain that information which one could gain at firs) hand by visiting the Territory.. The time has long since gone by when any Parliament should agree to the creation of a body of this kind. No one will suggest that this Advisory Council will faithfully represent the people of Darwin, and I, for one, am not prepared to vote for the Ordinance. I hope it will be withdrawn, and that the Minister will present one which will more faithfully coincide with the views of honorable senators as disclosed in the course of this debate. If this is done there will be nothing to retard the progress of the Northern Territory, because the people then will have some degree of responsibility, whereas at present they have no voice in the election of members  to this Council. It may be inopportune at the present time, though I doubt it, to extend to the people of Darwin absolute home rule. I think they are prepared for it, and I believe it will have to be granted them in the future. The sooner the position is faced the better. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not know what is best to be done for the Territory, because I am unable from a perusal of the annual reports  to get all the information I desire. I should like to know how the country is held, who holds it, under what terms it is leased, and for how long the leases will be operative. I am informed that the stations there are so large that their boundaries are "defined, not in the ordinary way, but by the parallels of latitude. If it is profitable to occupy the Territory in this way, and I have no doubt it is,  we may be quite sure that this new Advisory Council will not remedy the position, because the public interests will be, to a large extent, ignored. I appeal to the Minister to review the position, and by a new Ordinance allow the people of Darwin the right to elect members to the Advisory Council. It has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that they would not take the trouble to conduct an election. That is one of the greatest mistakes that honorable senator has made for a considerable time. We know that elections for the British Parliament are invariably keenly contested, and that tens of thousands of pounds are spent for the honour of' assisting in making the laws of the Mother Country. The same may be said of elections to the municipal councils in Australia. In very many cases large sums of money are expended by candidates for the honour, not of legislating, but of administering, the laws given to them by the State Parliaments. There need be no fear about an election for members of the Advisory Council in Darwin not being keenly contested. On the contrary, I think- that practically every man there would be anxious to exercise the franchise, and if this right were given to them we would have the satisfaction of knowing that their representatives would not be the creatures of two or three men away in the back-blocks, or of certain vested interests, but that they would be men, and possibly women, elected by the votes of the adult population. I understand the Territory comprises about 500,000 square miles of country, which is bound to be developed in the future, but we may be sure that no progress will be made if it is tied up with regulations suggested by an Advisory Council nominated by the Minister, .or by some other person. For these reasons, I ask the Minister to with- - draw the Ordinance, review the situation, realize that public opinion is progressing, and that everywhere there is a demand for' home rule. Although there is but a small community in the Northern . Territory, the sooner we extend to them some real measure of home rule the better it' will be foi- this -Parliament, for the Territory, !and the Common wealth. </para>

                        PRATTEN  (New South Wales' [5.44]. - I did not intend to join in this debate, but it seems to
                        <inline font-style="italic">me-</inline>
                        that, although the immediate matter brought up by

                        does not appear to- be of supreme importance, we are really engaged in discussing the future of the northern part of Australia. I listened with interest to the speeches -made by other honorable senators, and I take it that the two principal points involved are, firstly, that the new Director of the Northern Territory,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline>
                        will practically continue the Gilruth
                        <inline font-style="italic">regime;</inline>
                        and, secondly, that the Advisory Council, as. proposed in this Ordinance, will -be dominated by the new Director. There has been a great paucity of imagination in connexion with the administration of the Northern Territory, and this so-called reform. I have had the privilege of visiting Darwin on more than one occasion,' and on my last visit was struck with the wa&gt;nt of .progress in the years that had intervened. Certainly there was a big meat .works establishment, erected at a cost of possibly . £750,000, and many hundreds of aliens - 'Greeks and Russians - had been added to the population; but I saw no signs of real progress. If this Chamber disallows the Ordinance, and it goes back to the Home and Territories Department, it will indicate that, in the opinion of the Senate, it is high time some imagination was shown in connexion with the development of the Territory. I have held the view for a long time that those who keep must develop. The time is rapidly approaching when we shalT have to view this matter from an international stand-point; when we will have to get to work on the development of the science of aviation as related to the Northern Territory.
                    </para>
                    <para>Those who know the Territory best must be driven to the conclusion that practical development may be looked for from two industries, viz., mining and cattle raising. It is highly probable that in that vast area there are a good many potential centres of mining activity, which could be developed with a progressive policy. We know that men ' will brave the cold of Klondyke, the heat of Central Africa, or the rigours of Siberia, or any other part of .the world in their search for gold or precious minerals, and I believe that if a progressive policy were adopted by the Minister and the organizations in control in the Northern Territory, we would record some extremely payable mining developments there. We  Know,  however, that the Bolshevik tendencies of some of the people there constitute one of the chief difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- I am satisfied that none of those aliens will lift a finger to fight for the Territory, or anything else; but. I think some measure of home rule, some compromise developed on the principles of this Ordinance, .would be beneficial. I appreciate . to the full the very many difficulties that have been encountered by the Government in the development' of that part of Australia, which has been a  6ink,  . speaking from memory, for the expenditure of about £250,000 per annum. If we had an imaginative policy - a progressive and liberal policy - in connexion with the Territory, now would be the time to show activity, seeing that we have some chance of development when the population of Australia is being so largely augmented. I shall support the motion for the purpose of remitting the Ordinance to the Department concerned. I will not stand for the continuation of the dictatorship experienced under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> I will not stand for giving the Director further dictatorship, such as this Ordinance would confer. It is time the Department of Home and Territories presented some schemes-it need be merely a skeletonic proposal - for discussion by this Parliament in the interests of the true development of the Territory. I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> being some what on the horns of a dilemma at this moment, seeing that at one time he had Ministerial control of the Territory, and was concerned in the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> Probably he is unable to entirely rid himself of the shackles which, were then upon him. I hope the motion, will be agreed to, if only for the reason that Parliament should not be content to continue the tactics of the past, and will not be satisfied to shut its eyes to what is going on in the Territory. The people of that part of the Commonwealth are entitled to a measure of home rule, but such home rule cannot be expected to include the voting and expenditure of money or any dabbling with the politics of this Parliament. I do not believe that 4,000 people resident in the Territory have the right to claim Federal representation. We know full well that at election, time it would be almost impossible for more than half of the votes of citizens to be polled, seeing that about half of the total population is scattered over hundreds of thousands of square miles, and that the polling would be almost entirely confined to residents in and about Port Darwin. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot admit that this Parliament is a stumbling block to the welfare of the Territory. All the statements which have been so far made have had to do with the usurpation of powers by the Administrator or of the exercise of his powers in a wrong direction. The Federal Parliament would not solve such difficulties even if it permitted twenty representatives of the Territory to enter this Legislature. There is something practical in the suggestion for the establishment of an elective local Council. I have some friends in the Territory, who have been following various mining interests. They have informed me that there is an element in that, part of the Commonwealth which constitutes a source of danger, not only to itself, but to everybody resident there. I refer to the alien element, which is not in harmony with the Democracy of Australia. If we were to confer adult suffrage, with direct representation upon an elective Council at Port Darwin, the interests of the Territory itself would be swamped, generally speaking, and Darwin would rule. I am anxious to witness genuine development, and, while I do not see that the Ordinance will bring about ideal conditions, I believe that- it will be a step towards improvement. No better proposition has" been offered for the solution of the Territory's difficulties. I know that an elected body, possessing limited powers, would probably represent a progressive step; but I am of opinion that the Ordinance itself provides a better scheme than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> The various interests of the Territory will be represented upon the Council. </para>

                            <para>- The position would not be the same. In fact, it would be difficult to give such representation then. You cannot have adult suffrage and at the same time grant representation of interests. There must be majority rule where adult suffrage is the law. The proposition for the representation of various interests is really the best suggestion so far offered. </para>

                            <para>- The Administrator, whoever he may be, will have the Council around him. Its members will be able to discuss such questions as the Administrator may permit. It will be very largely a matter of the individual himself, and not of the-powers which the Council may or may not possess. If the Director is sane and sensible, and truly desires to develop the Territory, he will allow the Council to ventilate matters aimed at the development of the Territory, and intended for the solution of the grievances of the people; but if he is an autocrat, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> there will be trouble. I trust that the Government will pay close attention to the subjects coming before the Council for discussion, and that if it should -appear that the  Chairman  is using his powers to block the legitimate ventilation of grievances, and to thwart- the genuine desires of the people, his powers will be limited or taken, away from -him. At present, I am walling to give my support to the Ordinance by way of experiment. </para>

                    <para>I rose chiefly to emphasize a point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks;</inline> that is with regard 'to the number of leases which have been given away. The Territory to-day is practically in the hands of a few land-holders. A friend of mine departed from a certain  Queensland centre som'e time ago as the representative of a community of settlers in one of the best of our agricultural districts. Beginning his activities from Cloncurry, my friend, together with another gentleman, fitted out a team at a cost of £250. Then he set out to investigate the Territory  lands  on behalf of the community whom he was leaving behind, and who were almost all determined to follow 'him. Ere he set out, he and his associates secured all the  data  available. They perused all the maps which they could lay their hands upon, but found that the whole of these were of very little use. My friend entered the Territory armed with such  information.  'as he could gather; he journeyed from one waterhole to another, and examined  the  land around every water frontage that he had heard about. Everywhere, however, right from the Queensland border to Darwin itself, he discovered that the pick of the Territory, containing all the water, had been taken up by some one else - by Vestey Brothers. </para>

                            <para>- The whole of the money subscribed by that little community of pioneers was wasted, and all the people behind ray friend in his investigations had to be disappointed. Not one settler went to the Territory, for the reason that all the water frontages had been, taken up. My friend did not let the matter drop at that stage, however. He travelled to Melbourne and fought the question out with the Department. He was able to point out that the maps in the possession of the Home and Territories office were of little more value than so many blank sheets of  paper.  The officials obviously had no conception even of the number of leases granted, much less with respect to the nature and the number and the situation of the various sources of water supply. They did not realize that all the water frontages had been leased away. The administration of the Territory, so far, in relation to the issue of pastoral leases, has been most unfortunate. I have' taken a keen interest in the Territory for years, and have discussed its welfare and development with people who possess first-hand knowledge aud experience, either as cattle men or miners, or the like. I am convinced that the  manner  in which leases have been given away has proved anything but good for the Territory. If we are going to push on with settlement, something urgent and drastic must be done in respect to those leases. In the instance which I have- munitioned, some twenty or thirty families would have taken up holdings, but that they found that vested interests had already secured the sources of water supply. It would not have paid those settlers to take up dry country and spend their money in putting down bores merely on "spec." </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support . the motion. One might well believe, when reading this Ordinance, that one was (perusing the Constitution of the legislative Council of Victoria. The Department which promulgated the Ordinance must have been delving into the musty old tomes of fifty years ago. Whilst I am a representative of the people, I intend speaking on their behalf. The Government should be concerned in the working of the Territory, and we should have the means in this Parliament .of ascertaining what is really in the minds of the people living there. The Ordinance under review does not make any provision at all in that direction. We have appointments all made hy the Government, and everybody knows that the Government are likely to have a Council of people of their own political opinions. This Council will be ruled by the Government, notwithstanding the opinions expressed by their advisers. Members of this Parliament are so far removed from the Northern Territory, and the means of communication are so inadequate, that members have not the opportunity of becoming conversant with the actual conditions. We have to rely on the information we receive from the residents there. The Council of Advice should have on it representatives of the people who are earning their living there and expecting to permanently settle in that part of the country. I have no objection to the first three nominees mentioned in the Ordinance being appointed by the Government, but the other four should be elected by the residents of the Territory. The Administrator may be a smart and able man, but he is not to be there for the term of his natural life; he is merely a Government servant, who will . later on be looking for a lucrative appointment in some more salubrious part of the Commonwealth. The Administrator may be an honest man ; but he is not as well qualified to conduct affairs in that part of the country as those who are familiar with its conditions. Under this Ordinance all of the members of the Council are to be nominated by the Government. </para>

It should provide that four of the nominees should be elected by the people on the same lines as we are elected to this Parliament. We cannot accept this Ordinance and at the same time satisfy those people who are directly concerned. There is a most outrageous provision in the Ordinance, which reads - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but we can move to dissent from his rulings. The Government cannot expect a Parliament elected as we are to pass such an Ordinance. We are elected by the people of Australia, whose every vote has the same value. It is our duty to see that the people in this far-distant part of Australia have a fair deal. The settlers in the Northern Territory are real pioneers, and are endeavouring to develop what we hope will some day be a tremendous asset to Australia. I believe that, up to now, the. possibilities of development in that country have not been the concern of the Government or of the people of the Territory so much as they have been of private individuals. The people must have an opportunity of expressing their desires and aspirations to the Government of the Commonwealth, and the best means of doing this would be by, direct representation in this Parliament. </para>

Their only opportunity of ventilating their grievances is through representatives of other parts of the Commonwealth, an'dthat is. not a fair position. As the Constitution will not allow the Territory to be directly represented in this Parliament the next best thing is for them to have representation through the people elected in their own part of the country, but this Ordinance does not provide even that. It is my intention to vote against the measure and every other provision that the Government bring along until satisfactory arrangements are made for the wants of these people being brought before Parliament in the proper manner. Most of us were particularly dissatisfied with the Parliaments of Australia until the interests of the people were properly represented. </para>

                        O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [6.15]. - As a South Australian member I naturally take particular interest in the Northern Territory, more especially because it was attached to South Australia, and was a part of a district I represented for a number of years. Looking at the Ordinance, it is puzzling to me to know why it was promulgated or where it leads. Provision is made to allow the Minister to consult with the officials in the Northern Territory, hut he can do that without any special Ordinance of this kind. I would welcome any provision that would place the affairs of the Northern Territory in a better position than they are to-day. A good many years ago I was a member of a Royal Commission, consisting of members of the South Australian Parliament, that went into the affairs of the Northern Territory, and I do not think conditions have improved .since then. I have to be guided largely by the .opinions expressed by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland, Senator Ferricks,</inline>
                        and

                        who have recently visited the Territory, and have up-to-date knowledge of the conditions prevailing there.

                        are strongly opposed to the Ordinance, and

                        condemns it with faint praise. Until recently the Government Resident has had autocratic powers. "When the Territory was under the control of South Australia it was represented by two live members in the House of Assembly, but since it has been taken over by the Commonwealth there have been no direct representatives, and it has been under autocratic control. This provision means that the control will be similar to what it has been in the past, because, although a Council is to be appointed, the  Chairman  can do practically what he likes, and is subject only to  the will of the Minister. I join with others who advocate democratic principles, and favour a Council elected by the people who have to live under the " regulations provided under the Ordinance.

                            <para>- Yes. Any one who does work of a legislative nature should be paid. On reading the various provisions of the Ordinance I think they could be summed up by saying that the  Chairman  of the Council established under this Ordinance is to be allowed to do just as he thinks fit, subject only to the supervision of the Minister. There have been many changes in the Ministers controlling the Northern Territory, but they have all found it a difficult proposition. The Territory is so far away, and the means of communication, especially of late years, have been so frequently interrupted, 'that the Minister has had to depend on the advice of the Administrator and others in his confidence. This Ordinance seems to me to be intended to. establish a Council of Advice, merely as a sort of buffer between the Minister and the Director of the Territory. It may relieve the Minister of some responsibility and enable him to say, in respect of matters upon which there is a difference of opinion, that the view he takes is supported by' the Council of Advice, whilst, at the same time, the Council of Advice may not be in touch with the people who will be affected by the administration which may be proposed. That is the great weakness of the Ordinance. I support the motion to disallow it. I' do not think that the Northern Territory will suffer in any way if this Ordinance is consigned to the waste-paper basket. The debate which has taken place on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> motion may render it possible for some more democratic and common-sense  proposal to be devised for the government of the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with a good deal of attention to the debate. There is one aspect of the matter which appears to have escaped attention, and to that I shall address myself very briefly. The Government are proposing to do by regulation something which might have been better done by the passing of a short Act by this Parliament. If the Government had introduced a short Bill, under which they might call to their assistance the advice of honorable senators who have been to the Territory, that would have been better than the calling together of a Council of Advice in the Northern Territory, as proposed by this Ordinance. I may say that I have been disappointed beyond measure with the conduct of affairs in the Northern Territory by the Government. I was looking forward to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> being transferred from your position, governing here, to the position of Governor in the Northern Territory. I think that the time has arrived when the real development of the Territory is necessary, and that a man accustomed to governing unruly spirits, accustomed to the exercise of authority, acquainted with the forms of government, a man who has pioneered in Queensland and has been accustomed to a tropical climate, might well, if transferred to the Northern Territory, have helped to add another province to Australia. The anticipation that you, sir, 'would be the gentleman who would secure the appointment as Director of Affairs in the Northern Territory was one of the things to which I was looking forward with pleasure should it be my fortune to be a member of the next Federal Parliament. There was another hopeful prospect in my mind, and that was that, failing your appointment, the Government might appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> to the position. </para>

I hold that a man who has had experience in the public life of the country is, to a certain extent, equipped to deal with any question of government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> appointment would have given me extreme pleasure. He has taken an active interest in the Northern Territory ; he has visited it, and has followed the reports and records of the Territory, and the attention he has given to that part of the Commonwealth would have warranted consideration of his claims to the appointment. The honorable senator mav, for all I know, have been offered the position and refused it. Such appointments would have been better than to go out of our way to appoint a representative of vested interests as Director of the Northern Territory. </para>

                                says that the company had nothing to do with it; but I say that all our appointments should be absolutely above suspicion. I do not think that I am an unduly suspicious man; but I believe that if a question arose in connexion with which the interests of Vestey Brothers were opposed to Australia's interests, this gentleman, coming direct from Vestey Brothers, would naturally be influenced by his previous association with that company.

Mav I not include myself amongst the people who would have been pleased to assist in adding the Northern Territory as a new province to Australia? If it had been my good fortune to be sent to the Northern Territory as Administrator, I should have called to my counsel the extremists of both sides - the Bolshevik land-owners and the slow-going land-owners; the men who will not work, and are satisfied to let the Territory earn their living for them. I would have called to my counsel the greatest Tories I could find in the Territory. and also the most extreme Radicals. </para>

                            <para>- It is strange how great minds run in the same groove. I was just about to mention others who could fill the position with equal capacity, and I specially had in mind one class of men from whom a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> might have been selected - I refer to our returned soldiers. Seeing thai the Government have laid themselves out to induce the public to believe that they are anxious to find positions for our returned soldiers, would it not have been an excellent thing for them to have selected from the ranks of these men one who was capable of filling the office to which I have alluded ? But even in this chamber there is one man, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who has been prominent in pioneering work, and who might have filled the position with great distinction. I would have been very pleased, indeed, had he been selected for the post. It would have saved the necessity for the adoption of a new standing order in this chamber, having for its object the curtailment of our speeches. Yet, despite this wide field of choice, the Ministry has selected for the important office of Director of the Northern Territory a man whose capacity to fill it is totally unknown to them. To me it is quite evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> had a very good friend in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> There is no mistake about that aspect of the matter. No man could be a member of this Parliament very long without becoming acquainted with what has transpired  in the Northern Territory during the past four years. During that period a condition of things has obtained there which one would have thought the Government would have laboured strenuously to alter. There may have been some reason for the statement of the Minister that while the war was in progress he could not deal with this matter in the way that it ought to be dealt with. But the war is now over, and, consequently, there ought to be in this Ordinance some evidence that the 'Government intend to vigorously grapple with the  problems of the Northern Territory. Yet this Ordinance shows that they have no intention whatever of endeavouring to make that part of Australia profitable to the people of the Commonwealth, and to adequately guard that portion of our continent against invasion. This aspect of the matter brings me to the real question at issue in the Northern Territory. When <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen,</inline> one of the ablest geologists in the world, was appointed to the Territory, I received quite a number of letters from him. I had had the privilege of his friendship before his appointment, and 1" do not hesitate to say that he was absolutely 'driven out of the country by men who were opposed to his political views. With all these facts before the Government, if there were a shadow of excuse for delaying action regarding the Territory while the war was in progress, that exCUSE has now vanished. Yet this Ordinance shows either that the Government are afraid to proceed with the development of the Territory or that they have no time to attend to this back door of Australia. I have had some experience of tropical climates. At one period of my life I spent more than twelve months in Fiji. That experience convinced me that white people can stand tropical conditions better than can coloured people. But in Fiji the white employer did not care how many coloured labourers died. The latter were being brought into the country in thousands, and - if hundreds of them perished that was no concern of his. As a matter of fact, the white employer there was not satisfied with cheap coloured labour - he wanted to secure the cheaper coolie labour. Similarly, the property- owning class of the Northern Territory do not desire that country to be developed by white labour, because its employment would mean the .payment of good wages and the observance of proper industrial conditions. It is quite a remarkable circumstance that those who believe that the Northern Territory is not a fit place for white men to live in habitually come down to the southern portion of Australia, .and freely air their views of that country in the columns of the daily press. They tell us that they have lived in .the Northern Territory for many years, that they have enjoyed good health there, and that they have prospered  there. Yet they add, "It is not a fit place for white men to live in." They want cheap Japanese and Chinese labour and the cheaper coloured labour of India, if possible. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. One day when I was walking along a road in Fiji, I came across an Australian gum tree.. I went back and brought my wife to see this gum tree .growing there, and it was the smell of that tree which induced me to return to my own native land. The employing class in Fiji, like the employing class in the Northern Territory, are not satisfied with cheap coloured labour, but desire to obtain the cheaper coolie labour of India. Within two years of the period when the employing class in Fiji began to import  coolie  labour there, the white population of the place had dwindled by 25 per cent. All the positions were filled by coolies, including those of shop assistants and typesetters. What is the secret of the success of Britain as a colonizing Power ? It is the fact that wherever the Britisher goes he carries with him his ideas of government, and he generally finds a means of establishing a form of government based upon the British system. Look at the development of our own country. From the moment that the people here insisted upon  their  right to govern themselves, our progress was marked. The more self-government we have had, the greater has- been the measure of our progress. Yet all the time property-owners have been exclaiming that , as soon as a certain, class were placed in charge of the machinery of government, ruin would overtake them. If we agree to this Ordinance, under which all the power will be vested in the Director of the Northern Territory, we shall be continuing an utterly vicious, system. I do not wish to join in any clamour against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> but from the stand-point of progress I see very little in the Northern Territory to mark his term of office. Had he put forward any proposal, small or great, which promised the development of that Territory, there has been no Government in office which would not have supported him. But the very reverse- has been the case. He has failed in initiative. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it will take time. That was our experience in the early development of Australia. Any honorable senator who reads those excellent historical records containing the official correspondence must come to the conclusion that those chiefly concerned in the development of this country had a wide outlook. From .the point of view of those in London, in the early days of Australian, colonization, Sydney (or Botany Bay, as it was then called) had not nearly so promising a future as Port Darwin has at the present moment. But, happily, those intrusted with -the development of the country were gifted with a wide vision. Governor Phillip, in the lay-out of Sydney, reserved all  that  area which now forms the centre of the city as the property of the Crown for ever, and if his scheme had been carried out the city of Sydney would to-day be a city beautiful. <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham. - Is it not that now ?</inline></para>

Then came the time of the rum 'contractors, of men who could see only their own profits and bad no vision of the future. After Governor Phillip came Macquarie, who was responsible for those exploration parties which penetrated into the heart of the unknown interior, and the construction of roads- across the Blue Mountains, thus opening up Australia as a stock-raising country. </para>

                    <para>If we read the history of Australia aright, we must realize that the success, which has attended our developmental enterprises up to the present has depended largely on the capacity of men at the head of affairs. Now, unfortunately, we have the spectacle of a Government, with a -province as rich as New South Wales was regarded in the early days - and which with rapidly improving means of  communication  must have infinitely better prospects - coming down and saying that this Ordinance is the best they can do for the development 'of that magnificent inheritance. I wish the Minister would withdraw .the Ordinance, but I know that if the question comes to a vote the Government will win, not upon the judgment, but through the loyalty, of their followers. I am satisfied that those who vote for the Ordinance will do so, not-  because they indorse the Ordinance, but because they feel it to be their duty to support the Government.- I would like the Minister to realize the importance of the Northern Territory, and what its future may be, if only the Government have the courage to attempt its development under white conditions. This principle must be asserted. All this talk about white people not being able to live in tropical countries is moonshine. The wealthy whites can live there very well, and prosper. </para>

For my part, I would rather live in the hottest tropical, part of Australia than come to this . miserable ice chest of Victoria. I can easily understand why people from New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia wonder how we can exist through the winter in Melbourne. I feel as strong physically as most men, but the inroads which this wretched climate has made upon my health make me long for the time when the Seat of Government will be moved to Canberra. </para>

                    <para>I understand that the new standing order will limit speeches to one hour and a half. I intend to practise now by trying to keep to the time-table on this motion, and I intimate that on all future occasions I shall take my full time allowance on every subject that comes up for discussion in this chamber. I shall conclude my remarks now by saying that the development of the Northern Territory is a big proposition worthy of the best attention the Government can give to it. I ask them to withdraw this Ordinance, to submit a short Bill embodying their ideas as to the best means of governing the Territory, and invite members of this Parliament as a whole, and not as members of a party, to co-operate in devising the best legislative machinery for the government of that part of Australia, and not to seek to govern it as, under this Ordinance, by placing all power in the hands of one man. The  Ordinance,  in my opinion, is unworthy of consideration. The Minister would be well advised to try and get Parliament to deal with this matter in an earnest manner, because I believe that, -under wise administration, the northern part of Australia will become the populous home of white Australians, and one of the most prosperous portions of this continent. </para>

I listened with great interest to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> who, unlike most of us, has been a Minister of the Crown, and was administering the Northern Territory when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> was appointed. In the course of his speech, he appeared to be in two minds as regards the Ordinance. He did not want to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> motion to disallow it altogether; he admired <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks'</inline> proposal for an elective system in regard to the Advisory Council, and then concluded by. saying that he would support the Government. I can scarcely understand how a man of his wide experience and administrative capacity could find himself in the position of not knowing where he stood. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> cannot support an Ordinance which will have the  effect  of placing power entirely in the hands of one. man; and while that honorable senator may be right in saying that we must either disallow the whole Ordinance or accept it, would it not be better to disallow it than adopt it with its many objectionable features, some of which were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> himself? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> referred to Bolshevists in the Northern Territory.

                            <para>- If that is the honorable senator's definition of Bolshevism, all I can say is that hundreds of  residents in the Northern Territory are Australian citizens, born and bred there, and if this jibe is to be hurled at them because they desire to get some system of self-government, then we are all Bolshevists. I want to know whether, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> Bolshevism means mob rule or autocracy. So far as the Ordinance is concerned, I think it means autocracy in its purest and simplest form, because it seeks to place the whole of the destinies of the people of the Northern Territory in the hands of one man, who, according to section 8, will have the right to determine whether the Council shall discuss any particular question. I am sure no honorable senators can agree to a proposition of that nature. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> is not a Bolshevist, and I am sure that, as  chairman  of directors of the many concerns with which he is connected, he would not take unto himself all the authority which this Ordinance vests in one man, as the  chairman  of the Advisory Council. I feel sure also that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> realizes what this Ordinance means, he will not vote for it in its present form. Mention has been made of the possibilities of the Territory. I visited it as a member of a Federal parliamentary party in 1907. During the two months which I spent in those northern parts, I was struck by the possibilities of that tropical climate. I saw white people just as healthy and vigorous as are those with Whom I have come into contact in this rigorous southern climate of Melbourne. Let me take as an example a gentleman named Giles, who drove portion of our party from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles</inline> was then about sixty-five years old. He was born a few miles down from Pine Creek. He had travelled the overland route to Oodnadatta on three or four occasions. He was a grandfather, and I had the pleasure of meeting his progeny - all vigorous people. Again, at Wolfram Creek I saw a family of white folk, and there was a baby boy of nine months in the arms of his mother, who impressed me as being as fine a specimen of Australian childhood as I have ever seen; which proves to me that white people may be reared as well an our northern coastal country as in any other part of Australia. The possibilities of our Northern Territory - pastoral, agricultural, mineral, and otherwise - are illimitable, and we can develop them under a proper system of government. But I regret that, since the Commonwealth Government took over control and responsibility from South Australia, the Territory has been practically a no man's land. I blame all recent Governments for a lack of concentration and determination upon the' development of that rich area. I condemn all Governments concerned ako in regard tn the indisputable fact that, whereas they have looked upon Port Darwin as the back door of Australia, it is really the front door, in more than one vital respect. It is the front door to that menace which is staring Australia in the face - the Japanese menace. It is within a few days' sail of that country, which, although it has been our Ally in the troublous five years just past, may be our enemy within five years from now. </para>

                            <para>-I do not desire to pose as a prophet, but I am -certain that the administration of the Territory will be in as bad a position as it has been in during the past five years, if -not more seriously placed; and that will mean that the development of the Territory will be utterly retarded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> rather apologized for the terms -of the Ordinance set out in sub-section 5 of section 5; and he -suggested that that provision was intended to provide for a roundtable Conference, at which gentlemen would be -called together to take part in the administration of affairs, in an amicable way and- for the settlement of any dispute that might arise. It would be all very well if the section in question were to be operated in that direction only; but those of us who have been in the Territory recently, and those honorable senators who are familiar with what has been going on there for the past four or five years, are convinced that there will be no hesitation in employing that section for any purposes which may be desired for the time being. I have no faith in the provision for a round-table Conference. </para>

And those gentlemen were elected upon the same franchise as their fellow members. At the same time that those representatives sat in the South Australian ^Legislature, an Administrator, appointed by the State Government, carried out his duties at P'ort Darwin and exercised considerable powers "Whenever anything was wrong, or anything was wanted in the Northern Territory, the people had1 to get into communication with their representatives in Adelaide, who, in turn, got into touch with the Government, when, their requests were immediately righted. I have had telegrams and lettergrams from residents in the Territory, but I have no more right to speak for the residents there than any other senator. I am not directly concerned' in the Northern Territory. </para>

                        and that is why they ' should have direct representatives in this Parliament. If honorable senators object to the residents of the Territory having representation in this Parliament, there should be an elective Council, with a head who would -have some- power, and1 who would be permitted to&gt; act without referring everything to the earner of Spring and Collins streets; Melbourne. It' is an- absolute impossibility to administer' the- affairs of the Territory in anything like a just manner; or to give fair play to this particular part of the Commonwealth under existing conditions.

Every one admits that the Northern Territory is a splendid portion of Australia, and in every way worthy of the rest of this great continent. In spite of what has been said to the contrary, I believe that country has a great future; all it wants is a fair deal. The people are deserving of sympathetic consideration at the hands of the Government, and those who are pessimistic to-day will, in the course of a few years, regret the disparaging terms they have used regarding the Territory. I have every confidence in submitting- the motion to the vote of the Senate.

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> was speaking this afternoon, he drew attention to proposals submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and myself regarding an Advisory Council for the Northern Territory. Whilst I advocate the establishment of an Advisory Council on an elective basis, I regard that only as a tentative proposal until such time as the Northern Territory has direct representation. The view I hold regarding representation for the- Territory is that there might be one member in either House to represent the Northern Terri-' tory and Papua, rather than that the Territory should he split up into sections and attached to electorates in different States. My idea of an elective body, as a tentative proposal, would 'be to have more than a Board of Advice, as suggested, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> The residents of the Territory also desire an elective body, with powers similar to those possessed by a Commission of inquiry, to investigate the Civil Service generally, the 'cost of administration, and the -need for certain offices which are regarded by some as sinecures. Such an elective body should have power to make recommendations to the Government. </para>

                <para>I would also like to bring under the notice of the Acting Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> the position of a number of trainees at the military camp at Enoggera who were called up for home service during the war, as compared with that of similar trainees of the Citizen Forces, who were doing duty on Thursday Island. On representations being made, to the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> he immediately had the men on Thursday Island released, whilst those at Enoggera are being retained during a period which, to many of them, is a vital part of their apprenticeship. I know one or two lads of eighteen or seventeen who have been taken away from their apprenticeship to electrical and other trades, although they could be replaced by some returned soldiers, who would be prepared to take up their work. There appears to be an objection on the part of the military, authorities to release these young men. One would naturally conclude that returned soldiers, who had seen active service, would be more suitable for the work than men who were too young to enlist. I do not want to give the names, but to mention, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> that strong representations have been made to enable these young trainees to be released from home service at the Enoggera Camp. If they are kept there much longer they will be cast on the world without having completed their apprenticeships. </para>

I am not enthusiastic over the continuance of militarism in Australia, but, whilst the .system prevails, it seems only reasonable that men who had the necessary physical qualifications to go away from Australia should have the necessary physical attainments for appointment as military instructors.

                    <para>.- Some time ago I met two returned men who had  a  complaint against the Defence Department. They had to pay for uniforms which they were compelled to purchase in London because of the disreputable condition of the uniforms in which they arrived there from France. I have lost the addresses of these men, and I wish to take this opportunity to supply an explanation, which I hope they will see, and which was obtained for me by Che Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> It seemed rather strange that men arriving in London from the battlefields of France with their uniforms naturally considerably damaged should have had to pay for uniforms with which to replace them. That they had to do so was proved by the fact that they produced their pay-books showing that the money expended in the purchase of the new uniforms (bad been deducted from their pay. I at once communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> concerning the complaint, and he was good enough to investigate the matter, and has forwarded to me a copy of the following communication received from General Birdwood :  </para>

                    <para>Reference to yours of the 10th instant  received  here yesterday. To explain the matter it will be necessary to reply somewhat at length. </para>
                    <para>It is within your knowledge that we pay the Imperial authorities a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> rate for the maintenance of our men in France, and that maintenance includes the supply of clothing. It was, therefore, necessary that all demands for supply of clothes to the men in France should be met by the Imperial authorities. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Imperial Force arrived in France in March and subsequent months of 1916. It was some time after this before leave to England was regularly granted, and to insure that men granted leave were properly clad when on leave, very specific instructions were issued to all commanding officers that each party of men, before departing on leave, was to be inspected by an officer, and that no man was to be allowed to go unless he was clean and well-dressed. Notwithstanding this, it was found that many men, on arrival in London, demanded supply of new clothing from the clothing store 'here. We were then faced with the difficulty that - (I.)We were paying the Imperial authorities for the clothing of the men; but such clothing could only be issued in France. (II.) If we supplied clothing to the  men  when on leave in England, it would necessarily be at Australia's expense, and we should, therefore, be paying twice over for the same service. </para>
                    <para class="block">It was, moreover, thought that if the officers carried out their instructions that no  man  was to be allowed to go on leave unless he was properly dressed, there should foe no necessity for an issue of clothing in London; and that if any man did obtain an issue, it should be entered in his pay-book. Orders were issued accordingly, a proviso being added that any soldier, having issues so entered, could represent the matter to his commanding officer on his return to his unit; and if the commanding officer considered the issue was necessary, he should obtain the approval of the Brigade or Divisional Commander to cancel the entry. </para>

I found to-day an armed man marching up and down in front of the Navy Office saluting officers who approached that establishment. That seems to mc to be absolutely unnecessary. The man. would be far better employed in productive work.

In lav opinion, there is no necessity to have a man, armed with a rifle and a bayonet, marching up and down in front of the Navy Office. So far as I know, no one is going to raid that office. We have exhibitions of the same sort at the Victoria Barracks, Darlinghurst, Sydney. There a few men may be seen marching up and down1 with fixed bayonets, whilst an ordinary policeman would be more than sufficient to preserve order in that peaceful' quarter. I suggest to the Acting Minister for Defence that this kind of useless military display should be at once abandoned. </para>

                <para class="block">I  do not think that, in all the years  I  have been a member of the Senate,  I  have ever, previously brought the case of an individual before honorable senators. The case which I venture to mention now is one of such peculiar hardship that  I  feel justified in doing so.  I  have exhausted my patience in trying to get it settled.  I  think the patience of the Minister must also have been exhausted in connexion with this case, because.  I  am inclined to believe that he holds the same view as  I  do as to its justice.  In our military service there was an officer, Captain Hayne, who was retired in February last as permanently unfitted for further service. The regulations stipulate that upon such retirement an officer is entitled to the compensation of three years' pay.  I  intend to read the regulation, and I shall then ask the Minister to decide to-morrow  that he will pay this man or inform him that he will not be .paid. If he adopts the latter course, the man can easily get his money through the Courts. This man was retired for heart trouble. His case was one of actual breakdown as the .result of work conscientiously done. He asked to be given light work, but he was warned by the doctor that he .was not fit for any kind of work. He was retired six months. ago, and from that time until now he has been in a state of constant worry, because the Department will' not pay him what he is entitled to. I now ask the Minister to make up his mind one way or the other upon this case.  I  quote from the Military Financial and Allowance Regulations, page 151.

                    <para>. -  In regard to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Ferricks</inline> concerning .Enoggera Camp, apparently home service men have been called up for duty, and I must .express my  surprise  that such men are -engaged there »t the present time, especially -as plenty..  of  returned soldiers are available. But there is now in existence a Home <inline font-style="italic">Personnel</inline> Commission, which is just returning from Queensland, where it ,has -been endeavouring to- clean up these camps with a view to enforcing .economy. '  .If  we -really .require .men ,-at .-any camp, I will see that, as  fiar  as .possible, returned soldiers are employed. In regard to the question of height, which has .been raised., 1 would point out that' we have reduced the standard which was originally advertised, so as. to render eligible practically -every man who was accepted for service in the Australian Imperial Force. The principle we have acted upon is that if a man was good enough to -fight in France, he is good enough <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> play at soldiering - speaking comparatively - in Australia. In regard to the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I must express my regret that it has not been settled. "Under our Defence Act men are entitled to certain compensation in ease of a breakdown on duty. Since that Act was passed we have established a system of war pensions. This man  was  transferred from the ordinary civil staff of the Defence Department, and enlisted for home service during the period of the war. He rendered splendid service there, but finally broke down badly. After a close investigation into his case, and a little delay which did not occur in the Defence Department, it was discovered that, whilst Parliament bad enacted that a man in receipt of a war pension could not receive compensation, a man could receive compensation, and afterwards claim a war pension. Under no circumstances would we have been justified in paying both. I tried to overcome the difficulty by asking the Treasury to send £50 to this man to keep him going until we could get the legal position cleared up. The Treasury sent that money to him, but, unfortunately, the authorities wanted him to contract himself out of all claim to a war pension. Naturally, until he understood his position, he declined to do so. I do not blame him for that. However, we have now succeeded in getting a decision that he as not eligible for a war pension, and consequently he is entitled to compensation. I am hopeful, with the cooperation of the Treasurer, . that I shall be able to finalize the matter before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> leaves for Sydney to-morrow. Of course, I cannot say the amount of compensation to which the officer will be entitled, but I will do my best to have the matter settled without further delay. </para>

But it appears that a discharged soldier, who was a solicitor before enlisting, applied to the Department for an advance of £200 or £250 whilst he was shown to be possessed of assets amounting to £1,700. He is a young man who is in a position to take up his occupation again, and, in view of these circumstances, the Department did not feel justified in making the advance sought for the purpose of starting him again in his profession. That is the case as far as I know it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> asked me yesterday if the financial position of an applicant affected his application, I replied in the negative, and that reply is substantially correct. But when I made it I had more particularly in mind those applicants who require vocational training, artificial limbs, &amp;c. In such cases the Department asks no questions. But if the contention which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> by inference, has put forward be correct, we might have a wealthy station-owner, who went to the Front, asking us for an advance to start him again in business. In any advances which the Department makes there must be limits imposed by the practical character of the circumstances. The Department has not been established for the purpose of giving rewards to men for the services which they have rendered. If such rewards are required, Parliament can bestow them by granting special bonuses to these persons. The purpose of the Repatriation Department is to re-establish men. in civil life, and it will do that, irrespective of whether the applicant is penniless or otherwise. But there is no justification for the Department making a grant to a man who obviously does not need it. If we made an advance to this particular individual, it would be impossible to refuse similar consideration to any other man who sought it. In the circumstances, I ask the Senate to uphold the Government in the action which they have taken. </para>
