                    <para>. - I expressed the opinion yesterday that if -this measure is agreed to in. the form in -which it has been printed it will intensify the domination under which the elector is how placed in connexion with our -electoira&#39;l machinery. That may or may not : be an &#39;advantage, according to the point of view of the candidate concerned. Another -and imjpor.tant aspect of proposed new section 7;2a is that it will be  practically impossible for all the candidates in one interest to group themselves together, except by mutual arrangement. The proposals which are embodied in it will work out in a way that will be quite unexpected, and will certainly constitute a precedent, so far as the form of balloting is concerned, in any part of the British Empire. I admit that the Bill possesses many excellent features, and that, in the absence of complete electoral reform, it will mark a distinct step forward, inasmuch as it will absolutely prevent minorities from electing members to this Chamber. But, in addition to providing that the names of candidates shall be placed in alphabetical order upon the ballot papers, and that the electors shall vote for them in the order of their choice, it is proposed in the schedule that the letters A, B, or C, as the case may be, shall be placed opposite the names of the candidates who have been grouped by mutual consent. In this provision, therefore, we are going a very long way towards the setting up of machine elections. I regard the . provision with very great apprehension. I have no objection to the schedule- </para>

                        <para>- I submit that t am in order in referring to it by way of illustration. The schedule is connected with the clause under discussion, inasmuch as it provides for the block vote, and for placing upon the ballot papers the names of candidates in their alphabetical order. I regard the provision for lettering with very great apprehension, because it will . add to an otherwise simple ballot-paper, and will develop <inline font-style="italic">All</inline> sorts of difficulties in connexion with canvassing and voting on polling day. </para>

                        <para>- I . am. quite aware of that. The fact remains that it originates the idea of the grouping of candidates, which is carried out in the schedule where provision is made, not merely for placing on the ballot-papers the names of candidates in their alphabetical order, but for putting certain letters alongside grouped names. I cannot support a provision which will ma&#39;ke for machine domination of the free choice of the electors. These proposals go farther in the direction I have indicated than legislation in any other portion of the British Empire has gone. All our electoral reforms, from open voting to secret balloting, have had for their object the granting to the elector of an unfettered choice of the candidates for his suffrage. </para>

                        <para>- Theoretically the elector has freedom of choice, -but in actual practice this grouping system will mean that the cards will come out inscribed &#34;Vote for A&#34; or &#34;Vote for B,&#34; as the case may be. I desire to knock out this A and B idea, because it tends to restrict the freedom of choice of the electors. It is an electoral anomaly which is calculated to prejudice the chances of  independent candidates. Wo ought not to adopt any method of voting which is likely to impair the chances of any candidate. The innovation which is now . proposed was used at the last Federal elections in connexion with the voting of our troops overseas. How it operated my honorable friends opposite know. I hope that some amendment will be introduced which will result in the elimination of the grouping of candidates. Surely the average elector is sufficiently intelligent to vote the party ticket without having the way pointed to him on his ballot-paper. </para>

                    GRANT  (New South Wales) &#91;3.28|.  -  The provision to which exception has been . taken is, to my mind, one which ought to meet with our approval. It is a -complete misrepresentation to suggest, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    has done, that this proposal really constitutes an interference with the rights of the . electors.  As a matter of fact, when an elector enters  a  polling booth, nobody is quite sure as to how he votes. There is nothing to prevent him from voting for any candidate that he pleases.  His  freedom of choice is absolutely unrestricted. All that this provision seeks is to indicate to&#39; the elector the candidates of the party to which he himself belongs. I regret that it has not been made even more distinctive than it is. I should like to see some provision inserted whereby in front of the names of say, Gardiner, Grant, and McDougall there should appear at the forthcoming elections words intimating that} these candidates are the) selected candidates of the Australian Labour party. If the parties were clearly shown on the ballot-paper, the electors would know exactly what to do. I do not see that we have any need to slavishly follow Great Britain, as suggested by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline>
                    It may be good policy on some matters, but surely no one in this Chamber would think of following Great Britain in the matter of electoral reform. There are millions of men and women in Great Britain who are absolutely disfranchised, and it- is ridiculous to make any comparison between the electoral practice there and that in vogue in Australia. The Bill has many advantages, and, in my opinion, its provisions are an improvement on the present system.

                        <para>- I am not suggesting anything of the kind, and such a step would be contrary to the spirit of the law. In connexion with my last Senate election, one of my comrades., secured votes that were omitted from an entirely different group. That shows clearly that an elector can vote for whomsoever he pleases. There are certain individuals who refrain from voting for candidates in one group and support those in another group. </para>

                        <para>- I am not suggesting anything of the kind. We have found by experience that the grouping system has many advantages. It does not bind an elector to vote for every candidate in a particular group. We now propose to obtain the consent of candidates in the matter of grouping. If they are grouped in the manner provided for in this Bill, how is the freedom of the elector being interfered with ? I am astonished that some honorable senators, who are usually so intelligent in Committee, appear now to think that by this innovation the British Constitution is going to be undermined, and the whole system of parliamentary government dissolved at one blow. </para>

                    Lt.-Colonel O&#39;LOGHLIN  (South Australia) &#91;3.41&#93;.  -  This clause appears to me to be one of the few common-sense provisions of the Bill. It is too late now for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    to rail at the party system. We have it, and, I think, whether for good or ill, it is going to remain with us. The clause, I imagine, has been inserted entirely for the convenience of electors, because at&#34; present candidates are grouped on party tickets during an election campaign, and  I  assume that, at the forthcoming election, the Labour party, the Nationalist party, and the Farmers Union party, if they run three candidates each, will advise electors to mark their ballot-papers in some order of preference for their respective nominees. This clause will prevent some confusion and difficulty on the part of electors when going through the list of candidates,  because the official ballot-paper will indicate the party candidates, whose consent has first been obtained for the grouping.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    said there is no precedent for this clause. Well, that is no argument against it. There ia no precedent for the Bill. It is entirely a leap in the dark. As a matter of fact, there is, as I. have shown, some precedent for the grouping system, but for other principles embodied in the Bill there is none.

Is it to be pretended that when an elector goes to a polling-booth to discharge this solemn obligation, to perform . this sacred duty of voting, he does not know the political views of the various candidates? If this is the belief, then all I can say is that honorable senators place the electors&#39; intelligence on a lower level than that of the punter on a race-course. I can quite understand a certain class of punter, if he loses a marked card, and has forgotten the names of the horses, asking a friend to mark the card for him, because he does not know the performances of the various horses, or their weights in comparison with weights carried in some previous events; but to imply that an elector does not know what he is doing, and cannot discharge his duty unless assisted, is, to my mind, an insult to him. </para>

                <para>We say that every elector should have a free choice, and that it should be competent for every elector to offer his services to his country as a representative of the people. Suppose we have five candidates for three vacancies, all, generally speaking, advocating the same platform and looking to the same voters for support. If three of those candidates were grouped they would be damaging the chance!5 of the other two candidates, for by their grouping they would intimate to the public that the other two candidates were npt of the orthodox party at all. To. that extent, they would be conspiring against all candidates of the same political thought who were not in the group- Let us assume that there were four candidates of the same political thought standing for three vacancies, and that three of them decided to be grouped. The fourth might come along and say, &#34; I want to join this group &#34; ; but under this clause they would have authority to say to&#39; him, &#34; No ; you keep outside.&#34; And by thus grouping themselves and excluding the other candidate, they would represent themselves to the electors as the three true-blue candidates of the party, while the other candidate would be impliedly one who had not subscribed to the principles of the party. </para>

                        <para>- But we are instituting a new system, and we ought to be logical, and say that if there are five, six, or seven candidates of a particular political thought, they should have a right to be grouped. There is, of course, nothing to prevent their being grouped ; but the tendency will be to confine any group to the exact number of vacancies, so that three men may combine, in effect, to damage the chances of a fourth by being grouped on the ballot-paper as the authorized candidates of a particular party. To that extent the people&#39;s rights will- be interfered with, because the tendency will be to concentrate votes, as far as possible, upon a group of the. number of candidates actually required. </para>

                        <para>- Of what use is it for honorable senators to try to disguise the fact that government in . Australia is carried on under the party system? We as a Government are asked to prepare an  electoral measure to facilitate elections under the system which has been adopted throughout the British Empire. Under this proposal the- different political parties contesting an election will become known as &#34;A party&#34; or &#34;B party,&#34; according as their candidates are grouped on the ballot-paper.&#39; Honorable senators may object to the party system, but I do not think that there is any member of the Committee who has ever objected to being grouped with other candidates of hu party for the purpose of an election. I nan imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> with impassioned eloquence, asking the electors of Tasmania to vote for his two colleagues and himself, and I should prefer the influence of the honorable senator&#39;s recommendation as a colleague of mine in an election to a special designation on a ballot-paper.&#39; We know that electors who might be confused in recording their vote never enter a polling booth without a copy of their party ticket showing how they should vote if they wish to support that party. I am not an enthusiastic party man, and do not claim that the party system is perfect, but we have to consider this Bill in view of our adoption  of the system under which people are governed in practically every part of the British Empire. I will go so far with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> as to admit that many things might be done legitimately outside which could not be tolerated in a polling booth. The ballot-paper under this clause will not offer an inducement to electors to vote for group A any more than for group B. </para>

                        <para>- The ballot-paper will be perfectly neutral. I am satisfied that at least 80 per cent, of the electors will desire to vote upon a party ticket; and this proposal will facilitate their attainment of that desire. I think that it will be -found to make an enormous difference in the despatch of work in the polling booths, especially in the closing hours of the poll. I can remember that I recorded my first vote for the members of the . Federal Convention, and, though I think 1&#34; may claim to have more nerve than the average elector, I did not leave the polling booth without some doubt as_ to whether, after all, I had voted for the candidates whom I desire-3 to support. </para>

                    has said that if a man desired to stand as a Labourite or a Liberal we should not forbid him to do so. I remind honorable senators of the case of ex-Senator Trenwith. He had a dispute with his party,&#39; but at an election for the Senate he still stood as a Labour man according to his own label. If a political party desires to group its candidates to distinguish them from other candidates, it should have the right to do so. A fourth candidate standing in the same interest should not have the right to force himself into a party group without the consent of that party, as the result might be to confuse the electors, to the disadvantage of that party. On the occasion to which .1 referred, ex-Senator Trenwith was the fourth candidate standing professedly in the interests of Labour, and, though he was not included in the Labour group, he topped the poll, because the electors riveted their attention upon his personality. Other instances of the same kind might be quoted, but it is clear that in the great majority of cases the proposal of this clause will facilitate the recording of their votes by the electors. We know that, under the existing system, candidates issue thousands of cards showing their names, in groups, with crosses against them, to inform the electors how they should vote. The newspapers&#39; also group the candidates at an election, and those who are loyal to a party appeal to the electors on behalf of all the candidates included in a group. I should be sorry to think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    did not appeal to the electors on behalf of his two colleagues when he stood for election.

The candidates of other parties will, in the same way, become known as the &#34;three B&#39;s,&#34; the &#34; three C&#39;s,&#34; and so on. I am asked why we should not attach the name of the party for which they stand to each group of candidates; but I do not see why. we should compel a man who wishes to call himself a Liberal to describe himself as a Labour man. </para>

                        <para>- I know that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> desired. to call himself a Labour man, and found himself described on the ballot-paper as &#34;miscellaneous,&#34; no one would make a greater row about it. It would be tyrannous to say. that a man who wishes to describe himself in one way should be compelled to accept a different description. Under this clause a candidate will be able to describe himself as he pleases; but, for the convenience of voting, candidates will be allowed to group themselves by mutual arrangement. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that it is not&#39; at all likely that there will be four candidates included in any group; but the proposal embodied in the clause will not interfere in any way with the neutrality of the polling booth or of the ballot-paper. </para>

                <para>I admit that this is an experiment which has not been tried in any other part of the Empire; but there is no reason why Australia should not lead in this matter. We did lead in the adoption of the ballot. Honorable senators will remember the circumstances of the old Wicklow election recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Handy Andy,</inline> where a voter took considerable risk in going to the poll at all. &#39; We have improved upon that condition of things, and it should still be possible for us to lead in the matter of improved electoral systems. </para>

                        <para>- I do not claim that this Bill provides for a perfect system, and because it does not, I hope that it will not. be permanent. There is a growing tendency in Australia to give better representation to minorities, and I realize that there is a good deal to be said for that. Majority rule may, in some cases, be abused? and British constitutional law is specially directed to the preservation of the rights of minorities. As it is imperative that the Bill should be passed at the- earliest possible moment, 1 ask honorable senators to  come to a decision upon the clause, and let the Bill go through. </para>

                    <para>. - I favour the proposed grouping system, mainly in the interests of the electors, to whom it will be a very great convenience. A large number of electors in Australia vote informally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has spoken of the great intelligence of the &#39;electors, and I take it, from what he has said, that there are very few, if any, in Tasmania who vote informally. But on the mainland of Australia a very large number of electors vote informally at every election for the Senate. I should be very pleased if this Bill contained a provision requiring the electoral authorities, after an election, to set out the reasons why people had voted informally. When I was a member of the House of Representatives I endeavoured to ascertain why it was that so many persons recorded informal votes. The Chief Electoral Officer explained that 70 or 80 per cent, of those who voted informally did so by voting for too few or too many candidates in a Senate election. That was not the only cause of informal voting, but it was the chief cause. If so many informal votes were recorded when people were required to vote for three candidates, and no more than three, it is likely that a greater number of informal votes will be recorded under this Bill when the electors are required to vote for at least seven candidates. The grouping system will obviate that to some extent, but not altogether. It will be necessary to impress the people with the fact that they must vote differently from the manner in which they have been accustomed to do. The trouble is, however, that, no matter how earnestly we may set out to educate the people, there will be some who cannot be reached. The overwhelming majority of the people believe in parties, and vote for parties ; they do not vote for individuals. How many honorable senators, present were returned to this Chamber on their individuality - on their transcendental abilities? We were sent here because we advocated certain policies. I polled about 500,000 votes at the last elections. If my name had not been on the party ticket, even though I had independently advocated all those policies which I did advocate, I would have received fewer than 1,000 votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would have secured a few more - say, 1,500 - for the reason that he was given 640 more votes than were placed in my name. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would have secured still more as an independent, because he is better known than either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> or myself; but I doubt if he would have gained more than 5,000 or 6,000 votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon was a giant among giants when he adorned this Chamber. There is no one in New South Wales who holds a relatively higher position in th&#169; esteem of the public than did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon  in South Australia. The late senator stood on a party ticket, and was returned at the head of the poll. A few years later he entered upon a campaign outside of party, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> beat <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon hands down. The latter gained only about 17,000 votes; he was at the bottom of the poll; he lost his deposit.  The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Playford was in his day also a leading light in this Chamber.  His  reputation was as high in the Senate as in his native State, where he had been Premier. He was known from one end to the other of South Australia. When he stood on the party ticket he polled second only to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon. Later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford</inline> stood &#34;on his own&#34;; he figured at the bottom of the poll, and lost his deposit. The people want policies, and do not bother much about individuals. Australia naturally desires to choose as her political representatives men of honesty and some capacity. But they desire, first of all, policies, and not men; programmes, and not individuals. Be it said to the credit of Labour, the introduction of the party system is due to it. There was a time when people did not bother so much about policies; when candidates were returned because they kissed babies&#39;, or happened to be members . of some friendly society or other. </para>

Yet this Bill does not prevent any one from standing as an independent. Any person who can raise &#163;25, and can . cajole six people into nominating him - six from among the whole of the population of Australia - may woo the electors. His election campaign need not cost him a penny, over and above the original &#163;25 deposit. </para>

                        <para>- He got in without spending any money. Some people assert that, owing to the system of pre- &#34;selection, intending candidates are prevented from offering themselves. Of course, a man who has an organization at his back has a better chance than an independent. But, so long as there are principles to be fought for, there will be party organizations. It is far better that we should contest elections upon great principles than that we should revert to the old-time quarrels over personalities. I arn of opinion that the grouping system will cause many more people to vote formally than has been the case in the past. </para>

                    <para>.  -  I have been struck by the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that we are estimating the intelligence of the electors at a level below that of the race-course punter. I favour the grouping system, but I do not like the idea of branding groups with the letters A, B, and. C. Candidates should be grouped under the names with which they register themselves with the Returning Officer. There are the Labour party, the National party, the Socialist party, and others. Honorable senators&#39;, by the way, need not worry about Labour and Socialism being unable to agree upon a name. I know that there will be some difficulties when the Nationalists desire to change their names. Confusion will be caused, because some will prefer to be known as National Labourites, while others will want the title of National Liberals. All such difficulties as those, however, will vanish at the polls: No matter what various groups may call themselves, the people, will know who they are; they will know whom they intend to vote for. &#39; I have before me the record of an election held in New South Wales in 1914. I have here the official return, which shows that the successful candidates, and the votes which they polled, were as follows : - Gardiner, 344,151; McDougall, 342,482; and Grant, 341,934. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who was not elected on that occasion, polled 322,076. Honorable senators may ask why I have quoted these figures. My explanation is that some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> called attention to the fact that he had defeated our party, and I then promised that I would on some future occasion quote the actual votes polled with a view to showing him what the results were when we met. So far as New South Wales is concerned, there has never been a senator returned for that State, under the old block system of voting, who has not represented a majority of the electors. The successful candidates have always secured more than 50 per cent, of the votes polled. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the proposed grouping of the names of candidates, not only would I adopt that system, but I would go further, and attach to the names of the grouped candidates the distinctive political designation of the parties to which they belong. I would also provide little squares in which the colours of the different parties could be shown. This would certainly aid the electors to distinguish the particular candidates for whom they desired to vote. Of course I know that there is a section &#34;in this Chamber whose members do not believe in the pre-selection of candidates.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> - For a free Parliament there should be no such thing as a pre-selection of candidates. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> also believes that order, regulation, and system are not consistent with liberty. My own idea is that an organized Opposition is conducive to good legislation. The &#39;constituencies outside, as well as this Parliament, have approved of the system of party government, and the Vice-President of .the Executive Council has assured us that the intention  of this Bill is to make it easier for the electors to vote for the particular candidates whom they favour. If that be so, why should we not go a step further, and brand the candidates of the respective political parties ? &#39;Surely we can have a system under which the general Returning Officer may receive the registration of the names of those parties. Priority of use should determine questions in regard to the title of any party to a particular name. </para>

There are many acts that are permissible outside a polling booth that are not allowed within its walls. We know there are frequently altercations down the street in connexion with parties, but all political strife must cease the moment electors are inside the booth. There are members who wish to destroy a remarkably fine electoral ideal, and hanker after some means of placing a mark on the ballot-paper to indicate the parties to which the candidates belong. Let us see how this ballot-paper will work. Ordinarily, the names are placed on the ballot-paper in their proper alphabetical order. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the iniquitous principle contained in clause 3, and the specimen ballot-paper in the schedule has a direct bearing on the clause under discussion. A candidate standing as an independent, who represents some particular phase of public opinion, is relegated to the bottom of the paper, regardless of alphabetical order. Is that right? Why should groups of three have preference over groups of two, and all groups over single candidates, regardless of alphabetical order? Is not that indicative of preference and differential treatment on the ballot-paper ? </para>

The clause, if it is not amended, will be opposed by me. This Bill has never been discussed by the party to which I belong. The introduction of this principle is one that has never been fully considered by the National party, and the Bill is thrown down to us here with a provision relating to grouping that has never been fully considered. The Minister admits that he has not even discussed the Bill with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> Whose opinion does the Bill contain ? Has it been placed here at the wish of the National party? There has been &#39; no public request for anything of this nature. There has been no party request, and the grouping principle has been, embodied in the Bill without reference to the members of my party. </para>

                        <para>- There has keen no discussion of the grouping system. This is very important, because it attacks the secrecy and purity of the ballot. I feel fully justified in putting the position before the Committee, because we shall be told, that, as members of the National party, we decided upon the adoption of the principle embodied in the Bill. Nothing of the sort took place. This is an adventitious insertion in the measure of a principle singularly vicious &#39; in its character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, but his position was brought about by the rigidity of the electoral system we have been remodelling. We have been remodelling it, not in the direction of limiting the electors&#39; choice in regard to candidates, but by enlarging their liberties and facilities. We favour the right of an individual to come forward as a candidate unfettered by the limitations imposed by some coterie alleged to be representative of a party. Here we find the insidious provision to perpetuate the domination of the machine, and to increase the domination of party. The Constitution recognises no party, nor does the Electoral Act, and the ballot-paper should not recognise parties. The grouping of names, irrespective of alphabetical order, is the thin edge of the wedge inserting in. the ballot-paper a clear indication of the party the candidate represents. That is subversive of the principles of electoral freedom. Would I be permitted to go to the booth with my wife and eldest daughter, and, for convenience sake, record their votes? Would that be entertained for a moment? I know it would not. If one of the grouped candidates who was elected was compelled to resign his seat would it mean that those who were grouped with him would also have to resign? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> for instance, is not responsible for my actions; nor is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.I</inline> am responsible to the electors for whatever I do, therefore my name should be placed on the ballot-paper in accordance with the principles of equity. I will do all I can to make this a lesser indication of preference than it already is. I favour giving every candidate the same chance on the ballot-paper irrespective of the fact that the initial letter of his surname gives him alphabetical preference. Why should Quick and Russell be given precedence over Thomas, who ordinarily would follow in alphabetical order? Yet certain candidates are to be relegated to the tail end of the ballot-paper because they are standing alone, according to the specimen ballot-paper. </para>

                    has treated the clause in his usual energetic fashion. I can quite appreciate his attitude. On a previous occasion he sought to substitute for the principle in the Bill a proportional system, which meant the recognition of parties
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad finem.</inline>
                    I could not follow his reasoning then, but I can now. Previously he sought the recognition of parties great and small, but now he will not allow the recognition of parties of any description.

                        <para>- One object of the proposal is to&#39; enlighten public opinion, but it is a crude way of accomplishing this object, particularly -in a country where we are so enlightened, and where we have compulsory education. If the electors in this country cannot make an intelligent choice from among seven, eight, ten, or twelve candidates for the Senate, it is a reflection upon the political enlightenment of the people. If it is considered that political ignorance is such -that the Bill is needed to enlighten the electors, I say that the measure is altogether unjustifiable. That is my reason for opposing this feature of the Bill. I may be asked, what is wrong with the party system? I believe that so long as representative government lasts, the party system will be one of its inherent and incurable evils. But, while I make that admission, I am equally ready to . say that so long as the party system lasts it- will be wise, and in the interests of the nation, to discourage any slavish respect for it, because I believe that the public welfare, which, of course, is above all other considerations, has, in the past, been jeopardized by this slavish respect for party interests. The Minister tells us that this proposal is an experiment. I hope it will not find favour in this Chamber. I hope we will progress along those lines which have forced keen political students in other countries to admire the many admirable features of our electoral system. There is no need to educate the people on the party system, but, if there is, I do not think this education can be given to them by compulsory means. Anyway, it is not the duty of this Parliament to enlighten electors on the issue. It is wrong to make the machinery of government and the machinery of our electoral system subservient to the party system. I believe that the national interest has, in the past, suffered too much owing to this unreasoning and beslavering respect for party considerations which, in my opinion, should always be subservient to the national welfare. If we allow grouping on; the ballot-papers, the impression conveyed , to the elector will be&#39; that it is the first official recognition of the party system. This will be an unwarranted exaltation of the party system above the public interest. The party system is, as I have said, an incurable evil of our form of representative . government; and I shall not be one to ask the people to bow down, in a figurative sense, to adore it. The system has run riot in America, where candidates are officially labelled as Republicans, Democrats, and so on. We do not want to copy American methods in Australia. I am not going to vote for the proposal, believing that the instrumentalities of our electoral system should be unquestionably neutral. John Smith, Bill Brown, and Patrick Murphy should be equal, as candidates, in the eyes of all electors. The point referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> should be kept in mind. It is the right of a candidate who does not belong to any party, and is of an independent turn of mind - and such men, I say, are the salt of our political life - to have a fair chance. -He should not be placed at any possible disadvantage by the introduction of this grouping of candidates. The proposal will, in effect, penalize every independent minded man who dares to say, &#34; A plague on your party system.&#34; I do not want our electoral machinery to arrive at that point, for I have seen too many instances of the public interest being jeopardized by this strict respect for party welfare. Proposals from the Government benches have, on occasion, been turned down simply because the other party could not&#34; have credit for their initiation. While the party system is an incurable evil of our present form of government, we should do what we can to check it, and hot raise it to a higher level in the eyes of the people. </para>

                <para class="block">When speaking earlier this afternoon I said that the grouping system had been introduced mainly for the convenience of electors, and I think my amendment will make the position much clearer, because electors will then have the names of the respective parties to which candidates belong printed in the ballot-paper, instead of the algebraical system of lettering A, B, and C. In other words, instead of Labour candidates being grouped under the letter &#34;A,&#34; which&#39; I understand will be their group letter, they will have the words &#34;Labour party&#34; printed opposite their names; likewise, if candidates under group &#34; B &#34; are Nationalist candidates, the word &#34;Nationalist&#34; will be printed opposite their names; and, if Farmers Union candidates are under group &#34; 0,&#34; the party name will be shown in the same manner. Surely no candidate need be ashamed to be grouped under the name of his party. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think there is a very great deal in the matter under discussion. I feel sure that the intention of the Government, in framing the proposed new sub-section, was to oblige the electors, as much as possible, by making the system of voting as simple as possible. I am surprised -that our friends opposite should be so keenly in favour of it, because I have always been . under the impression that the Labour party supporters take a much greater interest in, and know far more about, political candidates than Nationalist electors, so I remind the Government that it is as well to beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts. I am inclined to think that there is more in this proposed amendment than appears on the surface. I give the Government every credit for endeavouring to help the electors, but I think that a great deal may be said for the argument that we should not differentiate on the ballot-paper itself. It is right . that every citizen should have an equal chance, so I think the Government would be well ad- &#39; vised to drop the clause. It is not very important after all, because the electors will have those party tickets which are always prepared for distribution. If one is not accustomed to voting, it is not such a simple matter to go into a booth and select a number of candidates. I have had a long political experience, and I must admit that I shall feel a little uneasy when I have to go into a booth to choose from about twenty names the three men -who I think will suit me best, and then have to show my preference for others. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I was drawn aside by disorderly interjections.. The intention of this clause is, no doubt, good, but I think the Government would be well advised if they dropped it. The electors&#39; will in any case vote upon a party ticket, because we know that the party system will continue. I think it was Napoleon who, when the great advantages of the British Constitution were pointed out to him, said, &#34;It is all very well so long as you have two parties, but if you had three parties your system of government could not continue.&#34; I am inclined to agree . with that opinion. </para>

                        <para>- They may do some things . better in France, but the French system of government is not better than ours, and that proves that Napoleon was probably right when he said that two parties would be quite sufficient. This Bill is an effort to help the electors, but the clause we are now discussing is of no real importance, and  might well be dropped, as one effect of it would be to differentiate on a ballot-paper between one candidate and another, and to interfere with a man&#39;s absolute right to stand as a candidate on his merits. </para>

                        <para>- All my Tasmanian friends disclaim having done so, but I may inform honorable senators that at the Senate election of 1917, of the total votes recorded in New South Wales, 3.83 per cent, were informal; the percentage in Victoria was 3.21; in Queensland, 4.76 per cent.; in South Australia, 4.44 per cent. ; in Western Australia, 5.16 per cent., and in Tasmania, 3.71 per cent. These figures go to show that in the intelligent State of Victoria the lowest percentage of informal votes was recorded at that election. I appreciate the effort of the Government to assist the electors by this Bill, but the clause under consideration involves a departure from the existing system under which every citizen of Australia has an equal opportunity to submit himself as a candidate for the Senate, and as the defeat of the clause would be a matter of no importance, I repeat that, in my view, the Government would be well advised to drop it. </para>

                    <para>. - In speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I contended that there would probably be more informal votes cast under it than have been recorded under the existing law. If this clause is not adopted, my prediction will be found to be true. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has spoken of obliging the electors, but we are here to assist the electors. They are under no obligation to us, but we are under obligations to them. It is our duty to make this measure so plain that it will assist the electors when . they go into the polling booth to cast their  votes in the way they desire. I am supporting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin,</inline> which will go further than the proposal of the Government in connexion with the grouping system. I believe in the grouping system. The Minister has admitted that the proposed alphabetical indication of groups by means of the letters A, B, C, and so on, provides to all intents and purposes for a party designation. That is the object of the grouping system. The Minister has admitted that, for instance, the letter &#34;A&#34; may indicate the Labour party, the letter &#34;B&#34; the National party, the letter &#34;C&#34; the National Labour party, and so on. If that be so, why not go to the full extent suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> amendment, and print the name of a party opposite the group of candidates of that party on the ballot-paper. Why should not the groups be designated &#34;Labour party,&#34; &#34;National party,&#34; &#34;Liberal party,&#34; or &#34; Coalition party&#34;&#34;? </para>

                        <para>- Why not, if honorable senators please? If that designation were adopted by the party opposite, it might assist the Government to win the election. The electors, when they went into the polling booth, might forget that the present Government said that they would win the war, and that they won the last election on that cry. Is there any objection to our friends opposite being known as the &#34;W.T.W. party&#34; - that ja to say, the &#34;Win the War party&#34;? No man who stands for Parliament in Australia need be ashamed of having the designation of the political party to which he belongs shown on the ballot-paper. It is well known that there will be at least three parties in the field at the next election - our friends from the Government benches, ourselves from the Opposition benches, and the Farmers&#39; party. </para>

Let the candidates indicate to which party they belong, and under the grouping system that can be made clear. The Minister urges the objection that in certain instances there may not be a. sufficient number of candidates to form a group, but that is a difficulty which might be easily overcome. No better speech could have been made in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> amendment than that which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> in discussing this clause. The honorable senator stated that if it were not for the party system he would not be here. That statement applies with equal force to every member of the Senate, and, indeed, to every member of this Parliament. There is not one of us who would ever have found his way into any Parliament in Australia were it not for the party machine he assisted in working. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the present Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> is an exception, but that gentleman discovered that he had to join some party, and he has done so. Hie is now a member of the Government which he previously opposed. He was for a time in another place an independent man. He is not independent to-day, however, and when he woos  the electors of Gippsland a few weeks hence he will do so as a member of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise&#39;s</inline> one-time independence has disappeared. There is not one member among the 111 who constitute the Federal Parliament to-day who would have been elected to this Legislature but for the party machines. . He would be a bold as well as a foolish man who would face any election without the backing of a party and a policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> would be wise to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> amendment, and not to accept the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> to drop the clause. If the amendment is not agreed to I shall vote for the clause as it stands. The Minister admits that the alphabetical system of group-marking suggests party designation. That being the case, why not print the proper and well-known name of the party on the ballot-paper ? </para>

                    <para>.- I appreciate the remarks of honorable senators who have expressed views which differ from my own; nevertheless, I am not convinced that their opinions are justified. When I examined the clause to provide for the grouping of candidates I was struck with its. wisdom. I considered that anything which tended to help an elector cast his vote as he desired must be good. I have known many instances where an elector has cast his vote contrary to his intentions. It is all very well to speak of the ignorance of the elector, but I predict that at the forthcoming election, unless there is a proper designation of party groups, many hundreds of electors - among them university-educated men - will not know the names of the candidates who have been selected by the parties which they favour. The ignorance of the general public is often appalling. I have frequently met people who have addressed me as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> and have asked me what portion of Tasmania I represent in the Federal Parliament. There are actually members of Australian Legislatures who are ignorant of the forms of voting throughout the Commonwealth. No person is compelled to vote for a party. No matter how a ballot-paper may be grouped, electors are free to mark their papers as they choose. So far as grouping is concerned, the French party list system would be an improvement upon this new proposal, because it provides a column for every party. The specimen ballot-paper contained in the schedule does not make party distinctions sufficiently clear. I would like to see the groups more effectively indicated. Why should not the party groups be placed in separate columns? At the recent State elections in Tasmania, for the Division of Bass, when my son was elected, there were five candidates for the party to  which he belonged. A certain section of the community printed and published a number of tickets, placing thereon the names of all the candidates for the Labour party except that of my son. Scores of canvassers were employed in distributing: those tickets; they told the people, &#34; This is the ticket of the Labour party.&#34; Yet the name of one of the party&#39;s candidates, had been struck from the list and that of another man had been inserted. The grouping of names as provided in the Bill would put an end to that sort of manipulation, for the reason that when an elector is handed his ballot-paper at the polling booth he will see at once that an effort has been made to . deceive . him ; and he will not find it difficult to vote the party group.. In the Senate election of  1914  there were two brothers . who were candidates. One of these, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> R. Shoobridge, stood in the interests of the Labour party, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> M. Shoobridge was a Liberal candidate. Scrutineers ascertained that there were thousands of cases of voting by mistake. In one little polling booth ninety-two instances were recorded where ballot-papers had been marked for five Labour candidates and the wrong <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shoobridge.</inline> They knew that a candidate named Shoobridge was a Labour nominee, but did not know which of the brothers to vote for. No one wishes an elector to vote in a manner other than he desires to do. I think the grouping system will help to indicate the true intentions of the people, and will reduce the number of informal votes cast. Men opposed to my views in politics have assured me that more informal votes are cast on their side than for Labour. That may or may not be the case; but this measure will considerably reduce the totals of informal votes. There are many people who favour the elimination of party altogether, but there are few political aspirants who would care to enter upon a campaign with that ideal for a fighting platform. Non-party government may sound captivating, but it does not appear to be practical nowadays. I shall support the amendment, and, if it is lost, I will assist the Government to secure the best system of grouping that may be devised. </para>

                    <para>. -  A number of helpful suggestions have been advanced, and I would like to consult officials of the Electoral Department before proceeding with this clause. Possibly, as an outcome of such discussion during the dinner adjournment, I may be able to present an amendment which will embody certain useful proposals offered this afternoon. The grouping of candidates has nothing to do with party. We all desire to perfect the electoral machine. I suggest that consideration of this clause and consequential clauses be postponed. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to submit an amendment affecting a matter of principle. I wish to see the system under which a candidate for parliamentary honours is compelled to lodge a deposit, abolished. To my mind, a deposit constitutes a property qualification. Under the existing law, if I desire to contest a seat for the Senate, and I cannot find a deposit of &#163;25,I am prevented from doing so. I think that a man has a right to be; come a member of this Chamber even if he does not possess &#163;25. Of course, it may be urged that the political party to which a candidate belongs visually finds the money for him. I admit that . the party with which I am associated has frequently provided the deposit for me, and so far it has not lost it. </para>

                    <para>. - The new paragraph , which I have proposed plainly sets out that all preference votes received . by a candidate shall be counted to his credit up to the time that the last vacancy is filled. After the first candidate has been elected, the other candidates will receive additional preferences, the same thing will occur after the second candidate has been elected, and the process will be repeated until the third vacancy is filled. I recognise that the phraseology is somewhat difficult to follow, but if the new paragraph does not give effect to the intention of the Government I shall be prepared, at a later stage, to recommit the clause, and amend it. </para>

                    <para>- My objection to the clause is that it will compel an elector to vote for at least seven candidates. He will be required to exhaust his preferences up to that number. But, no matter how many more candidates there may be, the elector will be at liberty to exercise, or not to exercise, his preference votes in respect of them. I have already said that this Bill is really misnamed. It is not a Preferential Voting Bill. The &#39;very fact that it cuts out even, the eighth candidate will deprive the elector of the chance which it seeks to give him. We all recognise that under this measure; unless an elector exhausts his preference votes up to seven, his ballot-paper will be informal. I think it is admitted that an elector is under a penalty. Under the ordinary preferential system in vogue in connexion with the House of Representatives, and in Western Australia and Victoria, the whole of the preferences must be exhausted. If there are twenty candidates standing for a seat in the Legislative Assembly, the whole of the preferences must be worked out. If this Bill becomes law, the electors will be compelled, under the penalty of being disfranchised by rendering their ballot-paper informal, of voting for double the number of candidates required, plus one. Why not assist the elector by making it a simple preference, and going straight on? </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with the selection of parties in&#39; some of the States, the preference system obtains. In our Western Australian pre-selection party ballots we have a preferential system of selecting candidates for the Senate. We vote three ones, and then from two to ten, according to the number of candidates. The three ones are of equal value, and we then go on until the ballot is exhausted. </para>

                        <para>- We should endeavour to assist them. This is called a preferential system; but the clause as at present framed does not embody that principle. I am not prepared to indicate an amendment at this stage, but later on I may be able to move in the direction of providing a real preferential system. An elector has to vote for at least seven candidates - if that is not done, his paper is informal - and we ought to provide that the whole of the candidates standing should be voted for in the order of preference desired by the elector. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to suggest a means of simplifying it. If an elector is allowed to vote from, say, one to ten, and knows that by so doing his paper will not be informal it is simplifying the proposition. I suggest that the clause be amended to enable an elector to exercise his preference right through. </para>

                    <para>. - The difficulty that presents itself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is the possibility of complication in the method of marking the papers in order to obtain the proper preference. Why should it be more complicated on the mainland than in Tasmania? At the 1913 elections 75 per cent. of the total number of electors in that State recorded their votes, and only 2.8 per cent, were informal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The method of voting is the same, although the system of counting is different. A Tasmanian elector understands that if he places the number 1 against a particular candidate, that candidate will be regarded as his first preference, and he goes on marking the paper in order of preference to, say, nine. </para>

I analyzed the figures in connexion with the election in Denison when fourteen candidates were standing, &#39; and nearly every elector voted up to seven, and that is exactly what would happen under this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There were very few informal votes. I think it wise to carry out the order of preference, and if an elector considers one candidate objectionable, he can pass him over and support one whom he considers less objectionable. I do not consider the system complicated. An elector can easily mark nine or ten preferences if requested to do so. To give effect to this principle it will require seven preferences to be recorded, and for that reason seven has been embodied in the Bill. My analysis in connexion with the Denison election proves that an; elector should vote for at least seven. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has omitted, quite unintentionally I believe, the vital point in his explanation in connexion with the Denison election. He has stated that fourteen candidates were competing, and that most of, the electors voted for seven, and that some exercised their preference right down to the fourteenth. I understand that in nearly all cases the electors voted as far as the seventh; but I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> that that election was conducted on bitter party lines, and that each of the parties had seven candidates. </para>

                        <para>- That is where the Bill is palpably unjust, and if an elector is compelled to vote beyond his own party he may be supporting a candidate whose views are entirely different from his own. That is the principle in the Bill, but it is not the principle upon which Tasmanian elections are conducted. As a rule a Tasmanian elector is not obliged to vote for more than the number of candidates to be returned, whereas under this Bill an elector of the Commonwealth will be required to vote for double the number of candidates plus one. This, I think, is a rank injustice. </para>

                        <para>- But we know it as the Hare-Clark system in Tasmania. I never will be able to see the jhstioe of a principle that compels an elector to vote for a man that is not of his own party. We may assume that at the forthcoming election for the Senate there will be a number of independent candidates, and under this Bill a Nationalist supporter, taking that party as an illustration, after voting for the three Nationalist candidates in the order of his choice, will have to extend his preference vote to four other candidates, and possibly will have to show some preference for three Labour candidates whose . politics, perhaps, he absolutely hates. It is absurd. There is no necessity for the provision. </para>

                        <para>- If I cannot get a Labour man. returned, then I must give my second preference to somebody else who, in my opinion, is the next best. There is no getting away from this principle under the preferential system, which- is now &#39;applied to the House of Representatives elections, so that when I go to the poll in Perth at the forthcoming elections I will give my No. 1 vote for a Labour candidate ; and, in order to make my vote formal, I must exhaust my preferences. The Minister has said that there is not going to be two systems of voting, but I contend that, under the Bill as it stands, there will be two systems, because, whilst an elector will be compelled to exhaust his . preference votes in the case of candidates  for  the House of Representatives, he will be required to exhaust only a certain number of his preference votes so far as the Senate is concerned. There is the difference. If unity is so much to be desired, then every elector should be compelled, to exhaust the whole of his preference votes. This is the principle of the preferential voting system. I want it to be uniform, and I move - </para>

                        <para>- An elector who intends in a Senate election to vote for three men, as a rule, does not see the others at all, and, except for the contingency which did arise on one occasion in South Australia - of a candidate dying between the time of nomination and . polling day, I can see no reason why any elector should be called upon to vote for more than the number actually required. If the Minister can throw some light on the clause, I shall be very glad. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> urged that an elector should be compelled to mark his preference against the names of all the candidates, but this, I think, would be a waste of time, and would lead to congestion in the polling booths, especially in city divisions. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think this- is an excellent clause. Without it we could not&#39; have preferential voting, in &#39;which, I assume, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> believes. The proposal is that the minimum vote which an elector shall record is a vote for double the number of candidates required to be elected, plus one. Unless he votes in that way, we cannot have preferential voting at a Senate election. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> argument is, in effect, that the candidates for whom an elector votes in numerical order from one to three are sure of being returned; but I point out to him that the result of the election will depend on the aggregate preferences expressed by the whole of the electors. It is not to be assumed that either the whole of the Labour party candidates, or the whole of the National candidates, will be returned, -and the proposal in this clause will enable&#39; an elector to record the estimation in which he holds a candidate who differs from him politically. </para>

It may put him down at the bottom of the list on the electors&#39; ballot-paper, but it will still have some value, and may assist his election.

Is there any provision in the Bill to meet the case of the demise of a candidate after nomination and before the declaration of the poll? Is there to be a recount?

                        <para>- I do not think so. Let us suppose that the grouping principle has been instituted, and that four candidates are nominated, either in one group or within two groups. Instead of another election becoming necessary, the fourth candidate would secure the votes cast for the deceased, and would thus occupy the third seat to be filled. There would be no need for a further election, and there would be no impairment of the principle laid down in this measure. </para>

A candidate, who would have been placed at the head of the poll, died before the declaration. The outcome was that . the three candidates . who had polled the highest number of votes below the total of the deceased were declared elected. If some provision of the same character were included in the Bill the measure would be improved. </para>

                    <para>. - The difficulty mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> should be provided for in the Bill. The circumstances as related by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> are correct, providing that electors are compelled to vote for four candidates whom they do not wish to see elected. The trouble is, however, that one candidate whom an elector might not wish to see elected would be automatically declared elected. . That individual, for whom an elector did not wish to vote, would take the place of the deceased can&#39; didate, for whom the elector had voted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> argued that the Bill should provide- for the circumstance of the decease of a party nominee. There is nothing, in the Bill to deal with such a situation, but there is provision by which some one else would be elected in the place of the deceased candidate. </para>

                        <para>- No; I argue that there should be machinery in the Bill in the event of the death of a candidate. Elections nowadays are party fights. In the forthcoming contest there will be three Labour candidates fighting three Nationalist candidates. There may be three candidates representing another party; and still others. Under the provisions of this Bill electors will be compelled to vote for seven candidates. In the event of the demise of a party candidate the party which has nominated him can have no opportunity to make the votes cast for the deceased tell in favour of the party. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The same situation was discussed at the time of the unfortunate incident in South Australia. It was considered that there was a way out of the difficulty. Let us suppose that a Nationalist candidate has died. The National party should have the right to place the name of another candidate on the ticket before the day- of the election, so that Nationalist supporters could vote for a complete Nationalist ticket. When a Senate ballot-paper is placed in my hands I am desirous of voting for the three candidates nominated&#39; by the party to which I adhere, and of voting for no other candidate. I want no other candidate elected to Parliament. This measure will compel me to vote for a person whom I would not have on my mind. That is one of its faults. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> holds that I, as an elector; should not be placed in such a position, but. that a party should be able to say, in the event of one of its candidates dying, that none of the effective votes cast on. the party ticket for the deceased should &#39; be permitted to count in favour of some other candidate outside of the party group. The Bill should provide for another name being related in the group instead of the name of the deceased. </para>

                        <para>- It is desirable that this matter should be discussed in order that it may be in the minds of honorable senators at a subsequent period when possibly we may be called upon to consider another Electoral Bill. I do not think it is fair &#39;to compel an elector to register a vote in favour of any candidate whose claims for support he would not have upon his mind. The average elector knows quite well how he intends to vote. He is either upon one side of the political fence or upon the other. This result has - been brought about by the organizing work of the two great political parties which are recognised in this Parliament to-day. Those parties are recognised only because the people who are behind them have taken the trouble to make themselves fairly conversant with the affairs of this country. In my opinion they are the only people . who are entitled to representation here. We are now arriving at a stage in our history when&#39; other political parties may spring into existence, but in my judgment we shall not have more than one additional party. Nevertheless, the occasion may arise to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has called attention, when after one candidate has dropped out of a contest, the electors who have supported him with all the machinery of their organization, may be compelled to see their votes given to another candidate whom they would not support under any conceivable circumstances. Provision should be made in the Bill to avoid that sort of thing. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of my amendment is perfectly clear. In its present form the Bill will prove absolutely unfair in its operation. The object of any election is to afford the electors an opportunity to vote for the candidates in whose policy they believe. It is absolutely repugnant to the principles of a fair Electoral Act that any elector should be compelled to vote &#34;for* a candidate in whose policy he does not believe. Yet this clause affirms that although &#39;there may be only three candidates to be elected, every elector must vote for twice that number of candidates plus one. In other words, it provides that every elector must vote for seven candidates even if only three are to be elected. I am quite prepared to believe that there may be amongst honorable senators opposite a very rigid total abstainer. There may be one amongst their number to whom the smell, let alone the taste, of such a mild beverage as Abbot&#39;s lager is absolutely objectionable. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it can. Under a system of. proportional representation, if there are three candidates to be elected, the elector has to vote for 1,2, and 3 in the order of his preference. But he is not compelled to vote for more than the number of candidates requiring to be elected. I have seen the system operating off and on in Tasmania for the past twenty years. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> is a rigid total abstainer. At the forthcoming elections for the Senate in Queensland, there may be nine candidates whose names will figure upon the ballot-papers. Out of that number, there may be three in whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> believes because of their general politics, and because they are total abstainers. With the other six candidates, he may not have anything in common. As there are only three candidates to be elected, it would be unfair to compel him, after he has exercised his first, second, and third preference votes, to continue to register his preferences in respect of the remaining candidates whose policy may be absolutely repugnant to him. The effect of my amendment will be to make the Bill a fair and square one, which will compel the electors to vote only for the number of candidates requiring to be elected. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not accept  the amendment. As I pointed out during the course of my speech upon the second reading of this Bill, there is no particular virtue in numbers. The number seven, for which provision is made in this clause, is simply an arbitrary number. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> rightly pointed out that, under a perfect preferential system of voting, an elector would be bound to register his preferences in regard to all the candidates whose names appeared upon the ballot-paper. The reason why seven has been -adopted in this measure is that, at every election there are a number of nondescript candidates who cannot hope to influence the result in the slightest degree, and whose candidature simply means an unnecessary burdening of the ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>- &#34;We do not wish to overcater for it. The number seven has been chosen, and the elector is to be obliged to vote for that number of candidates, for common-sense reasons. It is not desired to compel electors to vote for candidates who, by reason of the votes thus cast, would gain a notoriety which would not otherwise come to them. It has been shown that seven is a very safe number to adopt in connexion with elections; and, although this system may not be quite as scientific as that which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> in 999 cases out of 1,000, it will produce the same result. On the other hand, I would point out that if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> wishes, an elector is permitted to refrain from- exercising his preference votes in the case of more than three candidates, at a big party election it will mean the end of the preferential voting system. At the last elections, a mere handful of people were watching and organizing, whilst the two big political parties were fighting each other, and this small minority of electors was practically in a position , to blackmail either of those parties by threatening to swing its support to the other side. We wish to insure the recording of sufficient votes to destroy the power of a small minority. It has been shown from investigation that twice the number of candidates required, plus one, is a sound method, and gives the same results in actual working as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

                        <para>- There may be a nondescript,- who secured a few votes, but who could be made master of the situation. The object of making the number seven is to provide for a distribution of voting power, and prevent an outsider being elected. Supposing the National party and the Labour party were within 5,000 votes of each other, and the Farmers&#39; party received 15,000 votes, it would be master of the situation. The system would lead to corruption - in consequence of the insufficiency of votes to be utilized. The idea is to compel such a number of votes to operate as to make that impossible. I do not suggest that people would do anything corrupt, but the temptation would be there. . I believe that a well-managed party would in all earnestness make the best arrangements for their candidates. There is not anything miraculous about twice the number plus one, but it makes an electorate sufficiently large to prevent any by-play being undertaken. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment were adopted, we would remain in our present position, and it would be just as well to drop the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Practical tests have been made  Dy  the electoral officers; and, although I was not present, I have been informed by men sufficiently acquainted with scientific electoral methods that the tests on the system of twice the number plus one record a preferential vote in 999 out of 1,000. If honorable senators are opposed to the system embodied in the clause, they had better vote against the whole Bill. </para>

                    <para>. -  Under the Bill an elector will have to vote for twice the number of candidates, plus one. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has said, the supporters of the group &#34;A&#34; candidates would not have the group &#34; B &#34; candidates on their mind, and the result would be that the supporters of groups <inline font-style="italic">&#34;A&#34;</inline> and &#34; B &#34; would give their surplus votes to group &#34; C.&#34; That would result in the last mentioned group receiving double the number of effective votes, and groups &#34; A &#34; and &#34; B &#34; being displaced. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the system submitted to the Committee, and I am rather -in favour of the marking being limited, because. I can see that there is a possibility of forcing the surplus votes on to a third party. A better system would be to record the  preference for every candidate on the ballot-paper rather than for twice the number, plus one. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all, because an elector could vote for only three. If this amendment is carried, an elector will be able to vote for more than three, if he so wishes. Supposing there are six candidates - three Nationalists and three representatives of the Labour party - it will be- necessary  under . this Bill to vote for seven. If there are only six candidates I cannot see how the three representing one party can be returned without having a majority of the votes. It would, be sufficient, I think, if the application of the principle were optional instead of compulsory. I understand that 80 per cent, of the informal votes cast at the last election were informal because the voters marked their papers for less or more than the number required. </para>

I admit that if there were nine candidates in the field it would then be possible for a candidate representing a minority vote to be successful. But I think the optional exercise of the preference vote would be sufficient. If it is made compulsory I feel sure the tendency will be to increase the number of informal votes cast. Why should I or any other elector be compelled to vote for a candidate whose principles I do not believe in ? </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister spoke of political bargaining as &#39;being likely to lead to some form of corruption, and I repeat that we have not had any corruption up to the present. Honorable senators seem to have missed the point of my amendment. I am not against preferential voting, but I admit that I would kick the Bill into the waste-paper basket if I could. If my amendment- is carried we will have the very best kind of preferential voting, because it will be optional. Can any honorable senator honestly declare that an elector will exercise preference wisely if it is done under compulsion ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is one of the oldest students of proportional representation and the preferential vote, and I ask him if he thinks a man can be expected to exercise a sound preference vote if it is done against his will. </para>

                        <para>- I disagree with the honorable senator. . Preference, in my opinion, should be by the free will of the elector, and not under compulsion. I believe in compelling a man to vote for the number of vacancies to be filled, but any preference beyond that number should be optional. Of course, we know that the Bill has been introduced so that after the next election the present Government will not have a new Senate as a result of a split vote. </para>

                        <para>- Let us be candid about the matter. The Government know that they are not much in favour with a certain section of their supporters, but they believe that the Farmers Union voters, after they have given their primary votes to their own candidates, will probably mark their fourth, fifth, and sixth preferences in favour of Nationalist candidates rather than in favour of Labour nominees. If the Government are justified in the assumption that supporters of the . Farmers Union will prefer a Nationalist candidate to a Labour candidate, the adoption of my amendment will in no way affect the result of the election; but if it is carried, provision will be made for the exercise of a real preference by  electors, and they will not be compelled to indicate what will not be a  Teal  preference by recording a vote for candidates whom they have no desire to see returned. </para>

If the electors, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, are to indicate only their first three preferences, this Bill will have no advantage over the present block system. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; we shall be just where we are under the existing law. It is easy to visualize an election for the State of Victoria, which would give 300,000 first, second, and third votes for Nationalist candidates, 275,000 first, second, and third votes for Labour candidates, and 100,000 first, second, and third votes for. Farmers Union candidates. The result would be that 300,000 Nationalist electors would elect the whole of the three members of the Senate required to be elected for the. State of Victoria, and 375,000 combined Labour and Farmers Union electors would elect none. That is what this Bill is intended to avoid. </para>

                        <para>- I have no idea as to what will occur  at  the next election; but I say that if the electors are to exercise a preference in the voting for candidates, they must vote for at least seven if the object of the Bill is to  be  achieved. I wish to emphasize one point that the Minister made, and that is that the electors should be compelled to vote for at least seven candidates, so that their preference, when exercised, will  be  so broad as to prevent any minority representation in the Senate. I was not surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> support the amendment, because the honorable senator frankly admits that he does not want proportional representation, and he does not want preferential voting.. He believes in the block vote, the first past the post, and party organization. The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment may be seen if it is applied to an election for the House of Representatives. It will be clear that in that case there would be&#39; no necessity for preferential voting at all. I shall certainly oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has compelled me to speak, for the simple reason that I gather from his remarks that he  ha3  in mind a better system for securing the better representation for the people in the Senate than is the block system. I prefer to be guided by the results in actual practice of .a system we have tested rather than by speculations upon the results of a . system that has not yet been tried. The block system is  responsible for the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the present Senate, and it will be agreed that that is highly satisfactory. If honorable senators will consult the figures of the 1914 election, they will find that, with two exceptions, the senators returned to this Chamber represented an absolute majority of the votes recorded at the election. The two exceptions were ex-Senator Ready and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> Ex-Senator Ready polled 49.47 &#39; of the votes recorded at the election in Tasmania, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> polled 48.92 per cent, of the votes recorded in that State. The only senators who were returned at the 1914 election without an absolute majority of .the votes recorded in their State, were two representatives (of the State which we have been invited to believe is the most intellectual State in the Commonwealth. I am disposed to think that it must be&#39; so, because the people evidently keep their intellect in Tasmania, since they do not send it here. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that what is desired by the Government for the coming election is such an alteration of the electoral law as will bring the system of voting for senators into line with the system now in force for voting for members of the House of Representatives. We cannot force the hand of the Government, but I believe that if the Minister will introduce a Bill which will provide for a block vote, with the exercise of first, second, and third preference, for the Senate, it will bring our system into&#39; line with that adopted for the House of Representatives, and will be all that is required for the coming election. The old block system has been found satisfactory, and why should- we not continue that system ? I venture to say that when a Government have given up the responsibility of governing, and announce their intention to appeal to the country, it is not a good thing to alter the system of voting which the people are accustomed to. </para>

That would bring the system of voting for senators into line with the system adopted for the House of Representatives, and in view of the immense amount of business which remains to be done, the Minister might take into consideration the advisableness of making such a proposal. </para>

                        <para>- It is human nature. I remind honorable senators that since 5 o&#39;clock this afternoon I have not addressed myself to this measure, believing that we would get along with its consideration. This is a question in which the interests of honorable senators are at stake. They have been elected for term after term, and are experts in a matter of this kind. On this account we may expect that every clause of the -measure will undergo full discussion, and I suggest that the Minister might agree to take a simple test vote to decide whether we shall continue the old block system for the coming election, and let the new Parliament take up the consideration of proportional representation and preferential voting. I will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, because I see no reason why we should compel an elector to indicate a preference for a candidate in whom he does not believe. In the case of the last Senate election in New South Wales, if I had exercised a preference for a fourth candidate it would probably have been for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> because he will not mind my saying that I am closely in agreement with him on the question of prohibition. If I were to exercise a fourth preference at the present time I should exercise it in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> because it matters not whether he is behind the Government or otherwise; he is just as much in opposition to the </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but the honorable senator does not want to see Government supporters secure a majority of seats even when they have a majority of the votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is always willing to take advantage of the situation arising from an outsider coming along with the avowed purpose, not of gaining a seat, but of keeping another candidate out. I have previously quoted the results of  an election, which was also referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> On one side there were 236000 votes, which succeeded in getting two seats, while on the other side 234,000 votes secured four seats. That is the sort of thing we are trying to correct. I would correct- it by means other than those set out in this measure. If the Government simply require electors to vote 1, 2, 3, and do not compel - them to vote for any greater number of candidates, they will fail to accomplish what the Bill sets out to secure. It will amount to this: that the minority will gain the seats. </para>

                    <para>.- In standing. by the block system I claim that a review of the figures which I have already quoted will show that the block system has proved to be actually a. majority system. I quoted the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and of ex-Senator Ready being returned to this Chamber.&#39; It will be recalled that the election results so closely approximated to an absolute majority that if either the preferential or any other system had been in practice the &#39; same effect would have been secured as the block system brought about. If the block system has resulted in candidates who have- gained absolute majorities being returned to Parliament, why change it? I can quite understand, that an honorable senator who knows of a better system would be able to see the evils of the block system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> however, has benefited by the preferential . system. </para>

Suppose that I am to vote, on the 13th December next, under the preferential system. I will naturally vote for three Labour candidates. But what of my fourth vote ? Will I vote for the best man next available, or for the candidate  who is least likely to be returned, and who, even if he is returned, will be the least troublesome to the Labour party? </para>

                    <para>. -  When I was addressing myself to the motion for the second reading of this Bill I was under a misapprehension as to the meaning of the word &#34; excluded.&#34; I thought it meant that the candidate with the lowest number of primary votes was to be &#34; excluded,&#34; not merely from the first count, but also from the second. However, I accepted the explanation offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating-</inline> at the time, although I still think that the amendment will absolutely insure that when a candidate is elected his second preference votes shall be included in the next count.- </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against the undue length of certain clauses in this Bill. The particular clause under discussion covers half of page 5 of the Bill, the whole of pages 6, 7, and 8, and almost the whole of page 9. To my mind a very much more satisfactory system of draftsmanship could be adopted. The machinery which is embodied in this clause should be divided into several clauses. The measure would then be much more intelligible to honorable senators, as well as to the electors. </para>

The Government have been considering for several months a Bill to amend the electoral law in regard to the election of senators, and we have also been informed by the Minister that the suggested system has been satisfactorily tested by . competent electoral officers. Notwithstanding this, at the first breath of opposition from the Government supporters - because those on this side were in favour of the grouping system -

                            <para>- And I have known cases where the names, were arranged alphabetically and the electors found it exceedingly difficult to record their vote as they wished. In some cases they marked the first or the last three. In the event of a double dissolution, there would be six candidates for each party in the Senate, and the difficulty would be accentuated. Under the Bill, as it has been amended, it will be necessary for the elector to mark at least seven candidates, and if the grouping system is dispensed with and the alphabetical order substituted, it will lead to confusion. The grouping system would have facilitated the operation of voting considerably. </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised to learn that a majority of the Senate is opposed to such a simple proposition. Wo have not to consider what is good for one party or the other, but -the convenience of the electors. I am prepared to make a stand, and would like the question put- to a division. I am not viewing this matter from a party stand-point, but am endeavouring to simplify the system of voting. We have to remember that nearly half of our electors are women, who do not see a ballot-paper from one election to another. There are also others who have to be assisted in&#39; recording their votes, and under, the grouping system  voting would be simplified. If the electors are to select their candidates from a list alphabetically arranged, all sorts of devices will have to be adopted to enable an effective vote to be recorded. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am entirely at a loss to understand what has persuaded the Minister to depart from the grouping system, of which I cordially approve. In moving his amendment the Minister did not in- &#39; dictate his reasons for dispensing with the letters. The grouping system would assist the electors in effectively marking their ballot-papers. I favour the grouping rather than the alphabetical system. If the names are grouped it would not be of any advantage to any party, but it would be a convenience to the electors, and it is extraordinary that the Minister . should, without any discussion, move an amendment to delete the letters designating groups. . The Bill is supposed to simplify the method of election. We should do all we can to simplify the ballot-paper, especially in the interests of the older people whose sight may not be so keen, and who are so often called upon to exercise the franchise in dimly lighted polling booths. I hope the Committee will not agree to the withdrawal of the amendment. I intend to oppose it, and to get a vote, on the question, because I feel confident that during the second reading debate, a majority of the members in the Senate favoured the grouping system. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think a position has arisen in which we can very well meet the Minister. I do not mean that we will accept the amendment that has now been moved to strike but certain words, but I suggest that if be thinks the majority, of the Senate is against him, a test vote might be taken, in which, by arrangement, the Minister should vote with the &#34; Noes,&#34; and for retaining the provision in the Bill. We will then have a fair test of opinion with regard to -the grouping system, which I think is preferable, and should be retained in the Bill,&#39; particularly in view of the fact that at the next election it is likely there will be a large&#39; number of groups. I ask the Minister to let us have a test vote, because I am of the same opinion as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> and think that the numbers are the other way. </para>

                            <para>- This branch of the Legislature has an unchallengeable right to make amendments in a measure of this nature, especially when the circumstances warrant it. I am&#39; one. of those who voted for the Bill, because it embodied the principle of preferential voting. I reject the proportional system as &#39;applied to fine Senate for the reason that the Commonwealth is a specially constituted form of government under which &#39;all the States have equal representation in the Senate. Here, now, is an attempt to recognise parties. Every honorable senator is here to voice views which he thinks are in the public interest. &#39; I believe that by retaining this clause the party to which I belong will stand to lose more than it will gain, because, as one who has gone through the mill, I know how the electors of this country are schooled. I believe, however, that we should do all we possibly can to discourage the baneful influence of party system, which; as I have previously said, is the direct product of representative government, and has been responsible for many grievous wrongs. </para>

                            <para>- The good must be balanced against the evils, and I say that in the national interests the party system should be kept in check.&#39; Here is an attempt for the first time to elevate the party system of government. The Australian ballot has won the admiration of the most earnest students of parliamentary government in other parts of the world, and it would be a grievous mistake, in my opinion, to attempt to elevate the party system to a higher level than it should occupy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> sits where he does, not because of a slavish submission to party interests, but because he broke through party bonds, and said, &#34; No more of your party government for me.&#34; </para>

A proposal was made for the purchase of a. private railway enterprise, involving an expenditure of -&#163;1,500,000, a large sum for  a small community. That proposal was made by the party in power at the time. The party in Opposition, although its members said in the lobbies of Parliament and elsewhere that the proposal was a magnificent one, opposed it, because they would not give the other side the flimsy credit of being responsible for carrying it. . They combined forces, and defeated the proposal, to the serious injury of the people of Western Australia. </para>

I will npt lend my assistance to give the seal of approval to the party system, which is often referred to by intelligent citizens as the curse of the country. We are &#39;here asked to give the party system our benediction, and by a law of the country set the seal of approval upon it. I hope that honorable senators will stand by the purity of the ballot, which has raised us from a lowly position to a high one in the matter of intelligent political thinking. We should stand by the old system which has done so much for us in the past. We must preserve inviolable the neutrality of our electoral officials, and I hope that honorable senators will vote accordingly. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot refrain from expressing my opposition to the views put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> as to the defects of party government. Any one who will consider the growth and development of the party system in politics, in Great Britain particularly, with its long parliamentary history, will find that from a, system of government by persons called together by the King, and not consisting of parties, there grew with the passing of the years, a better system, under which the best set of nien in a party formed the Government, and the other party formed the Opposition. That result was a matter of slow growth, and it could not have matured as it did except with the approval of the people. Party government was not invented and discovered complete, and forced upon the acceptance of the people. It was the growth of years. It has its defects, as have all systems which have to be operated by human&#39; beings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is blaming the system of party government for something which is not party government, and which has been even more apparent in Great Britain than it has been here. It has become an axiom in Great Britain that coalitions of parties are always absolute failures. This Bill has been introduced, not by a party government, but by a coalition of parties attempting to govern: The coalition system is a failure for the simple reason that,  instead of having a definite and distinct policy, a coalition Government must pursue a compromise policy all the time. That has been the trouble with this Bill. As introduced it provided for a system of voting for groups of candidates. In the coalition party opposite it has been found that there is a strong section of members who will not have groups, and as soon as those members raised their voices the Minister, who wants groups, says, &#34; The majority is against me, and, therefore, I must compromise. I have no fixed policy.&#34; The honorable senator can have no fixed policy, because he is leading two sections regarding political questions from different view-points. I am not censuring the Minister on this account, because in the position which he occupies I consider that he is doing excellently. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I want, and, in my opinion, if .the Government had properly interpreted the opinion of the Senate, the Minister would have adhered to the Bill. It would have been better if, before giving way on this matter, he had tested the opinion &#39; of the Senate. No Minister can express the view of honorable senators on the other side, because they hold two distinct views - one the view of the Nationalists, and the other the view of those who would probably call themselves the Nationalist Labour section. </para>

The Government introduced this Bill in good faith, but I have said that I would not regard it as a party measure in so far as the machinery clauses giving it effect are concerned. If the question now raised were regarded by the Government as vital, my attitude upon it would be quite different. . We have determined the main principle as to whether there shall be majority rule or proportional representation, and I have endeavoured to ascertain the will of the majority of honorable senators, after reasonable discussion, as to the machinery clauses to give effect to the vital principle of the Bill. It is not a pleasant thing to have to bow to others&#39; opinion, but I believe that the true principle of democracy calls for it in this case, and the opinion of the majority should be respected when to respect it would in no way humiliate the Government. I am not prepared to go back upon my expressed intention to be guided by the majority of honorable senators with respect to provisions of the Bill which are not vital. I am not going to jump about now to see whether the majority are behind me. If in this matter it is found that the majority are not behind me I cannot&#39; help it.

                        <para>. - I wish to say a word or two on this matter. I shall go back to the question of the count. How is the elector . to differentiate between candidates if we do away with the grouping system? If the names of the candidates are to be scattered up and down, the ballot-paper it will be a mere scramble, especially for those who are not as clear headed as are honorable senators, to decide for whom they should vote. If the names are to be placed on the ballot-paper in alphabetical&#39; order, King&#39;s name would appear on the ballot-paper at about the place where Quick&#39;s name now appears, according to the schedule of the Bill. Russell&#39;s name would appear very near the bottom of the paper. An elector, in recording his preference, will require to vote for&#39; one candidate whose name appears at the top of the paper and another whose name appears in the middle of it, and for a third whose name appears at the bottom of the paper. That will be an impossible task for a great many electors in Australia, and it will certainly lead to a multiplication of informal votes. If the group system did not commend itself to the Government when they introduced the Bill, why did they adopt it. The Minister says that the Committee is against it, but I question that very much. I know that a few honorable senators are against it because they think it may be manipulated in. some way. As provided for in the Bill it would facilitate elections. I am not viewing the Bill as it might affect me, but as it might affect the electors. When they have marked the three candidates whom they desire to see returned they will have to mark their preference in respect of four others whose names will be equally scattered on the ballot-paper. We are asking the electors to do what it will be impossible for a great many of them. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder when we shall hear the last of what is done in Tasmania. We are everlastingly being told what they&#39; do in Tasmania. Surely there is some good in Queensland, where the people have had the wisdom to avoid the adoption of the principles which has been adopted by Tasmania ! My sole endeavour is to make elections as simple as possible. Let us consider the three names which . appear in the first group on the ballot-paper set forth in the schedule, and let us disperse them alphabetically. One name will be found at the top of the paper, another about the middle, and a third right at the bottom. After an elector has discovered those three names, he must make his fourth preference, which will probably be found at the top of the paper. The fifth may be about the middle,  the sixth  at the bottom, and the seventh somewhere between the top and the bottom. This kind of thing will drive -hundreds of people away from the polling booths. We make it compulsory for electors to enroll. Why should we not facilitate their voting? </para>

                        <para>. - I want to know why the Government originally placed a number of names in a certain order on the ballot-paper, and why there has been some understanding since arrived at regarding the amendment of the Bill. I protest against it. This Bill is an innovation. The method of marking papers is new. The system of voting for so many candidates is new. It is our duty to make the innovation as simple as possible. Only upon two occasions in the past have the people been called upon to vote for more than three Senate candidates at an election. The aged and infirm and the comparatively illiterate, of whom there are thousands in Australia, will find, it a tremendously difficult problem to compulsorily select from an alphabetically arranged ballot-paper seven candidates in order of preference. </para>

Had I been present I would have supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment in favour of the principle of proportional voting, as it is one which I have favoured for a number of years. It is one that is included in the platform of the South Australian Labour party; and, now that we are re-casting our electoral law, the Government have missed an opportunity  of  introducing a. thoroughly scientific and tried system. It would have been, decidedly better than the complicated, cumbersome, and untried system that has been adopted. I am influenced by the fact that all the senators from Tasmania, where the system has been in operation for twenty yeai&#39;3, are unanimously in favour of it. It has been tried in various countries, and this hybrid system which we have just passed is really a leap in the dark. The&#39; only objection to be found in connexion with the working of the proportional system is in regard to by-elections; but that objection cannot apply to Senate elections. Under the Constitution, a by-election to fill a Senate vacancy is undertaken by the two Houses of Parliament of the State affected jointly choosing a member. The system contained in this Bill perpetuates the block system, under which one party can obtain the whole of the seats at any election. One party has succeeded in doing that. As a member of the Labour party, and speaking from experience in the State I represent, I can say that this system has worked very well from a party point of view. In 1904, 1910, 1913, and in 1914, the South Australian Labour party have obtained the whole of the three Senate seats, and I have every confidence that in the forthcoming election it can do the same. That, however, does not blind me to the fact that a principle that enables any party to obtain the whole of the representation in this Senate on a small majority vote is an unjust and inequitable system, and for that reason I am opposed to the principle. In the Commonwealth at large the Labour party gained all the seats in 1910 and 1914, as did the National or Win-the-war party in 1917. The actual number of votes cast for each party did not justify one party in getting the whole representation. It would only justify it in securing ten of the eighteen seats; or, in the case of a double dissolution, twenty out of thirty-six. For these reasons, I am opposed to the Bill. I think the principle is one that cannot be justified in carrying on representative government, because it ought to provide for majority rule and a minority having adequate representation. </para>
