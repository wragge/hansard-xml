                    <quote>
                        <para>That the Senate records  its  sincere regret at the death of the late Albert Clayton Palmer, member for the Division of Echuca, and expresses its appreciation of the zeal with which he devoted himself to his public  duties,  and its profound sympathy with  his  bereaved wife and family in their great sorrow. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I am sure that I have the concurrence of honorable senators in submitting this motion, as although the honorable gentleman whose name is referred to in it was not a member of the Senate, he was a member of the National Parliament, and had endeared himself to members generally by his high personal qualities and his devotion to his duty. </para>
                    <para>It is inevitable that in any Parliament all the members will not hold the same views. Yet, though honorable senators may have differed from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer</inline> in opinion, they- all recognised those personal qualities which made him conspicuous. He undoubtedly had great courage, he was essentially straight, and regardless of the effect upon his own political fortunes which the expression of his views might entail, he was always possessed of the courage to express them. Having heard him state his views, all his hearers were immediately convinced of the sincerity behind them.  His  personal qualities insured for him a hearty esteem, whilst there was a manliness, courtesy, and sincerity about the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer</inline> that endeared him to the large majority of the members of both Houses of this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I submit this motion with a special reference to those who are the chief sufferers by his decease. I am sure that our hearts go out to them on this occasion. We, therefore, not only place on record our sense of the loss of a fellow worker with ourselves in the National Parliament, but also our great sympathy with those who are left to mourn him. </para>
                    <para>In submitting the motion, although it is not expressly stated in it, I assume that it carries with it the request that you, sir, will forward it to the proper quarter. </para>

                        <para>. - It is my sad duty to second the motion so ably moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and to associate honorable senators on this side with it. Sitting in a different branch of the National&#39; Parliament, it was not my good fortune to be closely acquainted with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer;</inline> yet I feel sure that not only honorable senators on this side, but members generally of both Houses of this Parliament will concur heartily in the expressions given utterance to &#39;by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> We do extend to the loved ones&#39; left behind the sympathy of the Senate and of this Parliament. </para>
