            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - In re-affirming the attitude of the Government,  it  is both desirable and necessary  that  the circumstances  surrounding  the present disastrous strike should be clearly set out. Moved by the experience of many disastrous strikes, the community decided, and has repeatedly indorsed its decision, to adopt arbitration as the means  for  the ordinary settlement of industrial disputes. That decision is embodied  in  the law of the coun  try,  and the necessary legal machinery had been created to give effect thereto. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That . machinery is available to the members of the Seamen&#39;s Union, but they not only decline to avail themselves of these means of obtaining consideration of their claims, but they have openly declared that they will not proceed by the orderly and regular methods of arbitration, but intend to enforce their decisions by paralyzing the industries of the country. They seek to win, not through the merits of their case, but from the suffering they hope to inflict. They no longer disguise either their objects or their methods; both of which constitute an open challenge alike to the law and the community. </para>
          <para>From the inception of the strike the Government have worked with but  one  object. They have taken every step which offered any prospect of leading to a (peaceful settlement of the dispute, short of an ignominious surrender to the demands .that direct action should &#39;be permitted to triumph over arbitration, the law, and the established institutions of the community. </para>
          <para>In the hope that the good sense of the majority of the men would ultimately reject the sinister advice of their leaders, and that the growing manifestations of public disapproval would convince them of the folly of continuing to follow that advice, the Government have with great patience refrained from any action at all&#39; likely to complicate or extend the struggle, or to embitter the minds o&#163; those who have created it. After the-. Court had been openly flouted, the Government took the action which again: enabled the men without any loss of dignity or prejudice to their case, to again obtain a hearing. But, again, they, made it clear that they were defiantly determined to enforce their claims by war upon the community rather than submit to the adjudication of the Court.&#34; The Government is now, as it always has been, willing to further any proposal making for the proper and orderly settlement of the dispute, but it cannot, and will not, yield to methods of direct action or the revolutionary threats of those advocating that policy. </para>

              <para>- The present position cannot be allowed to continue. Already the strike has caused great industrial dislocation, with the accompanying widespread privation to thousands of innocent people, and serious material loss to the country. These grave consequences will intensify with every day&#39;s prolongation of the struggle, which, if allowed to proceed, would ultimately strangle all industrial activity, and with it the people&#39;s means of subsistence. </para>

          <para>The Government realizes fully its duty in the present trying conditions, and is not assisted in its discharge by the advice of ill-informed critics. It is, however, in possession of information indicating that steps are being taken to secure a peaceful solution of the present distressful problem. It does not intend to jeopardize this movement, but, on the contrary, will do everything in its power <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> help to a successful issue. The Government is not without hope that this movement will succeed; but should it, unfortunately, fail it will take all steps necessary to secure the restoration of in- - dustry to. normal conditions. </para>
          <para>The Government desires at this critical juncture to make a final appeal to the men immediately concerned to even now present their claims to the proper tribunal rather than to continue to wage war upon the entire community and the forces of constituted authority. The Government presses this appeal with all sincerity and all earnestness, and it asks the co-operation of all the leaders of organized labour who are in a position peculiarly fitting them, to influence the decision of the Seamen&#39;s Union. It will do what it can to overcome any difficulties which may appear to exist in the acceptance of this appeal. </para>

              <para>- The rule is that if any paper is laid on the table of the Senate any member of the Senate may move that it be printed. But the paper read by the Minister for Repatriation was not laid on the table. It was merely a statement by the Minister, which might have been delivered without having been written out at all. The honorable senator cannot move that that statement be printed, because it is not a paper laid on the table of the Senate. </para>

It would be absurd for the Senate to meet at 3 o&#39;clock to-morrow and adjourn at 4 o&#39;clock. I invite honorable senators, therefore, to express approval of the proposed course - that is, to take Friday&#39;s sitting to-morrow, and to cut out what would be Thursday&#39;s sitting. </para>

        <para class="block">Australia) &#91;3.25&#93;.- Will the Minister consider another proposition, which also involves the question of adjournment; that is, whether in regard to the business of the Senate we cannot meet on Thursdays and Fridays instead of on Wednesdays and Thursdays ? This Chamber has been meeting for some time upon only two days in the week. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> therefore consider the convenience of honorable senators from South Australia, who have to leave their homes on Mondays and spend a day or two in Melbourne doing nothing? Honorable senators from Sydney and other States, where the facilities of daily trains are still afforded, are free to journey to Melbourne or to return daily, whereas South Australian representatives in this Chamber are compelled to .spend an extra day here. </para>

True, we have been putting in only two days weekly since re-assembling, but I hope presently to present such a budget of business that more time will be required than has hitherto been occupied. If honorable senators are willing, however, I shall not object to sitting on Thursday and Friday instead of on Wednesday and Thursday if only two sittings are necessary each week. </para>

            <para>The rule of the Department is to prohibit medical officers, who are employed on a fulltime basis, from engaging in private practice; but in South Australia this rule has been relaxed in the case of some city practitioners, who are permitted to do a small amount of private work in off-duty hours. These include some city practitioners who are called up for full-time duty at intermittent periods only. The latter mustof necessity keep in touch with their districts to cope with the needs of the civil community. No interference with military duty is caused by the arrangement which obtains in South Australia - an arrangement that has been designed to meet both civil and military requirements. </para>
            <para>The following is a list of medical officers in South Australia who are so engaged :  - Lieut. - Colonels H. H. E. Russell, R.&#39; S.&#39; Rogers, and A.W.

            <para>- The maintenance of soldiers who have lost their employment as the result of the strike was not regarded as a function of the Repatriation Department, but the Government recognised that these men, recently returned from the Front, could not be asked, unaided, to face the ordinary vicissitudes of their calling, and, therefore, resolved that they should receive the same sustenance as they would have received had they been placed on the unemployed register of the Department. The men, therefore, get the same sustenance allowance as &#39; they would have got if. they had never been placed in employment. The Deputy Controllers of Repatriation will be given authority to make the necessary inquiries, with a view to insuring that only men who are entitled to this aid shall receive it. </para>

I do not propose to read the whole of the court martial proceedings, but to refer to the first stage of the proceedings which led to the charge of mutiny. I do not leave out reference to other proceedings of the court martial with a view of lessening the gravity of the offence with which the men were charged. I make this quotation for the- convenience of honorable senators to show what was the beginning of the so-called mutiny in order that they may be in a position to say whether the sentences imposed were savage sentences or not. I quote the following ; - </para>

          <para>The charge was accompanied by the following circumstantial report by Captain Cumberlego: - &#34; The circumstances are as follows - About 10.30 a.m. on Sunday, 1st June, 1919, at Fremantle, my attention was directed to a large body of men between eighty and 100 in number, who came up on to the quarter-deck and assembled in front of P turret. I noticed that many of the men wore the rig of liberty mcn, and that they straggled on to the quarterdeck and formed up there with more or less even front, but no attempt at an orderly formation was made. </para>

            <para>- Before you, sir, give your ruling on the point of order, let me say that you ruled that I could not ask a question in which I made a statement. I have made no statement in the question I have now asked; I have merely asked the Minister if it is a fact that certain British officers have inflicted savage and vindictive sentences upon Australian sailors who have done good service during the war. I do not make a statement. I ask whether a statement is correct, and I believe I am in order in doing so. </para>

            <para>- The Standing Orders are clear and emphatic that a question must be asked only for the purpose of eliciting information, andmust contain no statement, no argument, and no comment. . The practice of the House of Commons as laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> confirms the practice followed under our own. Standing Orders. The word &#34;savage&#34; used, in the honorable senator&#39;s question to qualify the word &#34; sentences &#34; is undoubtedly comment, and his question is therefore contrary to our own Standing Orders and to the practice of the House of Commons. </para>

        <para>Questions are continually coming under my notice which are asked, not so much for the purpose of obtaining information, as for ventilating the opinions of the questioners. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> preferred not to have his question placed on the notice-paper if the word &#34; savage &#34; were to be left out of it. That, proves to me clearly that the honorable senator is more interested in having his own comment published with the question than in obtaining information. </para>
        <para class="block">I wish to say at this stage that there is no evidence that I had any such idea in my mind.. You, sir, stood up and made a statement which there was not even an excuse for making. You made that statement in giving your ruling. You said that I preferred to have the question left out if it was not put in the way&#34; I desired. I never made any such statement. My statement was that I preferred to draft my ownquestion, and I refused to permit you to draft it for me.. I hope that you will see the difference* between the two positions.

        <para>In your reply you said that, as a matter of fact, no honorable senator was in order in asking questions at all except upon notice . given. I say your ruling . as a fair indication of your mind on this subject. We want to look closely into this matter, and see what our rights are, and whether they are not being gradually whittled away by a ruling of this nature. I maintain that honorable senators are entitled, not as a matter of privilege, but as a right, to ask questions without notice; and, further, that this right is provided for in our Standing Orders, as well as sanctioned by the immemorial custom of Parliaments, which confers an even stronger right than that given in our Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. That is my belief, too; and the onus is on the Minister of showing that honorable senators&#39; privileges have been . abused. I invite honorable senators to read my question with an openmind, and to remember that, although they may be ina majority to-day, and vote in the direction of preventing questions such as I have asked, they may on some future occasion probably findthemselves in a tight corner if they endeavour to ask questions to which exception has been taken. The standing order is quite clear, that there shall be no inference or imputation made in asking a question. Can honorable senators say that my question should have been prohibited underthis standing order? I simply asked the Acting Minister for Defence is it a . fact that on men on board the <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> savage sentences were passed by British officers. I&#39; made no statement that British officers did . inflict severe and savage sentences, though I have formed my own opinion as to their nature, and I asked the Minister &#34; if it is a fact &#34; that savage sentences were passed on the men. </para>

            <para>- I do, but I do not want to be led into a discussion on that aspect of the matter. It&#39; has been suggested to me that the word &#34; savage &#34; was too strong for the occasion, and that if I had asked the question in milder language it would have been permitted. But I argue that if I was out of order in applying the term &#34; savage &#34; to the sentences, I would have been equally out of order in referring to them as &#34; severe.&#34; </para>

            <para>- That may be so, but as far as our Standing Orders are concerned, I hold the view - contrary to that held &#39;by many honorable senators - that their interpretation ought to be in the direction of granting honorable senators greater liberties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has now put it to me that if he had asked the question he would have been perfectly in order in asking  if severe sentences had been- inflicted upon men.

            <para>- That is exactly the point at issue. If I am ruled out of order in putting my question in that manner, then rulings of such a character will narrow the rights of honorable senators so severely that it will be impossible - not with a  President  such as to-day presides over this Chamber, but with one who may want to become a schoolmaster - for anything else to follow except the curtailment of honorable senators&#39; liberties. If any honorable senator feels that a statement of his has been wrongly assumed to contain an imputation, there is a well-known course of procedure&#39; by which he may put himself right. He may deny the imputation, and his word is accepted. In asking my&#39; question I had no desire to impute anything &#39;to any one. I desired only to call the attention of the Government to the sentences which had been passed, in order to get the &#39; Government to say whether those sentences were savage or severe. Whereupon you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> ruled that I could not put my question in such form. It will be said, perhaps, that questions such as mine are asked so that honorable senators may parade their own views. If  one -desired to draw the limelight upon himself by medium of such inquiries, the opportunity is afforded by either moving the adjournment of the Senate or speaking upon the ordinary  adjournment.   My position has been this: I read in the newspapers particulars regarding the infliction of these&#39; sen tences, and I noticed that the whole trouble had originated from certain of the seamen on the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> having waited on the officers in deputation. Up to that stage no greater offence had been committed than that the men had waited in deputation on their officers. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I am not going to discuss how far circumstances such as have, arisen&#39; through the punishment of these men may extend, if sentences of such severity may be inflicted without question. When you ruled, in the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that my first inquiry was out of order, I took no exception, for. the reason that it comprised a statement of my own. I then drafted my question so that it would come within the Standing Ord&#39;ers. My surprise at your ruling it out of order was &#39; then so great that I could not imagine how it would be possible for me to ask a question of that kind at all. If I had characterized the sentences passed on board- the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> as savage and severe there would have been no need for me&#39; to&#39; have asked whether they were or were nob savage and severe. But, in asking whether it was a fact that those sentences were savage and severe, I hold that I put myself clearly within the Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- The rule of&#39; the House is that in putting a question no argument or opinion is to be offered, and no new fact stated, except as far. as they may be necessary to explain such questions. The good sense of that regulation must be evident to the House. No matter ought to bo propounded as a question in a form to raise discussion. In the present instance it is quite allowable for the honorable member to state the facts which are necessary to elucidate his question. Whether or not the assertions he has made are well founded it is quite beyond my province to determine. It would, of course, be improper and out of order for a member to state as a fact anything which he cannot substantiate. If it is capable of being established as a fact that the effigy of the Prince of Wales has been publicly burnt, then, perhaps, no great difference* of opinion would arise as to the appropriateness of the epithet &#34; disloyal &#34; applied to such a transaction. The rule of the House is, as I have stated, that no matter of opinion or argument can be introduced in putting a question. </para>

        <para class="block">The  Speaker  ruled that that question was in order. If such an inquiry was in order in the House of Commons, surely our practices are hot to he clipped, curtailed, and confined so as to provide a lesser degree of liberty than is enjoyed in the Imperial Parliament. Indeed, our Constitution gives to us all the rights and privileges obtaining . in the House of Commons. If your ruling, sir, were to hold good for the future, and an honorable senator rose to ask a question of similar character, the position would be that because an assertion had been imported into the question it was out of order and could not be asked. I rest my case upon, the one authority alone from which I have quoted. Here was a question, asked in the House of Commons, whether a certain disloyal gathering had committed certain actions. Objection was taken to the question being put in that form, whereupon the  Speaker  ruled as I have just indicated. It was not for him to determine as to the truthfulness or otherwise of the subject-matter of the question; it was sufficient that such subject-matter was considered necessary for inclusion in order that certain information might be elicited. I think you must see, sir, that if my question cannot be asked in the form in which I have put it, you will be curtailing, not only the rights and privileges of honorable senators held from the beginning of this Parliament, but rights and privileges which should be continued -to the end. </para>
        <para>In all my conflicts with the Chair on questions of order, I have had no personal bias or animus. I have followed this rule, namely, that I would never permit our rights to be transgressed without challenge. I feel very strongly that for you to rule that honorable senators may not ask questions in the form in which I have put mine would prevent us from asking any questions at all, if they contained matter intended for the eliciting of information. What if I were to ask, &#34; Is it a fact that the officers in German internment camps have inflicted savage and severe punishments upon Australian soldiers who were being held prisoner and who had done good service in the war ?&#34; Would such a question be in order J </para>

            <para>- I hold that under the Standing Orders honorable senators may ask questions of that character. According to the President&#39;s ruling, however, the Standing Orders are being interpreted in a manner which I deem contrary to common sense. The Standing Orders must be interpreted, not in any strained fashion, and not in such a manner as to pick upon any one word and rule that that word conveys an imputation. I repeat that I had no desire to impute motives to any one. &#39; Indeed, I have refrained from discussing these sentences in the strong hope that the Government might see fit to mark the celebrations of Peace in a way which would make those sentenced men rejoice and bring joyful appreciation to their relatives as well. We have either to exercise here the rights- which we have hitherto exercised - amongst others, the right to ask questions for the purpose of eliciting in-&#39; formation and without being bound down strictly to the language that we may use - or we must be content to see those rights disappear. I admit that it  is your province,, sir; to prevent a disorderly question appearing upon the notice-paper, .and I have _ never .questioned your authority in that matter. On the contrary, I accepted your ruling in that connexion at least on one occasion, because I believe that it is within your province to exercise that power. But when you exercise the power of determining that a question which contains no statement of fact, and which makes no imputation against anybody, but merely contains some adjectives which, in &#39;your opinion, are too strong, is disorderly, I hold that you are exceeding your functions. I do not care a dump for that aspect of the case, but I do care very seriously for the future conduct of business in this &#39; Chamber if our rights are to be thus gradually whittled away. In passing, I may say that this whittling away of parliamentary rights is a notable feature, not only in Australia, but all over the world. We see our privileges here disappearing, probably because of an indifference on the part of honorable senators to resist encroachments upon  them.  Reading our Standing Orders without bias and without in any way trying to bolster up a case, I maintain that you gave your decision hurriedly and without considering whether -I had asked the question for the purpose of eliciting information. I merely asked if it was a fact that a certain thing had happened - I did not say that it had happened. In these circumstances I ask you to reverse your decision so as to give a wider interpretation to our Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- &#39;It would be a happy one for the honorable senator, but a miserable one for the Government. Questions of that kind are clearly barred, not only by our Standing Orders, but also :by the wisdom which is derived from experience. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has raised the point that, under the interpretation given to our Standing Orders by the  President,  the power of honorable senators will be limited. I maintain that it will not be limited at all. There is ample room for the honorable senator to make imputations against these naval officers, but he must not make them by means of a question. He may move the adjournment of the Senate if he so desires, and upon that motion he will be at liberty to hurl all the condemnation that he chooses, either against .the officers who inflicted .these sentences, or against the sentences themselves. There is no Chamber in the world in which members have a greater freedom to express their views than they have here. But our Standing Orders are intended to cause honorable senators, in the first ,place, to ascertain what are the facts upon which, later, they may found their- opinions. It seems to me that the matter is so simple, both by reason of the language of the standing order and also because of the quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has made, that I was surprised to hear him venture to question your ruling. Once&#39; or twice in the course of his remarks it appeared to me that he wasunder the impression  that you were in some way responsible for that decision. Now it may -be that the standing order I have quoted is open to criticism - I am not saying that it is - but I want honorable senators to draw a wide distinction between a weak standing order and the decision of the  President  in interpretingit. I believe that the standing order in question is a sound and necessary one,, but, whether that be so or not, I submit that the  President  has given an accurateinterpretation of it. For this reason, I hope that the Senate will decline to indorse the motion submitted .by <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

            <para>- I think not. If I desired to waste the time of the Senate in quoting from its records, I believe I could show that Ministers, in answering questions, have expressed opinions. They have sometimes said in reply to questions that they did not feel inclined to answer them because they were submitted in a particular way. I believe, sir, that in ruling that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not entitled to use the word &#34; savage &#34; you  were unnecessarily curtailing his privileges. 1 feel sure that you would not wish to do so; but every one is entitled to his own opinion, and the presiding officer of the Senate, if he errs in giving a ruling, should err in the direction of extending rather than restricting the privileges of honorable senators. I say that your ruling in the case was wrong, because its tendency is to curtail the privileges of honorable- senators. Where there is any doubt about the interpretation of a standing order - and there is room for doubt about the interpretation of the standing order in question in this case - ithas been the custom of the presiding officer of the Senate to give his decision in such a way as to widen rather than restrict the privileges of honorable senators. If your ruling in . this case is to stand, an honorable senator will be debarred from asking such a question as - &#34;It is a fact that leniency has been shown by the Government in certain sentences that have been inflicted ?&#34; I believe that our records will show that questions have been allowed and answers permitted where opinions have been expressed, if the effect has been to give  praise to some one or other. No exception has been taken in such instances. If honorable senators desire not to unnecessarily curtail their privileges, but to retain them as they have existed for the past nineteen, years, they will uphold <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> objection, and. vote against the President&#39;s ruling. </para>

          <para>.- I did not intend to say anything on this matter, but as we shall presently be asked to condone or condemn the President&#39;s ruling, I may as well give my reasons for voting against it. I take it that all the camouflage with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> surrounded the standing order will go for nothing with honorable senators. He tried to show that the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was out of order because of an adjective which was used in it. I do not know whether the President&#39;s objection is to the use of the word &#34; savage,&#34; but I believe that if the records of the Senate were looked up, it would be found that the word has been used on many occasions. </para>

The word &#34; savage &#34; is an English word to be found in ordinary dictionaries. In my view, any word in the, English language to be found in a dictionary, and which is not blasphemous, should be allowed to be used in this Chamber. I shall not argue about the standing order. I refer honorable senators simply to the word which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> used. I consider that an honorable senator in asking a question should be at perfect liberty to use any word to be found in an ordinary English dictionary, so long as it is not blasphemous </para>

        <para>It is because a very great latitude is sometimes given to honorable senators, and the concession tends to an abuse of the Standing Orders, that honorable senators on both sides - and I do not accuse those on one side any more than those on the other - sometimes exceed their privileges in the asking of questions. The moment the curb is put upon that, and an attempt is made to bring honorable senators back within reasonable limits, they naturally feel some resentment, believing- that their rights are being curtailed, when nothing of the kind is attempted. </para>
        <para>I want to say that not only is my ruling on this occasion in accordance with the practice of the Senate, but it is in absolute accordance with the practice of the latest years of the House of Commons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted standing order 99, which reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In putting any such question, no argument or opinion shall bc offered, nor inference nor imputation made, nor any facts stated, except so far as may be necessary to explain such question; and the  President  may direct the  Clerk  to alter any question so as to conform with this order. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">A Minister in answering any question is subject to exactly the same limitations as the senator who asks it. There can be no doubt whatever that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> question transgresses standing order 99. </para>
        <para>The matter arose first of all by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> giving notice of his question. When my attention was directed to it. I decided that the use of the word &#34; savage &#34; represented the offering of an opinion, and an imputation against the officers who had passed the sentences referred to. It was a matter of common knowledge that certain sentences had been passed, and the use of the word &#34; savage &#34; in the honorable senator&#39;s question represented an imputation against those sentences and against the officers who passed them.. It offered an opinion upon them, and asked from the Minister an expression of opinion as to whether they were savage or not. It is not permissible, in asking a question, to offer an opinion, nor is it permissible to put a question asking for an opinion from a  Minister,  nor to put a hypothetical question. The use of the word &#34; savage &#34; in the honorable senator&#39;s question offered an opinion upon the sentences referred to. It was a comment on those sentences and an imputation on them. There can be no doubt whatever about that. </para>
        <para>My predecessors in office have frequently altered questions submitted by honorable senators. I have a long list of such occasions here, but I do not propose to read them all. I find that on the 26th November, 1908, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> complained that his question had been censored in such a fashion as to make it quite useless foi his purpose. The then <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Albert</inline> Gould, explained that the word &#34;misrepresentation,&#34; which appeared in the question as handed in, had been amended to read &#34; representation.&#34; The latter word conveyed no expression of opinion as to&#39; the character of an advertisement, but the word used by the honorable senator did, and, therefore, the alteration had been made. Honorable senators will find a reference to that case in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1908, at page 2247. That is absolutely in accordance with our Standing Orders j and in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> originally gave notice of his question, I directed the elimination of the word  &#34;savage,&#34; and he then intimated to me that he desired the question removed from the notice-paper. </para>

The Minister could convey no information as to whether the sentences were savage or not. At the most, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> could only offer an opinion on the subject, and the expression of opinions is not permissible in asking questions.

            <para>- I cannot prevent honorable senators from asking. questions, by way of interjection, nor do I endeavour to do so; but this authority has been exercised frequently in Parliament when, in the opinion of the Presiding Officer, undue licence was being exercised. These are the facts. I do not think any honorable senator can saythat my ruling has in any way curtailed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> rights. When I invited him to alter the form of this question, I told him then, and I told him again to-day, by way of interjection, that in a general discussion he would have a perfect right to use the word &#34; savage,&#34; or even a much stronger expression, in describing the sentences if he thought it was fit and proper to do so. T do not place any limit on the language1 he might be &#60; entitled to use in such circumstances. But he has no right to do that in asking a question, because our Standing Orders and the practice of Parliament forbid it. I think, therefore, that it is absurd for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to say that his rights have been limited.  His  rights still remain, and he knows quite well that ample opportunity will be afforded him to discuss these sentences and describe them in the strongest parliamentary language at his command. </para>

That is what I had in view. I hope honorable senators,, in coming to a decision, will not be under the impression that I had any other desire than to give full effect to the Standing Orders of the Senate for the good order and government of debate in this chamber, and more especially for She preservation of the liberties, of the minority. The majority may, if they so decide, suspend the whole of our Standing Orders.. Our Standing Orders are, however, essentially intendedfor the protection of the minority, and I have always endeavoured to interpret them in that way. I hope (honorable senators will carefully consider the position beforethey authorize any interferencewith the proper interpretation . of our Standing Orders. </para>

I have a very clear impression that when I spoke to you on the subject I declared that I would &#39;have my questionasked in my own way or not at all. </para>

            <para>- No, it is not. The  President  imputes motives to me, and Idesire to assert my right to ask questions inmy ownlanguage, or not ask them at all. Honorable senators may not see what I am driving at, but I know quite well what I mean. I might refer to the conversation which Ihad with the  President  at his table, and at his invitation. I was invited by the  President  to show how the question could be put on to the business-paper, . and my answer to the President&#39;s suggestion was that if it could not be put in my own way, I did not want it put on thebusinesspaper at all. It was suggestedthat if the word &#34; savage &#34; were struck out, the question would be permissible; but if the word &#34; savage &#34; or any other word had been struck out, I would have objected. I am not here as a school-boy, under the President&#39;s control. </para>

            <para>- I can see that honorable senators are not grasping the viewpoint I am endeavouring to put to them, probably because of my incapacity tomake my meaning clear.From the day that I dame -into this Senate I have always taken the stand that I would put. my questions in any own way, and I shall not allow the  President  to&#39; become my instructor as to how I shall ask questions.. If honorable senators cannot seethe difference, I can. I do not want to discussin detailwhat took place between the  President  and myself in our conversation. I can quite understand that twopersons may have a somewhat different impression as towhat actuallyhasbeen said, though each might give what he believed to be a correct report of the conversation. If a conversation is tobe used in this way, we shall be compelled infuture to . ask if use will . afterwards be made ofwhat may be said in such circumstances. I &#39;am sorry that I have been dragged into this . phase of discussion. I point out again that I made no statement in the question I submitted to the Minister. I desired only to obtain information. Officially, we have no knowledge as to whether these sentences are inflicted1 or not, whether they were&#34; savage or brutal, or whether they were sentences that should have been inflicted by civilized men living in a civilized community. In my official position I. asked the Minister if it was a fact that savage sentences had! been imposed on men who had given fouryears of service to their country. If the Minister had risen in his place, and said&#39; that such sentences had . not been inflicted,, or that the sentences were not savage or severe, there would have been no debatable matter for the Senate. If honorable senators vote to curtail my liberty, they will interfere also with their own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> put the question excellently. He said that, under the President&#39;s ruling, if an honorable senator inquired if an undue leniency had been shown in the imposition of certain sentences, that question, also, would have to be disallowed,, because it contained a statement of fact.. The  President  has himself shown howweak is his position, and he quotes, to justify himself, the view that Ministersneed not answer questions without notice. We know&#39; that Ministers can always refuse to answer questions, and ask for notice. Invariably they do so.But the  fact that a Minister need not answer a question does not take away from honorable senators the right to ask questions. As a matter of fact, questions that are quite within the Standing Orders, but which Ministers sometimes consider offensive, are treated with contempt, and are not answered. I am sorry that I did. not make myself as clear as I might have done, but in the House of Commons the question was asked if it was not a fact that a disloyal gathering was held at a certain spot in Ireland. Exception was taken to the statement &#34; disloyal,&#34; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ruled that the question could be asked. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is joking. Any one who has sat here so long with me surely cannot put such an interpretation upon my remarks. In the case which occurred in the House of Commons, and which I have quoted, there was an imputation against a large number of people contained in the question ; that is, if we are to take the ruling of the  President  and apply it to the question put in the Common&#39;s. It may be, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that, in the attitude which you have adopted, you are acting under fear of the Navy, and that you have had instructions from the naval authorities to prohibit the discussion of sentences imposed. It may be that the naval authorities object to such matters being debated in Parliament, for fear that such action may break down the discipline of  the Navy. I shall not discuss the question itself at this stage, but I fully intend to do so at the first opportunity afforded me; and that, I take it, will be on the adjournment of the Senate this evening. It may be that the Navy is interfering. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> know that parents and friends of our naval men in Sydney were endeavouring, a few weeks ago, to organize a club in that city. They had secured a room in the Educational Buildings for the purpose of holding a meeting. However, Commander Dumaresq saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> and the meeting was prohibited, because that naval officer said it was intended to discuss the sentences on the <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> Nothing had been further from .the minds of those people. They were not of the type who would discuss that subject. Their meeting was to organize the establishment of a  club-room,  .where our naval men in Sydney could meet. When one knows of things like that, one may well think that there is an attempt here to hush up what the Navy is doing. Although I am restricted during this present debate in the matter of. airing my own opinions upon the whole subject, I can, in open discussion, use just exactly what expressions I may deem fit regarding those sentences; and I will use them upon the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I emphasize that if my question is not in order, it will be scarcely possible for any honorable senator to ask any question which will be in order. I intend to take good care to ask you, sir, for a ruling upon every occasion which may arise. I have asked, &#34; Is it a fact that savage and severe sentences have been imposed ? &#34; It is &#39;for the Government to answer whether sentences of that nature have been passed. They can answer me definitely to the effect that no savage and severe sentences have been imposed. Indeed, they need not answer me at all. But for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to rule that I have no right to put my question in. the form in which I have set it out is the most astonishing ruling which has ever been given. I have quoted a case which arose in the British House of Commons, where exception was taken &#39;to the importation of the word &#34; disloyal &#34; into a question, on the ground that it was an imputation. The  Speaker  definitely ruled that the question was in order, and hepermitted it to be put. </para>

            <para>- The  President  can only rule me out of order when my question exceeds the Standing Orders; whereupon the deciding factor becomes the Senate itself. It will be a pity if a decision of such a character is influenced by party considerations. I sincerely trust that the vote to be taken will not be a party decision. Standing order 99 states -  </para>

        <para>What argument is applied in my use of the words &#34;is it a fact&#34;? It is merely asking the Government for information. I am not saying, &#34; Savage and severe sentences were inflicted, and will the Government do something in the matter?&#34; I am merely inquiring, &#34;Is it a fact?&#34; If the Minister considered that my question had been asked for a double purpose, he could have refused to answer it. It is now, however, for honorable senators to come to a decision, and I have a doubt whether or not a decision has been arrived at, by the &#34; Caucus &#34; of the party Opposite, to the effect that I am to be outvoted. I hope there are honorable senators opposite sufficiently broadminded to take the stand that our rights shall not be curtailed. </para>
        <para>You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have displayed what I may call unconscious bias against me. I do not want to personally comment on that, but I remember an occasionwhen I endeavoured to address the Senate upon a very important matter, and the whole procedure of the Senate was set aside by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in order to injure and coerce me. That was a procedure which for fifteen or sixteen years had held good, and yet, after all that time, it was set aside by the  President. </para>

            <para>- No. I am sorry that I have been driven to make such a statement, as the result of what the  President  then said, but I have facts regarding what has happened in the past, and I must reply to those inferences and imputations by the  President,  basing my comments upon facts as they exist. Upon one occasion, sir, you stated in this Chamber, in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> that you had not answered a communication from him because he had passed you with his nose in the air. My nose happens to be too short to get very high up, so I shall not be subject to treatment of that kind. But right at the bottom of all &#39; this business there is personal feeling, and the sooner we get away from it the better. Here is a standing order which gives honorable senators the right to ask questions so long as they are respectfully worded. I challenge the Government to point to anything of a disrespectful nature in my question. I leave the interpretation of that question, as I put it, to a public which has read with disgust and anger the sentences imposed upon the seamen on the <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline></para>

        <para class="block">In submitting this measure for the consideration of honorable senators I desire to intimate that there isno big principle involved in it. It draws, attention to one of the stages of development that, we have reached in connexion with our lighthouses. Under the Navigation Act, which will probably come into operation a little later, there is power to compel the masters of vessels to report any, injuries inflicted, upon lighthouses. But the most recent development for the protection of Australian shipping -around our coast - as, indeed, in other parts of the world - has taken the form of unattended lights. These lights are automatically operated with acetylene. They light up with the falling of darkness, and cease to burn at daylight. In the old days when caretakers were in charge of all lighthouses, there was somebody upon whom responsibility could be fixed for any damage which they might sustain. Under this Bill it. is proposed to compel any ship, or any person damaging any lighthouse &#39;or marine mark, to report the damage so done. In the case of a ship, she is required to report at her first port of call in Australia within twenty-four hours of her arrival there, whilst any person responsible for damage to any lighthouse or buoy is compelled, within forty-eight hours after its occurrence, to report to the Collector at the port nearest to the place where the damage was sustained: Most of these lights are located at distant parts of our coastline - along the Queensland coast and that of the Northern Territory, for example - many hundreds of miles from civilization. Unless the shipmaster, owner, or agent of any vessel which inflicts damage upon a lighthouse or marine mark is responsible for reporting that damage promptly, we may have a large portion of our coastline unlighted for some considerable time. </para>

            <para>- But the Bill should have been more explicit, both in regard to the penalty to be imposed for any damage done to our lighthouses and to the act of reporting such damage. I do not know whether we have the power to fine anymaster of a foreign ship who damages one of our marine, buoys. I do not intend to criticise the Bill  any  farther . than to say that I am perfectly in sympathy with it. At the same time, it doesnot go far enough, and it, is not searching enough to enable us to catch any person who may damage one of our lighthouses, and thus cause disaster to vessels trading along our coast. </para>

            <para>- If we impose this responsibility upon shipping agents, they will refuse to act in that capacity. An agent will not accept a responsibility which may amount to &#163;70,000 or &#163;100,000. Not many years ago a ship collided with the Wonga Shoal Lighthouse, near Adelaide, and did damage to the extent of &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000. But there was no chance whatever of recovering that money. Hence my objection to proposed new section 19a. Let us suppose that a ship is leaving Australia. Her first port of call in Australian waters may not be made for ten years afterwards, or, indeed, she may never return. </para>

            <para>- The responsibility should unquestionably be placed. Proposed new section 19a provides a penalty of &#163;100 in the case of a ship not reporting any damage done by her. But it is impossible for a. vessel to report if she is going out of Australian waters. Take for example a vessel voyaging to Auckland or Dunedin. It is impossible for her master to report to the Collector in Australia within forty-eight hours. </para>

            <para>- I think that we can. There is a way of overcoming the difficulty. But I shall leave it to the Crown Law authorities to. devise the means. No agent will accept responsibility for a ship if he is to be made personally re sponsible for any damage done by such vessel- . - desire to see the measure impose  responsibility.  upon the charterer of a ship. A man who charters a ship to take away a cargo of wheat may, before she leaves Australia, sell that wheat. Even if we laid hold of the vessel, he would say, &#34; She does not belong to me.&#34; All these wheat ships are chartered by the Commonwealth Government, who will under this Bill become responsible for all. damage inflicted by them upon lighthouses or buoys. The Government are the agents as well as the charterers of these vessels, and consequently will be responsible for the negligence of any of their masters. </para>

            <para>- In modern times it is found necessary to more effectively light our coasts, though they are not yet lighted as effectively as they might be. This involves a very large expenditure which the Commonwealth cannot at the present time very well afford. On the Tasmanian coast there are a number of unattended lights that are of very great importance. For instance, the light at Cape Wickham, on the northern part of King Island, is an unattended light. There was at one time a lighthouse at this place which cost the State of Tasmania a considerable amount of money. &#39; to maintain. When the lighthouses were  transferred to the Commonwealth, this was made an unattended light. I have to admit that it is not likely to be damaged by any passing ships, because it is on the mainland of King Island. . That, however, does not affect my argument. There are floating lights and buoy lights that are unattended. Some maintain their lights day and night, and others operate in such a way that the light shows from sunset to sunrise. If anything should happen to these lights the safety of human life and property might be seriously endangered. Under this Bill should any persons within our jurisdiction - and that is a limitation we are apt sometimes to forget - -be responsible for the disappearance of any of these lights, or damage to them, they are compelled to notify the matter. I think we might go further, and if a person knows that a light has been damaged or displaced- </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will agree that every navigator recognises the importance of making a report on such a matter. If a shipmaster has damaged a light, or knows that a lighthas been damaged through his own fault, or by the act of God, and it no longer operates, he will report the matter for the benefit of other navigators. I do not know that we shall be able to bring foreign ships under our jurisdiction in the matter, but certainly ships that are under our jurisdiction should be compelled to report such accidents to lights  as early as possible, whether the masters are responsible for the damage or- not. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GARDINER.</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;5.45 J. - I was waiting for some other honorable senators to discuss this Bill. For the life of me I am unable to understand why the measure was introduced. To propose a penalty upon a master of a ship for not reporting damage to a light is about on a par with saying to a member of the Senate, &#34; If you destroy one of the lights of this building which are established for our comfort and convenience, and do not report the matter to the  President,  you will be liable to a penalty of &#163;100.&#34; There is no one more interested in the maintenance of the lights dealt with in this Bill than are the masters of ships. It is. proposed to impose drastic penalties  upon them if they do not report any damage done to a light. A shipmaster may have his hands more than full in looking after his vessel in a storm,, and how is he to report the damage he may have done to a light, when he may not know that he has done any damage. </para>

Any person w,ho, or the master, owner, agents, and charterers of any ship which damages or destroys any lighthouse or marine mark shall be liable to pay the Commonwealth the cost of repairing, re- - placing, or reinstating the lighthouse or - marine mark. </para>

        <para class="block">If a vessel going out of the harbor bumps one of these lights, do honorable senators mean to tell me that some person who was not on board .the vessel, and could not in any way be held responsible for the damage, is to be liable under this Bill to pay the cost of repairing the damage? It would appear that some official carrying out duties under the Lighthouses Act has met with some little difficult-&#34;, and he proposes in this Bill that it shall be remedied by the imposition of extreme penalties for something that is very unlikely to be done. It is very unlikely that any master qf a ship will damage a lighthouse or marine mark without reporting it. Under the Bill the owner, or agents, or charterers may be responsible for damage caused by the master of the ship, or what may have been the result of pure accident. A storm may have driven a ship upon a marine mark, and if it is damaged persons who are not responsible for the damage in any way may be held to be liable, to make it good. Honorable senators must remember that a case will be decided upon the letter of the law, and the intention of Parliament in passing it will be set aside. The proposed new section I have quoted holds the people to whom I have referred responsible for damage done, no. matter  how it is done. I realize that the Government must have power to enforce the laws and protect Government property, but there is danger in hurriedly or carelessly passing unnecessary little Bills. If we interpret their language generously they may appear to be all right ; but cases are decided, not by what Parliament intended in passing a law, but by the language that Parliament used to give effect to its intention. It appears to me to be very loose draftsmanship to place upon the persons referred to in this Bill, the responsibility of repairing damage, even though it may have been caused accidentally. If the measure is passed in its present form, the owners of ships may find themselves called upon to pay sums of money which in equity and justice they should not be called upon to pay. </para>

I suppose that if the Bill is passed, where damage has been caused to a marine light a claim will be made by the Commonwealth Government against some person, and a Court of law will decide whether that person, the master, or the owner, or the agent of the vessel, is liable. . </para>

            <para>- If the proposed new section said that they shall pay, that would be mandatory; but it does not say so, -and persons must be found liable by the usual process of law before they are called .upon to pay. If the Court says they are not liable, they should not be called upon to pay for damage  done.  It is clear to me that somebody must ,be responsible. The importance of reporting cases of damage to lightships, lighthouses, lights, or beacons cannot be overestimated. Reports should be made at the first opportunity by&#39; the person responsible, and if .not by him, then by some other person. I cannot imagine any master of a vessel sailing his ship past a light that had been damaged, without reporting the matter. The Bill, I take it, provides that for the future more persons will be held responsible for damage done than has been the case in the past, and I see no reason why it should not be passed. The Bill will snare a few more guilty persons in the future, and that fact should justify its passage. </para>

        <para>Let us have it clearly understood that the Bill is double-barrelled in its purpose. In the first place, it provides that liability shall be on the ship for any damage done to lighthouses, lightships, beacons, or buoys, and in the second place&#34; itthrows on the individuals . concerned in the damage the responsibility of reporting such damage, otherwise they will be subject to certain penalties. As to the responsibility of the . ship to make good the damage, when I say ship I mean &#34;ship-owner,&#34; &#39; &#34;ship master,&#34; or &#34;agent,&#34; generally spoken of as &#34;the ship.&#34; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline>has said that he understands that the Bill is intended to bring in a few more than the present law makes liable. It seems to me that whatever the existing law may be, the Government have taken up the position that if a ship collides with a&#39; buoy or beacon, and damage is done, responsibility is on the ship, whether the damage is done maliciously, or. is the result of negligence, or want of skill. Who takes the responsibility now ? </para>

            <para>- No. Does the Government at present take the responsibility? Has the Consolidated Revenue or the ship-owner to bear the cost of damage done? If at present the Government accepts this responsibility, we can understand the reason for this measure, to relieve the &#39; Government of the risk, and impose it on the ship. If the ship takes the responsibility, where is the necessity for this Bill ? It is obvious that the Government is trying to extend the area of responsibility, and it is well, therefore, that we should legislate with our eyes open, because later on, when perhaps some damage has -been done to a particular beacon, lightship, or buoy, a shipping company will be called upon to make good the damage, and the company may force the captain to make good to it. We will then hear of a hard case, and it will be pointed out that, so far as Parliament expressed its intention, it decided that in all cases, whether the damage was the result of negligence, malice, or an accident, the ship must bear the cost. </para>

            <para>- That is the point. We ought to consider whether we are doing the right thing in passing the Bill as it stands. Some reason may be advanced why there should be an unqualified, obligation on the ship, and the Court, when deciding any case that may be brought before it, will say that if Parliament intended to put in any qualification to relieve the ship of liability, this qualification would have been expressed in the Act. </para>

        <para>With regard to the other part of the measure. I think it is very desirable indeed that if  anybody  does interfere with, or affect the value of any light or navigation mark, he should, at the earliest possible moment, be called upon to report; and, if he fails to do so, he should be penalized. Notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said concerning liability for damage done to lights in this building, I contend that the case is not in the, least degree parallel. Ocean marks, lighthouses, lightships, or buoys intended to insure the safety of navigation, must be treated very tenderly indeed by the whole community, because the slightest disarrangement of position or alteration in appearance may lead to grave disaster. Naturally, those who do go down to the sea in ships are very careful about them, and in 999 cases out of 1,000 a master or officer of a vessel noticing any damage to or alteration of any of these marks, enters the fact in the log, and notifies the first authority. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and the lives of others engaged in this perilous undertaking. It is true that, in Tasmania and elsewhere, there have been occasions when damage has been done to lights by hooligans, who, naturally, would not report  to the authorities, and it is very necessary, therefore, that legislation in this direction should be passed. While this part of the measure deserves commendation, I think the Minister has not yet made out a sufficiently strong case to warrant us in deliberately attaching liability without any qualification whatever to the- ship for damage done in every instance. </para>

          <para>. - There seems to be no difference of opinion as to the principle of the Bill, which is not regarded from a -party standpoint. The intention of the measure is to perfect the  machinery  for. giving effect to the intention .of Parliament. As the result of an evolution in appliances, automatic lightships and buoys are coming more largely into use, and it is the intention of the Government to make a rapid extension of their use, particularly in the northern and western parts of Australia. These buoys require no attendance, and experience has shown that where damage has been done in the past the only action which the Government could take was to issue a caution that it should not be done again. The principle of liability for damage is a sound one; but in view of what has been said during the course of the debate I should like to con-  sult further with the legal authorities. An attempt is being made to throw the onus of proof on the ship-owner or the agent, and it is possible that in the draftsmanship the position has not been clearly stated, so &#39; that in the event of damage being done the Court will be called upon merely to assess the extent of damage. That hardly expresses the intention of the Government. I am prepared to listen to any suggestion for the improvement of the Bill. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made one, which appeals to me, concerning the liability of the agent or charterer. It is possible that a vessel leaving Australia might damage a life-buoy at the last port of call and go away without notifying the fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the master of such a vessel should be required to send a definite message, by wireless presumably, at the first opportunity, is well worthy of consideration, but I amnot quite sure as to the power of the Commonwealth to enforce penalties against the agents or charterers of a vessel outside Australia, </para>

            <para>- It is hardly advisable to wait the return of a vessel before taking action. If the agent resides in Australia the Government would, of course, be able to exercise authority over him. It is not the desire of the Government to impose penalties on ship-owners who may have been responsible for damage, owing to unfortunate circumstances. I shall look into the various points raised and see if it is possible to comply with the suggestions made. If the Bill is taken through the second-reading stage I shall be prepared to consider all that has been said, and give sympathetic consideration to suggestions for its improvement. </para>

        <para>In view of the rapid development of wireless telephony in recent years, it is considered advisable, in the public interest, that the Government should exercise the same control over it as over wireless telegraphy. That is the object of this short Bill, which will widen the definition of &#34; wireless telegraphy &#34; so as to include . wireless telephony. The effect of the measure, will be that the Minister administering the Wireless Telegraphy Act will have the exclusive privilege of establishing stations for the transmission or receipt of messages by wireless telephony; but he may grant licences to other persons to establish such stations, on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit. No person in the Commonwealth will be permitted to establish any such station unless he has been granted a licence. Wireless telephony has not yet reached such a state of perfection that it is likely to supersede the ordinary telephone as a means of communication for use by the general public, but it has made rapid strides during the war, and as early as 1915 wireless telephone conversations took place between Washington and Paris. The difficulty which confronts inventors at present appears to be that of eliminating outside influences, and of insuring secrecy of conversation. These facts constitute additional reasons for placing this means of communication under the exclusive control of the Government. </para>

          <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para>It is a very short measure ; it deals with a subject upon which, I think, all honorable senators will agree. It proposes  to  give discretionary power to the Government to prevent the use of certain trade marks, and to protect such words  of  national significance as, for example, &#34; Anzac &#34; and &#34;Aussie.&#34; These words have been used, in some cases, by people who have had no right to employ them as they have done. There have also been certain letters used - such, for example, as &#34;A.N. A.&#34; These letters have been attached to various manufactured articles with the implied purpose of impressing the public that the goods have been made in Australia. Briefly, the letters have  been used to perpetrate a deception. This Bill is intended to protect the public. Further, there has been a practice among certain individuals, who have claimed to be the possessors of patent rights in specific productions, of threatening retail merchants that if they continue to handle those goods they will render themselves liable to prosecution. It is a case of pure bluff, and the parties putting up the bluff have no thought of carrying the matter to Court. Frequently, however, storekeepers have been scared, and have desisted from offering the goods for sale. This measure is not intended in any way to interfere with the rights of <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> patentees. </para>

              <para>- There is good reason for such a course. Certain articles branded &#34;A.N.A.&#34; have actually been made in the countries of our late enemies. The sympathies of the buying public have been fraudulently solicited. As for the names and terms made sacred by our soldiers, they should be kept apart altogether from trade usage and vulgar employment generally. </para>

            <para>.- I shall oppose the Bill. A measure which proposes to give power to the Government to declare any word prohibited from general use shall have no support from me. I do not like the term &#34; Anzac.&#34; It has robbed Australasia .of credit it is entitled to. It has taken from our people the credit which Australians won. It is quite a catchy little word, and aptly indicates the original Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. But it has gathered round it to-day a meaning altogether beyond that. The word has distinctly taken from the people of Australia that to which they are justly en titled, and has given credit where it does not belong. I have read magazine articles dealing with the origin of &#34; Anzac.&#34; It has been asserted that it has an Arabic source, and that it was the name of a bay or a peninsula in the neighbourhood of the scenes where the Australians and New Zealanders made it famous. </para>

They may be men whose limbs are buried at Gallipoli.

              <para>- A most excellent suggestion. I hope that the privilege will be accorded to those who gave a value to the name of Anzac - to the men who accomplished the impossible. No less an authority than the late Lord Kitchener said that only the sight of these men in the position which they had won would have convinced him that a landing could be successfully made under such circumstances. Consequently, I am not exaggerating when I say that these men accomplished the impossible. </para>

              <para>- I have been wondering whether the Acting Minister for Defence would consent to an adjournment of this debate, seeing that the Bill seeks to give effect to a principle which should not be allowed to pass without the closest scrutiny. Had I moved the adjournment of the debate before addressing myself to the measure, I understand firomthe Government Whip that the motion would have been agreed to. Does the Acting Minister for Defence desire the second reading of . the Bill to be passed to-night? The progress which is being made in another place certainly does not warrant the assumption that we are likely to be overburdened with work during the next- day or two. Under the Bill, I do not know whether persons seeking to trade with the initials A.I.F. may not find themselves prevented from so  doing by Ministerial proclamation. I  do  not think that the Acting Minister, when making his second-reading speech, had in mind what was . likely to be the effect of the measure. Personally, I have a rooted objection to endowing the Government with any . power without first knowing how they intend to use it. I should like an assurance from the honorable gentleman that it is not intended to use the powers which, will be conferred by this Bill in the same way as Ministers used the powers that were conferred under the War Precautions Act. Here I Should like to point out the vast difference between the granting of powers under a proclamation and the granting of powers under regulations. In the former case neither branch of the Legislature can exercise any&#39; control over the Government. All these points are worthy of consideration. </para>

              <para>- I object to the Governmentbeing able to do anything by means of a . proclamation. Will the Acting Minister agree that the things provided for in  this  Bill shall be done by  means of regulations ? We all know that any such regulations must be laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament within a certain &#39;time after Parliament reassembles, and that they may be disallowedby either branch of it. On the other hand, the Government may issue a proclamation whilst Parliament is in a recess extending over six months, and while half of the Ministers are&#39; absent from the country, of which they are the sworn guardians. If half of them may go away, the other half may follow their example. </para>

              <para>- I have no desire, sir, to ruffle you or to disagree with your ruling. I realize that if even an abler  President  were in the chair and ruled that I was out of order I should have to obey his ruling. But I ask you, sir, whether I shall be in order if I argue that when the best Government we have ever had in this country had certain powers conferred upon it under a measure somewhat similar to this, a number of people in this country complained that those powers were used in a way that was never intended, and a similar result may follow upon the exercise of powers under this Bill. I submit that these remarks are pertinent to the Bill. </para>

              <para>- I have no intention of doing that. I trust that I shall be permitted to connect my references with the Bill in the way I originally intended. My eulogy of a past Government was only in order to show that if the most&#39; perfect Government could exercise powers conferred in this way in a manner distasteful to the public, how much more careful should we be about conferring similar powers upon a Government which every one admits is very far from being perfect. That is a perfectly legitimate argument to use. When a perfect Government could fail in their administration in the exercise of powers without the consent of Parliament, how much more dangerous would it&#39; not be to confer such powers upon Governments that are universally admitted to be bad? I do not think that any one has a good word  to say for the National Governments, whether State or Federal. </para>

          <para>The case I have in mind is this. The Commonwealth had secured an important system of wireless telegraphy that did not in the slightest degree infringe any patents previously published. The Telefunken first took the matter up, but as they had no registered patents in this country they knew &#39;they could not carry it out, and they transferred the matter to. the Marconi Company. It might be as well to say here that the Telefunken Company, the Australian Wireless, and the Marconi Company are all one and the same, though they have&#39; shareholders of different names holding various interests. They threatened action against the Commonwealth for infringement of  their patents. The Commonwealth prepared to defend the action. As I have said, the Telefunken Company handed the matter over to the Marconi Company, and the case came. before the Courts eventually. The High Court decided that in such a case they were not in a position to give a decision as to whether an infringement had taken place unless they could be i shown that it &#39;had by expert evidence. The Fisher Government secured the best expert obtainable by bringing from &#39;Great Britain, at great expense, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> who is a very high authority on wireless telegraphy. He made a sworn declaration that he was thoroughly acquainted with the existing published patents of all the wireless companies, and that the Australian Commonwealth system, which was the invention of Father Shaw, was 33 per cent, a better system than any other then in existence, and was in no way an infringement of any existing patents. One can see at a glance the bluff that was put up by the Marconi and Telefunken people. They knew that their case would go by the board if that expert evidence came before the Court. They had not, however, lost their punch in bluffing, wheedling, and swindling Australia out of its money. An agreement was entered into by the Government thai displaced the Fisher Government in 1913. This Government was in office for less than twelve months, and after it wa&#187; beaten, at the poll, in 1914, it signed aa agreement giving the Marconi Company &#163;5,000, ostensibly for some patents they had in possession, and the case was not allowed to go beyond the stageit had reached. The Commonwealth, was- bluffed into that agreement. They got patents that expired in the following November. Possibly the Ministermay have had facts like this in his. mind&#39; when he sought to protect people frombeing bluffed. I hope he did, becausewhat I refer to is one of the landmarks of  swindling by . big companies ; possibly it has never been excelled in Australia. If that was in the mind of theGovernment, I welcome the Bill, but it isin the nature of a death-bed repentancefor all the ill deeds that they have been, responsible for. It is evidently an attempt on the part of the Government to* enable private companies, firms, or persons to obtain legal redress for anythreatened action. I draw attention,, however, to the proviso which states - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Provided that this section shall not apply if the person making the threats, with due diligence, commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of his trade mark. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that proviso should be struck- out,, because it gives one the impression that,, although the Government determined todo something to protect the people, theyrelented, and have half slammed the dooragainst the remedy in cases of groundless threats by enabling the persons who makesuch threats to escape if &#34; with due diligence &#34; they commence and prosecute arn action.

          <para class="block">It may be necessary for the Government to amend some of our existing legislation which has been so Satisfactory for so long, and wake up to the fact that the Royal Arms of England are not to be used for trading purposes. I do not know whether my memory serves me aright, but I think I can remember seeing the Royal Arms of England on a whisky advertisement, and I am quite sure that the Royal Arms of Scotland - the lion rampant - has been seen on such advertisements for many a long day. It appears, however, that the Government have decided that it is to be an offence to use these emblems of Royal authority for trade purposes, and by proclamation people doing so are to be brought within the law. I should like some definition of the words &#34; some member of the Royal Family.&#34; Will it be  His  Majesty the King,  Her  Majesty the Queen, one of the Princes, one of the Princesses, or some other relation ? Will it . be the uncle of  His  Majesty King George - the Imperial Kaiser - grandson of . our late very respected Queen Victoria? If the Kaiser has become skilful at. the occupation he is supposed now to be employed at - wood cutting - I can imagine how pleased <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would probably be if he were transported to Western Australia to con tinue his occupation there, and company promoters might thus have authority to emblazon the Royal Arms on the company&#39;s note-paper. I ask the Minister to give a definition of what constitutes &#34; some member of the Royal Family.&#34; This is a serious question. It is really time that, in this free Commonwealth, we got away from worn and threadbare statements that mean nothing. We should come down to the plain business reading of our- laws, and I contend that &#34; some member of the Royal Family,&#34; in its application to this Bill, is not plain business reading. The proper authority to . give or withhold the right to use the coats-of-arms is the Government of the country, and we would be wise in our day nd generation if we made that simple fact plain in all our legislation. I give second place to no one in my respect for those in authority. I never, by innuendo or insinuation, reflect upon authority, because I recognise that in every form of society the Government that is, is right. Every sensible man will . recognise that authority must restsomewhere, and in this Commonwealth, by virtue of our Constitution, authority rests in the sovereign people. If the sovereign people are satisfied to conduct their business under laws and a Constitution, assented to by the Royal House of Britain, well and good. But authority to use certain emblems and trade marks should be exercised by the Government of the country. The only authority vested with the power to permit the use, or compel the disuse, of the Royal Coat-of-Arms within the Commonwealth is the Commonwealth Government. What if the Government were to say, &#34; We shall refuse the use of the Royal Arms to such and such a firm,&#34; and what if that firm produced an authority from some member of the Royal Family to make use of the Royal Arms? A very complicated situation would arise. There might be a big brewing interest which had among its shareholders some member of the Royal Family. That company might be trading under the Royal Coat-of-Arms. The position would be a nice one ; but there is only one . authority having the supreme control,  and that is the Government of the Commonwealth. No one to-day questions the right of the people to govern themselves. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is referring, no doubt&#39;, to the situation in Ireland. Despite the unsuccessful efforts of the Irish people to secure self-government, the right of the people to govern themselves is unquestionable. The people are the only rightful authority for the making of their laws and the governing of themselves. It is only unnecessary padding to insert in this measure that any member of the Royal Family may exercise authority co-equal with the Government of Australia. .No one has co-equal authority. The people of Australia, through their Government, are the sovereign power. They are the final Court of Appeal. </para>

              <para>- In Australia, with its 5,000,000 people and its seven Governments, there should be only one constituted governmental authority ; that is, the Commonwealth Government. But while the States exist we must recognise that, .within their sphere, they have the power of government. If the Commonwealth authorities have the power to deal with trade marks we can well afford to delete from this measure all reference to the authority of the State. On several grave occasions recently we have witnessed conflicts between State and Commonwealth authority. The New South Wales Government violently repudiated the authority of the Commonwealth Government in connexion with a menace which has proved one of the most terrible in the history of Australia. Ministers of that State went out of their way to flout the Commonwealth Government, for what reason I do not know. Honorable senators will recall the famous, or infamous, case of a New South Wales Premier - now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers - seizing the property of the Commonwealth Government by force; I refer to the wirenetting incident. We have to pay tribute to the tactfulness of those who were charged with the protection of that com modity, and who knew that it was not worth while to resist force with force, but were content to leave it as a matter of law between the State and Commonwealth authorities, ls the language of this Bill so clear that a Court could give a definite decision asserting the supreme authority as between State and Commonwealth? It may be argued that in all our legislation wherein conflict between State and Commonwealth could arise, the power of the latter is supreme. Nevertheless, this Bill contains a clause wherein the Commonwealth Government propose to confer equal powers on a State authority. When a State can come into conflict with the Commonwealth over such a deadly subject as the influenza epidemic, it does not require much effort of imagination to anticipate trouble in connexion with a comparatively, trivial matter, such as trade marks. </para>

          <para>Study of the Bill reveals that, not only are the proposed powers to be given to a State &#39;Government, but actually to a State Department. I can imagine a wheat company being formed under the authority of &#39;a State&#39; Department, which grants the use of the Royal or Australian CoatofArms. In justification of such action that Department would be able to point to the constitutional rights conferred upon it under this Commonwealth measure. On my reading of the Bill, the Department of Agriculture would be able to permit a company which was trading in wheat to use the Australian Coat of Arms. </para>

It appears to me that instead of endeavouring to make these provisions perfectly clear, somebody has been struggling to get in a number of sentences which would sound well. I never remember a Bill which contained two such clumsy clauses. </para>

              <para>- As there is no  Deputy President  to-night, I think I shall have the time of my life. The penalty which the Bill seeks to impose for any infringement of clause 4 is one of &#163;20. That is about the only definite thing in the measure. Honorable senators may imagine how shocked I am to learn that&#39; a Wheat Pool, a farmers&#39; exploiting company, or a farmers&#39; trading company may use the Commonwealth coat-of-arms or the Royal coat-of-arms, and that the only penalty for so degrading these devices will be a fine of &#163;20. Think of Watson&#39;s whisky with the Royal Arms of England printed on the label attached to the bottle! I think that the Royal Arms of England are actually shown on the label of King George whisky.

              <para>--That interjection opens up quite a vista in regard to what may happen under this Bill. If there is to be a penalty imposed for using the Royal Arms of England, why should there not be a penalty prescribed for using the Royal Arms of Scotland? Will the Acting Minister for Defence accept an amendment in the direction of prescribing a penalty for using the recognised  arms of Scotland and Wales? I am told that Australia had no seal&#39; which could be attached to the Peace Treaty which was recently signed by the Prime Minister on her behalf, and that, as a result, the seal of &#34;Wales was used. Personally, I think that even if it had to be torn from a sheet of note-paper, the coatofarms of Australia should have been affixed to that Treaty. But probably the unauthorized use of it would have been dangerous, and the Prime Minister might conceivably have been called upon to pay a fine of &#163;20. Anyhow, he attached to the historic document the seal of the country to which he belongs. Clause 5 of the Bill contains a long and difficult definition of what the Governor-General may  do, and in this connexion&#39; I would again appeal to honorable senators to realize the difference that exists between doing things by proclamation and doing them by regulation. I venture &#34;to say that the people of Australia are &#39; not in favour of giving powers to the GovernorGeneral in Council. They are not prepared to vest in the Executive, powers which they are unable to control except through the medium of a censure motion in Parliament. Take the word &#34; Anzac &#34; by way of illustration. Let us suppose that some person who desires to make that word bigger than it is attempts to add to it the letter &#34; C,&#34; so as to embrace the Canadian Forces, which fought so admirably, thus converting the word into &#34; Canzac.&#39; The Government propose to prevent words like these from being used by trading companies. The word &#34; Anzac &#34; is. too sacred. Taking the broader view, I, as the head of a company, propose to include Canada, and make the word &#34; Cart.zac.&#34; If I do so, a charge may be laid against me for, using the word without authority, and with the intention to deceive, and I may be liable to a penalty of &#163;20. What is a penalty of &#163;20 to a big trading company? </para>

          <para>Before honorable members settle down at .the beginning of a session, we find these fool, measures presented. I use the term advisedly.  What  is the use of trying by legislation &#62;to say that certain words are of such importance that the* Government should issue a proclamations preventing their use? If we desire to&#187; keep the words in use, we should permit the people to use them everywhere. That will not degrade them, but will elevatethem. Their general use will make them part of our everyday life. Events now move so rapidly that the word &#34; Anzac.&#34;&#39; which is in every one&#39;s mouth to-day, willin two or three&#39; years&#39; time be almost a. forgotten word. </para>

              <para>- I do. I donot think that it will ever be forgotten, generally. I think it will be a wordwhich will be uttered on occasions, and always with pride and pleasure. But if the Government adopt this stupid method&#39; of prohibiting its use, it will tend to its being forgotten. No man has a greater admiration than I have for the men whocreated the name of &#34; Anzac.&#34; . I say that sincerely; but I say also that thousands of men, who never got the advertisement which the Anzacs received,, fought on the battle-fields of France with, a gallantry which equalled, if it did not surpass, that- of the Anzacs. It may bethat, history will one day do justice to&#62; the men who fought on those other fieldsThe name of &#34;Anzac&#34; was won by themen who fought at Gallipoli, and will stick in the memory; but at Pozieres, Messines, Bullecourt. and a number of other places in France, men who werenever at Gallipoli fought with as much, bravery, and showed as much Australian-, initiative and skill as was shown at Gallipoli. The word &#34; Anzac &#34; is to-day applied loosely to men who went -to France,, and who never saw Gallipoli. </para>

              <para>- I was going to repeat the ruling which you have so &#34;frequently given that one is not permitted to go back over arguments he has &#39;already used. I am trying to get the Bill before honorable senators, and when I do so I shall be able to refer to its general  principles  without tedious repetition. When honorable senators talk of tedious repetition, let me remind them that the word &#34; mark &#34; is repeated in one of these clauses about eighteen times. I find these words in clause 2 - or any word or mark so nearly resembling any  such  word or mark- </para>

          <para>I shall now have a word to say on the general principles of the Bill. It is intended that this measure shall amend the Trade Marks Act 1905-12. I want to see how these amending clauses fit in with the sections of the existing Act. Before the second reading of the Bill passes, I intend to move an amendment giving an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to make amendments in other sections of the existing Act. I am afraid that if I do not submit such an amendment at this stage, I may be prevented, when the Bill is in Committee, from submitting amendments of other sections on the. ground that they would be outside the scope of the Bill as passed on the second reading. The instruction to the Committee to permit amendments of other sections must be moved on the second reading. </para>

              <para>- I do not want to delay the Senate, but I think those honorable senators who have been listening to my remarks on the various clauses of the Bill will realize the seriousness of the position as regards the power to be conferred upon the Government by means of proclamations. This measure was introduced late in the afternoon, after two other Bills had been passed, and the Minister is not warranted in persisting with it. The fact that a Bill has been introduced in this Senate warrants honorable senators in demanding its full consideration. It should not be rushed through in a single day. I do not mind the progress of the measures that have gone through, but apparently the Government resent my speaking on the  third Bill, and what has happened this afternoon will make me all the more careful for the future. I have shown that each of the three amendments in the Bill are most important. The Government are preparing for legislation by proclamation, and under this measure we have not had the faintest idea, from the Minister&#39;s speech, as to what form the proclamation will take. It may embody the most fantastic idea of an absurd and fantastic Government, but&#39; if it does, it will only bring greater discredit on an already discredited Government. It is the duty of the Minister, in the course of his reply to inform the Senate and the country in what direction the Government propose to use these enormous powers which are to be given to the Governor- General. Probably if I speak much longer the length of my remarks and the lateness of the hour will be the excuse for a non-compliance with my request, and as I am anxious to get full information I shall not delay the Senate longer. If this power is conferred upon the Governor-General there may be no limit to its use. Some fad, some sudden impulse, some expression of public opinion, or strong feeling running through the community will one day impel some brilliant genius of this or some other Government to use the powers sought for in this measure, and perhaps prevent the use of certain trade marks. All the forces at the command of the Commonwealth will be brought to bear to enforce the proclamation. </para>

          <para>Under  this measure, have to apply to the Commonwealth Government for the right to employ those words, and the responsible Minister might say, &#34; Our leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> invented  that  phrase. You cannot use it. He is going to make things cheap  by  making them dear through a  high  protective duty. Therefore, we shall prevent you from using  the  words.&#34; High protective duties and carrying on the war after peace has been signed will become the trade mark of this Government at a not very distant date, and if&#39; any one not in the counsels ofthe Government attempts to use those words a proclamaion will no doubt be issued, signed by the Acting Minister for Defence, or the &#39;Governor-General, or some equally exalted personage - perhaps a member of the Royal Family. That being so, I am reluctant to vote for the second reading of the Bill. If I had been allowed the opportunity which should have been afforded me, I could have suggested other amendments to prevent some of the injury that will be. caused by certain clauses of the Bill now under discussion.

          <para class="block">Australia and be sentenced to two years&#39; imprisonment for daring to wait on their Commanding Officer in the form of&#39; a deputation. For that is all they were guilty of. After the deputation, other things may have occurred. Events in these present days are so grave that the Government would do well to mark the celebration of Peace by. the restoration of those sailors to the status they enjoyed before that unhappy day at  Fremantle.  It may be said, of course, that discipline has to be maintained. Discipline never will be maintained among our Australian sailors and soldiers if it is to be upheld by the stupidity of British officers. The one offence of these sailors was that they Wared to wait on their officers. If they are kept in gaol while the people of Australia are celebrating Peace, an injustice will have been&#39; inflicted which will never be forgotten or forgiven. I recall the case of the soldiers on board the transport <inline font-style="italic">Argyllshire.</inline> It will be remembered that about 1,100 of them were landed under authority at a quarantine station in New .South Wales. There they were marched into an unsuitable camp. Snakes and vermin, crawled all over the place. Exercising their sound common sense, these Australian fighting, men, in defiance of their officers, marched <inline font-style="italic">en masse</inline> out of that camp. It may be said that for that slight infringement&#39; of discipline those troops should have  been punished. That would have been the British method of enforcing discipline. But such, conduct would have spelt disaster if it had &#39;been tried upon those Australian boys. The Government were fortunate in having in New South Wales a Commanding Officer of such sound sense and judgment as General Lee. When he heard that the men had disobeyed orders - had mutinied, if honorable senators like to put it that way - and had taken the boat on to Sydney, did he aTrest and court martial them ? . He did nothing so stupid or dangerous.* He met them, and had a talk with them, and then, he marched them to the Sydney  Cricket  Ground. There was no disorder. They were kept under control and away from contact with the people of the city. </para>
          <para class="block">Thus a disaster was averted. Of course, the ringleaders could have been brought up and punished, but General Lee might have said that they were all ringleaders; and, for such an offence against discipline, the Sydney gaols might have been  packed with a thousand prisoners from the <inline font-style="italic">Argyllshire.</inline> The good judgment of an Australian officer prevented such a situation. </para>
          <para>It should be remembered that the men on board the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> had been under keen active service conditions for four years in the North Sea. Then there came one day of glorious liberty at Fremantle, where the people, in welcoming them home, possibly overdid their hospitality. It was inevitable that the men who had enjoyed such a kindly reunion with Australia should desire an opportunity to return the hospitality. </para>

              <para>- I am assuming that that is what the Minister will say. I emphasize that no breach of discipline occurred which&#39; was so serious as to warrant the imprisonment for two years of a man who had won signal honours in the heroic exploit at Zeebrugge. There is noword strong enough to express my condemnation of such sentences. The <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> came into Sydney Harbor, and the mothers of those lads went down to meet them. The prisoners were marched off in irons under the women&#39;s eyes. One woman dropped to the ground, and so great was the shock that her life was . despaired of for days. That was an outcome of the brutality of those officers - an act worthy of the fiercest term that could be employed. </para>

          <para>There is scarcely, a camp in Britain or Prance where discipline has not been broken and orders disobeyed by Australian soldiers who were dissatisfied with existing conditions. Large &#39; numbers of our men were carried away by the impulse of the moment. But it should not be forgotten that impulses such as those which sent many of our lads to gaol were identical with the imputes which won Australia fame. I hope that the good sense of the Government will lead them to regard the sentences upon the seamen in the same light as does the whole of Australia. There is discontent, and, indeed,, a feeling of degradation over those sentences. The Minister, no doubt, will claim that the whole matter is beyond the control and authority of the Government. We handed our warships over to the Imperial authorities to assist in the protection of the whole Empire. We placed our own sailor boys under the control of Imperial officers; and if the latter can provide no better reward for those lads after their services have been&#39; completed and the war is over, then our blood will continue to boil&#39; with indignation until redress is granted. I hope the Peace celebrations will not occur if those men. are to remain in .gaol. What would have been rejoicing on my part will be sorrow, so long as I know that the parents of those lads are sitting sadly in their homes instead of participating in the general joy. If the Government continue to carry out a barbarous sentence, they will be parties to an exhibition of vindictiveness and savagery such as one would expect only from an uncivilised nation. The situation would have been different had those mcn been going into action instead of returning home at the conclusion of the war. No doubt, the sentences arc right and just from the viewpoint of the British naval authorities. It may be an affront to an officer to be compelled to even speak to an ordinary fighting seaman. </para>
