            <para>That the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia . expresses&#39; its sorrow at&#39; the loss which has befallen the British Empire in general, and the Union of South Africa in particular; by the death of the &#39;Right Honorable the Prime Minister . of : the iTJnion, &#39;General Louie Botha, patriot, soldier, statesman, and empirer-builder, nnd extends its sympathy to the people of the sister Dominion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block"> In submitting this motion for, I . am. sure, the unanimous &#39; yet regretful acceptance of the Senate, I ask leave to make a few remarks regarding the gentleman who is the subject ofit. It is no exaggeration to say that General . Botha secured for himself a place in the ranks of those whom the world holds as its great -men.  His  career has been a remarkable one. The British Empire first knew him as its enemy, and later as its friend and loyal citizen. He compelled its &#39;admiration in whatever position helield. As our enemy we learned to respect him, -and as our friend and our fellow citizen we learned to regard with esteem -everything that he has &#39;done. </para>
          <para>I should like to make special reference to the. great efforts which he -put &#39;forth after &#39;the &#39;merging of South &#39;Africa in the Empire, not only -&#39;to bring about unity among the discordant -factions in &#39;that country, &#39;but also to Tnake-that-portion of Africa a &#39;loyal &#39;integral portion of the &#39;&#39;Empire &#39;itself. From the moment that General &#34;Botha accepted citizenship under &#34;the Imperial &#39;flag onwards he has been -as loyal -a citizen as ever walked or/served under it. Under great stress, and in the face . of ..great &#39;temptations and -many complicafced difficulties, Ifchere was . never for a imoment a -sino-le  treason  to . suspect &#39;that the loyalty&#39; -he manifested was notisincere tand deep. </para>
          <para>Passing from that aspect of the &#34;case, may I anake a reference Ito his jmilitary (achievements, &#39;which -were *of mo -mean  order? &#39; When the . recent war rbroke out, in 1914, if there was any . portion of the world in which Germany hoped, more . confidently than elsewhtere that the flag of rebellion would &#34;be raisecl, it was South Africa. It is true that -a flag was raised there when General Botha . raised the British flag to take the place of the German flag which, as a result of his successful operations, was &#39;hauled &#39;down in what had been German territory. That military undertaking marked -.General T3otha as a man of high . military qua^fications ; as is  admitted by those who are competent to speak as to his achievements on that occasion. But what -he -did there was in no -sense more valuable or more difficult than that which he did when he visited Europe, and as amember of the Peace Conference showed himself to be as broad minded and as capable of taking a strong stand in the field of statesman-&#39; ship as he had on the field of battle. </para>
          <para>General Botha&#39;s services to the . Empire may, perhaps, be . expressed in . a phrase by saying that in a. time of crisis he became a great stabilizing influence in. the &#34;Empire. We in Australia claim it a special privilege to unite with his fellow citizens of South Africa in placing upon record our sense . of loss, and our . great appreciation of his &#39;.life&#39;s service. </para>
          <para>Ihave no . doubt &#34;that before long:monu- ments will ibe erected to his . memory, but  nothing ithat sculptors or painters-may do will ; erect -a monument so . lasting and jidble as that -Which lhe : has : establishfid -by his  town  life!s work. </para>

            <para>.- It as with -great . -regret that  T  &#34;rise to second &#39;the -motion of the Leader of &#39;.the &#34;Senate.  On  behalf of . honorable senators on this side, I  say.that we regret very much to . hear , of  the. death &#39;of this, distinguished . soldier -and statesman. He was a relentless foe when, opposed to us, but always chivalrous to : those whom he was . fighting. When he felt called . upon . recently, in defence of the ^British &#39;Empire, to turn. against those who had &#39;been associated with &#39;him in ithe &#34;Boer Army - df which he had &#39;had command - he pursued them just as relentlessly as he &#39;.had pursued the British when opposed . to . them. He -was a man who  struck always for the . right,, and . never for  might. </para>

          <para>We resrret that, after his experiences lin thesgreat war:that has just ended. -and after going&#39; . through the . preat battles  of  the . Peace Conference, and fighting for  the interests of his Dominion, the . great scythe bearer bore down upon him. almost immediately after . he got . back to his home in his beloved country. Death waits for no . man and seeks no man. but eventually we all fall into his net. We regret the death . -of General Botha. We are sorry . that &#39;he has gone, &#39;but &#62;we -prize the opportunity to -offer this expression of sympathy to&#39; those he has left behind. </para>

          <para>. - Regulation 13a sets out that in certain circumstances an offence is committed and I wish to be quite clear on a matter that at present is somewhat indefinite. Yesterday I moved an amendment in connexion with the possibility of the imposition of a penalty of six months&#39; imprisonment under certain circumstances. That is the penalty provided in the Bill from beginning to end. I was informed by the Minister that the penalty is not a new one, and that it has been in operation during the whole time the regulations have been in force. I must confess that I have not been able to see eye to eye with the Minister, and I would like further information as to . whether his statement is correct or not. </para>

If it should benecessary to confine the operations of the officers of the Wool Board to &#39;the work of appraising, and not to allow them towrite to any newspaper, I strongly object to the  Chairman  of the Wool Committee being the sole adjudicator in such cases. The  chairman  is set up as a &#34; Poo-Bah &#34; and a &#34;king,&#34; and is above the Government, &#39;the Minister, and Parliament. Members of this Parliament, who are representatives of the people, have endeavoured to see correspondence of the Wool Board, but this &#34;king&#34; who is  chairman  of the Wool Committee says that it is not to be available to members, and even the Minister falls on his knees before him. I am not saying that &#39;the  Chairman  of theWool Committee has not done good work, but he should not have such arbitrary power. I  am  in favour of the whole regulation being left out. I intended amending re gulation 18a by striking out &#34;the  Chairman  of the Central Wool Committee,&#34; with a view to inserting &#34;the Minister.&#34; The regulation would then read - </para>

Whenthe Chairmanof the WoolCommittee refuses to allow honorable members of this Parliament to peruse correspondence whichis of vital interest to the country, he is exceeding his powers and placing the administration of the Governmentin a farcical position. </para>

          <para>. - I thought the meaning was obvious. Honorable senators must,. of course, know that persons handling a very large amount of property under the various Pools- obtain possession of a considerable amount of . confidential information, and it is reasonable to ex,pect that they shall preserve secrecy with respect to these transactions. In connexion with price fixing and other Commonwealth Departments, we have found it absolutely necessary to extend reasonable protection to people who have furnished information. If we had not given this bond of secrecy much of the information would not have been made available to us, because we were dealing with a very touchy business. The same may be said of the regulation now under notice. In the early days&#39; most of the newspapers had wool appraisers acting as correspondents. Under this scheme some of those were taken over, and it is only right that they should be required not to publish information which comes into their possession as Commonwealth wool appraisers. Upto the present there has been no abuse of the power conferred upon the  Chairman  of the Wool Board by virtue of this regulation: </para>

            <para>- It may be, but the&#39; same principle is observed in the Price Fixing Department. Men give evidence on oath, and those hearing the evidence- are undera pledge not to divulge information thus given. This is necessary in1 order to safeguard competitors in business. In connexion with shipping matters, I have seen rivals in business sitting round a table at a conference to deal with difficult problems that were confronting the Commonwealth, andthey were most reluctant to give away any information which might be of value to their rivals. But frequently after such conferences I have been given valuable information in confidence. </para>

          <para>.- A pretty little storm in a tea-cup is raging. In the past, appraisers employed by various wool companies have been in the habit of supplying the press with the firm&#39;s lists of sales and prices. The newspapers do not specially employ men to attend wool sales, and to call at the various wool houses, for these particulars. The commercial editor attached to each big newspaper receives reports direct from wool-classers or appraisers attached to private companies. Those same woolclassers and appraisers are now placed under certain restrictions. They have become official appraisers. They may not now provide the commercial columns of newspapers with trade particulars unless by consent of the  chairman  of the Wool Committee. My son is an appraiser under the wool scheme. He had been in the habit of supplying the commercial editors of the big newspapers with information concerning wool sales and prices. No hardship is involved in the present restriction. There is no censorship, and no one is interfered with. It is simplv a safeguard - a matter of control. The con trol is quite unnecessary, in my view ; but there is no friction. Therefore, why all this fuss ? </para>

          <para>. - I believe in a shoemaker sticking to his last. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has had some experience in country newspaper offices . He is well aware that country correspondents for the big newspapers are generally local clergymen, or agents, or storekeepers, or civil servants. The perquisites attached to country correspondence on behalf of the metropolitan press should surely belong to men engaged in the journalist&#39;s profession in rural centres. I do not think a wool appraiser should be permitted to act as correspondent to the press in relation to his business. </para>

          <para>. -  Centralization has not been due to the dictates of the Director of Raw Materials. The extract which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has quoted is only an expression of opinion. The view of the Director of Raw Materials is not binding. When the scheme was inaugurated, the Government were not sure whether the Wool Pool would continue for one year, or would extend for two or three years. There was nothing to justify the Government in launching upon huge commitments in expectation of a protracted war. It was decided, therefore, to utilize, as far as possible, those districts and ports and wool stores which were already concerned in the wool industry. Not since the days of modern wool-handling have there been any facili-ties for dealing with wool at Newcastle. Had it been realized that the Wool Pool was to extend its operations over so long a period, I, personally, would have, advocated the opening up of all the principal ports around Australia&#39;s coast, in relation to the activities of the Committee. It would have been bordering upon madness had the Committee, in view of its restricted existence, set out to extend its operations in places where private enterprise had never been previously engaged. If the Wool Pool were to be permanently established, I should  be- in favour of building wool stores at many of the remoter ports, particularly in the north of Queensland, and at such places as Wyndham and Geraldton, in the northwest of Western Australia, which are the natural outlets for the produce of wool districts. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that wool was not exported from Newcastle before the wai-. Wool sent direct from the station to the ship was exported, but wool was not stored at Newcastle -fox the purpose pf appraisement and sale and subsequent shipment from that port. No one is more anxious than I am to develop the outer ports of Australia. I have always been strongly opposed to the centralization of all trade in the State capitals. In my view, that is not the best national policy to pursue. The point&#39; is that for a two-years&#39; Pool no one could justify the expenditure of &#163;10,000 or- &#163;20,000 upon stores for the appraisement of wool at Newcastle. Private persons dealing with wool did not make use of facilities at Newcastle im that way before the war, and would not be likely to make use of them if they were provided now, unless there were some development of the trade and conditions which did hot exist before the war. If the Wool Pool did not. continue, and stores for -the appraisement &#39;of wool were erected, as proposed, we should later  on  have some . honorable senators charging the Government with extravagance. In view of all the circumstances, it would be extravagant and unbusiness like at the present time to erect such stores at Newcastle.

The Northern Railway is gradually being extended closer to the borders&#39; of the Northern Territory, and, as a result, it is reasonable- to assume that the breeding of cattle, except in the immediate Gulf country, will be replaced by the grazing of sheep in the north-west of Queensland, and even over the border into the Northern Territory. All the wool grown in this vast district must go to Townsville for shipment. That is a development of the Queensland trade in wool which should be borne in mind by those in authority. The fact that the Central Wool Committee does not deem it advisable to alter the present arrangements should not be allowed to influence the decision of the Government with regard to the future. </para>
          <para>The shipment of wool from Townsville to Brisbane for appraisement involves- considerable additional expense and extra handling. <inline font-style="italic">Thr&#62;</inline> wool has to be run from the railway trucks in- Towntvillo into the stores, and from there to the shipls side-, and on arrival; in Brisbane has to be landed,, transferred again to stores for appraisement; and then re-shipped. That kind of. centralization has been, the curse, of Australian development,, and. if the Government desire to promote decentralization my amendment - affords them an op^ portunity to do so.. They should not encourage the diversion of trade from, other, parts of Queensland to Brisbane when the work can be done as well, and- much, more cheaply,, in other cities of that State. In  view  of the&#39; very extensive coastline of Queensland &#39;and the ports available, such centralization in Brisbane cannot be defended. I trust that the representations that have been made will be passed on for. consideration . by the responsible authorities when any re-arrangement of these matters is under consideration. </para>

              <para>- I do. not think so, and that is the weak, point in- the hon-i orable &#39; senator&#39;s argument. There would be &#39;great trouble in inducing these men to take such a. long trip as would be neces? sary if they were called upon to appraise wool at Rockhampton or Townsville. There is only a limited number- of men engaged in &#39; this work, and they have a very great deal of work to do at the present time. They are the old buyers who used to . buy wool on commission, or for themselves as ; a speculation, and they have taken on this work . of appraisement until the open sales of wool are resumed. In view of the fact that the Pool will continue for only about eleven months more, it would be inadvisable to make any change at the present time. I -agree that if the Wool Pool were to- be continued as a permanent institution, it would be wise to have wool appraised in places like Rockhampton and Townsville: </para>

              <para>- There are many difficulties in the way. If the Pool were to continue for a long period some rearrangement would certainly be advisable. I am rather in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> amendment, but at present I am not prepared to support it. It would be the means of decentralizing the wool business of Queensland if appraising were done at various ports; but for private sales it would be difficult to bring about, because buyers like to have the wool brought to them. They have the key of the position in their own hands. </para>

              <para>- New Zealand had a similar  experience  when they held sales at various coastal centres, as the buyers would not visit the outlying ports, or when they did, the wool offered did not bring the same price  as  in the main centres. Every fresh market tends to reduce the price.

              <para>- Whatever was the cause, the actual effect was that the growers received less when their product was sold at outlying ports. From that point of view, it is worth considering whether we are justified in altering an arrangement which has only eleven months to run, and which cannot be carried on indefinitely, because the British Government will not continue to purchase in the way the growers desire. The task is too great for the British Government, because they find it difficult to handle our wool in conjunction with enormous shipments coming from other parts of the world. If the arrangement we are making was to cover a very long period, I would support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> but as it is for only eleven months, I do not think it worth while. </para>

            <para>.- There is really nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> suggestion that wool should be shipped from Townsville or Rockhampton, but there appears to be some misunderstanding. The official appraisers who represent the European firms are only limited in number, and- if the -provisions of the Bill expire at the end of eleven months, a practical difficulty will be created. A limited number of buyers have a stipulated time in which to do their work. I was in the Queensland Parliament when a Bill authorizing the holding of sales in Brisbane was passed, and, in spite of every inducement offered, it took years before the buyers  would purchase in Brisbane, as it interfered with their time-table. </para>

              <para>- It is not that altogether, and I am not backing up Brisbane, but simply pointing out&#39; the difficulty that existed. If the wool sales are to be held at widely separated centres, the European buying firms will have to appoint additional representatives, &#39; because they have not sufficient to be distributed over the buying centres, say, from Adelaide to Townsville, during the time the wool is under offer. After a time,, the buyers fell in with the arrangement, and Brisbane is now included in their schedule. At times the buyers have to hire a special train to get from Sydney to Brisbane to attend a sale, and occasion - ally have to rush back to Sydney by steamer. </para>

            <para>.&#39; - I think the amendment is unnecessary. The pledge has been given that, so far as possible, in all these commercial &#39; transactions, the usual trade practice shall be observed; but the operations of the Wool Pool have been such a complete revolution that it is almost impossible to observe all the old conditions. I again emphasize that we -are not dominated by the Director-General of- Raw Materials as to the local treatment of ! our- wool, or sheepskins&#39;; but he has, in- fact, been a-, real, benefactor to the Australian industry, because, instead of importing into Great- Britain wool in. the grease, he.de-- liberately set out- on a&#39; policy-&#39; to give: as&#39;&#62; much work as possible* to the woolscour:ing plants of Australia. In this matter the Central Wool Committee have acted, as the agents. The same may be.- said, in regard to sheepskins. The British Government buy the surplus after all local requirements are. met,, and&#39; again the Central Wool Committee, act as. their agents. P am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is labouring&#39; under&#39; some- misapprehension. The policy of the Central Wool Committee has been to retain, as far as. possible, pre-war methods- and customs. &#39;Iaii order to show how. operations have been extended, I&#39; may point out that, in 1917-18, 48,000 1 bales were f ellmomgered in New South Wales, and, in 1918-19, about 58,000 bales, the increase being nearly 10,000 bales, or 19.96 per cent. </para>

            <para>. - I agree that the amendment should be pressed. The Wool Committee comprises a group of gentlemen all of whom are in the trade. Under this regulation it is competent for the  chairman  to authorize discovery of the affairs of actual, and, not merely potential, competitors with members of the Board. Discovery is a procedure authorized by Courts of law in actions between parties. In no procedure connected with any Court in any part of the Empire is discovery of this character authorized by law or regulation. When it is a matter as between two parties, discovery  or&#39;  interrogation is never authorized unless approved specifically and in detail by the tribunal. To authorize a Committee to pry into the affairs of competitors in this large and general fashion is a principle of jurisprudence for which no parallel can be found by the Prime Minister, or the AttorneyGeneral, either in this country or elsewhere. There are people connected with the wool industry in various parts of Australia who are never likely to be placed upon the Wool Committee. There are those in outlying districts who have their grievances against the Committee, but find it no easy matter to present their case in&#39; person to its members. On the other hand, the Committee has power, without any check, to investigate its competitors&#39; affairs. There is no limitation. The Committee can investigate incidental affairs, can pry into matters absolutely foreign to the purposes and functions of the Wool Committee. </para>

It should be well known that, in practical operation, the  chairman  of the Central Wool Committee does work in cooperation with the other members of the Committee. The other members of the Committee, and the Department also, are consulted in connexion with all matters of any importance. But very often small details of administration require immediate action, and the Central Wool Committee  doe3  not sit continuously. No member of the Government would dream of incurring certain expenditure without the approval of the Cabinet, but it may be necessary on occasions to send a man upon a special mission, and a Minister would not hesitate to incur the necessary expense in such a case without reference to the Cabinet. In respect of details of administration involving expenditure, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins is in the position of a paying officer,  but,  as I have said,&#34; in connexion with matters of importance, as a matter of course, he consults the other members of the Committee. </para>

          <para>SenatorPRATTEN. - Before the war, wool tops were being made inSydney from the skins of slaughtered sheepand completed from the wool on the skins to the finished wool tops. That process has been objected to by the CentralWool Committee, and consequently those carrying on the industry cannot buy live stock, sell themeat, and use the wool on the skinsfor manufactureinto tops, as they previously did. The Central Wool Committee says, <inline font-style="italic">&#34;No,</inline> that process shall no longer go on. You must sendyourskin wool for. appraisement to a centralplace, and it will , be returned to your factory after appraisement,before the processof manufacture into iwo.ol tops begins.&#34; That is a distinctviolation ofthe promise givenbythe Prime Minister to secondary industries. Onthatground I thinkthe proviso to which I take exception, would not stand thetest ofcontroversy, ifthe Committeeagree,as I propose,to leave out the words &#34;by consent of the Central Committee,&#34; the result will be to return tothe positionlaid down by the Prime Minister at the inauguration of the scheme. </para>

            <para>The retention of this regulation is very necessary, from the point of view of the Committee. The wool trade isa very cosmopolitan trade: The. British Government have, from time to time asked that certain information should not be divulged. The  chairman  of the&#39; Committee has to see that this information is not divulged, and occasionally- it is. necessary to ascertain that these requests are being complied with. The whole thing is done quietly; there is no show. The  chairman  is. the Government nominee, and be - thinks that he ought to be trusted in this matter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is an additional reason. There is a regulation to the effect that wool, after being received at the store, must be reweighed within twenty-four hours. This is very important, and means that immediate action should be taken in. cases where grave suspicion exists. In one case, involving &#163;2,000, an effort was made to prevent the wool being weighed at the proper time to. enable the owner to derive the benefit of the increased weight. In the event of the. weight increasing, it, is essential that no documents shall be altered to make them agree with, the increased weight. I have endeavoured! to meet the position, and say, quite candidly, that I have not had. sufficient time to give such an important matter.the attention it demands. To meet the. wishes of the. Committee, I shall ask. Cabinet to give the regulation its careful consideration. If the Committee agree to. that course, we shall see that there is no abuse, and that the principles of liberty are fully preserved. </para>

          <para>SenatorMcDOUGALL (New South Wales) &#91;2.56&#93;. - During the discussion on this Bill the other evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> submitted priced samples of Australian tweeds. I informed the Senate&#39; that I would produce a pair of trousers, which cost 35s., made from the material submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and would ask him to indicate where the profit was made. I have been wearing garments made of tweed woven at these identical mills, and know by experience their worth in a wearing capacity. One could hardly wear them out. There is no reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should say that huge profits have not been made. According to the figures and samples submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> the material in the garment I have produced cost 10s. 8d., and the cost of making was 7s. 6d., or a total of 18s. 2d. The completed article is sold at 35s., leaving a profit of 16s.10d. Can any one say that a profit of over 90 per cent. on such a garment is a fair one? If he does, the criticisms of the Inter-State Commission are well deserved. The article I am referring to was not handled by a middleman, but passed directly from the tweed mills to the emporium, where it was manufactured under union conditions. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> indicate where the enormous profit has been made? I do not say that the manufacturers of cloth receive it all, but I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has been misled in connexion with the prices he submitted to the Senate. </para>

I have myself experienced the inconvenience, on other occasions, of being summoned to attend meetings of the Senate without being called upon to transact much business, and I do not wish unnecessarily to subject honorable senators to the inconvenience of coming to Mel- bourne in such circumstances. Before the date fixed for the re-assembling of this Chamber, I shall he in a position to warn those who live in different States by telegram if it is proposed to adjourn the Senate for another week. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister has mentioned a subject of  very great importance indeed. I hope that nothing will be done by the Government to prevent matters arising out of the Peace Treaty from being dealt with by both Houses of the Federal Parliament at the same time. I take it that in such circumstances the Senate has equal powers with the House of Representatives. Therefore, both Chambers should have the same opportunity of dealing with those matters. If matters relating to the Peace Treaty are not laid upon the table of both Houses at the same time, the Government will be making an invidious- distinction between the rights of the two Houses. It is the duty of the Government to see that nothing shall prevent those matters being dealt with simultaneously in both Houses. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Well, Mr. President,</inline>I have just another observation to make, and I think it will be in order. It is proposed to adjourn the Senate until 10th September, and the Minister has indicated that, in certain circumstances, there might be an adjournment until 17th September. . I know that honorable senators, like other individuals, are likely to study their own convenience, and, perhaps, there will be a chorus of assent to the Minister&#39;s suggestion that we shall not re-assemble until 17th September; but in view of the enormous amount of business outlined for this session, it is the duty of the Government to provide work for the Senate early. What is there to prevent us from proceeding with Government business on 10th September? I understand we are to have a measure to alter the system of election to this Senate. If that is so, this is the Chamber most interested, and it is the duty of the Government to introduce the Bill. here. If the measure is ready - and I am given to understand it is, or that it will be ready in ten days&#39; time - why should it not be introduced and dealt . with here ? It is going to give rise to a very long discussion, and because of vital alterations proposed in our method of election, honorable senators should have ample time for its consideration. </para>

          <para>. - I shall now conclude what I was saying when speaking to the previous motion.I hope it is the intention of the Government to introduce in this Chamber the measure dealing with the alterations in the method of election to the Senate. Within the last twelve months the system of preferential voting in elections for the House of Representatives has been adopted, and the Senate should have an early opportunity of dealing with the proposed alteration in the Senate elections. </para>

            <para>- That is quite true. Every honorable senator will concede that this subject is of more interest to the Senate than to the House of Representatives. I do not know what is in the mind of the Government, but I have been given to understand that until quite recently it was their intention to introduce this Bill in the House of Representatives first, because the Minister controlling the Department is in the other House. But we have a representative of that Minister in this Chamber, and there is no reason why the measure should not be brought forward here first. Referring again to the matters arising out of the Peace Treaty, I hope they will be placed before both Houses simultaneously. &#39; In addition to these subjects,several other important measures have been&#39; outlined for our consideration in the near future, and the Government should endeavour to bring about a more equal division of the work by initiating more Bills in this Chamber, thus obviating the rush towards the end of a session, and the scanty consideration sometimes given to measures because of their extreme urgency. All Governments have been transgressors in this respect, and sometimes we have been called on to do as much work in the last few days of a session as during the previous two or three months, with the result&#39; that frequently measures do not receive the consideration they deserve.. I hope: the Government will do. something to provide work to keep the Senate going. </para>
