                        <para>. - In addressing myself to this Bill, I recognise that it is a very important measure, and one that directly affects our primary producers. I am not altogether satisfied with the manner in which it was introduced, or with the matter brought before us by the Minister when he was moving the second reading. He said there are practically five Bills in one, which means that five very important industries are dealt with, in one measure. As the new standing order limits honorable senators to sixty minutes in which to deliver a second-reading speech, we have only twelve minutes in which to deal with each of the five huge industries concerned. I am quite unable to condense my remarks and at the same time deal fully with the provisions of the Bill. I am absolutely at a loss to intelligently discuss questions of such magnitude in the limited time at my disposal. </para>

The offer of an extension of time by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and the party of which he is a member, and which has forced us to deal with the Bill under the conditions to which I have referred, will not receive my favorable consideration.

                    <para>The Wheat Pool was brought into existence by the Hughes Government, to assist the producers of Australia. The Hughes Government has changed its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> so frequently that I am doubtful as to which Government I am referring to. I was a member of the Fisher Government during 1914-15, and of a Hughes Government during 1915-16, and I believe it was during the latter period that the Government brought the Wheat Pool into existence. The predominant reason for its establishment was scarcity of freight, and the possibility of vessels coming to our shores being seriously reduced in number, with the result that the farmers would be left with huge stocks of wheat on hand. In those days, when we had good government, Providence blessed us with good seasons; and the Wheat Pool was established to secure to the farmer what was then considered a fair price for his produce, which was at that time abundant. We had to face some troubles in forming such a huge Pool, and in financing it. I desire to give full credit to the financial institutions of the country, the private banking concerns. When they realized the enormous proportions of this new project they did not fail to appreciate that it might eventually interfere with their interests, yet they met us in a spirit which, permitted us to finance it But when it was discovered that our first overdraft would amount to about &#163;8,000,000, and when arrangements to cope with that overdraft were being made, the financial concerns, realizing that we were short of the necessary money by some millions sterling, were quite prepared to take a perfectly legitimate advantage of the situation, and to increase their rate of interest. However, the Commonwealth Government arranged otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of what I know, and I do not desire to be interrupted by the Minister. Thanks to the fact that the Commonwealth Government has a banking institution of its own behind it, the rate of interest was kept at the original mark. These matters are well worth considering at a time when the Federal Parliament is dealing with a proposal to extend the operations of the various Pools. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> claims that the continuation of the Wheat Pools is not desired for any reason except that it is necessary that the authorities concerned shall be given sufficient time to complete contracts already entered into. If the wheat scheme has proved a huge success, so far as the primary producers are concerned; if, indeed, it has not merely given them a vast sum of money, but has actually and literally saved them, why should the Government, which claims to be the special and peculiar representative of the primary producer, make no effort to secure an extension of the Wheat Pools beyond the very short period set forth in the Bill? </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>So far as my objection to this measure is concerned it will be based chiefly upon the fact that the Pools are not to be continued for all time for the benefit of primary producers, but are to be continued only for the assistance of big interests. The smaller interests, and the whole community in relation to the cost of living, are to be ignored. The Government has entered into no contracts to alter the conditions bearing down upon the rank and file of working men to-day; the latter are neglected, and&#39; it is merely the big interests which are to be looked after in the Bill. I am quite aware, of course, that the Government has no constitutional power to deal with the other interests just indicated. But the Government could very quickly and easily have secured the necessary power. As soon as the armistice was signed, or at any period during the peace negotiations, the Government, if it had truly desired to conserve the best interests of the community, could have called Parliament together, and it could have gone to the people for the necessary power to enable it to adequately meet the needs of the community in relation to the cost of living. And, by the date on which this present measure was introduced, those necessary powers could have been conferred. However, that course of action was not taken. </para>

                        seemed to think that because the Wheat Pools have showed a profit on the whole series of transactions they may be said to be a huge success. It evidently gives him satisfaction  to think that all the criticisms levelled at himself during the period of his Ministerial control may be said to have been swept aside because there is a sum on the right side of the ledger.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline>
                        holds the opinion that, no matter what has been said regarding bad management, ineptitude, and lack of business foresight, the Wheat Pools have proved a success, because there is a credit &#39;balance, and there is still unsold wheat on hand. I cannot understand that method of reasoning. I fail to see why, when the Minister was describing the success of the wheat scheme as a whole, he could not supply all the facts indicating the full extent of its success. It is not merely that the &#163;18,000,000 overdraft has been met, and that there are some millions of bushels of wheat still in hand. The Minister was very vague with respect to the stocks still in hand. The wheat in the stacks is represented, on paper, as being equal to the quantity of wheat delivered into the stacks. But mice and Tats and weevils have destroyed great stocks. In addition to those factors there is the possibility that the total shown on paper has never actually reached the stacks. We are living in a business community. My idea of the business methods of the community is that those methods aim entirely at making money anyhow - honestly or otherwise. The quantity of wheat shown in the books of the Wheat Board as having been delivered into the stacks may never have actually reached the stacks.

                    <para>But, notwithstanding the ravages of mice and weevil, and the waste due to inefficient management, the farmer is still in a much better position under the wheat scheme than he would have been without it; that is to say, had his produce been subject to the ravages of private enterprise in connexion with commissions when wheat was cheap. One very prominent man connected with the wheat trade has assured me that the losses sustained on account of the ravages of weevil and mice are nothing as compared with the losses sustained on account of the commission which private buyers used to get. If that be so - and I am inclined to think that it is a fact - and if a better method of handling our primary products is within reach, the Commonwealth Government, as representing the farmers and the people of Australia, should not withhold their hands for a single day. They should unquestionably adopt that improved method. It is a sad reflection upon the people of Australia, that this Parliament does not possess the power to do this at the present time. Under the War Precautions Act, which has been subjected to a good deal of criticism from time to time, the Government intrusted with the conduct of the war was vested with power to do whatever it willed to do. But if that Statute had not been enacted it would still have been the inherent power of any Government - when the nation was either threatened with war, or was actually at war - to do whatever they deemed it necessary to do for the protection of this country. In other words, the Executive Government of Australia could, in time of war, without the aid of the War Precautions Act, have done all that it did under that Statute. </para>
                    <para class="block">Our constitutional powers in this connexion were first called into question when the Commonwea.th Government fixed the price of bread. Certain business persons were not content to allow us to insure that the people should obtain bread at a reasonable price. To them it did not matter that our granaries were overflowing, or that we had been blessed bv Providence with the most bountiful seasons. Immediately the Government fixed the price of bread, certain persons engaged in that industry contested the validity of our powers. The case soon after came before the High Court, but it was not until the 13th May, 1916, that the decision of that tribunal was forthcoming. The whole of the delay experienced was due to the fact that our Constitution was then in exactly the condition in which we find it to-day. The decision of the High Court was&#39; practically that the question whether it was necessary to fix the price of bread in order to enable us to conduct the war successfully was one for the Executive alone to determine. If the Cabinet said that it was necessary to do so, it had&#39; a right to fix the price. That decision on the part of the highest legal tribunal in this country confirmed the opinion we had previously entertained. Subsequently the operations of government in this connexion were vastly extended. </para>
                    <para>Coming back to the Wheat Pool, I unhesitatingly affirm that during the period it has been in existence much valuable experience has been gained. For example, we have learned how to conserve the wheat during good seasons with as little damage as possible. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has pointed out, we were confronted, shortly after the establishment of the Pool, with a mice plague of unparalleled magnitude, owing to the huge storage of wheat which had been effected in various portions of this country. But an easy method for coping with this pest, and thus keeping the stacks free of it, was very soon discovered. What has since happened in regard to our wheat? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> did not tell us what he expected the whole profit of the Pool to be, He has withheld from the people of Australia much information, under the plea that he did not wish to advantage the dealers in wheat scrip. I say, here and now, that there never should have been any dealings in wheat scrip. As soon as the Wheat Pool was established upon a fair basis, the farmer should have been paid the full price for his grain. </para>

But my own opinion is that it should not be necessary for him to guess at the quantity of wheat in stock - he should know it from actual returns. I trust that the Minister responsible for the management of the Pool will in future keep the public so informed of what is happening that it will be impossible for fortunes to be made by slumping the market to-day and causing it to rise tomorrow. The people of this country want straightforward dealing in connexion with this matter. If the Minister in the exercise of his discretion withholds certain information from the public, how can he be assured that some officer in his Department will not disclose that information to outsiders? </para>

                            <para>- The Minister&#39;s remark, I take it, goes to prove the truth of my allegation that no matter what quantity of wheat is credited in the books of the Department as being in the wheat stacks, there is no guarantee that it is there. I am not blaming the Minister personally for withholding information from the public. But he must be aware that wheat scrip has been so used as to allow fortunes to be made out of the manner in which the market has been manipulated. In the matter of withholding information, need I point to the Georgeson case in New South Wales? An investigation into certain charges made in relation to that particular con- tract has just. been finished, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Georgeson</inline> was a lucky speculator who took the great risk of buying from the New South Wales Government more than &#163;500,000 worth of wheat without paying a single shilling deposit upon it, and of securing the Eastern market for himself, I am not going to say that he has done anything dishonorable. Far from it. Yet, not only does the evidence disclose, but the finding of the Judge shows, that on the 1st February last a certain telegram was in the possession of the Minister who was in control of the Wheat Board in New South Wales, that that telegram was submitted to the Chamber of Commerce and to various individuals in Sydney somewhere about the 5th February, but that it did not find its way to the Wheat Board until the 20th of February - the day upon which the Minister entered into the contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Georgeson.</inline> That telegram disclosed that there was a drought, with a consequent shortage of rice, in Japan. It did not require a very intelligent man to know that if there was a shortage of rice in Japan it would be necessary to make good that shortage with wheat. Nor did it need a very smart business man to know if he could purchase &#163;500,000 worth of wheat from the New South Wales Government, and obtain access to the Eastern market, the risk he would incur in purchasing that wheat would not be a very great one. The Department had the information to which I have referred from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Suttor,</inline> its representative in Japan, on the 1st February last. That information was sent by telephone to certain public bodies in Sydney, but it was not till the 20th February that it reached the Wheat Board. Secrecy of that kind is calculated to create in the minds of the farmers but one impression, namely, that those who were responsible for the management of this Pool were not much concerned about securing for them the very best possible price. </para>

Let me refer to the manner in which Australian wheat was sold to </para>
                    <para class="block">Great Britain time after time. I can quite understand that persons sentimentally inclined might say that when Britain was under the stress of war, and when U-boats were blockading and threatening to starve her people, we should not have cavilled at the price at which we sold our wheat to the Mother Land. I am not going to cavil at the price now, hut I venture to say that, even under conditions like those to which I refer, the British people might well have been called upon to pay the same price for Australian wheat as their Government were prepared to pay for British-grown wheat. </para>

                            <para>- I would have done what the British Government did - the best for the people they were governing. If the Australian Government had acted in like manner, and had done their best for the Australian people, we would have had a great deal more money with which to meet our war loan obligations than we have at the present time. The sale of huge quantities of Australian wheat at about 4s. per bushel at a time when the British Government had fixed the price of British-grown wheat as high as 10s. per bushel was a bad business deal from the -stand-point of the Australian farmer. It is all very well to say that we get credit for helping the Mother Country when she was in danger, by letting her have our wheat for half the price she was paying to her own people. No doubt this was splendid, and our farmers have stood up to it magnificently. But it was bad business to call upon the Australian farmer - because, after all, it was the farmers and not the Australian public - to bear the entire &#39; burden, for while his wheat was being sold at half its price, he was being compelled to pay at exorbitant rates for all the necessaries of life, and had to pay excessive freights on his wheat. </para>

                    <para>Some time ago I asked what was the cost, in 1914, of carrying wheat from Australia to Great Britain in privately-owned vessels, and the Minister&#39;s reply was that the freights ranged from 19s. 6d. to 32s. 6d. per tan. During the war this Government, with the deliberate intention of decreasing the margin between the price which the British people were paying for Australian wheat and&#39; that which the British Government were paying for British wheat, increased freights in their own vessels to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. per ton. I shall not read the whole of the questions which I put to the Minister on that occasion, as they appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and my statements may thus be verified. Under the operation of this scheme the farmer who delivered his wheat in good order and condition gets only the proclaimed price. If 1,000 bags of first class wheat was destroyed by the mice or weevil in another State, the farmer who delivered first class wheat would have to bear his share of the loss. </para>

                            <para>- I know that my speeches always start <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s active brain working, but, unfortunately, he sits so closely behind the Government that for most of his time here it remains inactive. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie talks to me about wanting cheap bread, I say that we could just as well let the people of Australia have bread at 3d. per 2-lb. loaf, and pay the farmer full value for his wheat, as pay the iron manufacturer a bonus on his product. The point I am attempting to make is that, owing to the losses that have been incurred in the working of the Wheat Pools, the wheat producer has been suffering more than any other section of the community. It may be that the Minister will say that finally the farmer will get full market value, but to that argument I reply that if, owing to hard conditions, a farmer is obliged to sell his scrip, he will not get full market value for his produce. Let me now give a few quotations showing the price of wheat in Great Britain. I go to the actual source for this information, so that my figures may not be questioned. In the House of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the16th March, 1917,I find the following remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outhwaite:</inline> - </para>

I want to get the price that is being paid to the Australian farmer, in order to compare it with what the British farmer is extorting. </para>

                                has himself just said that it was not 4s. 9d. per bushel, but that there was a possibility that it would reach 4s. 9d. per bushel if all went well, having regard to freight, mice, and everything else. I shall establish the correctness of these figures beyond dispute by quoting the answers of responsible Ministers in Great Britain to questions asked in the House of Commons. Honorable senators wil1 recognise, therefore, that any figures I use are submitted only after complete investigation.

                            Is the honorable gentleman aware that he did not answer this question on Thursday at all? He said the figures were incorrect. Is he aware that the first figure is got from the statement made by the  president  of the Victorian Farmers Union dealing with prices given in Australia, and the other figure is given from the front bench?
                        </para>
                        <para>Captain Bathurst. - I am informed by the Wheat Commission that the figure is incorrect; but it is immaterial whether it is correct or incorrect. Questions of this character are greatly to be deprecated, and render the negotiations for the purchase of wheat in other countries somewhat delicate and difficult. </para>

                        <para>Captain Bathurst. - May I take the opportunity of saying that there is nothing whatever to show that there is any disparity, considering the altered conditions, between the price paid for this wheat and British wheat. The contract is one which was made several months ago, when the conditions in the world generally were wholly  different  from what they are to-day. </para>

As freights went clown the loaf went up. That was duc to the fact that the American grower, and, possibly, the merchant, succeeded in making far larger profits than ever they anticipated; undoubtedly they have made large profits out of the privations of Europe.  We  are not in the happy position of having the American Government in full sympathy with us in this and other matters, &#39;and&#39; I observe from newspaper reports that a fixed price has been made, and that wheat can be purchased in the United States at something over 2 dollars a bushel - 2.25 dollars or 2.30 dollars - that is to&#62; say, about 10s. a bushel, or 80s. a quarter. </para>

The Minister says that the fact that there is a surplus from the Wheat Pool is a proof of its success. The Minister&#39;s statement that there is a surplus is a proof of its success in spite of, I will not say the bad management, but the lack of experience, which had to be gained in the management of the Pool before it became -successful. But I have made, the quotations I .have given to the Senate to show that it is to the farmers, and to them alone, that credit is due for sending wheat to feed the British people, and that they gave that wheat at half its price, and did so without grumbling. Now that that wheat has gone, and the war is. over, the Government are asking to extend the Pool over another harvest or two, but they are not proposing to protect the farmer from private speculators. The farmers are as large purchasers in the world&#39;s markets of boots, clothing, arid other necessaries of life as are the members of any other section of  the community.  Whilst the Government are proposing  to extend the Wheat Pool until their contracts are completed, they do not make any statement of their intention to extend in other directions; for the benefit of the farmer, what has proved to be a good system of bargaining with, their wheat and other produce. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government, with a view to protecting the farmer quite a number of ships were purchased by the Government to carry abroad the produce of farmers and other persons. A high price was paid for those ships, as they could not be purchased otherwise at the time. But it never was intended by the Government which purchased them that, once they came into their hands, they were to be used for profiteering purposes in just the same way as privately-owned ships were used. I may remind honorable senators that before the war the rate of freight on wheat from Australia to London was from 6&#163;d. to less than  10&#189;d.  per bushel or from 19s. to 323. per ton. What are we to say of a Government which, without any very considerable additional cost in the handling of their ships, charged the Wheat Pool, and that is to say the Australian farmer, as high as 150s. per ton, or about 4s. per bushel, freight on wheat to London? I invite the attention of the Minister in charge of the Wheat Pool to this matter, and he &#171;an give me an answer one way or tie other as to the exact figures when he comes to reply to the debate. The figures will show that the profits on carrying the farmers&#39; wheat to London by the vessels which the first Hughes- Government purchased paid for those vessels, and thus the people who paid for them were the farmers. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder if it is too late now for the Government to fix  a  fair rate at which to carry farmers&#39; wheat. I do not say that it should be based on pre-war rates, but wheat should be carried at a reduced price, and the profits should go into the Pool to enable the farmers to participate in them. The farmers have to pay the world&#39;s parity for everything they use, and why should they not be allowed to receive full value for their produce? Having neglected, owing to lack of business aptitude, to secure the world&#39;s price for the farmers&#39; produce, the Government should charge only a fair freight for grain, and give the balance to the people who have earned it. I find that I&#39; have left this important question practically untouched, because there are  a  lot of important matters in connexion with the Pool that should be dealt with.  What  happened in the seeking for these extended powers by the Government in another place? The Minister who introduced the Bill quoted the opinions of an array of distinguished barristers regarding the powers of the Commonwealth to act in this way, but I have the presumption to differ from the opinions of those distinguished barristers. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, this legislation will remain in operation only until one firm with sufficient capital behind it appeals, when it will be found to be wholly unconstitutional. In introducing the measure in another place the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> endeavoured to justify his action, and he would not have been driven to that extremity if he had not grave doubts concerning its legality. Seeing that the Government doubt their constitutional powers, and that they believe that these concerns can be successfully carried on by the Commonwealth, it would be better to ask the people of Australia to grant them the powers they need. </para>

                        <para>. -  I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has not seen fit to accept an extension of time in terms of the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> I am entirely in sympathy with him, and realize that it is impossible to deal with an important Bill in such  a  limited time  as  is allowed by  the  new standing order. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>During the war period the Government practically controlled the whole of the import and export trade of the Commonwealth, as well as a good deal of its interna&#93; &#39;trade, and their activities extended over most of the important commercial undertakings within the Commonwealth. The transactions of the Government represented, approximately, &#163;400,000,000 sterling, and this is the first time that Parliament has been asked for approval or disapproval of, what has been going on and what is proposed next year. The Senate should, and will, give attention to some of the weaknesses of governmental control of commercial activities, as evidenced in the past. 1 believe the Senate will endeavour to make some improvements, so that the lessons of the past may be of practical use to us. </para>
                    <para>The Bill proposes to extend the control over dairy produce, wool, skins, flax, sugar, and wheat until varying specific dates next year. I understand that contracts have been made in regard to these commodities, and that the legal luminaries the Government called to their counsel have said that the measure will be perfectly constitutional. </para>
                    <para>I notice the absence from this Bill of any attempt to control metals, and I hope no further control is intended. It is &#34;to be hoped that governmental control of this very important primary production will end on the expiration of the War Precautions Regulations. I believe a silent vote on this matter will condone a good deal &#39;of what we hope will be rectified in the future in connexion with our commercial activities of the last four years. This is the most important measure we have had before us for the last two years. The Minister, in introducing it told us that it was really five Bills in one, and that each division was a Bill in itself. I am sorry that my time is so limited, owing to the passage of the new standing order, and I may have to ask the Senate for an extension to enable me to fully analyze some of the important provisions of the Bill. I regard the measure as one which has been brought in by the Government to keep faith with Parliament. The explicit promise was made, in connexion with the discussion of the extension of the War </para>
                    <para class="block">Precautious Regulations, that before very long the Government would ask for parliamentary authority to extend the powers which up to then had been granted and exercised under the War Precautions Act. The difficulties of -the Government have been very great. There has been the enormous factor of the war.. There has been the long and dangerous transit to our overseas markets. We remember the first days of the war, when the outlook was black, and when some of us, perhaps, were in a nervy condition ; and, indeed, when, possibly, a panic was not far distant. The conception of Wheat Pools and of Government control in wartime was, in my opinion, sound. We  were  a great primary producing country. We had raw products to sell - far more than we required for home consumption.  W&#171;e  had the question of finance to consider. We were compelled to play, at that stage, for safety and caution. We were groping in the dark. We had faith in our cause, but the end could not be foreseen. All those factors are a condonation of what the Government has done in regard to its various controls during the war. Australia has come out of her difficulties fairly well. True, we have had unofficial dictators, some tyranny, a great deal of secrecy, and much incompetence. Administration has not always been satisfactory. A case could be established, in connexion with Government activities, based upon the contention that we have sold cheap and bought dear. But I do not propose to be wise after the event, and to be hypercritical in connexion with the tremendous and unforeseen difficulties arising from the war. I hope, though, that as the result of our being able to enter upon much freer discussion now that the war is over, the blunders of the past will be rectified, and that many hard-learned lessons of the past will be applied to improve present and future administration. </para>
                    <para>Of all the activities of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has rightly remarked that wheat control has been the most unique. Wheat constitutes the vastest bulk of our produce; it requires the greatest amount of tonnage to transport; it is the most perishable of all the controlled commodities. It is liable to pests; and the Government was caught, when the pests developed, with primitive storage arrangements. I arn sorry that the Minister, in his speech, still continued upon that optimistic plane where he has all along dwelt in hi- relations with wheat control. He was still somewhat indefinite and inconclusive; and his figures, unless subjected to very careful analysis, do not lead us far. I am sorry that the Minister did not see fit, two years ago, when we sustained such big losses as an outcome of our primitive storage arrangements, to take the country into his confidence, and strike a pessimistic note. </para>

                            <para>- Had the truth been told, the farmers - who are the owners of the wheat - would have been prepared for the losses which must surely arise. In addition to those losses, there have been abnormal expenses per bushel. None of the Ministerial statements issued upon the subject has even hinted at the abnormal expenses incurred in connexion with the handling and marketing of our wheat. </para>

                    <para>I propose to devote my speech upon these &#34;five Bills in one&#34; to some detailed analysis of the wheat position. I believe the farmers want to know where they are. Month after month, the press has been calling for some clarification of the position. I propose to show, so far as I am able, with the help of figures collected from various sources, what position the farmer is in at the present time. I shall attempt to show the statistical position in relation to wheat still held for sale. My figures lead me to the conclusion that we shall be at least 24,000,000 bushels short when the four Pools are cleared up, but we may be able to learn what the value of scrip really is. The abnormal losses, and the great expenses per bushel incurred in placing the wheat f.o.b., will show that the farmer&#39;s net return will amount to barely 4s. per bushel on the average of the four Pools. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that later. This statement agrees with those issued from time to time by the Wheat Board up to the 23rd June. That body supplied the information that the wheat received in the 1915-16 Pool, or the &#34;A &#34; Pool, was 163,374,000 bushels; in the 1916-17 Pool, or the &#34; B &#34; Pool, 138,275,000 bushels; in the 1917-18 Pool, or the &#34; C &#34; Pool, 103,342,000 bushels; and, in the 1918-19 Pool, or the &#34;D&#34; Pool, 64,796,000 -bushels; a grand total of 469,787,000 bushels. Those figures do not constitute quite the whole of the wheat grown in the Commonwealth. No doubt, a few million bushels have criss-crossed about the country, and have been retained for local consumption; but that grand total comprises all the wheat put into the Pools. The Minister stated in another place, on the 2nd July, that sales overseas by the Board have amounted to 6,050,000 tons, and that of this quantity there had been shipped 5,200,000 tons. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> stated on 27th June that the amount of money involved in sales of wheat to the British Government  was &#163;30,333,000; that was, in regard to 500,000 and 3,000,000 tons of wheat. The value of the wheat delivered in respect of those contracts - the Acting Prime Minister said was &#163;24,657,000, and the amount advanced over and above the value of wheat delivered to date is &#163;5,676,000. According, then, to the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s statement, the amount of wheat yet to be delivered and paid for was approximately, 650,000 tons. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> stated on the 2nd July that there were 850,000 tens still to shiip.  The Acting Prime Minister&#39;s statement referred only to the British Government&#39;s contracts; and, knowing that orders from other countries had been placed with the Australian Wheat Board, it is reasonable for me to assume that by that date there would have been another 100,000 tons sold, but not shipped and not paid for. To reconcile the statements of the Acting Prime Minister and the Acting Attorney-General, however, I will assume that that tonnage is 200,000. I shall show, on the basis of those official figures, what a great discrepancy will be discovered upon the clean-up of the whole of the Pools. </para>

                    <para>The most &#39;interesting point of all with those people who are interested in the wheat scheme is. how much wheat is there left to sell ? For the purpose of elucidating that, we must analyze operations from two stand-points; first, theoretically, the Wheat Board&#39;s figures; and, secondly, various statements made in Parliament, which I have repeated. The announcements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> have also included the statement that these were the figures after allowing for Commonwealth consumption of wheat to the end of the year. He said that after allowing for that item, we still had 2,000,000 tons for sale. That announcement  was a few days afterwards confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt,</inline> the accountant, or secretary, of the Wheat Board, who said, in effect, that after the sale of 1,000,000 tons - the last - was made, if the British Government exercised its option over the 500.000 tons, there would only remain 500,000 in the Pool. The shippers&#39; stocks of wheat and flour on 23rd June last, Wheat Board figures, were 147,808,000 bushels. The consumption of wheat in Australia to the end of the year, based on an average of 2J bushels per head, will be, according to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> 13,750,000 bushels. This quantity, deducted from that which was in the Pool on 23rd June, would leave 134,058,000 bushels. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom&#39;s</inline> figures are based on the assumption that there are 35 bushels of wheat in a ton, and if we accept the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s statement, that 650.000 tons have yet to be delivered to the British Government for payment received, the shippers&#39; stocks of wheat and flour would be further reduced by 22,750,000 bushels. These quantities deducted from the 134,058,000 bushels would leave in the Pool, theoretically - after provision had been made for six months&#39; local consumption - 111,308,000 bushels yet to be realized. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> in introducing the Bill in another place, stated that we still had for sale 2,000,000 tons of wheat. After allowing for the 200,000 tons sold to various Governments, there is thus a discrepancy of 34,308,000 bushels between the quantity which, theoretically, ought to be in the Pool and- the quantity which the Minister says is still for sale. I think that the following table will make these calculations clearer: - </para>
                    <para class="block">In dealing with this theoretical deficiency, I propose to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> in connexion with the correction which he made in his tonnage figures last Friday. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> has based his calculations upon the assumption that 35 bushels of wheat will weigh a ton, those who know anything about the matter know that it takes 37J bushels to weigh a ton. I must, therefore, make a contingency allowance in connexion with these figures, and I propose to make that allowance, not 5,000,000, but 10,000,000 bushels, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> himself may have allowed for more than the actual bare requirements of the Commonwealth for the balance of the year. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister&#39;s observation will not affect my figures in the slightest degree, because they are based on the statistics of the Federal Wheat Board up to 23rd June last. Further, I do not think that shipping is proceeding at such express speed as to materially interfere with them. I have reduced the theoretical deficiency - based on the statements which have already been made - of 34,500,000 bushels by a contingency allowance of 10,000,000 bushels, to 24,500,000 bushels. I am quite aware that on some of the crops there has been an increase of weight. But I am not now dealing with the profit to the Pool which must result -from that increase - an increase which will, perhaps, amount in all to nearly 4,000,000 bushels. Rather am I dealing with the actual losses which will be incurred in connexion with the administration of the Pool. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, it may be that very many more certificates have been issued in connexion with the receipt of wheat at country railway stations than suffice to cover wheat which has actually been delivered there. That will be a loss to the Pool, and must eventually be a loss to the farmers of this country. </para>

                    <para>It is interesting to endeavour to analyze in what States these losses are likely to occur. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> said that 3,821,000 bushels of the 1915-16 crop still remain in South Australia. Without questioning his statement in any way my information is that no South Australian wheat can be stacked for four years and remain in good condition at the end of that period. I prefer, therefore, to believe that this 3,821,000 bushels is represented &#39;by dust and refuse. </para>

                            <para>- But they contain the wheat of other crops than that of 1915-16. South Australia has been particularly unfortunate in regard to shipping, in that she has not enjoyed the facilities -which .have been  enjoyed  by other States. However, as my time is limited, and as I desire to present a somewhat complex argument in which I must set out my figures consecutively, I shall be glad if the Minister will allow me to proceed without interruption. On the 1916-17 crop I estimate that there will be a loss in New South Wales of at least 6,000,000 bushels. As a matter of fact, I think that loss has been almost admitted. I believe that upon this crop there will be a loss in South Australia of 4,000,000 bushels. Upon the 1917-18 crop, which in New South Wales and South Australia has been considerably damaged bv weevil, I estimate a loss of 3,000,000 bushels in the former State, and of 2,000,000 in the latter. There will, of course, be some losses in Victoria. Those losses possibly, without allowing for any addition owing to the increased weight of the wheat will amount to anything up to 4,000,000 bushels in all in that State. So that the total losses on the figures which I have presented is 22,821,000 bushels. Assuming that there is none of the 1915-16 crop left, after these losses have been deducted, there would remain for realization 27,606,000 bushels of the 1916-17 crop, 39,407,000 bushels of the 1917-18 crop, and 57,974,000 bushels of the 1 918-19 crop, a total of 124,987,000 bushels. Of this quantity the British Government have to get 650,000 tons, which have been paid for, but which have not yet been delivered, so that on the figures which I have submitted the stocks available for sale will be 4,856,000 bushels of the 1916-17 crop, 39,407,000 bushels of the 1917-18 crop, and 57,974,000 bushels of the 1918-19 crop, or a total of 102,237,000 bushels. Now, I must deduct from this amount a certain quantity in order that the British Government may receive 37. bushels per ton instead of the &#39; 35 bushels estimated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> When I have done this I think that the quantity of wheat remaining to be sold at the time these statements were made would amount approximately to 100,000,000 bushels. </para>

                            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of last Thursday published the State scrip figures up to Wednesday last. These were made up by the State Wheat Board office&#39;, and show that in New South Wales, for all the Pools which have been established, there is not 25 per cent, of the wheat scrip in second hands - that is to say, in the hands of speculators. Various estimates have been made by brokers and others, but nobody seems to know accurately what is the position. However, I think it . is fair to assume, on the figures I have quoted, that in New South Wales considerably more than 50 per cent. of the scrip issued in connexion with all the Pools still remains in the hands of the original owners, and that considerably less than 50 per cent, has found . its way into the hands of speculators. . Whatever we may now say is the value of the scrip, the point is that it is of far more importance . to the farmers than, the speculators, because they hold the bulk of it. In analyzing the scrip position, I have taken the average net market rates as on the 14th July of this year, and my calculation as to the total value of scrip in all the Pools has been arrived at on the following basis: - New South Wales : - &#34; A &#34; Pool, 1. 7-16d. ; &#34; B,&#34;1&#189;d. ; &#34;C.&#34; 9¾ d ; &#34; D,&#34; 6d. Victoria -&#34;A,&#34;1d.; &#34;B,&#34;7¾d.; &#34;C,&#34;10d.; &#34;D,&#34; 4d. South Australia-&#34; A,&#34; 7-16d. ; &#34; B,&#34; 3d.; &#34;C,&#34; 9d.; &#34; D,&#34; 4d. Western Australia- &#34; A,&#34; Id; &#34; B,&#34;1&#189;d.; &#34; C,&#34; Sd. ; &#34; D,&#34; 3&#189;d. These are the net prices and have been arrived at after deducting 4d. in the case of New South Wales, for freight in respect of &#34; B &#34; and &#34; C &#34; Pools; 4&#163;d. railage in Victoria in respect of &#34; B &#34; and &#34; C <inline font-style="italic">&#34;</inline> Pools; and 2&#188;d. freight for &#34;B&#34; and &#34;C&#34; Pools in South Australia. A calculation of the money that will be required to redeem the scrip at these net figures on 14th July of this year gives a sum of &#163;8,443,418. If there were only 100,000,000 bushels of wheat in the Wheat Pools actually saleable on the dates at which these figures were compiled, I think we could assume that the balance in the 1916-17 Pool, 4,856,000 bushels, would realize 4s. 6d. per bushel net, or a total of &#163;1,092,600; that the 39,407,000 bushels&#39; in the 1917-18 Pool would realize 5s. ; or a total of &#163;9,851,750; and that the 55,737,000 bushels in the 1918-19 Pool would return 5s. 6d. net, or a total of &#163;15,327,675, giving a total for the 100,000,000 bushels of &#163;26,272,025. The overdraft on 23rd June of this year was &#163;18,335,000, which, deducted from the amount realizable on the basis stated for the 100,000,000 bushels, would show a credit of &#163;7,937,025. The net value of the wheat scrip on 14th July I have shown to be &#163;8,443,418. Therefore, on these figures, the loss in market value of the wheat scrip on 14th July would appear to be &#163;506,393, without taking into account any further expenditure. I believe there is a good deal of evidence available to buttress the calculations which I have made. For instance, although we hear of high prices being paid for wheat, we must not forget the heavier expenditure incurred. For the &#34;A&#34; crop the expenditure, as spread over the whole crop, is 7.3d., without allowing for railway freight. For the &#34;B&#34; Pool, the rate is 11.18d. ; for the &#34; C &#34; Pool, 9.8d. ; and for the &#34; D,&#34; 5.38d. per bushel so far. I think that the total cost of the realization of the wheat in the four Pools cannot be less, including railway freight, than Is. for the &#34;A&#34; wheat; Is. 6d. for &#34;B&#34; wheat; Is. 3d. for &#34; C &#34; wheat ; and Is. at least for &#34; D &#34; wheat. </para>

                            <para>- No. Another thing the farmers are entitled to know in connexion with Wheat Board finance is whether or not the whole of the wheat in the Pools has yet been paid for. In an actuarial survey of the statements given to the public by the Wheat Board, I find that the sum paid to the growers at the prices set out for the respective Pools - 4s. 9d., 3s. 3d., 3s. 3d., and 4s. 4d- is nearly &#163;8,000,000 less than ought to have been paid, based on the quantity of wheat which the Wheat Board admits has been received into the Pools. I understand that this includes railway freights on the A &#34; and &#34; D &#34; Pools ; but this, reckoned on the average of 4d. per bushel, will not amount to more than &#163;4,000,000 sterling, so that, on the face of it, it looks as if &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 or more is still owing to the growers. Coming hack for a moment to the position in New South Wales, I believe that less care has been exercised in connexion with the wheat storage there than in the other wheat-producing States of the Commonwealth. I am sorry to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Grahame himself has made statements, before a Royal Commission, which lead one to the conclusion that there is going to be a heavy loss in connexion with the 1916-17 wheat. Farmers have been paid in New South Wales 3s. 3d. per bushel so far, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame</inline> said that, up to the time of the Georgeson sale, 21,000,000 bushels of the 1916-17 wheat had been disposed of at an average of 4s. 3d. per bushel fio.b., leaving a balance of about 11,000,000 bushels, according to the books of the State Wheat Office, still to be sold. With such a definite statement as that, we are able to throw some light upon the real position of the 1916-17 Pool in New South Wales in comparison with the other States and other Pools. At 4s. 3d. per bushel, 21,000,000 bushels will realize &#163;4,462,500. It is not reasonable to assume that in New South Wales we are likely to get more than 4s. net for the balance of 11,000,000 bushels, in view of the fact that it is the refuse of the whole of the Pool. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Now, 11,000,000 bushels at 4s. would amount to &#163;2,200,000, or a total for the 33,000,000 bushels in New South Wales of &#163;6,662,500. There has been advanced to the farmers &#163;4,990,000, and as 32,050,000 bushels at 3s. 3d. amounts to &#163;5,208,125, apparently there is a sum of &#163;218,125 still owing to the farmers in connexion with that Pool. Expenses to 23rd June, 1919, amount to &#163;1,718,000, so that there is against this realization % sum of &#163;6,926,125 altogether, showing a loss on this Pool if all the wheat is saved and sold, of &#163;263,625. But if the Pool is short to the extent of 6,000,000 bushels at 3s. 3d., the loss will be &#163;1,238,625 in New South Wales on the 1916-17 Pool alone. </para>

                            <para>- Of course not, but the Minister should tell the Senate whether or not all the wheat is paid for, and, if not, how much remains, because that sum must be added to the debit of the Pool. The figures, so far as I can thresh them out on the Ministerial statement alone, show that a couple of million of pounds sterling is still owing to the farmers. </para>

                            <para>- I shall go back a moment in order to make my statement clear in this regard. Take, for instance, the &#34; B &#34; Pool, which is three years old. The Federal Wheat Board figures, dated 23rd June, state that there has been paid to the growers, in connexion with the Pool, at the rate of 3s. 3d. per bushel, the sum of &#163;22,163,000. The same statement sets out that of this crop there were 13S,275,000 bushels in the Pool. This number, multiplied by 3s. 3d., will give &#163;22,469,687. In other words, the Wheat Board say that they have paid to the growers, in connexion with &#34; B &#34; Pool, a sum of &#163;300,000 less than the growers are entitled to, in view of the number of bushels of wheat in the Pool. This is an illustration of the point I wish to make with respect to the amount of money that is owing to the growers in connexion with their Pool operations. </para>

                            <para>- The Wheat Board figures show that the sum of 3s. 3d. per bushel has been. &#39;paid to the farmers, and why complicate the position by criss-crossing with freight on one crop and not on another? The country is entitled to the most explicit, frank, and straightforward declaration of the wheat position that can possibly be given by the Minister. I hope that he will make such a declaration, after the remarks I have made to-day, because we all know that the care of the wheat is a responsibility of the State Governments, and not of the Federal Government, and the responsibility of the losses is not a responsibility of the Federal Government, but of State officials. I am not here criticising the Minister. </para>

                    <para>Now, as to the farmers&#39; point of view: The farmers rightly claim that the Government commandeered their wheat and that they are not liable for the losses that have occurred. I am sure that, whether we like it or not, there is a controversy looming as to whether the general body of the taxpayers should pay or whether the whole of the loss should be averaged over the four Pools. In this connexion, I should like to refer to an interjection made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking this afternoon. The Minister said that each State will pay its own losses. I understand that an agreement was arrived at some months ago whereby the losses would be pooled over the whole of the operations of the wheat-growers. It is certainly understood in New South Wales that Victorian farmers will very likely have to make up, by the good management in Victoria, the bad management in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>-From the figures I have given in connexion with the Wheat Pool I think we can judge, with a reasonable amount of accuracy, how much the farmers are going to net in connexion with the Government operations. If those figures are followed closely it will be seen that the wheat farmer is not going to average more than 4s. per bushel net, as the expenses already charged, with the losses yet to be adjusted, and the miscellaneous squaring up which will have to be made, will probably double the pre-war cost of putting the wheat from the country station f.o.b. the ship. Although, in my opinion, the average selling price is likely to be 5s. per bushel throughout the whole of the Government&#39;s activities, the farmer is not going to get more than 4s. of this amount. </para>

He laid before us the increasing cost of wheat-growing, and placed before the Senate a good many statements to indicate the hard lot of the wheat farmer in many parts of Australia; We know that the average crop during the last ten years has been only about 12 bushels per acre, and if the farmer does not get more than 4s. per bushel he -cannot average a gross return of more than &#163;2 8s. per acre as the result of his exertions. There has been some inquiry into the cost of wheat-growing in New South Wales. I am not quite sure whether it is official or not, but one of the conclusions come to in connexion with that inquiry was, that the cost of wheat-growing to-day is, approximately, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per acre. Therefore, if in war time the Australian farmer is only going to get an average return of &#163;2 8s. per acre of wheat that he sows, and this is going to cost him &#163;2 per acre to grow, there does not seem to be very much encouragement for wheat-farming, and it is no wonder that nearly, 4,000,000 acres have gone out of cultivation for wheat since the beginning of the war. I think that fact is very eloquent testimony to the hard luck of the farmers. </para>

                            <para>- No personal reflection upon the Minister is intended. I think he will realize that the wheat position  is  an extremely complicated one to the ordinary man, and that it is almost impossible for him to figure out what the owners will eventually get for their wheat unless some help in the matter is given by those of us who have tried to understand the position, and some further assistance is given by the Minister himself. I trust that I have his assurance that he will endeavour to clear up the position and face it. I repeat that the losses that have been incurred in wheat stacking and by State administrative control are no responsibilities of his. I am sorry that he did not face the position some two years ago. I think that if he had done so a good deal of friction might have been avoided and much dissatisfaction prevented. I trust that as a result of the observations that have been made to-day the Minister will be as frank as he can with the country in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- Looking abroad, what do the farmers say? They read that the Government of the United States of America guaranteed their wheat farmers last year 9s. 2d. per bushel for all the wheat they grew, that that crop was marketed at little or no loss to the country, and that the same guarantee is being given by the Government of the United States of America this year of a further 9s. 2d. per bushel for all the wheat that the farmers of that country can grow. They read, also, that the British Government have guaranteed their farmers 9s. per bushel, and that the Canadian Government have guaranteed farmers in Canada 8s. 4d. per bushel for their crop. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> tha&#39;t when the Australian farmer reads of these conditions prevailing in other Dominions and other countries he is rightly critical of the amount he nets for his crop. </para>

I have given some little attention to this phase of the matter, but I am driven&#39; to conclusions other than those arrived at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> One of the conclusions to which I am driven is that the sum of &#163;1,000,000 per day approximately that was collected by the British Government in excess profit taxation has been collected from a hundred different sources all over the world, and that the Australian farmer has practically paid some of it. Wheat freights vary, and I believe the rate to-day is &#163;5 per ton to Falmouth. According to a statement made by the Prime Minister wheat freights have been as high as &#163;11 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- Every &#163;1 per ton in freight means about 6&#163;d. per bushel. If a war-time freight from Australia to Europe, including shipowners profit, is set down at, say, &#163;3 per ton it is evident that the British Government did, or should have collected from 60 to SO per cent, of the abnormal profit, which was the difference between &#163;3 and the freight actually charged. If the average of excess profit was anything from &#163;2 to &#163;6 per ton - the British Government would be entitled to at least 30s. to &#163;4 per ton under their excess war-time profits tax, which would represent from a minimum of 9fd. to a maximum of nearly 2s. 6d. on every bushel of Australian wheat shipped abroad during war time. </para>

                            <para>- To some extent it would. The abnormal profit over and above &#163;3 per ton, basing freight on &#163;5 to &#163;11 per ton, was anything from &#163;2 to &#163;8 per ton. If the British Government, under their excess war-time profits tax, took 60 to SO per cent, of the increase it is clearly seen that they have received out of the freights paid to convey Australian wheat to Europe, sums amounting to from 30s. to &#163;6 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- No, the British Government received an excess profit of anything from 6d. to 3s. per bushel on our wheat.

                            <para>- I am not touching that point just now. The Australian farmer admittedly sold at a low price compared with the world&#39;s parity. As I have mentioned, the British consumer did not receive very much benefit, and the freights mentioned had to be added to the price obtained by the Australian Wheat Board, f.o.b. Australia, or its wheat sold and shipped at that freight. Under any circumstances, even at the highest rate of freight, Australian wheat was the cheapest delivered to Great Britain at c.i.f. prices, as the New World growers obtained 9s., 10s., Ils., and 12s. per bushel for their product. The British consumer did not derive much benefit directly, but a good deal of the profits went indirectly into the British coffers as war taxation. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made to the Australian Government&#39;s line of  steam-ships  and its effect on freights. I have already mentioned that the responsibility in connexion with the loss on the Pools is not the responsibility of the Federal Government, but is clearly the responsibility of the various States. The farmer feels that he has been harshly dealt with, and according to a statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, their losses will not be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue nor out of the taxpayers&#39; pockets as a whole. The farmers are being asked a high price for next season&#39;s cornsacks - at least 5d. per bushel. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> admits that the Australian farmers have contributed to the British war-time profits, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prothero,</inline> the Minister of the Board of Agriculture, has also alluded to the patriotism of the Australian farmers. We should all face the position squarely, and do something for them. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest, in view of the greatly increased cost of the production, the probable increase in the world&#39;s shipping during the next two or three years, and the statements made in connexion with the starving millions of Europe, that the Government should see that the Australian farmers, who have had so much bad luck in having sold war wheat at peace prices, should have a guarantee of at least 5s. per bushel at country stations for the next three years. We have come to the point when we have to realize that wheat growing is not being undertaken as extensively as previously. Instead of the Government hesitating to guarantee 4s. for the coming season - without running any risk - they should face the position, and try to make up these losses and resuscitate such an important industry. This can be done at little risk, and it will stabilize the position. It will enable the farmer to know what he is to receive as a minimum for the next three years. The Government would incur little risk, and such action would give the primary producers of Australia some security. </para>

                    <para>On the whole, I think we can support this measure, although I give it my support with some reluctance. I believe the Government are committed, and we are, therefore, in honour bound to carry out those commitments. I do not at all agree with this &#34; Made-in-Germany &#34; idea of State organization and control of everything. In normal times private enterprise should have full control of all commercial undertakings. I am opposed to centripetal force as we have it today, with a Minister standing on a rostrum, controlling our producers and manufacturers. I do not believe in one man controlling the affairs of others simply by pushing a button and telling them what to do, as well as exercising the power to veto. Now the war is over, I do not favour the Government going too far with these nostrums. We have all been through a difficult time, and I believe the experience of the world has been that individual enterprise, if allowed to follow reasonab&#39;e lines, will be more successful in developing our country, and will act generally in the best interests of the producers. </para>

The Anglo-Saxon temperament will not stand it, as we are a peculiarly constituted people. I hope the Government will, as they have commenced to do by the repeal of the War Precautions Regulations, allow trade and commerce to return into fair and reasonable channels, and that they will not attempt, in this National Parliament, to obtain control over everything from Port Darwin to Cape Leeuwin, and from Cape York to Cape Otway. </para>

                        <para>. - Unlike the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat, I favour State control, as I believe it is a step in the right direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said that the Anglo-Saxon people would not take kindly to such control, but during the most trying period of our national history it was found necessary, and availed of even in Great Britain in connexion with almost everything. The Government seek to continue a state of affairs which held sway during the war period, and the question has been raised whether they have the constitutional power to continue such control. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in speaking in another place seemed to be quite satisfied that the Government have the power, and if they have it in regard to the five commodities dealt with in the Bill, they must have similar power in regard to other commodities, especially the necessaries of life. The Government therefore will be guilty of inconsistency - having exercised&#39; control for varying periods over the five commodities mentioned - if they do not continue to regulate prices and control supplies. If the Government have not the power, I do not think that, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the matter will be brought before the Courts. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, so far as the lay- man can judge, there is at least some doubt in the matter. But I am not afraid that the action of the Government in this direction will be challenged, because 1 believe there is an implied understanding of some kind. If a Labour Government were in office, and were endeavouring to secure the powers provided in this Bill, we know that the whole matter will be fought out in the highest Court of the land. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government proposes to continue legislation of the kind we are discussing, it will be well not to embody so many separate and important subjects within the one measure. It has been amply demonstrated to-day that it is impossible for any individual to deliver, within the time limit, a speech fully dealing with the whole matter contained within this Bill. It has been truly stated that the. measure consists of five Bills in one. </para>

                    <para>Having listened to two- excellent speeches on the subject of wheat, I propose to refer to that part of the Bill having relation to the sugar industry. The growing of sugar has been keenly, harshly, and unwarrantably criticised by people in the southern States. We have heard for years a cry for cheap sugar. Sugar in Australia during the past four years has been purchasable at a lower price than in any other country in the world. It was at one time claimed on behalf of Queensland, and with every justification, that the measure of protection which bad been afforded the sugar industry had been amply justified by the extent of direct settlement brought about in the north of that State; that the trade created, and the revenue maintained by the industry, had fully repaid the people of Australia for the degree of protection&#39; granted. We can say to-day, however, that the degree of protection hitherto accorded to the Queensland sugar industry has been fully repaid to Australia&#39;s citizens during the war. Had we been dependent upon supplies from outside sources, we would have had to pay more than double the ruling rates for our sugar. People concerned in the dried fruit and jam-making industries have been among the most conspicuous in raising the cry for cheaper sugar; but they have failed to mention that their own industries are very highly protected; more highly, indeed, than the sugar industry. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so ! The jam-makers have contended that the commodity which they manufacture comprises equal parts of fruit and sugar. It is generally admitted, however, that in a prolific fruit season considerably more than half of the jam manufactured consists of fruit. During the first year of the war, the cost of Australian sugar was kept down by price-fixing operations in the southern States. The price was maintained at a lower level than had existed in the five years prior to the outbreak of war. That was a ridiculous condition of affairs, but it was continued for twelve or fifteen months, until the Premier of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> after consultation with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> introduced what is known as the famous Sugar Acquisition Act. He commandeered the Queensland  sugar crop, and, under agreement with the Commonwealth Government, sold it at &#163;18 per ton as raw sugar. There was, of course, a great outcry; but the former price of &#163;14 a ton for the raw commodity was unwarrantably low. The people of Queensland had had every justification for seeking an advance in the quotation for raw sugar, quite apart from the circumstances arising from the outbreak of war. When the quotation was raised to &#163;18 a ton, the sugar industry employees were working under what is known as the McNaughton award; and the raw sugar price was satisfactory. Those  conditions were maintained throughout the 1916 crop operations, and into those dealing with the 1917 crop when the famous Dickson award was made. That fixed an advanced rate of wages, and the increase was not unwarranted. Eight years ago, the wages paid in the sugar industry were as low as 25s. a week. </para>

                            <para>- The employers, at any rate, would not discuss whether the rate should or should not be 5s. a day. The next step was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> as Minister for Trade and Customs, when he issued regulations providing for the payment of1s. per hour. Of course, there was another howl. The McNaughton award constituted an advance upon that rate, while the Dickson award provided a still further increase. At a selling price of &#163;18 a ton for raw sugar it was found impossible to  pay the rates set out in the Dickson award. The plea for an advance in the selling price could not be combated. About that time a conference of sugar-growers was called by the Queensland Government to ascertain what the growers considered a fair price for raw sugar at which they could pay the rates under the Dickson award. The estimate varied from &#163;22 10s. to about &#163;25 a ton. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> at that time was in Melbourne with the secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers Association <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pritchard).</inline> Those gentlemen interviewed the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I understand that they put a proposal before him to the effect that the sugar-growers would agree to the purchase of their crop at &#163;22 7s. per ton for raw sugar, with a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> in the form of an assurance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that the crop for that year, namely, 1917, would be harvested by industrial operations conducted under the protection of the War Precautions Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> undertook that if any trouble occurred in Queensland the Prime Ministerwould introduce a regulation under the War Precautions Act to insure that the crop was taken off. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not indicate from what source he proposed to secure the labour. He did not mention whether it would comprise more of his Maltese importations, whether it would consist of Japanese labourers, or whether advantage would be taken of the compulsory services of men employed in home service duties. The source of that labour was known, apparently, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> alone, but he gave the assurance that the Queensland crop would be taken off. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. When those representations on behalf of the Sugar Producers Association were being made, Mr.Hughes announced in the House of Representatives that the Commonwealth Government was about to- purchase the crop that year at &#163;22 7s. per ton. The price was generally regarded as being about the minimum, and the announcement was generally well received. However, certain other influences evidently got to work, because that offer never formally reached the Queensland Government. Once the intimation had been made in the House of Representatives, manufacturing interests presumably got busy, and told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> his offer for the raw commodity was too high. Eventually the price was whittled down to &#163;21, and a sort of promise was made that if anything remained over at the close of operations the margin would be divided between the sugar -growers and the manufacturers. I do not think the growers have heard anything about the division since then. That purchase price for raw sugar, as compared with the quotation for refined sugar, has had the undoubted effect of increasing the manufacturers&#39; profits; and under this Bill Parliament is now asked to extend the term of the manufacturers&#39; profit-making. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> offer was made to the Queensland Government it had been reduced to &#163;21 a ton. Even then the proposition was hedged about with most outrageous stipulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> asked that the Queensland Government should undertake and guarantee that during the currency of the agreement, and with respect to succeeding crops - if the agreement were to cover them - there would be no industrial disputes. </para>

                            <para>- Presently I shall point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to something even more preposterous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> asked the Premier of Queensland to give an undertaking either that the waterside workers would not go on strike during the currency of the agreement or that no difficulty would be experienced with them. Obviously the Queensland Premier has no jurisdiction over the waterside workers. That is a Federal matter. It was impossible for him to give any such undertaking. In my opinion, these preposterous suggestions were advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in accordance with his usual method of asking for so much, and allowing a bit of room to come and go upon in a spirit of compromise. When the Queensland Government was compelled to refuse his preposterous request, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said: &#34;Very well, we will meet you half way and give you this.&#34; The Premier of Queensland had then to sign the agreement, because the interests of the Queensland crop imperatively demanded it. The season was wearing on, and a press bombardment was being directed against him on account of his delay in signing the agreement, and thus fixing the price of raw sugar. Eventually, when the agreement was signed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> retained what, in my opinion, he meant to retain in the first instance and no more. Here, I may be permitted to inform the Senate that when the Queensland Labour party went to the country in 1915 it did so with a proposal that Cane Prices Boards should be established for the purpose of regulat ing the price of sugar cane. That party was returned triumphantly, and during the first session of the next Parliament, it passed a measure called &#34;An Act for the Regulation of Sugar Cane Prices.&#34; My Queensland colleagues will admit that the operation of that Statute has proved most beneficial to the sugar-growers in that State. One of the most baneful effects of the bounty system in connexion with the sugar industry was that it aimed at the production of a high tonnage irrespective of the sugar contents of the cane. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that if we had to sell our cane by weight any one of us would naturally grow the particular species of cane that would produce the greatest tonnage. That was an evil of the bounty system. The Cane Prices Boards have encouraged the cultivation of a cane of higher density, and with a better sugar content, with the result that the cane farmer has not now to produce so high a tonnage in order to obtain the same amount of money. Thus the Act has been of mutual advantage to the grower and the miller. </para>

                            <para>- The consumer hardly comes in there. In addition, it is safe to say that the operation of these Boards has resulted in a. general increase to the sugar-grower of about 9s. per ton of cane. When this particular legislation was enacted at the instance of the Labour Government of Queensland, it was naturally expected that the sugar interests would welcome it. As a matter of fact, the growers did, but the millers did not. The proprietary mills were up against it immediately, and they sought to evade its provisions in every possible way. The Court records of Queensland are liberally bespattered with the prosecutions of mills, because they failed to carry out the awards, and thus sought .to defeat the will of Parliament. One of these Court cases eventually reached the Privy Council on appeal. In this particular prosecution, which originated in the Bundaberg district, the District Court Judge gave his judgment in favour of the action of the Government. The Supreme Court of Queensland upset that judgment, and its decision was in turn reversed by the full bench&#39; of the Supreme Court of that State. The milling authorities then appealed to the High Court, which not only turned down the Act, but in doing so gave a unanimous judgment - an exceedingly rar&#169; occurrence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> then took the case to the Privy Council, which upset the decision of the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- And so it should be. I trust that in the not distant future we shall get brighter intellects on the benches of all the Courts of Australia and a few younger men. I have mentioned this matter because the proprietary mills in Queensland have endeavoured by other methods to nullify the effects of this beneficent legislation. I recollect the occasion when the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s mill refused admission to the check chemists whose services were necessary to check the density of the cane which was being operated upon. When the Government made it compulsory for the company to admit these chemists, one would naturally have thought that the difficulty was at an end. But when the price was increased to &#163;21 per ton - that was the price which the milling interests demanded of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - he, at their dictation, forced it upon the Queensland Government. When the regulation of the Sugar Cane Prices Act was amended to overcome this opposition to the Cane Prices Board, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company discovered a loop-hole by which it could evade its legal responsibilities. Honorable senators will, I think, be surprised when I show them the extent to which this monopoly is prepared to go in order to achieve its ends and to obtain an advantage for itself in spite of the law.

                    <para class="block">One would think that the position there was most explicitly stated. It is plainly set out that sugar cane sold to the mills, and paid for, shall be subject to the operation of that Act. . But the Colonial Sugar Refining Company saw a means of evading the Statute. Section 6 provides only for the sale to the mills of sugar cane by a grower. Nobody would expect that any person but a grower would sell sugar cane to the mills. But the Colonial Sugar Refining Company either persuaded or coerced growers who supplied their mills not to sell the sugar cane direct to those mills, but to sell it to one of their staff in Sydney. Thus, John Smith purchased the cane, and sent it to their mills, with the result that the (provisions of the Act were defeated. That illustrates the depth to which high commercialism in Australia is prepared to descend. At the present time there are many districts in Queensland in which numbers of cane farmers are unable to take advantage of an Act which has been passed for their special benefit, and which is operating to such good purpose in other districts of that State. That the growers are behind the retention of the regulation of the Sugar Cane Prices Act was shown by the result of the election in 1918, when the Ryan Government were returned to power with a greater majority than ever. Under the agreement embodied in the Bill which is now before us, we are asked to continue till the 30th September a stipulation which prohibits the operation of the regulation of the Sugar Cane Prices Act in certain districts in Queensland. I shall endeavour to show how that result is brought about. Part 4 of the Bill is very brief. In fact, the whole proposal relating to the sugar industry, which, I suppose, is, roughly worth &#39; no less than &#163;7,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 annually to Australia, consists of only one clause, containing three sub-clauses and covering about eleven lines.

                    <para class="block">That does not appear to contain anything of a very drastic nature. But if we turn to the preamble of the measure, it will be observed that, owing to the following up of the conditions which operated during the war period, it has been found necessary, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia;</inline> to ratify an agreement with the State of Queensland for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the raw sugar produced in that State during the seasons 1918 and 1919..

                    <para class="block">The agreement expressly, forbids any legislative or Executive interference by the Queensland. Government with the conditions that existed in May, 1918. I know it has been stated repeatedly in the press, and, no doubt, I shall be told here, that that provision was inserted so as to avoid&#39; industrial legislation varying the nature of the award during the currency of the agreement. That was the reason given to the newspapers, but the real reason was to prevent the Queensland Government from amending the Sugar. Cane Prices Board -Act, in order to compel the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s mills&#39; to buy their cane sugar from the growers instead of through an official in the Sydney office, who thus comes in as an intermediary. The Queensland Government desired to amend their legislation in - the direction indicated, and Colonial Sugar Refining Company growers wanted an amendment, but, unfortunately, have been prevented by this agreement, which will be ratified in the Bill now under consideration, so that the Queensland Government will not be permitted to continue its sugar policy. This is wholly wrong, and honorable senators should know the real position when they are asked to agree to the proposal. We hear a great deal about the necessity for increased production, now that the war is over, but it seems strange that encouragement is not to be given to primary producers in that part of Queensland which most urgently requires development. The restrictions which have been operating for the past couple of years will continue to operate until the Commonwealth inform the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that they must treat the sugar-growers in their districts in a manner similar to the treatment accorded to growers served by other mills throughout the State. </para>

                            <para>- If Colonial Sugar Refining Company growers are prepared to enter into an agreement with the company, it suggests, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins remarked in Court the other day in regard to another case, that some other influences have been at work. It may be regarded as pretty good evidence of the operation of coercive influences, and so I accept, with some reservation; any speeches made, or petitions signed, by growers in districts controlled by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

                            <para>- Then why is it being embodied in the present agreement ? It is well known and generally admitted that the trend of sugar cultivation in Queensland is northward, into the tropical regions of the State. With exception of Nambour, Bundaberg, and Childers districts, the disposition is to extend cultivation into the more northern parts of the State, where the density is higher and the ground new, and where the crops are so prolific as to treble the capacity of the mills. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> will agree with me that mills like the Invicta, if erected in such places as the Stone River, Tully River, Daintree River, and as far north as Bloomfield River, could be worked to two or three times their present capacity. </para>

They are obliged to sell their cane to an official in Sydney, instead of to the mills, and thus, by means of a third person, the award of the Cane Prices Board is evaded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> who took a prominent part in a quiet way in endeavouring to have the sugar industry carried on under regulations of the War Precautions Act, knows all this.

                    <para>When the selling price of raw sugar was &#163;14 per ton, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company always had a margin of &#163;6 per ton between the prices for raw and A1 refined, but when the price of raw sugar was raised to &#163;18 per ton in 1915, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company advanced the price of refined sugar to &#163;25 10s., increasing the margin by 30s. per ton. Subsequently, when the price for raw sugar was raised to &#163;21, refined sugar became &#163;29 5s., the margin being &#163;8 5s. It is fair to ask what becomes of that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 5s., which represents a margin twice as great as the margin in Europe under the Cartel system, and three times the margin allowed in America. Under the agreement which the Minister was good enough to show me, provision is made for a number of charges. </para>

He is in a position to enlighten the Senate on the subject. I point out that the cost of packing syrup is paid for ; the cost of the packages is paid for ; the cost of refining and shipping are paid for; and there is a selling charge of 7s. per ton; and I want to know why, on the top of all this, there should be a managing charge of &#163;1 per ton. It does seem strange to me that when the several charges for the work performed by the company are set out in the agreement, there should also be provision made for a managing charge. </para>

                    <para>There is a belief generally held that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is getting far too much out of the business under the control of the Government. I believe that the consumers of Australia are not hardly dealt with when they can purchase Al refined sugar at 3&#189;d. per lb. In normal times, quite apart from war time, the consumer would be doing fairly well in obtaining Al refined sugar at that price. But there is a section of the community that, in my opinion, is somewhat harshly dealt with, though not as harshly as were the cane-growers prior to the increased prices fixed for cane. Under the old conditions the grower had to take whatever the miller or refiner was willing to give him. Since he has had the assistance of the Cane Prices Boards his position has been improved. I do not think that the retailer of sugar is now getting quite as fair a deal as he is entitled to. I think that a little more might be taken from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and given to the retailer.I do not swallow all the circulars that we have received from the Victorian Grocers Association and similar bodies, but, having looked into the matter, I think that the retailer is not now allowed a sufficient margin to enable him to make a fair profit from his operations in the sale of sugar. I believe that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, as the refining monopoly, is still getting too much out of the business. </para>

                            <para>- I look at the balance-sheets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and find that every year their profits run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is not a question of what I consider a fair profit, but of the profit which the company makes and distributes every six months. That is where the shoe pinches. </para>

I very much regret that when representations were being made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> -the recommendations of the combined growers of Queensland made to the Premier of that State and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lennon</inline> were not brought before him. It was said that they made a demand for &#163;25 per ton, but I think that, on good grounds, what they asked for was &#163;23 or &#163;22 10s. per <inline font-style="italic">ton.</inline> The representations, which, presumably, were made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> through some occult source, and induced him to say that he would not allow &#163;22 7s., but only &#163;21, per ton, were not in the best interests of the sugar-growers of Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- That is worth knowing. In normal times we hope that, with the development of the industry, the bogy of over-production referred to in the agreement will not be regarded seriously. There have, I think, been only three years in the history of the industry in Australia in which the production, overtook the consumption. In the circumstances, when we see a statement in an agreement between two Governments suggesting a fear of over-production, it makes us a little suspicious, and inclined to think that some persons were looking for an excuse on which to base their opposition to development at the hands of the Queensland Government. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has intimated, the provision preventing the development of sugar factories has been waived by the Government, and I can, therefore, with every justification, ask the Minister to excise it from the agreement, so that when we pass this Bill embodying the agreement we shall not be perpetuating that hindrance to the development of this very important industry in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - The debate on the Commercial Activities Bill presents two important features; first, the limitation of its scope, and, secondly, the limitation of speeches recently adopted by the Senate. </para>

                    <para class="block">It has already been discovered by those who have dealt with this subject that they were not able, within the limited time at their disposal, to fully express their opinions. The Bill gives certain powers, or assumes certain powers, to legislate in the direction of controlling dairy produce, sugar, wool, flax, and whea&#39;t. If this Parliament now has power to legislate in the direction indicated in the Bill, it has had that power all along. I understand the Government are fortified in their action in introducing this measure by the advice of certain legal gentlemen, and I believe the opinions expressed by those gentlemen are unanimous. I am not a lawyer, but I dare say that when this measure becomes law it is quite within the realms of possibility that a test case will be brought in the High Court, and that its provisions will be found, to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> One of the legal advisers of the Government in this connexion may become a Justice of the High Court of Australia, and in that capacity may be called upon to interpret the Constitution of the Commonwealth. The constitutional aspect of this matter appeals to me. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. These contracts were entered into under the War Precautions Act, which will expire within a certain time by a mandate of this Parliament, but this Bill is to continue some of its provisions after the Act has expired. The War Precautions Act in itself is all-powerful. It is an absorbing and comprehensive measure, but when that awful Act dies, the extraordinary powers vested in the Government, and the contracts referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> must necessarily die with it. The War Precautions Act has been responsible for many glaring acts of maladministration, and under its protection our liberties have been suppressed. I fail to see how we can perpetuate its provisions by a- Bill such as this, which provides that the price of dairy produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat may be fixed until 1920. What is to prevent us fixing the price of these particular commodities for fifty years hence? I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill if be will point out to the Senate what section of the Constitution permits this Parliament to fix the price of, say, butter or sugar, and forbids Parliament fixing the price of any other commodity. Pricefixing has &#39;rt very important bearing on this particular Bill, and one would naturally like to know why we cannot go farther and fix the price of every commodity in general use throughout Australia. If we have the constitutional power to fix the price of butter and sugar, surely we have the power to fix the price of other articles. While the price of certain articles is to bo regulated, and the profiteer is to be held in check, he is to be allowed to run rampant in other directions. Why not fix the price of meat? </para>

                            <para>- To-day the cool stores of Australia are packed with. meat from floor to ceiling, and we are paying more for meat in  Australia  than is being paid for similar meat after exportation to Great Britain. The food exploiter is abroad in every way, and I shall quote one or two instances in support of my statement. Price-fixing was established during war-time by this Parliament, but no sooner had the Armistice been signed than the Price-fixing Board was abolished. High prices are still ruling, and so much so that at present we are in a state of industrial turmoil. Many charges have been made against the seamen who are endeavouring to improve their conditions of employment. As a result of their ceasing work, other industries have been held up, but I am surprised that even a greater number of workmen in Australia have not revolted against the prevailing conditions. The cost of living in Australia is so great that it is impossible for many to meet it, and I am surprised that the workmen engaged in other industries have not acted similarly. The seamen have been upbraided with not going to the Arbitration Court, but there are people in Australia who have increased the prices of butter, sugar, and other commodities without reference to any tribunal. Here is a quotation showing the profits received by the shipping companies during the war. There was no submission of their case to arbitration. The particulars are given under the heading of &#34; Shipping Sharks. Millions Yearly from Excessive Charges. Shipping Companies&#39; Profits.&#34; </para>

                    <para>In connexion with the seamen&#39;s strike it is interesting to note what profits the shipping companies have made during the war period. That is in relation, of course, to their plea that they cannot concede the men&#39;s demands, and with respect to their action in raising fares and freight, in some cases, already. I have been asked more than once in this chamber to give the names and particulars of the companies. They are as follows: - Adelaide </para>

                    <para>This Bill might have gone further than it seeks to do, for while sugar and dairy produce are important factors of domestic expenditure, it must be admitted that the present industrial dispute has not been the cause of the vastly increased cost of living. Prices in practically every direction were rising by leaps and bounds, and had there been no seamen&#39;s dispute there would still have been increases. If we are to legislate in respect to commercial activities at all, we should &#34; go the whole hog.&#34; Only one Government in the whole of Australia has endeavoured to grapple with the situation. In Queensland to-day there is a Bill before the Parliament having reference to all the domestic necessities of the people. </para>

In 1919 the net profits had risen to &#163;561,136. Shares in subsidiary companies represented &#163;4,769,470. The capital of that company totals &#163;5,254,000. During the year in which it was stated that that company would have to close its doors if an increase in the price of its manufactures was not made, the concern showed a net profit of more than &#163;561,000. </para>

For the same company, trading as the Fiji and New Zealand Company, the year&#39;s profits amounted to &#163;288,081. This latter company, although it has been in existence for less than three years, has loans and  investments  in other companies amounting to &#163;1,690,724.

                            <para>- Only in one or two instances. What happened in those instances, however, is as nothing compared with what has happened since the repeal of the price-fixing regulations. I come now to the question of rents. We all know that the Inter-State Commission has inquired, amongst other things, into such matters as rent, clothing, groceries, meat, &#38;c. Kent is at the base of&#39; the increased cost of living; and whilst this Parliament may not have the power to deal with the matters now under consideration, the State Parliaments have this authority. The Government of Victoria have appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into these matters, but I am afraid it is a case of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. I will vote for the second reading of the measure, though I do not think it is constitutional. The Government could have introduced a more comprehensive Bill dealing generally with the cost of living, and trusted to the constitutionality of their position. It was, I think, wisely said by the honorable senator who preceded me, that if any person decided to test the constitutionality of this measure before the High Court, that tribunal would declare it to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline></para>

                                when moving the second reading of the Repatriation Bill, observed that he&#39; was travelling over an uncharted sea. The Government, in the Bill now under consideration, feeling no doubt that they were also about to set out on an uncharted sea, sought advice from certain legal gentlemen in Sydney as to whether the measure would be constitutional. Perhaps, a few months hence, a test case will be brought before the High Court, and some of those gentlemen may be found holding briefs to test the constitutionality of the Bill.

                                has suggested that the State Governments should have been consulted. There was no need to do that, as the State Parliaments have sovereign rights in a matter like this.

                        <para>. - This measure, which deals with four articles of primary production, and one the result of manufacturing, raises three interesting questions. The first is the validity of the arrangement entered into during the war period by virtue of the war power, which might reasonably be considered as being validly projected into a period after the termination of war. I do not think any honorable senator, irrespective of party considerations, would be against the carrying out of an agreement, valid in spirit and almost certainly valid in the letter. The second question to which I refer is whether the people who are actively engaged in producing articles that come within the scope of this Bill are satisfied with the continuance of Government control. The third question, and to me one of equal interest with the other two. is whether certain features of the Bill are, by virtue of our Constitution, valid. It seems to me it cannot be clearly demonstrated that every provision of this measure deals with an agreement which can be considered as projecting its operation into a period after hostilities have legally terminated, that is to say, after the Peace Treat-&#34; has been properly ratified. I will not deal with the agreement phase of the question at all, because I am altogether in favour of agreements being carried out. That seems to be so evidently sound that further argument is unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- It is in connexion with this re-enactment of agreements that I propose to make some remarks. Certain incongruities appear in statements made respecting the satisfaction of certain classes of Australian producers with the proposed extension of Government supervision. We have been told that it is highly desirable, in the interests of the wheat-growers, to continue this form of Government cpntrol; but certain honorable senators, speaking ostensibly, and, indeed, actually, in the interests of wheatgrowers, have pointed out the serious disabilities under which those producers labour because of the existence of Government control. The one statement is certainly not compatible with the other. We have been told that our wheat-growers have suffered because they have been paid less than the world&#39;s parity for their produce. If that is so - and that is the condition arising out of this form of control - the principle itself is operating inimically to the producers of wheat. In regard to flax, wool, and the exportable surplus of our dairy produce, there are agreements for sale to the Imperial Government; and at the risk of re-stating what I have already said, I repeat that all agreements for sale to the Imperial Government, made during the currency of the war, should be carried out for the full term of their validity, and therefore there can be no doubt as to the desirability of enumerating them in the Bill. But whether, under the Australian Constitution, the projection or extension of these agreements into a period following the ratification of peace is valid, and whether legislation with regard to these agreements is within the competency of this Legislature, is quite a different matter. In the preamble of the Bill there appears the statement that, &#34; whereas the conditions brought about by the war are still operating.&#34; That is an assertion.. It may not be a fact. An assertion by this Parliament of the .existence of a certain condition is not in itself sufficient to make an enactment, based upon it. constitutionally valid. I do not admit that the conditions brought about by the state of war are operating in Australia. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the constitutional phase of the Bill, beyond all doubt, there is every reason for grave consideration as to _ whether it is &#39;within the competency of this Parliament to do anything, in the way of re-enactment, after the ratification of the Peace terras. I have expressed the view that it is not within the competency of this Parliament to enact war legislation after peace has been legally arrived at, and I am not going to be inconsistent in my attitude towards this Bill. I say that anything in it that savours of a new enactment, with the intention of projecting its operation into the period after peace has been arrived at, is unconstitutional. I do not for a moment admit it is desirable that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to legislate in this direction. I am going to object strenuously to any proposed extension of the powers of this Parliament for a long time to come, because anything that is sought to be done under this Bill can constitutionally and easily be performed with the consent of the States of the Commonwealth - a consent which I believe would readily be given if asked for. </para>

The Federal Government may consult eminent legal talent, all of which may eventually reach the High Court Bench or none of which may reach that Bench. But, still, a legal gentleman may pronounce an opinion which, as a High Court Judge, he would not indorse for a moment. Every one who has any knowledge of lawyers will agree that a lawyer giving an opinion and a Judge giving a decision are totally different individuals. The High Court of the Commonwealth has very properly shown itself to be very jealous of the rights of the States under the Federal Constitution. It will not read any power into the Federal Constitution merely to satisfy the desire of the Commonwealth Parliament. As the authority in the last resort, designed for that purpose, it will construe the Constitution with a proper and jealous regard for the rights of the States. </para>

They might thus rapidly have obtained from them a consent, which they would not withhold, I feel sure, if it were clearly demonstrated that a clearing-up measure was required, because we still are, technically, in a state of war, and that this state subsists between the time of the declaration of peace and the ratification of the Peace Treaty. </para>

                    <para>In order to be consistent - although consistency is not in itself such a great virtue, as some people assume it to be; and I give it its full value - I say that I do not view with anything but misgiving these constant endeavours to trench upon the constitutional powers of the States. What may have been good medicine for the nation during the war period should not be made its daily bread after peace has arrived. It does not at all follow that because a thing is necessary in time of war it is necessary in time of peace. We agreed under the War Precautions Act, by virtue of the war power of the Commonwealth Parliament, to practically suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. &#39; Every one is aware of the decision of the High Court. Judges to the effect that the Minister concerned might arrest and intern any one without giving any reason for his action. If that was not a practical suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act I want to know what would be so regarded. But no one will contend that in time of peace the Habeas Corpus Act should be suspended. .1 should be very sorry, as one who has profited by the tradition of British liberty, and who is here by virtue of that glorious tradition, to consent to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in time of peace. </para>
                    <para>Because we consented, for instance, to the price of sugar being fixed in time of war, it does not at all follow that we should consent to the projection of that power to fix the price of sugar, by a possible straining of the powers of this Parliament, into a time of peace. As honorable senators are aware, I objected very voluminously - I do not know with what effect, or with what degree of legal force, though I believe that, if the matter were tried, the position I took up would be held to be legally sound - to the projection of the War Precautions Act into a time of peace. I held that to be constitutionally invalid, and I believe that any attempt to do anything of the sort in this measure will also be invalid as being beyond our competency. </para>
                    <para>The recapitulation of the agreements in this, measure, although perhaps not unnecessary, do not add to their validity. If they are valid agreements they are Valid without inclusion in this measure. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is an exceptionally precarious position for this Legislature to take up, that it is competent for it to extend into a period of peace agreements which were of admitted validity during the time of war. I do not care if every lawyer in the Commonwealth has said it can be done, I have still my doubts whether the High Court Bench would give a similar decision. </para>

                        took up a most remarkable position. He wanted to know why, if by virtue of the war power government control had been established over the commodities enumerated in this Bill, the whole gamut of national activity should not be within the scope of this measure. He denounced the exorbitant prices of commodities of prime necessity, yet the honorable senator could not point out that any of the articles mentioned in this Bill were being sold at an exorbitant price. If dairy produce is being sold at an exorbitant price in Australia, that, in the circumstances, does not exhibit the virtue of government control. If wheat is being sold at prices unsatisfactory to the wheat producers of Australia that does not indicate virtue in government control. If sugar is being forcibly sold, so to speak, by virtue of this agreement at prices which constrain the sugar producers in Queensland to accept half the price which sugar is bringing in the outside world, it is questionable whether that is a good thing for the sugar producers of Queensland. I represent a State in which sugar is not produced. The people of Tasmania  would like to be able to obtain sugar very cheaply, because it is necessary for the manufacture of jam, which is made from the small fruits, of which Tasmania is prolific. But, speaking as a member of the Senate, I do not hope for high prices for Tasmanian products and low prices for the products of Queensland. If the sugar producers of Queensland could get twice what they are getting for sugar now, I believe they would be entitled to do so. If they are constrained, at the present moment to sell sugar at a price which represents only 60 per cent, of the price obtained for uncontrolled sugar in other parts of the world, that would appear to be a bad  thing for them. If, at the present time, they are satisfied to sell their sugar at a reduction of 40 per cent, on the world&#39;6 prices, because at times they secure from the Australian Government, by, virtue of certain arrangements, a price for sugar a little higher than the world&#39;s price in normal times, that is their own business. But it does not at all follow that an agreement of this kind is a good thing for them. I should like to hear one of the representatives of the sugar industry in the Senate tell us that the sugar producers of Queensland are altogether in favour of this arrangement, and of its continuation.

                    <para>Such an agreement, valid under the exercise of the war power by this Parliament and by the Federal Government, must be carried out; but any projection of it into a period beyond the ratification of the Peace Treaty should not be attempted by this Parliament unless the sugar producers of Queensland are satisfied with the proposed arrangement. </para>

My butcher was charging me ls. per lb. for rump steak, as good as could be obtained anywhere, and yet, when the price was fixed, he was able to charge me ls. 3d. per lb. A measure intended to prevent any increase in the price of a commodity permitted him to charge me ls. 3d. per lb. I do not like this price-fixing business. </para>

                            <para>- My experience of it is that it tends to check the production of commodities. We passed a measure here called the War-time Profits Bill. I am glad to say that I washed my hands of it, because a more pernicious measure in regard to the activities of Australia was never enacted. As a result of it, industries were strangled in their infancy by the dozen. I venture to say that if we had put out of our mind all thought of the &#163;1,000,000 or the &#163;2,000,000 of revenue that it was expected we should get under the operation of that measure, we would have derived ten times more benefit from the enterprise of the Australian people in establishing new industries regarding which they had to go cap in hand to the Treasurer. </para>

It has many functions constitutionally conferred upon it which it has not yet exercised, and which provide an ample field for its activity, and. any trespassing upon State rights, to me as a Federalist, is abhorrent. </para>

During the course of the debate I have noticed that frequent references have been made to the War Precautions Act, and honorable senators have blown hot and blown cold concerning its provisions. That Act has come in for a great deal of severe criticism throughout the Commonwealth, but when it is a question of perpetuating certain of its provisions there is a general desire on the part of such critics to welcome the perpetuation, if not an extension, of its provisions. </para>

                            <para>- One follows the other; one is the parent and the other is the offspring. I am not in a position to offer any legal opinion on the constitutionality of the Bill, but, viewing it as an ordinary layman, with ordinary intelligence, I do not see how the contracts in question can be successfully carried out unless this Bill is passed, and the Commonwealth Government possess the authority to see that their side of the bargain is fulfilled. Supposing <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> opinion holds good, and, immediately the Peace Treaty is ratified, the supreme authority of the Commonwealth ceases. If that is so, I am afraid that common sense will not influence a decision of the Supreme Court, if it will come to a similar conclusion. It is impracticable to immediately terminate contracts that have been entered into for war purposes, and it is unreasonable to say that these contracts shall cease to operate when the Peace treaty is ratified. The contracting parties must have some security, mid neither side wishes to be guilty of dishonorable repudiation. There is a vast difference between the Government retaining the power to complete contracts and stepping in with a policy of price-fixing of certain commodities. If the Government have the power to fix the price of, say, sugar, they ought to have the power to fix the price of any other commodities, such as boots, clothes and other necessaries of life. While we may consider it a very useful and necessary measure under present circumstances, there is great doubt as to its constitutionality; but I am not going to withhold  my support on that account. </para>

                    <para>Frequent reference has- been made to the cost of living and the limited powers contained in this measure. Whenever an outcry has arisen in connexion with high prices, I have endeavoured to discover the pros and cons of it, and have come to the conclusion that a good deal has been said that is really unwarranted. In this country at present the cost of living, within certain limitations, is a grievance, but it is not nearly so severe as it is in other countries, and particularly those which have been at war. We realize that the cost of certain commodities is far beyond what the cost of production warrants. Boot leather, woollen goods, grindery, and other raw materials produced in this country have been at a high price, but, as far as other commodities are concerned, I believe the rates charged are entirely beyond the power of any authority in the Commonwealth to either control or reduce. In proof of that, I may mention that in the Western State, in the early stages of the war, the cost of living aroused such, public comment that the Government yielded to the outcry to regulate the cost of living, and appointed a Royal Commission to make inquiries as a preliminary step. That Commission went about its work, and endeavoured to elucidate certain points, but came to the conclusion that there was nothing to discover at that particular time. The result was that the Commission fizzled out, was never resurrected, and no concerted effort was ever made to resurrect it or discover the cause of its abolition. The Australian Labour party was strongly represented on the Commission, but it ended in a fiasco, and has not reported even to this day for the reason stated. </para>
                    <para>Our Queensland friends will realize that while this Bill cannot regulate the cost of living, the Queensland Government, as referred to to-night, in their laudable efforts to settle the question, will never do so effectively until the Commonwealth Government are armed with the  necessary powers. They may as well try to fix the price of commodities in a Melbourne or Sydney suburb at the same rates and expect the whole city area to benefit. The suburb stands in the same relation to a city as a State does to the Commonwealth. The only effective dealing with the cost of living throughout the Commonwealth is by giving the powers required to this Parliament, and making it act through its recognised organ, the Executive Government. </para>
                    <para>It is worth recalling, in connexion with the wheat question, that no effort has been made to fix the price of wheat. I wish the price had been fixed There is no reason why one commodity produced in Australia should have the advantage of a fixed fair price while others are not treated likewise. The wheat-growers are mute and docile producers. </para>

                            <para>- I believe I am right in saying they are sweated more than any other section of the community. As one who has watched the work of the Wheat Pool, since its inception by the Labour party, I am pleased to say that the work of this Pool has materially improved the position of the wheat producers. Before the Wheat Pool came into existence, and when the farmers were subjected to the tender mercies of the men who entered into honorable understandings, the farmer had to sell in the open market at something in the neighbourhood of 2s. 8d. to 2s. l0d. per bushel. Papers circulated in this State made that announcement, and many of us can recall our own experiences. I am pleased to say that since the inception of the Pool, the farmers have obtained a much better price than would have been the case had they been dealing with private firms. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made to the ravages of mice, and I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is not here while I am dealing with that phase of the question. When the Government entered into an agreement with the contracting firms to handle, store, and ship the wheat, it should have been distinctly understood that the firms were to deliver the wheat in good condition. </para>
                    <para class="block">If there be any deficit - we have heard that about 1,000,000 bushels have disappeared mysteriously - these firms, by virtue of the agreement, entered into by the several State Governments and indorsed by the Australian Wheat Board, should be compelled to hand over the full quantity, as they were morally and legally responsible for the deficit. In the Western State, when the wheat was being destroyed by mice, it was the chief concern of the firms handling it to try to escape their obligations under the agreement, &#39;which made them responsible for damage by mice. If the agreement entered into with those firms by the four wheat-producing States is strictly adhered to and rightly interpreted, they should return every bushel received. I do not see why the Commonwealth Government or the farmers should be responsible for the loss. If the firms are not prepared to insure the grain against damage, that is their business and not that of the farmers. </para>
                    <para>Like the previous  speaker,  I think we shall have to look into the question of the sugar agreement and that of price-fixing very carefully. It is only in the case of happenings of an abnormal character that price-fixing is warranted at all. The rates charged here are not the result of anything that has happened in this country. The prices charged for articles produced beyond the Commonwealth have increased from 100 to 300 per cent. and it was a case of either buying them at the high price or not purchasing at all. Many of these articles were used in the manufacture of other articles, and their high cost was reflected in the price of those other articles. I had occasion when last in Western Australia to price ordinary working shirts, and was informed that they were being sold at 7s. l1d. I had one of those shirts. I saw some which were worn out within a fortnight. I took them to the leading draper in Perth, from whom they had been purchased, and I asked what he meant by sending out such material at such a figure. He called for the head of the department concerned, and in my presence asked for an explanation. That individual stated that the shirts had been purchased from a Manchester house at a little over 7s. each, and that the Perth firm&#39;s profit was  only  a matter of pence per shirt. The head of the department added that exactly similar shirts had been sold prior to the war at 2s. lOd. each, and that the firm had made a greater profit upon them while selling at that price than in selling to me at 7s. lid. each. Similar evidence was tendered by the same representative of that Perth firm before the Price-Fixing Commission, which did not complete its labours. I mention that to show that my facts are undoubtedly correct. I have referred to this matter also to demonstrate that a number of articles which constitute the necessaries of life have been purchased outside Australia, and also that material bought outside Australia has commanded prices beyond the  power  of any authority within Australia to regulate. When we talk of the increased cost of living, we should remember that we have been, and are still, suffering from the inevitable consequences of warfare. We in Australia do not know what war is, so far as the increased prices of all things that we eat and drink and wear are concerned. </para>
                    <para>A good deal was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> about the conveyance of wheat.  His  remarks were to the effect that the ships purchased by the Commonwealth Government should have been employed in the carriage of the farmers&#39; wheat on terms lower than the freight rates of other ships plying in competition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must be aware that those Commonwealth vessels came under the automatic supervision of the Comptroller of Shipping in England. There are fixed rates of freight for given distances, all round the world. The Commonwealth shipping authorities are bound to comply with those conditions. I would like to be informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> how he would propose to run the Commonwealth Steamship Line if he intended to charge lower freight rates than shipping firms in competition with the Commonwealth craft. I understand that the Commonwealth ships did not carry more than a fractional portion of the wheat exported from Australia. It would .be hard to justify our action in providing the Australian farmer only with the benefits accruing from lower freight charges in respect to our vessels. Those ships would be carrying our wheat one way, and bringing back overseas merchandise to Australia. Among that merchandise there would be, for example, mining machinery. Who will say that mining in this country is not entitled to all possible encouragement? As the result of the lack of cyanide in Western Australia, the mines on the Golden Mile were at one stage in a precarious position. Are those mines to receive no consideration in the matter of back-loading, after our vessels have conveyed Australian wheat at reduced freights to England? Why should the Commonwealth ships be called on, except for the purpose of keeping freights and fares in check, to run at much lower freight rates than the ships of other companies and countries? </para>

                    <para>With respect to Queensland, and to the high cost of living there, I have been pleased to note how prices were kept low for so long a period. As the war developed, however, I noted that in that State prices constantly and monotonously increased, until at last the cost of living has become higher than in any of the other States. Why is that so? The Government of Queensland to-day are in the  unique position that if they really desired to stem the continuous rise in the cost of commodities they can do so, despite the activities of the Commonwealth Government. By an enactment of the Kidston Government, power was placed with the dominant party in Queensland to carry through the Legislative Council any measure which that party deemed to be in the public interest. The question may be naturally asked, why the dominant party in Queensland has not set an example to the other States? </para>

The true position is this: When the relative powers of the Federal and State Arbitration Courts were called into question, and the High Court was appealed to, the latter held that the State tribunals could concurrently fix rates and conditions of labour, always provided that they did not fix a lower rate than that fixed by the Commonwealth. With respect to the cost of living, the true, legal, and constitutional position is that, though the Federal authority may fix prices at a certain m&#39;aximum, it is still competent for the State authority to step in, and, if it thinks that a lower figure can be reasonably set for &#39;the same necessary articles of living, it may take action, and that power of action will stand unchallengeable. I secured that opinion from one of the highest legal authorities in Australia; and it has fortified my contention that if the cost of living is really a grievance in Queensland - and it inevitably must be, seeing that increases have been greater there than in any of the other States - the </para>

                    <para>Now a word or two as to fixing prices in any way which will be likely to exercise a material effect upon the cost of living. My own view is that we shall have to treat this question very warily. Taking it all in all I do not believe it is practicable to fix prices in any way that will give general satisfaction. Let us follow the admirable example set by the British Government, which has just passed a Bill through the House of Commons with a view to preventing profiteering. I believe such power can be more successfully employed as a measure to frighten than a measure to operate. In certain instances I have no doubt that effective action can be taken. But as for enacting any measure which will prove practicable in operation over a wide range of circumstances, and that will satisfactorily influence prices, I say that any attempt in that direction will be extreme folly. The thing- has been tried over and over again, and has always been tried in vain. </para>
                    <para>There are only four industries mentioned in this Bill, and in respect of two of them it is proposed to fix prices. Other industries are left out in the cold. It is on behalf of these other industries that I intend to raise my voice in this Chamber later on. We cannot insure fair play all round if we single out a couple of industries for special treatment. When we adopt that course we must necessarily impose a handicap upon other industries. Take, for example, the sugar industry, the coal industry, and the carrying industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> told us this afternoon that the price of sugar had automatically and progressively increased from &#163;14 per ton to &#163;21 per ton. Who is paying that increased price? The taxpayers of this country. That expenditure has been the means of bringing under cultivation some of the richest lands in the Commonwealth. But it must be borne in mind that those who are engaged in cereal growing have to earn their livelihood upon the poorer lands of the Commonwealth, and as Henry Lawson says,. &#34; Their struggle with the elements is everlasting war.&#34; While the sugar industry, the coal industry,, the maritime carrying industry, and other allied and secondary industries are singled out for special treatment in- the way of having the prices of their commodities fixed,, and conditions imposed, of an advantageous character, other industries are left alone or seriously handicapped. Let me cite my own case as an example.. Twenty-five years ago I was going to sea. I worked on. this coast for &#163;7f per month. Very much less work than I did then is being done- to-day for double that amount. In other respects the conditions- of the seamen have vastly improved. What hae- happened in other industries?  What is the position of the miner in. North Queensland, or &#34;Western Australia, or Southern Tasmania? It can be said with absolute truth that he is not one whit better off than he was twenty-five years ago, whereas the position of the men engaged in the industries I have referred to has been improved beyond measure. </para>

                            <para>- I would like to know how he is better off. What is wanted in this country is a Bill which will enable the scales of justice to be held more evenly as between our various industries. There is a constant tendency to foster and coddle - indeed, to convert into things of a parasitic nature - certain industries at the expense of other industries which support a very much larger population. If that be progress, it is progress in a circle. If we want real progress the scales of equity will require to be poised more evenly between all our industries. Favour should be given to none, but a fair field to all. Take the case of the coal miners in New South Wales. Are not they vastly better off to-day than they were years ago, whereas the gold miner in the Golden Mile is not nearly in as good a position as he was twenty-five years ago. Such a condition of affairs cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as progress. Certain industries are advantaged beyond reason at the expense of other industries which are impoverished. I shall return to this subject at a later stage, and in the meantime shall content myself with saying that to grant particular industries most favoured conditions whilst compelling other- industries to hawk their products on the markets of the world and there to take what is offered and not what is fixed is not playing the fair game. My. voice will, therefore, be raised in the future in the direction of seeing that no more favoritism is extended to certain industries, because such treatment inevitably means the impoverishment of other industries and the inevitable injuring of general prosperity. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to direct attention to what I regard as a policy of mistaken economy on the part of the Postal Department. I have frequently had to appeal against various efforts by that Department to save money, but the latest incident which has come under my notice relates to the curtailment of postal facilities to a considerable number of persons in the southern portion of Tasmania. The particular places to which I refer are Woodstock and Craddock. These centres are on the way from Hobart to Cygnet, and although the mail motor passes these offices twice a day, their postal services have been curtailed to one mail daily. The schools in these districts have a regular attendance of from forty-five to fifty pupils. That, of course, is a very important matter. At Craddock there are always from 130 to 140 votes recorded, showing that there are that number of adults resident in the district. Seeing that the cost of these mail services to the Department must be very small indeed, consideration ought certainly be extended to that number of people. In criticising the position my correspondent advances the argument that the only saving which can possibly be effected by the reduction of the mail service hitherto in existence will be represented by the cost of the string and sealing-wax by which the mail bags are secured once a day. I direct the attention of the Government to this matter because I believe that the policy which they are adopting is a wrong one. One of the main problems with which they are confronted is the decentralization of population. Our mail services are a very important factor in inducing people to settle in: large centres of population. In our larger cities, for example, there are three mail deliveries daily, whereas country residents, who have to suffer many disabilities, receive only one delivery. If this matter be brought before the Postmaster-General, and Ministers stress the importance of making life as agreeable as possible to the residents of our rural areas, I feel sure that the Postmaster-General will recognise the justice of what I have said. </para>

                    <para>The presence of influenza in Tasmania having been officially notified by the Tasmanian health authorities, a proclamation was passed at the Executive Council on 20th August declaring the State of Tasmania to be infected with influenza. The Government of Tasmania has been informed that the Commonwealth Government now intends to assume control of the Inter-State traffic between Tasmania and the Commonwealth, and correspondence is proceeding with the view of the date being fixed on which detention of passengers in quarantine will cease. The restrictions on passengers from Tasmania will then be limited to medical inspection and travelling under permit, and on the arrival of passengers in another State they will be subject to quarantine surveillance for three days. From reports received, it appears that influenza is prevalent in all parts of the State, and that several deaths have occurred. </para>
