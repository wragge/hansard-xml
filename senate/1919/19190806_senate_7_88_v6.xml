                <para>Thatthe Senate places on record its appreciation of the public services of the late Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser, who was a member of the Federal Convention and a representative of the State of Victoria in this Chamber, from the inception &#39; of Federation, for several years. </para>

            <para>By means of this motion 1 invite the Senate to place on record its appreciation of the personality and services of a distinguished and highly respected citizen. Thelate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser has left behind him that which any man might well envy, namely, an honorable record of useful public life, served both in the State and the Federal arena. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser, as many honorable senators will recollect, was associated, in its early stages, with the movement which ultimately brought about the union of the several States of the Commonwealth. The public of Victoria showed their appreciation, both of the man and the service he had rendered, by electing him first as a member of the Federal Convention, and later to a position in this Chamber. </para>
            <para>If, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser had never filled that part in. the public life of this country he would still, I venture to say, have left behind him a record of great and useful service. He was one of those who, in his earlier days, did much to build up this Australia of ours, and we owe in a large measure the conditions we now enjoy, to the work which he and others then performed. </para>
            <para>Those honorable senators who, with myself, were privileged to share his companionship in this Chamber, will always appreciate his shrewd judgment and kindly yet vigorous personality. I was,  on ina.ny occasions, under a distinct obligation to the late honorable gentleman for the very cordial assistance he rendered to me, and he always tried to assist in the conduct of the business of the Senate. With other honorable senators I can look back to many kindly personal acts which endeared the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser to those privileged to enjoy his company. </para>
            <para>As is proper, the motion I have submitted expresses the sympathy of the Senate for those who are mourning the loss of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser even more deeply than we do. I submit the motion quite confident of the reception which it will receive at the hands of honorable s 6 ii aton </para>

                    <para>. - It is with very sincere feeling that I rise to second the motion submitted by the Leader of the Senate. T think I can speak for all honorable senators on this side of . the Chamber, when I say that we associate ourselves most heartily with every word which the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said- with regard to the merit, the work, the character, the capacity and attainments of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser. </para>

                <para>Personally, I feel as if a friend has gone from amongst us. Although he had long passed the allotted span of three score- years and ten - had, in fact, passed four score years, and was nearly approaching four score and ten - the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser had a bright, youthful, and sunny presence which seemed to create a circle of light around all with whom he came in contact. </para>
                <para>It is with, feelings of the deepest sympathy that I join with the Leader of the Senate and other honorable senators, in passing a motion of sympathy with the relatives he has left behind. </para>

                    <para>. - It is with a deep sense of responsibility and regret that I rise to support the  motion  - responsibility because of my early association with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser, and regret because of his departure and for the loss suffered, by his household. When the Senate first assembled, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> - then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> - was the oldest man in this Chamber and I was the youngest. We shared the privilege of moving and seconding  the adoption, of the first Address-in-Reply moved in the Senate. Doubtless other honorable senators have seen the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser about this building recently, but I think I saw him even more recently than they, and I was very pleased to note the state of health in which he then appeared to be. With every word uttered by the Minister . for Repatriation in addressing himself to this motion I am in absolute accord. </para>

                            <para>- The question, submitted by the honorable senator goes, as the Senate will recognise, a little beyond the mere question of the relief of the people suffering in Queensland. I am quite conscious- that in this matter the  fr  overrun ent have had to rely upon &#39; the  patience of honorable senators to, perhaps, an unusual extent. I can only say, that for reasons which appear to the Government to. be absolutely sound, we crave that that patience be extended a little longer. The matter is not being lost sight of, and I venture to express the hope that developments in the next few days will justify the action which the Government have taken. </para>

                        <para>- It will be within the memory of honorable senators that, on the 17th July last, the Minister for Repatriation made a statement which, to my mind, and I think to the minds of  many honorable senators, if not of the general public, impugned the honour and integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Major W.</inline> D. Evans, in the transaction regarding the purchase of the Mount Bardwell Estate for the erection of homes under our War Service Homes Act. I offer no apology for availing myself of our Standing Orders to place before the Senate a statement in reply by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> and other gentlemen, whose names were mentioned by the Minister during the course of his remarks. As I am allowed only half-an-hour to deal with this matter, I intend, for the purposes of accuracy, to read from certain documents so as to obviate the possibility of any misunderstanding arising. Some of these documents have been sworn to. In the first place, I have here a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> himself, which is addressed to me, and which reads - </para>

                <para>I may here interpolate that when the Minister made his statement on the 17th July last I intimated that I had known <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> for many years, and that I had never known him to be guilty of a dishonest action. That is the reason why he has written to me. Here is his statement - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Relative to the statement by the Minister for Repatriation, made in the Senate yesterday, it is inconceivable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> holding the high and honorable position of a Commonwealth Minister, would, in a privileges statement made to the Senate, descend to an undignified vituperation, allied with an unmistakable distortion of fact, unless he, in turn, had been deliberately deceived by some responsible official adviser. </para>
                    <para class="block">For instance, take his statement, <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Major Evans</inline> had exceeded the limits of land purchase by the Act, and had been dismissed.  . . .. The official papers disclosed that, on 20th June, the Commissioner wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> terminating his services.  Colonel Walker  went to Sydney, arriving on 24th June, to deliver the letter and appoint a successor.&#34; Commissioner Walker made the public statement recently, in Sydney, that I had been called upon to resign. However, I am not stressing the contradiction, as it is one of many. My offer to the attorneys (whose business antecedents and <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> I was not called upon to investigate, and who throughout all the investigations have acted in a straightforward and open manner) of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Ada</inline> Violet Mitchell, the owner of the estate, was only made on Thursday, 19th June. A letter of acceptance was forwarded on Saturday, 21st June, and was received by me on the morning of the 24th June. I might call attention to the fact that Sunday, 22nd, and . Monday, 23rd (public holiday), intervened. The sale was reported verbally to the Commissioner on the morning of the 24th, the first available opportunity offering. The question that now arises (especially in view of the senator&#39;s statement that &#34; The Commissioner knew nothing until he received a letter from the vending firm to nominate a solicitor, who would fix the matter&#34;) is, how was it possible for the Commissioner, in Melbourne, on the 20th June, to associate this purchase as the governing factor in my retirement? </para>
                    <para>The limitation of powers to &#163;5,000 under the War Service Homes Act is applicable only to the compulsory acquisition of land. The section prescribing this limit is incorporated with that part of the Act dealing solely with the compulsory acquisition under the Lands Acquisition Act as apart from purchase by mutual agreement and negotiation. </para>
                    <para>In any case, my instruction from Commissioner Walker (who knew the land well, and who, further, to my own personal knowledge, has had business dealings with Chas. Myers and Co., the attorneys of the estate) was to purchase the estate, if possible. These instructions were issued before the receipt of any expressed powers vested in me under any delegation of limitations subsequently determined by the Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>Doctors, lawyers, and even sworn valuators,  have  been known to differ, and in many cases of litigation and arbitration consistent with the object of the party that employs them&#39; are prepared to even back up such differences by sworn testimony. The fallacy of taking a local government or State valuation as a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> basis for negotiations has been previously exemplified. I need only quote a case fresh in the mind of the Sydney public - the Clontarf lands owned by the Sydney Ferries Limited, valued for taxation purposes at &#163;1.1,200 - which, after negotiation with the company for their resumption for public services had failed,&#39; were put up for auction recently, and actually realized, for a portion of  the  estate only, over &#163;30,000. I reiterate that the Mount Bardwell estate, despite the determined attempts to discredit the sale, constitutes an excellent bargain at the price, and is capable of being utilized almost immediately for the erection of 700 or 800 homes for returned soldiers - a big factor to be considered in such an urgent situation. </para>

                    <para>The discrediting statement that the gift lands &#34; were so low lying,&#34; &#38;c, I will leave in abler hands than mine to refute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> asking that the correspondence concering  the Bexley transaction should be tabled in the Senate, stated &#34; There is no correspondence.&#34; All I wish to say at this stage is that, on Handing over all my documents to Messrs. F. W. Toll and Bailey, on the 24th June last, prior to proceeding on one week&#39;s official final leave, this correspondence, which is fairly voluminous, was handed over with the rest. The official <inline font-style="italic">Records</inline><inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> will disclose this. I can quite understand the official reluctance to disclosing the exceptional merits of the deal, which  untampered  correspondence would reveal, and thus obviate any necessity for stultifying the extraordinary action of the Commissioner in his repudiation of the purchase. I greatly deplore the adoption of such slanderous tactics as this launching of a discrediting propaganda. It only tends to cloud and side-track the real issue, one that materially affects the interests of returned soldiers, which I have so much at  heart,  viz., the public exposure of the  proscrastinating  methods and detrimental policy of centralization adopted by the War Service Homes Commissioner in this State since the inception of the scheme, a charge which, in justice to over 3,000 soldier applicants, merits official explanation, but up to date has been studiously avoided. </para>

I contend that it is nothing short of a positive scandal to find at this stage ( six months after the assent to the War Service Homes Act and two months after my appointment), over 3,000 applications in hand in New South Wales, and not one penny available locally for furthering these; not one valuator, investigation clerk, or real property searcher appointed for even the essential preliminary work on each application; all this notwithstanding the fact that you were asked by me to undertake, on 10th May last, to expedite approval to these appointments.

                    <para>I have to acknowledge your 19/C50, numbered 1288, and dated 20th instant, handed me personally by you at 11.30 this morning. The decision to relieve me of my duties as  Deputy  Commissioner of this State suggests some serious omission or commission in connexion with my administration in New South Wales, especially when such action is not preceded by some preliminary inquiry into the circumstances of the implied charges. I feel that some grave misunderstanding has arisen on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence furnished. The position is so unusual for an officer of my status to be secretly charged, tried, and sentenced, without being heard in my own defence. I court the fullest scrutiny of all my official and unofficial actions since taking over my functions as Deputy Commissioner of this State, and I now ask, in the face of the grave injustice which I have been subjected to, to be supplied with the reasons for your summary action in peremptorily dismissing me from office. The fact that, as alleged by you, &#34; that I had written to some person in Ballarat advising him, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia, &#39;</inline> not to be in such a damned hurry&#39;&#34; (a statement absolutely false) indicates a manifest tendency on the part of some unknown person or persons to prejudice me through unfair misrepresentation. The further fact that official letters alleged to have been forwarded me from your office, such as, for instance, &#34; Technical Circular No. 1,&#34; stated to have been handed over to me, never actually received by me, or at my office, induces me to believe that probably important instructions have similarly disappeared. My work has been conscientiously and fearlessly performed, despite many difficulties - these efforts have always been directed in the sole interests of the housing scheme in New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>When the Commissioner was made aware that&#39; the contract had been signed, he naturally looked into it, and caused certain valuations to be made. One of these was by a gentleman who had for nine years been the valuer of the municipality in which the land is situated, and who is also retained by the Railways Commissioners for valuations in that district. It may, therefore, be assumed that he is a gentleman of both knowledge and reputation. He values the land at &#163;7,750, and, in addition, affirms that in no circumstances ought this land to be purchased, because of its unsuitability for the purpose for which the Housing Commissioner would want it. In addition, the Department of the Valuer-General was applied to. New South Wales has created a Department, the purpose of which is to value all the lands of the State, and those valuations, becoming a public record, are available for municipal, State, and other purposes, and would also form the basis of resumption, should the State at any time desire to acquire any  parcel of  land. This Department puts the value of this land at &#163;0,225..... </para>
                    <para class="block">The Commissioner also directed his officers in Sydney to invite representatives of the Returned Soldiers League and the secretary of the Soldiers and Citizens Political Party to accompany him on a visit of inspection of the land. One of these gentlemen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis,</inline> happened to be a licensed surveyor . . . but I am stressing  more particularly the fact that he is a licensed surveyor. In the report he has been good enough to furnish he says the- Bexley estate is totally unsuited for war service homes. I do not know of any more sweeping condemnation than that; but he goes into details: - &#34;About two-thirds of the allotment, as designed and marked out on the ground, are projected upon the rough precipitous slopes of the plateau. The land is so precipitous that it is entirely unsuitable for building purposes of a nature required for soldier settlement. I am of opinion that at least &#163;3 per foot would bo required to make any of the allotments ready for building purposes.  &#34; The whole subdivision is a courageous, and almost impertinent, attempt to make hope triumph over experience.

                    the senator really believed these valuations to be anywhere near correct, why did  Colonel Walker  tell Myers and Co. bie was willing to refer the subject of purchasing the property to Lieutenant-Colonel Toll ? He. had official access to copies of valuations forwarded to the  Deputy  Commissioner, Sydney, which were subsequently confirmed by actual sales, from &#163;2 up to &#163;6 per foot.

                <para>Obviously, Cortis must have visited the wrong area, as his assessment of precipitous area differs from the surveyors who designed the estate, and the estate is only 700 yards in a direct line from the Bexley tram line, and three-quarters of a mile from Banksia Railway Station. </para>
                <para>The senator stressed the point  that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis</inline> is a licensed surveyor. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Millen</inline> is under the impression that a licensed surveyor is an authority on building..

                <para>If the senator had the slightest reliance on the accuracy of any of these valuations, it was his duty to immediately veto any further negotiations with either Myers and Co. or <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Mitchell</inline> direct.

                    <para>. - During a very long parliamentary experience I have listened to motions for the adjournment of the Senate on many occasions, but I have never known one in regard to which the time allotted under the Standing Orders has been so ruthlessly wasted as it has been by the honorable senator. It may be interesting to him to get into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what is really an index to correspondence which somebody else holds, but it does not help the matter one iota. There are only two or three outstanding points in connexion with this question. In the first place I gather that the honorable senator&#39;s accusation, as applied to myself, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was not dismissed from office but resigned. . Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was not able to see that he, himself, cut the ground from under the feet of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> when he read that gentleman&#39;3 letter of the 24th June last. In that letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> protests against his peremptory dismissal, and says- </para>

                        <para>- I did not. Last week, as appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I endeavoured to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> pretence had no substance in it. The only resignation which that officer has put in is dated 17th July last.  His  notice of dismissal was dated 20th June last. Nearly a month later - for what reason  I  cannot conceive - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> wrote a letter of resignation. It seems to me that during that time some Legal mind had been at work, hoping, possibly, to discover a flaw in the notice of dismissal, and had then suggested - three weeks after <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> left office - that he should put in a formal notice of resignation. That was done long after the matter had got into print. It is impossible for any fair minded man to assume that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> wrote the letter protesting against his summary dis-  missal, he had any notion of talking resignation. </para>

                        <para>- He was relieved of office immediately. The letter of dismissal was written on the 20th June last. The Housing Commissioner, who alone is responsible for appointments to, and dismissals from, his staff, informed me that he was going to Sydney for the purpose of dismissing <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans.</inline> I am, therefore, personally able to say that on the 20th June,  Colonel Walker  had made up his mind to take that step. He took the letter over to Sydney, and delivered it to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> himself, and this accounts for the fact .that it was not delivered until the 24th June. In view of these facts it is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to come here and pretend that there was any <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> resignation on the part of the former gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- I will come to that. The honorable senator need not be afraid that I wish to skip any material points in this case. On the evidence that I have produced the only possible verdict is that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was dismissed. </para>

                <para>Now I come to the question as to whether the Mount Bardwell estate had anything to do with the dismissal. I have never said that it had. The very dates show that. What I did tell the Senate was that I wanted to deal with this matter because of the volume of criticism concerning it which had been published in Sydney. </para>

                    has drawn my attention to a statement contained in my previous speech, when, in reply to a question put by him as to the date of the valuations, I said they had all been made since
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline>
                    resignation. That statement, taken by itself, might be capable of being misunderstood, but the whole trend of my speech on the previous occasion showed that there had been no resignation. The point involved in
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline>
                    question was whether these were old valuations, .and I stated in effect that they had been made since the departure of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline>
                    from the office.
                </para>
                <para>I come now to the . question of the Mount Bardwell estate. I have never said that the negotiations for its purchase had anything to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> dismissal. In my previous speech I made it clear that the Commissioner knew nothing of the Mount Bardwell Estate at the time of dismissal. I referred then to two subjects which were exciting a good deal of attention in Sydney, one being <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans&#39;</inline> statements, and the other the Mount Bardwell transaction. At that time the Sydney newspapers were discussing the Mount Bardwell transaction, and I thought it desirable, for the reputation of the Department, that the action taken by the Commissioner in regard thereto should be explained in public. The two things were intimately associated with one man, but I think I made it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was dismissed for other reasons. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, I am not. able to quote the whole of my speech, but I invite the honorable gentleman to prove that the one thing hinged upon the other. So much has been said about the Mount Bardwell transaction, that I want to say a little more, and to give specific denials to certain definite statements. In the course of the statement read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> it is alleged that  Colonel Walker  knows the land.  Colonel Walker  denies that. He states he was  taken out somewhere in the locality of the Mount Bardwell Estate to look at some land, but he denies that this particular estate was. ever brought under his notice. It is stated also that he had dealings with Myers and Company. He denies this; unless the impression that he had dealings with Myers and Company is due to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Myers,</inline> or some one representing that gentleman, called at the Melbourne office, and left a plan or some letter bringing the estate under notice. That is the only dealing which  Colonel Walker  has ever had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Myers,</inline> and  Colonel Walker  states that this matter was dealt with bv the Sydney office representative to whom the paper was forwarded. That is the only transaction which  Colonel Walker  had with Myers and Company. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but we have this fact to the discredit of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> - ?that whilst he claimed that he had resigned from the Department, he has sent in a letter protesting against his dismissal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has quoted a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> in which he says that not only did he rely on his own judgment as to the value of this land, but that he had three independent valuations to support his opinion. I interjected immediately, &#34; For whom were the valuations made ? &#34; That was a very important point, and for the information of the Senate I may- state that, so far as I can discover, these valuations were made for Myers and Company, the vendors. There is no record in the Department of any other valuation at that time, and curiously enough, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has given corroboration of this theory by his reading of a prospectus of a company that was being formed for the purpose of proceeding with the subdivision of the land prior to its being offered to the War Service Homes Commissioner. One of the gentlemen mentioned in the prospectus is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox,</inline> one df the valuers referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> Honorable senators will agree, I think, that a valuation made for the vendor is about the last that should be accepted by any . Government that has regard for the expenditure of public money. </para>

I venture to say that if they believed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> had authority to carry this transaction through, they would not have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to waste the time of the Senate this&#39; afternoon in discussing this matter. The Act is quite clear upon this point. </para>

                        <para>- lt is laid down clearly in the Act that the authority given to the Commissioner- not to his  deputy  - must not exceed &#163;5,000, and that in transactions over that amount the proposal must be submitted for the approval of the Minister. If, as ,provided in the Act, the Commissioner is limited to &#163;5,000, would it not be an absurdity to say that he could give a  Deputy  Commissioner authority to expend an unlimited amount? Under the power of delegation the authority given to a  Deputy  is expressly - limited to &#163;1,000 without reference to Melbourne office, and I point out. that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> initialed that instruction, indicating plainly that he knew of  it. Moreover, at a conference in Melbourne, between the Commissioner and the Deputies, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> fought strenuously, but unsuccessfully, to get an enlargement of this authority, so it is idle to pretend that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> did not know the limit of his powers. </para>

                <para>I wish now to say a word or two about the valuations. I know that valuers of land differ very much in their ideas. It has been part of my experience to have something to do with the valuation of land, and I know that there is frequently a wide difference of opinion between men whose competence no one would doubt, because perhaps one sees in certain land opportunities which another fails to discern. But, even after making all. these allowances, there are limits beyond which it is impossible to go. I ask the Senate to remember that the departmental valuation of this property was not made by people interested in the sale, nor, presumably, by people- who wished to damn it. In the first place, there was the valuation .made by the State Valuer-General. If there is one person to whom we may look with some degree of confidence as being unprejudiced, surely it is the official appointed by the Government of New South Wales to value, the lands of the State generally, and part of whose duty it is to see that the value of one block bears some relation, to that of a block in a corresponding locality elsewhere. His valuation of this  property  was &#163;6,225. I may point out that the vendors agreed to accept &#163;25.000. Previously they asked &#163;31,000. If the true value was, as stated by the State Valuer-General, &#163;6,225, there was nothing very melodramatic about the vendors dropping the price from &#163;31,000 to &#163;25,000. Another valuation was by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMillan,</inline> a valuer under the Local Government Act of New South Wales. He fixed the price at &#163;7,750. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis,</inline> a licensed valuer, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> appears to discredit, said that, as a representative of the returned soldiers, he inspected the ground with the officers of the Department, and fixed the value at 5s. per foot frontage, as against 16s. per foot which the &#163;25,000 fixed by the vendors would represent. The municipal unimproved value is &#163;6,880, and improved value &#163;7,100. But perhaps I can- not do better than give the owners&#39; valuation as furnished to the Land Tax Commissioner. </para>

The owner&#39;s valuation, as set out in the Federal land  tax return, was - unimproved value, &#163;2,200; improved, &#163;2,900. I am not going to say. that the values returned for land tax purposes are indicative of the true market value, but I do regard it as a part of my duty to bring these facts under the notice of- the Land Tax Commissioner. There is one way in which I think we can demonstrate the actual value of the land. A month before it was submitted to1 <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> it was placed under offer to, and refused by, the City Mutual Life Insurance Company for &#163;12,000.

                        <para>- It shows, at least, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> had not studied his brief. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans,</inline> in his statement, provided for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and furnished to the press - probably overlooking that the documents contradicted his own statement - put in a mutilated telegram, and then, when supplying copies of the official documents, he failed to notice or realize that he thus gave away his own case, as has been proved here to-day. I do not know that I need bother any more about this matter. I&#39; shall be considerably disappointed, and I would regard the administration of a public department as almost intolerable, if, after the facts which I have given, I am to be worried any more upon this subject. </para>

T am bound to say that I took up this matter without knowing anything about the circumstances, except that I had had the advantage, twenty-five years ago, of occupying a seat in Parliament with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and that I am in a position, therefore, to know his methods and manners,. He is the finest word painter, the finest drawer of pictures, of any man whom I know in public life. Those touches in his speech of a week or two ago were the touches of an artist. He referred to the land company of which a man named Earle Hermann, and also a solicitor who had been struck off the rolls, were members. After investigation, I have ascertained that this individual named Hermann never was a member of that company. </para>

                <para>Let us now wipe from our minds all impressions that the two individuals under discussion were members of the company at all. Also let us forget the statement or impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> had been discharged because of his having entered into this particular contract. Since I spoke upon the .subject in the Senate a week or two ago, 1 have taken the opportunity to go over the estate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and I traversed the whole of it; and if we did not go over every yard of it, I am certainly prepared to say that we looked over every single block on the estate. I propose to quote now from a statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> read, in which a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis</inline> made certain comments. I desire to say first, however, that I have before me a map of the estate in which all the distances are set to scale by the simple process of marking the plan, with the aid of a compass, in i-mile circles. There can be no discussion or dispute as to the accuracy of my distances, then. I do not intend to get excited, nor to interest myself on behalf of Myers and Company, or Earle Hermann, whom I do not know. But I do protest that the way in which this whole business has been made public is not the&#39; proper method. For the Minister to have indicated or hinted that a possibly reputable firm is in actual fact a set of land &#34; boodleiers,&#34; who are deliberately trying to pass on an estate to the returned soldiers for an amount of &#163;25,000, when it is worth- only &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000- </para>

                        <para>- I am merely giving information according to the opinions which I formed as the result of my observations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis</inline> said that the area is about 1&#189; miles from railway or tramway communication, and that the intervening country is very rough and badly provided with road access. He could not have seen the land. The map before me shows that from the Arncliffe Railway Station the distance to this land is a mile, and that from the estate to the tram it is only a matter of 700 yards. If a party reports to the effect that a certain site is1&#189; miles from railway and tramway communication, whereas it is only 1 mile from the railway and 700 yards from the tramway, then he must have looked over the wrong property. This estate is within 2 miles of Botany Bay. The Bexley tramway runs to the Arncliffe Railway Station, which is 1 mile from the property, and the tramway line <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to Arncliffe runs within 700 yards of the estate. Is it not fair to assume, in view of the divergence between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis&#39;</inline> estimate of the distance and the actual facts that he must have made a mistake in his examination? I am trying to look from a charitable point of view upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cortis&#39;</inline> report. Honorable senators know full well that land valuations vary. When a big estate is subdivided, there is nothing very extraordinary in the fact that its value is judged to be much greater than when it was one whole block. </para>

                        <para>- It is an entirely different thing to say that such a property as this is worth only 5s. a foot. No man can be looked upon as a judge of land values throughout the whole country;but to say that land such as the estate in question is worth only 5s. a foot when it is within 6 miles of the Sydney Central Railway Station is altogether misleading. In my judgment, it is worth from 30s. to &#163;2 a foot; or, at any rate, I am willing to say that 30s. to 40s. is much nearer the true value than 5s. a foot. </para>

                        <para>- Then I would not be in the least surprised to discover, when it is sold, that it had fetched 60s. a foot. About 12,000 feet have been sold, and one block, which was purchased for prospective values realized &#163;6 per foot, whilst another 1,000 feet were sold at &#163;2 per foot. There are thousands of feet of land which, I believe, are equally as good as that sold at &#163;2 per foot. These are the facts, and they are supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who is a man of common sense, and one who took considerable trouble in looking over the land. The land is there, and any one who is interested can inspect it for himself. The Minister has been misinformed by the reports he has received, just as he has been in connexion with the Lithgow land. I believe a mistake has been made over the Lithgow property. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> stated that it was all swampy country. </para>

                    <para>. - As one who has looked into this transaction very closely since we were here last, I believe there has been some roguery or foolery, as stated by the Minister, but that he has struck the wrong nail on the head. He should call for an investigation to get the matter thoroughly cleared up. I am not going into the values of the land, but I am going to say that the statement read by the Minister has been compiled by some officer who is trying to smother up something. It is bristling with inaccuracies, if not deliberate falsehoods. I do not say that the Minister knows anything about them, but the statement has been compiled with the idea of smothering up something. </para>

One inaccuracy is that the members of this company are undesirable citizens, that a member of this company has served time in gaol, and that another One has been struck off the rolls. The man who put that into a statement for the Minister is attempting to mislead him and to smother up something. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has shown that the distance of the land from the railway in the Minister&#39;s statement iswrong. </para>

                        <para>- Not a bit of it. I would not suggest purchasing it or the Lithgow land either. It is better land than we have in other places the same distance from Sydney, that have been sold for &#163;5 per foot. It is an outrage to ask men who have to work on the wharfs to pay such an excessive price. Colonel Walker, according to the Minister&#39;s statement, has had a distant eight of the land, and. I believe he was over the place. </para>

I am going to believe what the Minister says, although I was debarred  from  replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> when he made a most outrageous statement about an old  gentleman seventy-three years of age,- who was desirous of helping returned soldiers by making the presenta-tion  to them. There is no likelihood of any one spending large sums of money in that locality until he has an assurance of continuity of employment in that district. If the Small Arms Factory were permanently established the land would have been sold long ago. </para>

In justice to the soldiers there should be an inquiry, and I hope one will be instituted as quickly as possible. I hope that every one who has had anything to do with the case will have the opportunity of proving their <inline font-style="italic">bona</inline><inline font-style="italic">fides</inline> so far as their transactions with .the Government are concerned. I have not had the pleasure of seeing the Bardwell estate, but I had the opportunity of inquiring from the vendors of the land, and from others who have been connected with it. I am perfectly satisfied that the information given by the Minister is inaccurate; that somebody has something to cover up, and that the wrong man has been sacked. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister may be, and no doubt are, the  valuations made by those gentlemen, but I am surprised at the enormous difference in the figures quoted. The first amount is .&#163;31,000, and then it is reduced to &#163;25,000 when the . Commonwealth desires to purchase the estate, whilst for local taxation and Federal taxation purposes the estate is valued at only &#163;7,500. I am of the opinion that the local valuations, and that of the Federal authorities, are all below the mark, and that in this, as well .as in other instances, the &#39; holders of large estates are escaping their just share of taxation. The Federal Taxation Commissioner should, I think, be called upon to explain why a valuation of &#163;7,500 was placed on the property.This gentleman is a highly paid officer, with, a big staff, and is supposed to place something like the true valuation on the properties assessed . They are apparently asking these people to pay on a valuation of &#163;7,500, and with the exemption of &#163;5,000 - which I am glad to say the Labour party, at their Federal Conference, determined to have repealed - the taxable value is reduced to &#163;2,500. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely expressing my surprise at the difference between the selling price of the land and the price at which it is assessed for taxation purposes. I inspected the land, and also that at Lithgow, which at present is not under consideration. In regard to the estate at Bexley, I wish to support the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to the effect that it is excellent building land. To say that that land is worth only 5s. per foot is absurd. If it were put up at auction to-morrow it would fetch an average of a good, deal more than &#163;2 per foot. Land about Sydney is very valuable, and is increasing in value every day. There may, and I suppose there must, be something in connexion with the estate, which has not been disclosed. It may be that access to the estate will be very costly, and that before it is sold access to it must be provided. But if that be so, it is somewhat strange, not to use another term, that already a number of blocks on the estate have been sold, and that a number of cottages have been erected upon it. These matters should be inquired into. It is altogether inexplicable to me that it should be suggested that this block of land is worth only 5s. per foot. There is no land in the neighbourhood, or even a long way out from it,, that could be obtained at anything approximating that price. It is a matter of very great surprise to me that it should be valued at such a price either by the local authorities or the Federal Taxing Commissioner. </para>

                <para>Personally I am not very much enamoured of the idea of constructing a large number of houses together for returned soldiers. I think the scheme adopted by the Commonwealth Bank of agreeing to purchase vacant blocks of land in any suitable position, and erecting on them homes for returned soldiers, whenever they may require them, is very much better than the erection of a large number of homes together for returned men. In my view it is better that the returned soldiers should be assimilated with the general population as soon as possible&#39;, than that they should be set apart in settlements by themselves. </para>
                <para>Enough has . been said by the Minister or by previous speakers to justify a searching inquiry into this matter. If it is true that the difficulty of access to this estate is so great that the land is really not worth more than 5s. per foot, that should be definitely established by inquiry. If,&#39; on the other hand, it is true that the land is worth a great deal more, and that homes for returned soldiers are urgently required, that also should be established by inquiry. There is an opinion, which I  share.  that the Government are not at all anxious to erect homes for returned soldiers. I have said before that if they were, seeing that we have placed an unlimited amount of money at their disposal, thousands of such homes would be erected to-day. Yet I do not know of one that has been completed so far, although the War Service Homes Act was passed more than seven months ago. I understand that a few soldiers&#39; homes have been commenced, and that a few may be completed inside of two months. It may be that in appointing Commissioners and Deputy  Commissioners under the War Service Homes Act the Government are only misleading, deceiving, and deluding the returned&#39; men into the belief that they are going to be provided with homes. That may be one reason why this estate was not accepted. I do not say that that was the reason, but I dc say that that interpretation may be put upon the refusal of it. I hope that later on an effort will be made to secure a full and complete inquiry into this matter. </para>

I venture to say, if I can judge from the chorus of approbation from honorable senators opposite which greeted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> remarks on the 17 th July, when he placed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> in the pillory, so to speak, an impression was left on their minds that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> had been guilty of some dishonest action. That impression is in the minds of the public of Australia to-day, and it was in order to secure an inquiry into this matter by some impartial tribunal that T moved the adjournment of the Senate. I hold no brief&#39; for Charles Myers and Company. I do not know them. I hold no brief for any man who is guilty of  wrong-doing; but as an elected representative in this Senate of the people of the Commonwealth, I do hold a brief for any man who is tried and condemned, and judgment pronounced upon him in his absence, and without his being given an opportunity to put in one word in his own defence. The Minister&#39;s reply, to me this afternoon proves that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was dismissed he was not given the reasons for his dismissal. On the 17th July, the Minister for Repatriation said, in connexion with the purchase of the Mount Bardwell Estate, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> was either a fool or a rogue. I ask the honorable senator now if he will give <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> a chance to prove that he was neither a fool nor a rogue. Not only are the honour and integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Evans</inline> at stake, but the honour of his family is also at stake. Imagine the stigma cast upon the wife and children of a reputable citizen of this country if the Minister&#39;s statement were allowed to go without challenge. </para>

The Minister has said that he hopes he may never again be ruffled about questions such as this in connexion with matters of public administration.

                            <para>- The answer supplied is - 1 to 4. A number of reports have been received from the Royal Commissioner, who considered the cases of 768 officers. The Commissioner has recommended that 719 of these officers be retained in the Public Service, for the reasons that their alleged enemy origin has not been proved, or, if proved, that it is either too remote or is accompanied by circumstances which did not justify a recommendation of discontinuance of services. In 35 cases, the Commissioner has recommended that the officers&#39; services be not retained, and 14 cases have not been completed for various reasons, such as traffic restrictions, and delays in furnishing evidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">I recognise that it is an unpleasant duty to move for the disallowancecof this Ordinance. But I am quite justified in my action, seeing that this particular Ordinance seeks to introduce an entirely new form of administration into the Northern Territory. At the outset of my remarks, I wish to make it perfectly clear that, in moving for the disallowance of the Ordinance, I am not influenced in any way by the appointment to the proposed Council of Advice of any of the gentlemen who are to form this new Advisory Board. I do not know any of them in this matter. All that concerns me is that a new departure is proposed in the administration of the Territory - a departure so drastic and important that, to my mind, it should first have been submitted to this Parliament for its consideration. Parliament has a right to say how our Federal Territories shall be administered in the future. For that reason, and in order to afford the Government an opportunity of submitting their proposals to Parliament, I am moving that the Ordinance be disallowed. Ever since I entered this Parliament, I have been decidedly of the opinion that the Northern Territory should be represented here. &#39; From that very important portion of Australia there should be in the National Legislature a certain number of representatives, who would be able to voice the opinions held by the residents there. Every honorable senator will agree with me that we know comparatively little of the Territory, of its requirements, and of the difficulties  and hardships which confront the people who are settled there. Because of the very great distance by which it is removed from us, and because of the lack of means for the interchange of ideas, it is severely handicapped. The members of this Parliament know very little of the requirements of the Territory, and because of its remoteness from us, we are unable to visit it for the purpose of examining it for ourselves, and thus obtaining first hand information. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but so far as the Federal Government are concerned there must be centralization somewhere. 1 am anxious that the Northern Territory  shall  be represented at the Seat of Government by persons duly elected by the people, and I disapprove of the methods adopted in connexion with the election of representatives on the Advisory Council. The Labour organizations of Port Darwin were called upon, under this Ordinance, to elect two representatives to the Council, and a number of persons were permitted to vote because they were members, of Labour organizations. Many of these workmen are not naturalized subjects, and under a proper electoral system they would not be permitted to vote. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt about that. I do not know how far the ballot extended, but under the new arrangement members of the Australian Workers Union had the right to choose two representatives on fie Advisory Council. I have the names of the persons appointed, and also the number of votes cast. Every man engaged in manual labour in the Northern Territory must be a member of the . Australian Workers Union, and so&#39; had a vote. I am not finding fault with these men as workmen, nor would I object if they had an opportunity of qualifying for the franchise, and used it in the ordinary way; but this election to the Advisory Council has not been properly carried out. I understand also there is to be on the Council one representative of the pastoral industry, and another of the mining industry; but I have no idea how they are to be elected, though this information may be in the Department of Home Affairs. Every member of the Senate should know how these gentlemen are to be appointed, whether they are to be selected, or nominated by some person. There will also be on the Council two heads of Departments - one the officer occupying the position of Director of Lands, and the other the Director of Mines. I presume they will be Government nominees, and there will, of course, be the gentleman appointed as Director, who will be &#39;chairman of the Council. My complaint is that we are not supplied with information concerning the proposed Council. We . get only scraps of information from time to time in the form of paragraphs in the press. The first intimation I had of the appointment of the Council was contained in a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the 3rd June of this year, to the effect that there had been an election of members of an Advisory Council for the purpose of assisting the Federal Government in the administration of the Northern Territory. Probably the paragraph was worded in an unfortunate way, as  the casual reader would come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Administration had failed absolutely in the past, and that the Government were seeking assistance from this elective body. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with the Ordinance in a few minutes. I do not intend to refer to any person who has &#39;been appointed, but I draw attention to the fact that there has been a protest from returned soldiers that they were not given an opportunity of appointing a man or competing for the position. Probably this was due to oversight on the part &#39;of the Government. The returned soldiers ought to have had an opportunity of submitting a candidate, and if he were found to be unsuitable they would then have been satisfied they had had a fair run for their money. The next information published in the press was in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 3rd July, to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> who has since been appointed Director of the Northern Territory, was to leave Darwin on a visit to Melbourne, and probably would return to the Territory by the next steamer, when his appointment would be formally confirmed. The paragraph went on to say that many, of the trappings with which the past Administrator had been surrounded were to be dispensed with; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> would not have the title of &#34;  His Excellency  &#34; - though I do not know that that would be a great hardship - and that Government House was to be used for departmental offices. I have a recollection, during my visit to the Territory, of what happened at the Batchelor Homestead Farm, which had been furnished at considerable cost to the Government. There were then only two or three pieces of furniture left, and I am afraid Government House will be treated in the same way. </para>

                            <para>- Various explanations were offered for its disappearance. I think it would be a mistake to close up Government House at Darwin. The furniture and appointments will, very likely, have the .same fate as those at Batchelor Farm. I fail to see why the Government, in their desire to bring about reforms in the Territory, should attempt to belittle that portion of Australia. Visitors arrive there from all parts of the world, and the former Administrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> was allowed a certain sum. of money per annum for entertainment purposes. Under the new Ordinance, the  Chairman  of the Advisory Council will receive only &#163;1,000 per annum, with no allowance for entertainment purposes. I do not want any trappings in the administration of the Northern Territory, but I believe the abolition of the entertainment allowance will be a step in the wrong direction. It will not be fair to the new Director to expect him to expend any portion of his salary in the entertainment of visitors, among whom may be gentlemen representing large interests in mining or other developmental enterprises, who may reasonably expect treatment similar to that which they would receive in any. other part of the world. With the entertainment allowance cut out, the Director will be unable to offer any of these people the usual courtesies, so they will have to put up at the local hotel. We are anxious to encourage the mining investor, the pastoralist, and the man who will settle and cultivate tropical products. It should be one of the chief functions of the Administrator, therefore, to afford such encouragement at every opportunity; &#62;but 1 contend that under present arrangements it will be impossible to do so in a manner creditable to the Administrator or the Commonwealth Government. An Adelaide newspaper, on the 24th July, pointed out that provision was being made for an advisory council of seven representatives of various interests, with the Director of the Territory as  chairman,  and that that gentleman would be in touch with the Minister in Melbourne. One of the reasons why the Northern Territory administration .has been so unsuccessful is that the Minister, from his office in Melbourne, has taken too much responsibility, or, rather, has prevented the settlement of Territory affairs, large and small, on the spot. That has been the great fault. The Administrator was not given an opportunity to deal locally with local matters. Almost everything had to be referred to the Minister in Melbourne. Under the new <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> the situation will be even worse. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> had very extensive powers. Nevertheless, he had to refer to .Melbourne very many decisions of grave and small consequence, with resultant dissatisfaction and uncertainty. That kind of thing has greatly hampered the development of the Territory. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 27th July, it was announced that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> had indicated on the previous day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Carey, formerly Government Secretary in Darwin, and now connected with Vestey Brothers&#39; meat works there, would be appointed director of the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> left his position of </para>

                    <para class="block">Government Secretary, and joined the firm of Vestey Brothers. Now he is leaving that company, and is taking up the duties of  chairman  of the Advisory Board at Darwin. I have no desire to discount the work of Vestey Brothers. Their enterprise in the Territory has been very great.; their expenditure has- been tremendous, and there should be considerable national benefit as an outcome ot their activities. But at Darwin there is a great deal of talk concerning the influence exercised by Vestey Brothers in relation to the government of the Northern Territory. It has been stated in various letters and communications which I have received direct from Darwin, that the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> has returned from his service with Vestey Brothers, will not be likely to lessen the influence of that firm in the government of the Territory. I have felt for a considerable time that Parliament and the public have not been able to secure that full fund of information regarding the progress of events in the Territory to which they are entitled. Dissatisfied with the meagre volume of information contained in the press from time to time., and with that made known by the Minister to Parliament, I ventured recently to ask certain questions in the Senate. I was anxious to discover whether there was any legal barrier to the direct representation of the Territory of the Federal&#39; Parliament. I had some doubt whether the Constitution would permit of the election of members. On 16th July I asked whether there were any constitutional disabilities, and was informed that there was no constitutional difficulty whatever. Further, I was told - </para>

                    <para>I fear that if the present rate of expansion is maintained it &#39; will be very many years before the Territory will have reached that stage of development where the Commonwealth Parliament may consider there is justification for granting direct parliamentary representation. On the other hand, I am satisfied that if the </para>

                    <para>In regard to the Ordinance itself, members of the Federal Parliament had been given no prior particulars. On 17th July I asked if the Ordinance had been laid on the table of the Senate, whereupon I was informed that it had been tabled on the evening of the date on which 1 made my inquiry. I desire to call attention to this Ordinance, and I am interested to know if honorable senators are of opinion that a form of government is about to be established under which they would care to live. Let us imagine ourselves as residents of the Territory, anxious to participate in some of the conveniences of civilization. Residents of that part of Australia are provided with a mail only once in two or three months. There are practically no railway conveniences; there is very little police supervision. Food has to be transported over great distances. Women and children - in the interior, at all events - live a very strenuous existence. Section 5 of the Ordinance states- </para>

                    <para>It amounts precisely to this : If the Minister desires to put through any special regulation, and is blocked by the Council of Advice as it then exists, he has  only  to appoint sufficient additional members who will be to his way of thinking, and he can easily secure his ends. The Ordinance does not say how many additional members may be appointed. If the Minister finds a majority of the existing members opposing any of his designs !.e can swamp such opposition by making as many additional appointments as ho deems necessary. All Democrats are opposed to nominee Legislatures. We have fought in Australia for many years against nominee Chambers. Senators are elected on the most democratic  franchise  in the world. Yet the democratic Parliament of Australia is asked to connive at the appointment of a nominee Chamber to rule over a section of this Commonwealth, and we are invited, in addition to deliberately place power in the hands of one individual to so &#34; rig &#34; that nominee council that he may gain his ends, whatever they may be. I do not suggest that a Minister controlling the , Northern Territory may ever do or seek &#39; to perpetrate such a thing; but here is his power. We hand over to the Minister absolute freedom to nominate councillors when he likes, how .he likes, and such as he likes. This Board of Advice may frame, rules of procedure and government, irrespective of the views of the people themselves. &#39; Residents of the Territory have become so sick and tired of Federal neglect that they care little what -is done or intended in the way of governing them. They have no vote for any Australian Legislature, and they worry mighty little  about  politics. For that reason I&#39; ask honorable senators to support me in my desire that this Ordinance be disallowed. It is only right that fairer and better steps be taken toward the government of the people of the Northern Territory. The Ordinance continues in section 6, sub-clause 1 - </para>

                            <para>- It is Autocracy camouflaged as Democracy. It is obvious to every one that it is Autocracy mingled with a little Democracy. Some of the gentlemen appointed on this Council of Advice are known to me, and I can imagine with what lamb-like submission they will agree to the powers of the  chairman  as set out in sub-section 3 of section 8 already quoted. I am strongly opposed to the Ordinance giving him such autocratic powers in the guise of Democracy. </para>

                            <para>- I am not allowed to submit alternatives under this motion ; but I am in favour of the Northern Territory having two representatives in this Parliament. I am not prepared to say definitely what representation there should be in either House, but I would suggest that the Territory be represented by one member in the Senate and two members in the House of Representatives. At present the residents of the Territory have no one here to put their case before the people, and generally they are in a most&#34; unfortunate position. If they had two or three representatives in this Parliament, who were continually speaking on behalf of the Territory, the people there would be in a better position, and they would have their interests protected, just as they were when they had representatives in the South Australian Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">That seems to indicate that the seven gentlemen appointed to the Council will not be allowed to do one stroke in connexion with public works without consulting the Minister in Melbourne, and instead of this being an improvement, the position will really be worse. &#34;Without the permission of the supreme authority, it will be impossible to put even a pane of glass in a window unless the work has been referred to Melbourne for the authority of the Minister. I dare say the Ordinance has been carefully studied by some honorable senators, and that, in the case of others, it has, like many other proposals, escaped attention. I have taken a great deal of interest in the Territory, perhaps more than others, and I am giving the Senate an opportunity of considering this matter, and seeing whether it is wise to pass the Ordinance in its present form. I wish to remind honorable senators that the Northern Territory was represented in the South Australian House of Assembly by two members, from 1890 onwards, when it had only one-third of the white population it has to-day. </para>

Apparently it was his last; but during the whole time he was there he never presented a more cheerful report concerning the Territory and its potentialities than he has done on this occasion.I do not intend to read much of it now, because I will have an opportunity later.

                            <para>- That makes my case only the stronger, and I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council for the information he has given as to the present European population of the Territory. It is apparent that the population is increasing, in spite of many disabilities and of the fact that the Government have been neglectful of the Territory. I say this, notwithstanding that they have spent large sums of money there, because money spent at Darwin on Government officials and officialdom is not going to develop the Northern Territory. The Minister has never heard me preaching economy, although I hope I shall never justify wasteful expenditure of money. It is possible that to spend no money at all might be the most wasteful . thing the Government could do. Even to spend money in the wrong direction to prevent previous expenditure being wasted would be better than to spend no money at all. </para>

                    <para>Having said so much, I feel that honorable senators will be quite justified in supporting my motion. I do not ask them to do so with any idea of embarrassing the Government, nor do I suggest that they should refrain from voting for the motion because to carry it might embarrass the Government. I think more of the importance of developing this great Territory than I do of temporarily embarrassing the Government. </para>
                    <para>Comparisons may be drawn with another Possession under the control of the Commonwealth; and the Minister, in his reply, will very likely remind honorable senators that Papua is being administered by a Board such as that to which I take exception. In anticipation of the honorable senator&#39;s reference to Papua, I should like to remind honorable senators that there are two governing authorities in Papua. There is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is comprised of six gentlemen highly placed in the administration of the country, and the Legislative Council is composed of nine other gentlemen. The six who form the Executive Council are also members of the Legislative Council of Papua. That will indicate that no comparison can be made between the government of Papua and that of the Northern Territory. The white population of Papua numbers about 1,000. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should have moved the adjournment of the Senate. Senators Newland, Fairbairn, de Largio, and quite a number of other honorable senators have been accusing me of wasting the time of the Senate ; but I am here now, ready to work, and yet, at half-past 6 o&#39;clock, when we have the best of the evening before us, it is proposed that the Senate should adjourn. I sincerely upbraid the Government for proposing the adjournment of the Senate at this hour. I protest against being charged with wasting the time of the Senate, when here the Government propose to waste the time of the country. It is strange that they should do so when they put up senators to speak, as some honorable senators spoke last week. I particularly refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> whose remarks are to be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

The point is that certain honorable senators falsely accused me of wasting the time of the Senate and of the country, and now the Government are doing the same thing.

                    <para>.- The Government are very anxious to go on with business; but I recognise that a big constitutional issue is involved in the matter that was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> and honorable senators who desire to speak on the matter are not ready to go on with the debate. I do not think that it is fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that there should not be a reasonable reply to him from the Government, and I am not now prepared to go on with the discussion. If I have made a mistake, I regret it; but I wish to avoid bringing honorable senators back for only about ten minutes after dinner. </para>
