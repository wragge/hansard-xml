            <para>- I hope that in this chamber of review there will be no attempt on the part of the Government to push this measure through in the indecent fashion in which it was pushed through in another place. I think that a matter so grave as the amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution should not he rushed through either Chamber of this Legislature. I hope that this Bill will&#39; not be passed in a hurried or perfunctory fashion by the Senate, but that it will receive the fullest discussion. Whilst I have no wish to embarrass the Government in any way, and 1 am quite prepared that the will of the people of Australia shall be expressed in due course in regard to matters which appear to many to be so important, I must say that if I do not oppose the motion for the extension of the Standing Orders, it is because I take it that an honorable pledge has been given by the Minister that, in accordance with the ordinary procedure in this Chamber, the fullest opportunity for discussion and ventilation of the provisions of this Bill will be afforded. I hope&#39; that no attempt will be made to rush the measure through in a. manner unworthy of the dignity of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- The modifications of previous similar&#39; proposals provided for in this Bill will probably be of more interest to honorable senators than will the proposals for amendment themselves. The first proposition is to amend section 51 of the Constitution by omitting from paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> the words &#34; with other countries and among the States,&#34; and by adding at the end, &#34;Provided that the alteration of this paragraph shall not be construed to empower the Parliament to make laws with respect to the control or management of railways the property of a State, or the rates or fares on such railways.&#34; As honorable senators are aware, under the Constitution the Commonwealth is prevented from legislating in connexion with trade and commerce except with other countries and between the States. Owing to the many limitations that have been placed upon the Commonwealth, our powers in the direction of trade and commerce are, for all practical purposes, worthless. While we have the nominal power to legislate in regard to trade and commerce, that power virtually ceases at the Customs House. It has been pointed out from time to time that Australian commerce is a matter that cannot be dealt with on geographical lines, and yet it has been impossible to have a uniform law throughout the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has not to legislate for other than Inter-State trade. It is generally admitted that there should he one control, because the State authority operates only within the borders of the State and the Commonwealth cannot interfere with the internal trade and commerce of the States. It is desired, therefore, to place trade and commerce, with certain limitations, under one national authority. It is true that our present power goes a long way, but it is desired to extend it, and we should trust the Federal authority, as was done in the case of Canada. It can be safely assumed that the Commonwealth will exercise its powers with wisdom and judgment, and not endeavour to interfere with purely State matters. It is hopeless to proceed in an effective way under present conditions, and I feel sure that the bulk of our honest traders recognise that the present limitations are undesirable. The present Bill is a step in the direction of making this a National Parliament in everysense. Trade and commerce is the life blood of any nation, and to say that a National Parliament shall deal only with trade and commerce between State and State destroys its national powers. Nearly all important questions come under the heading of trade and commerce, and we are called upon to tolerate a ridiculous position so long as this Parliament is deprived of its true national rights. </para>

To some extent they are, but under the War Precautions Act there were certain limitations. The rights and privileges of the States were, not interfered with unless interference was absolutely essential under war conditions. It would have been an abuse of power to try to permanently enact by war legislation what we could do in a democratic way by amending the Constitution on a vote of the people. </para>

Its provisions shall not be so construed as , to empower the Parliament to make laws with respect to the control or management of railways the property of a State, or to interfere with . the rates or fares on such railways. That is a sound proposition, because the railways are within the States and are under public control. </para>

A State cannot conduct trade and commerce &#39;beyond its own borders, and under existing conditions the Commonwealth has no power to interfere within the borders of a State. The power requisite for the efficient government of Australia does not exist to-day. Section 51 of the Constitution is also amended by omitting from paragraph xx the words &#34;foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth,&#34; and inserting in their stead the words, &#34; corporations, including (a) The creation, dissolution, regulation, and control of corporations; (b) corporations formed under the law of a State, including their dissolution, regulation, and control&#39;; but not includingmunicipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members; and (c) foreign corporations, including their regulation and control.&#34; That is to give the Commonwealth Parliament complete control over corporations. </para>

              <para>- I am quite prepared to use my influence in that direction. Clause 4 provides that section 51 of the Constitution is to be further altered by omitting from paragraph xxxv the words, &#34; conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State,&#34; and inserting .in their stead the words &#34; industrial matters, including <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> labour; (6) employment and unemployment; (c) the terms and conditions of labour and employment in any trade, industry, occupation, or calling; (d) the rights and obligations of employers and employees; (e). strikes and lockouts; (/) the maintenance of industrial peace; and <inline font-style="italic">(g)</inline> the settlement of industrial disputes.&#34; That is to give complete power, so far as it can be defined, for the . Commonwealth to deal with industrial matters. These are questions which affect the life, health, and well-being of the workers of this country. Any one who &#39;will give a moment&#39;s consideration to this matter will clearly recognise that the biggest problem facing, &#39;not only Australia, but the whole world, is that of industrial unrest. With perfect candour I can say that, considering the war conditions and the lack of effective machinery for dealing with industrial disputes, I am not at all surprised at the- unrest prevailing. Under our present system our Arbitration Courts are congested, and many organizations have to wait ten or twelve months before their cases can be heard. It is impossible to get a common rule, and, in consequence, large numbers of employers have to be brought before the Court. Conditions such as that should not obtain in any democratic country. This proposed amendment of the Constitution will give the Government power to legislate on industrial matters in any direction they think fit. It is not intended to interfere with such local matters as can be effectively dealt with by the States, but to use the power for national purposes in connexion with the control of large industries where there are likely to be disputes. The work of the Arbitration Court may have to be extended, but I hope the far-reaching powers will enable more rapid and, may I say, just decisions to be given. The laws controlling seamen&#39;s compensation operate whilst the men are working within a State, &#39;but if they should go beyond the limits of one State there is no power to legislate in their interests. </para>

          <para>Clause 5 provides that the Constitution is to be altered by adding at the end of section 51 the following paragraph: - &#34; (xl.) Trusts, combinations, monopolies, and arrangements in relation to - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> the production, manufacture, or supply of goods, or the supply of services; or (&#38;) the ownership of the means of production, manufacture, or supply of goods, or supply of- services.&#34; This power will enable us to deal with the distribution, for instance, of superphosphates if we so desire. Although we possessed this authority under the War Precautions Act, it is necessary that it should be embodied in our constitutional powers. There may be a desire to continue certain of the trading operations of the Commonwealth for a year of two. The people interested in the Butter Pool, for instance, might wish to continue the present arrangement. If so, we should have the  right,  as a Government, to cooperate with that or any. other industry. At present there is some doubt as to our power to trade in certain directions, notably in the production of cloth by our woollen mills. But, in view of the allegations of profiteering and an absolute shortage of material, there can be no doubt at all as to our moral right to utilize these national enterprises in the interests of the people. </para>
          <para>In the 1915 proposals power was sought to include railway servants. This ppwer is not sought for now; but- I point out that these amendments need not be regarded as the last effort in this direction. Personally, they do not eo so far as I desired but an absolute majority of the States and of the people is required to amend our Constitution, and as three unsuccessful attempts have been made already, the present compromise may be accepted in order to. achieve some results. I believe in preserving the spirit of our Constitution by recognising that certain powers belong of right to the Commonwealth, while certain other powers rest with the States. These powers should not be exercised by Federal and State authorities concurrently. They belong either to one or the other legislative authority, and I believe that those matters which belong properly to the Federal sphere should be brought within the ambit of our Constitution. I have no hesitation in commending this proposal, and I believe the people will give an almost unanimous vote in favour of it, because it represents a compromise in regard to certain questions, and if adopted will give ussomething resembling a national Constitution. </para>
          <para>There is a limitation of the period within which the powers now asked for may be exercised, unless a certain course of action is taken. </para>

              <para>- I do not think there is any doubt on that point. The proposed amendment will be of a temporary nature because it is desired that a democratic Convention shall be summoned at an early date to review the Commonwealth and States Constitutions, but we are unable to wait until that Convention gets to work, as it is necessary to deal at once with certain urgent problems with which Australia is faced. After the experience we have gained in recent years I feel confident that an improved Constitution will emerge from the proposed National Convention. Concerning the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I remind him that in relation to certain matters limits were fixed in the Constitution when it was adopted, and as we are assured of the co-operation, of the. States in endeavouring to secure the amendments now proposed, I do not think the question of constitutionality is likely to be raised. </para>

              <para>- The people are entitled to know what is ahead of them. If they were informed that members were to be elected for the purpose of amending the Constitution, they would give particular attention to the constitutional views espoused by the several- candidates. We appear to have secured unanimity with reference to these proposals. While our friends opposite may think,perhaps, that they do riot go far enough, otherhonorable senators believe, no doubt, that &#39;hey go too far, but they may be regarded as a working compromise for. thepurpose of dealing with the critical situation facing Australia in common with other countries of the world, and there is, I believe, a general desire to have them incorporated in our Constitution. </para>

I suggest that, if there are clauses upon which there is reasonable prospect of lengthy debate, those clauses he postponed. I assure the Minister that I shall not delaythe passage of the Bill next week. It is only reasonable that the debatable clauses should be held over until the fullest possible information has been presented to the Committee. </para>

Before the terms of this Article are accepted, the Government should inform Parliament of the approximate cost and upkeep of the administration of the island. The appointment of an administrator will create an office, and involve the appointment of a staff. No one will expect the administrator to live on the island, year after year, without a change. No one will expect him to stick to his job on this little island quite so closely as the High Commissioner in London. The factor of health must be considered. </para>

I am convinced that if the good Australian money which is about to be sunk in this project were invested, say, in Western Australia&#39;s timber and mineral resources, there would be vastly greater returns to the Australian taxpayer. Here we are about to bring into being another costly Department. I am anxious to learn the approximate sum to be expended upon the administrator, his office, and his staff. </para>

            <para>- And I do not intend to give you any such guarantee. Let us suppose that a proposal were submitted for the appointment of an Administrator for Kalgoorlie because of the prospective value of its reefs, and the gold which was to be obtained from them. Would we not send the most expert  assayers  there, would we not have every reef tested, and would we not have the old workings thoroughly examined in order to ascertain whether they had been entirely exhausted. But under this Bill we are asked to appoint an Administrator in connexion with a mining venture, although not one man in this Chamber knows the value- of the deposits which the Government propose to operate. I am not going to vote for the appointment of an Administrator in the absence of knowledge. If the Government have not that knowledge at their disposal, it is a very good reason for deferring the consideration of this Bill. We .have to accept responsibility for our action, and yet we are asked to sanction the appointment of an Administrator to manage a concern of the value of which we know absolutely nothing. </para>

          <para>. - The question of the appointment of an Administrator is certainly an important one, but at the present stage it would be &#39;very unreasonable to expect the Government to put forward a clear cut system for the working of these deposits. The island has just been taken over by the three high contracting parties to the agreement-&#39; Anything, therefore, in the nature of a working system is practically impossible. I have no doubt that in time such a system will be evolved. In this connexion I would remind honorable senators that we have recently added to our Pacific possessions very considerably. Hitherto we have controlled Papua, which constitutes only about a third of the island of New Guinea. But now we have secured twothirds of it ; and in addition we have obtained some of the other possessions of Germany in the Pacific. </para>

            <para>- They did quite  a  number of things. The honorable senator might as well ask me what Gladstone did in 1873.  His  interjection is very like the flowers that bloom in the spring - it has nothing to do with the case. It would be too much at this juncture to expect the Government to be . prepared with a complete scheme for the administration of the Pacific Islands. We can assume that they will be guided by common sense, and that affairs at Nauru Island will probably be controlled by  a  staff such as would be appointed for the conduct of a Department of Works. </para>

        <para class="block">Gardiner suggests.For once I am in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and I believe that for the first five years there is nothing to prevent the Administrator of Nauru Island being, in fact, the person charged with the administration of our mandate in respect to all the captured German Possessions in the Pacific. If that course be followed, there can be no question of the establishment of an extensive staff as an exclusive charge upon the administration of Nauru Island. No Government in its senses, and I do not assume for a moment that our National Government is not in its senses, would think of establishing a special Administrator at Nauru Island, with the whole paraphernalia of an Administrator of large colonial Possessions, for the control of a business enterprise, which, after all, in respect of turnover and. profit, would be of no greater importance than a big boot industry or a biscuit factory. The Government will have the responsibility of cutting their coat according to their cloth; and I see noreason why this enterprise should be loaded unduly with administrative costs, even under this agreement. In the circumstances, T suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the matter is not of sufficient importance to justify an absolute &#34;No&#34; to this proposal. There are, however, in the schedule two articleswhich I shall ask the Minister to postpone. </para>

            <para>- That is a most important point, and I shall refer to it. First of all, it is laid down. that Nauru Island, as a phosphate-producing territory, shall pay the cost of administration. This is to be met out of the proceeds of the sales of phosphates and other revenue derivable upon the island. It is conceivable that the man in charge of this island may adopt faulty business methods, or surround himself with an unnecessary staff, at heavy expense, and so load the cost of phosphates derived from Nauru as to increase the price to farmersin this country, in Great Britain, and in New Zealand. In the event of anything of that kind, I suggest that recent experience in Victoria, and especially at Echuca, proves that the farmers of this country will kick very effectively if on any such accountthey are called uponto pay an excessive price for phosphates. We are concerned in seeing that Nauru Island is the valuable proposition that it is supposed to be, and that it shall remain a valuable asset for the producers of this country. That it canonly be if we can obtain phosphatic rock more . cheaply from . that source of supply than we could obtain it elsewhere.If our farmers cannot get cheaper phosphates from Naur.u Island than they could get elsewhere, this proposition will be ofno use, and we shall beonly wasting our time in considering it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is perfectly justified in inquiring. into . the financing of this proposition; but he will see that, under the agreement, Nauru . Island is to rest on. its own base, and be . responsible . for its own debts. If this proposition is not worked economically and onsound business lines, those administering it must go short of theirsalaries to theextent of theirfailure to make it a payable proposition. If the price of phosphates is loaded by the expense of an unnecessary administrative staff, our producers will have their remedy, and it will be to obtain phosphates from some &#39;Other sources. We shall have that check upon the cost of administration at Nauru. Unless the management ison economical andbusiness lines, it is only a delusionand a snare to tell us that the Nauru Island proposition is a good one. I have no doubt that it will all come out right in the wash. If those in control of the island do not behave themselves, we shall not get a cheaper phosphate forthe producersof this country; and, ifwe do not, all thetalk about Nauru Island is only fudge. Those incontrol will, under thisagreement,be inthe -position of a man who, under an did Norwegian law, if he would not work,was put into a bath,into which water was run so fast that he had to &#39;keep on baling hard -to save his life. These people &#39;will have to work, or they will get no pay. Out farmers will watch this proposition, and, if they cannot obtain phosphatic rock from Nauru Island at a reasonable price, they will obtain it from Ocean Island, Christmas Island,&#39; or Japan. We have some responsibility to see that our producers get cheaper phosphatic. rock from Nauru Island than they, can get elsewhere, and thatcannotbe secured if the. cost of management of the island is not kept within reasonable bounds. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot agree with the opinion expressed by honorable senators opposite that the Government need not appoint a special Administrator for Nauru Island. I do not think it is possible, under the terms of the agreement, for the administration to be conducted from Rabaul, Port Moresby, or any such place. If that were possible, there is no reason why it should not be conducted from Melbourne; I direct the attention of honorable senators to the second paragraph of Article 1 of the agreement, which provides that - </para>

The Administrator may be a working manager, and probably it would be better if he were; but, in my opinion, according to the terms of the agreement, he must be stationed on the Island of Nauru. </para>

On the island of Nauru various institutions are established, and the supervision of them must necessarily entail a good deal of work and responsibility. I submit with all seriousness, and some degree of soundness, that these institutions should be under the control of a separate individual. The Article states that the Administrator shall have power to provide for the education of children on the island, to establish and maintain the necessary police force, and to establish and appoint Courts and magistrates with civil and criminal jurisdiction. Institutions of this nature in such an outoftheway place could not he supervised or effectively controlled at a distance. </para>

            <para>- We know the evils that existed in the Northern Terri.tory. where the Administrator was not actuated by a desire to do justice to the people in that Territory. In administering Nauru from a distance there is the possibility of official corruption. The irregularities that existed in the Northern Territory were apparently unnoticed in Melbourne by the Government of the day, and it is easy to imagine how much more corruption might go on at Nauru if the Administrator were not there to supervise operations. The Northern Territory and Papua are closer, but although we are prone to think that w&#169; know what is going on there, we really do not. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that it is the intention of the Bill, and I doubt very much the wisdom of giving a magistrate the full powers contained in this Article. It will be seen that the Administrator shall have power to make Ordinances for the peace, order, and good government of the island, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie favours giving that power to an ordinary magistrate resident on one of the other islands, great risks would be entailed. In the best interests of the supervision of the island, an officer should be resident there with the whole responsibility upon him, and the duty of devoting his full time to the welfare of  the  undertaking.  Even if he were paid a high salary, it would be economical in the long run. I am very afraid of what may occur in these outlying places judging by what I know has gone on in the Northern Territory, which is much closer to the Seat of Government in Melbourne. I very much doubt the wisdom of giving these officials the power to make Ordinances, even if such Ordinances have the sanction of the official, head, to say nothing of the sanction of this. Parliament. Administrators  aTe  often a law unto themselves, and  I  do not think  it  wise for  this  Parliament  to  give  an  Administrator  such extensive  powers.  It was a mistake to  allow  the  Administrator  of the Northern Territory such extensive powers.

          <para>. -  It will be absolutely necessary to appoint a responsible officer, but it does not follow that such officer should be continually resident on the island. If there had not been a valuable deposit of phosphatic rock on Nauru, the island would have been under our sole control, and included in our mandate. If Nauru had been included in the mandate a resident Administrator would not have been appointed, and this island would have been controlled from Rabaul, in conjunction with other adjacent islands. Although it may be necessary to have the operations carefully supervised, it does not necessarily follow that the supervising officer shall reside there continuously. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> argument does not hold good.  I  can clearly see that there is full power for the Administrator of the other islands  to  administer Nauru, and the charge of administration shall be apportioned between the three respective Governments. The cost of administration will not be a charge upon the business proposition. The governmental cost will certainly be controlled by the terms of the Peace Treaty, and if the island were included in our mandate we would be solely responsible. I do not think the cost of administration should be made a charge i. pen t he industry. If it were so, we should be embarking upon an entirely new proposition, and forming an independent State. I do not think that that is the intention of the agreement. In regard  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> remark in connexion with the appointment of an Administrator, I cannot see how the other contracting parties can be excluded from the agreement. Article 1 provides that Australia shall appoint an Administrator for the first five years, so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> must see that there can be no permanent exclusion. He bases all his argument on the fact that the three Powers are specified. A private. . company, partly British and partly German, was working the deposits, although the island was really in possession of Germany. </para>

          <para>.- I callthe attention of the Committee tothe contradictory nature of two of the articles. In Article 1 we are told that the administration of the island is to ibe vested in an Administrator, to be appointed for, in the first instance, a term of five years ; and that he shall have power to make Ordinances for the peace, order; and good government- of the island. I strongly object to any individual being vested with power to make Ordinances which are. not to be submitted to Parliament for approval. </para>

            <para>-The appointment of native police, for one thing. We are also told thatthe island is to be selfsupporting, and that as a matter of fact, we are going to make a profit out of it. I directattention to the fact that in Article 11 the price of phosphates, f.o.b. , is to be fixed by the Commissioners on a basis to cover expenses and cost of management; but the island itself will only contribute towards the cost ofmaintaining police force, magistrates, a Judge, interest on capital, sinking, fund, and so on. It appears, therefore, that Articles 1 and 1 1 are somewhat contradictory, and the schedule altogether has been loosely drafted. </para>

            <para>- Yes, too small. There are also Chinese labourers, Indian Coolies, Japanese, English, Irish and Scotch labourers; all, according to a magazine article I read on. the matter, ideally provided for. Any one acquainted with&#39; life on the islands knows that the natives have such a love for law that the most trivial dispute between husband and wife will be taken to the Administrator ; and if we have an Administrator with common sense who is able to settle all these disputes, we will get good service and create a healthy public opinion there. We should have a tactful man, because in an island only 5,000 acres in extent, and containing a population of about 5,000, disturbances involving the Commonwealth in serious difficulties might easily be created. </para>

            <para>- Some of the arguments&#39; raised during the course of the debate have been amusing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> indicated how little he understood the duties of administration when he suggested that the expenses involved by administration should be met out of the proceeds ofthe island. He inferred that if the island did not pay, the Administrator would get no salary. That is an absurd proposition. No administrator would accept the post on such conditions. The Administrator, will have nothing to do with working the deposits&#39;. He will find his hands full in his purely administrative and magisterial capacities. He will have the practical governance of a civil population, which will include Australians, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, and Indians. If any profits are made in working the deposits, no doubt they will go towards paying the cost of administration. </para>

            <para>- Suppose that the Administrator&#39;s salary is paid out of the charges, and that there is a loss on the whole undertaking. We would still be required to pay the Administrator&#39;s salary. What will be the duties of the Administrator? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie suggests that the Administrator of New Guinea could look after Nauru Island.  His  hands are more than full to-day. Another honorable senator has indicated that the job is merely one for a magistrate. It will be necessary for a magistrate to be on the spot all the time. The Administrator will need to take seasonal holidays, but the duties of a magistrate&#39; must not be interfered with by such interruptions. Considerations such as these must all be placed on the bill of costs. It is the duty of the Government to present a clear financial statement, and not to ask us blindly to agree to a proposition which, tomy mind, is highly objectionable. I have already said that the project savours of the activities of the rich uncle from Fiji. Although the great name of Lloyd George and the greater name of William Morris Hughes are attached to the agreement, that does not absolve the Federal Parliament of its obligation to investigate this gold brick scheme. The company which has been&#39; working the deposits has developed its plant in a most up-to-date manner. Even, so, I understand that the greatest quantity of phosphates despatched from Nauru in any one year amounts to 105,000. tons. I see no prospect of the&#39; three &#39;Governments securing greater returns. If this were an ordinary mining venture, &#39;no; one would put his money into it untilhehad secured the advice of investigatingexperts. I believe this Bill seeks toplay a confidence trick upon the people of Australia. If those confidence men who work the boats in Sydney and watch the trains for simple country visitors were to learn how honorable senator&#39;s have swallowed this proposition, they would be waiting for us on the Senate steps. They would know where the &#34; mugs &#34; are. </para>

I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> supporting the proposition if it is likely to provide farmers with cheaper (phosphates; but he must not forget that our farmers cannot expect to draw from Nauru more than 42,000 tons per annum. </para>

            <para>- Australia&#39;s share amounts to 42 per cent. The company has not succeeded in producing more than about 100,000 tons in any one year. Therefore, we cannot look for more than 42,000 tons as our annual proportion. Phosphate deposits are not valued by the ounce, as are precious metals. They are valued by the ton, and must undergo a series of &#39; processes before being ,placed &#39; upon the market. The labour involved in the production of a ton of fertilizers is probably infinitely greater than that employed to secure a quantity of gold or silver of equal value. </para>

            <para>- That is quite true. I am disgusted with the whole proposition. The Australian people must be considered a lot of simpletons. If Nauru Island were so situated that we could undertake activities to-morrow, and if it were merely a matter of transferring the phosphatic rock from the island to the Australian market, ready for immediate use, the project would still require cautious investigation. It has been suggested that the administrator should be a working manager. He can be nothing of the kind.  His  tasks will be altogether apart from the working of the phosphatic deposits. He will have to handle men ; he will require tact in solving difficult problems. Costly mistakes may be made if the administration of the island is left to an administrator stationed upon another island Possession 1,000 miles away. I hope honorable senators will realize that they are in danger of being tricked, and that the Australian people&#39; are likely to lose a very large sum of money. </para>

            <para>- My impression was that the importance of bur ratifying this agreement lay in that it would assure to Australia a proportion of the phosphatic wealth of Nauru. But there are islands containing excellent  phosphatic  prospects lying much nearer to our coasts. Quite recently investigators have been pursuing their inquiries upon this subject, with the result that phosphatic rocks have been discovered in various places. Hoban  Island, off  the North Queensland coast, for example, has been acquired because of the existence of -such deposits there. </para>

          <para>. - It seems to me that my honorable friends opposite have been drawing the long bow in regard to matters which are not of very great importance. One of them inquired, &#34;Where is the need for the appointment of an Administrator at all?&#34; But I take it that there must be some head appointed, and that the&#39; Administrator will not have the status which some honorable senators seem to apprehend. I do not imagine that he will live on the island. The idea of affording Australia the opportunity to appoint the Administrator for the first term set out in the agreement is that a person may be appointed to the office who is already acting officially in some part of the&#39; Pacific. I would rather have one big man administering the affairs of all the Pacific Islands than I would have a dozen little men administering the affairs of some of those islands. I should strongly resent any proposal to rappoint a Governor to a small island like that of Nauru. Further, I do not think that the Commissioners to be appointed will live there. I do not expect to see more than a general manager resident on the island, with the Administrator visiting it now and again. My own idea is that none of these officers is likely to reside at Nauru. Some honorable senator spoke of the police powers of the agreement. But those powers are merely intended to enable us to deal with native labour. Under the mandate we undertake to protect the native - to keep alcoholic drinks away from him, and generally to give him a chance. It has been said that the Ordinances for the island should come before Parliament. I share that view, and I would point out that ordinarily regulations and Ordinances are subject to veto or amendment by Parliament. But in the present instance, if that practice obtained, the Parliaments of three countries would have an equal right to exercise the power of veto, and as a result we should never arrive at finality. </para>

            <para>- I am not so sure of that. For eight months of the year the winds blow steadily from the south-east. I can assure honorable senators that there is no intention on the part of Ministers to establish anything like a new form of government on the island. We are dealing with an agreement which has already been entered into, and if we do not. ratify it I fail to see how we shall ever achieve finality. I believe that we can get phosphates from other places, but the supplies are chiefly controlled by private enterprise. We shall be taking a big step forward if we can guarantee to our producers that they shall be able to secure &#39; their fertilizers at a reasonable cost. If any of the Nauru Island phosphates are sold to outsiders the profits so derived will be divided amongst the three high contracting parties. I take it that the plant, which is installed on the island ought to be adequate to all requirements. Hitherto, Great Britain has imported about 60,000 tons of phosphates annually from the Pacific. The fact that she has entered into this agreement shows that she intends to draw her supplies chiefly from Nauru Island. That will involve an immediate duplication of the plant already installed there, which, in turn, will mean increased production. The first thing that the three parties to this agreement have to do is to take possession of the island and all that is thereon. They will then be in a position to say to those who have interests there, &#34;We are now prepared to discuss with you the amount of the compensation which we shall pay you for the acquisition of your rights.&#34; Probably months will elapse before finality is reached upon that subject. This Bill will do little more than confer upon the Government the authority to negotiate. I think that Ministers may be safely trusted to guard the interests of the people in this matter. To my mind, a great  opportunity is presented to. us, and. I feel sure that with every day which passes, we shall more fully appreciate the fact that in attempting to establish our basic industrieswe have sought to eliminate the dozen profitmongers who ordinarily stand between those industries and the producers. Therefore, I ask honorable senators not to press for an amendment of this article. They must trust the Government to make arrangements for the production of these phosphatic fertilizers at the lowest possible cost in order that the community as a whole may be benefited, and not merely a few individuals. </para>

            <para>- Glancing hurriedly through the article from which I have quoted I learn that, although the Minister in the course of his speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, said the value of the company&#39;s shares would be less than &#163;3,000,000, the Commonwealth will have to pay at least that amount. In the circumstances, I suggest that he should consent to an adjournment of the debate until next week in order that he may ascertain for himself the facts connected with this proposition with a view to placing them before the Government. When the Prime Minister reads the criticism of this mear sure by honorable, senators he will surely recognise that. he. ought not to put his. supporters in the position of being obliged to subordinate their own judgments to party exigencies. Good government at the present time would certainly not. ask us to pay 42 per. cent. of &#163;3,000,000 for this proposition, when it is clear that, the possibilities of increased profits are so small. This article says that the company make 6s. per ton profit, and if we have to pay interest on the millions which we are likely to have to pay the company, there will be no great margin left to enable us to provide cheapphosphates for the Australian farmer. </para>

An article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> on 15th March last, under the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. D. Tocke, which gives the following particulars: - For the four years ending June, 1918, the total quantity of phosphate guano imported from Nauru into Australia amounted to 147,060 tons, valued at &#163;331,910; but it must be . remembered that during that period shipments were greatly restricted through scarcity of tonnage, etc. Under normal conditions, it is claimed that 100,000 tons could be exported annually. I propose to base a few figures upon that statement. I have further ascertained, from what I consider good authority, that the production of this phosphatic rock costs, free on board the steamer at Nauru, 23s. per ton. I have been informed that the normal average profits of the company on the export of this rock from Nauru represent approximately 7s. per ton. This figure is reasonably near some which have already been quoted during the discussion of the Bill. At 7s. per ton, and assuming the normal output of the island with the present plant to he 100,000 tons annually- </para>

            <para>- I assume that there would be plenty of freight to ship the normal annual production of the island. If 100,000 tons of phosphatic rock is shipped from the island annually, and if the average normal profit is 7s. per ton, the profit from this output would amount to &#163;35,000 per annum. Everything depends upon the capital sum which the Commonwealth will be called upon to pay as its share of the purchase of this proposition. Various figures have been given, and I propose to take a figure which, so far as can be seen, is not likely to be seriously disputed. I suggest that this company expects, and may possibly obtain, a sum of at least &#163;2,000,000 for all its right, title, and interest in the phosphate industry in the Island of. Nauru. Assuming this, and assuming the normal annual output to be 100,000 tons, the following figures can be easily deduced: - The interest on &#163;2,000,000 would be &#163;100,000 per annum, and consequently 20s. per ton would have to be added to the cost of production. A sinking fund of 2&#189; per cent, would add another 10s. per ton-. There would then be the present production cost of 23s. per ton. We might add 2s. per ton as the average cost for administration, and a further5s. per ton for repairs, depreciation, contingencies, and sundries. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has not been listeningo me closely. I suggested a cost of 5s. per ton for depreciation, repairs, sundries, and all other contingencies. I am sorry if honorable senators are unable to distinguish between depreciation of capital and depreciation of capital expenditure. The figures I have given would make the total cost of phosphates f.o.b. at Nauru 60s. per ton. If the output were 150,000 tons per year, the additional cost for interest and sinking fund would be correspondingly less, but the other costs would remain the same, and the production cost of phosphates f.o.b. at Nauru would be 50s. per ton. If the output were 200,000 tons per year, clearly the interest cost and sinking fund on capital would again be less; the other figures would remain, and the total production cost f.o.b. at Nauru would then be 45s. per ton. </para>

        <para>I have given three suppositions as to the output of phosphatic rock from Nauru, one showing a cost of 60s., another 50s., and another 45s. per ton f.o.b. at the island. Before the war the phosphatic rock was sold at 30s. per ton, and during the war period at 40s. per ton. In view of the evidence placed before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and of the interjection by the Acting Leader of the Government in this Chamber, I think we can reasonably say that the profit that this company made on the 30s. and 40s. per ton mentioned was at the least an average of 7s. per ton. We now come to the point of what is the capitalized value of the profit on this amount. I will go back to the original statement of the authority I have mentioned that the normal average output is 100,000 tons. If we have 100,000 tons on which there is a profit of 7s. per ton we get the total expectant net profit of &#163;35,000 per year. If we capitalize that on a 5 per cent.sis it is &#163;700,000, on a 7| per cent.msis, &#163;525,000, and on a 10 per cent. basis, &#163;350,000. During the whole of my business experience I have never been accustomed to pay out in cash, nor have I. heard of anybody else paying out in cash, the whole of a capitalized value such as I have suggested. The custom in connexion with mining is, when the prospectus is issued and a thorough investigation has been made as to the value of the. property and the yearly profits of the company, for the promoters or the owners of the lease or mine to sell out to the public on a basis of three years&#39; profits. In ibusiness, too, when the proprietors of a successfulundertaking are converting the business into a joint stock or public company and float their capital interest into shares, it is very often that they say that their good-will or interest in the concern is worth three years&#39; of the profits. So, if we have a private business that has been making, say, &#163;2,000 a year, and it is converted into a joint stock company, the reasonable thing for the proprietor of the business to ask for goodwill is on the basis of three years&#39; profits, or, say, &#163;6,000. On that basis, what is this worth? It is not worth &#163;2,000,000. It is not worth even &#163;1,000,000, but is worth only the capitalized profits that are being made out of it. I have quoted those figures to endeavour to throw some further light on the matter. I also wish to point out that if the interest of this company is to be adjudged at anything like the sum of &#163;2,000,000, Australia&#39;s share in the purchase of this venture will  be.  &#163;840,000 assuming we are to pay 42 per cent. of the cost. The figures in the company&#39;s balance-sheet, as quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> do not indicate that the profits of the industry are anything like the profits that should be expected from the investment of such  a  huge amount of capital. Consequently, the position comes back to this: that  if  we pay an abnormal price simply because the shares have been sold on the London market at a very high rate, because London manipulators thought that they could make some one pay a huge sum for their interests, we shall, instead of helping the farmers, be saddling them with  a  burden of at least. 10s. per ton on the whole of the phosphatic rock obtained from Nauru Island for all time. </para>

            <para>- In view of the information given to the Senate, it would be advisable for the Government to send some responsible person to inspect the property. If that were done, the ratification of this agreement could be postponed until after the elections.  Thi3  would be a convenient time to report progress. I have said all I wish to say on this particular article. I do not wish to put honorable senators in the position of voting against their judgment, and that is the position they will be in if we call for a division. if, as the Minister says, the Government are going on and will see it through, it makes it necessary for me to say exactly what I think about it. </para>

            <para>- That, is quite possible; but the largest profit was &#163;70,000, and a portion of that amount was derived from&#39; the operationson Ocean Island. The article states&#39; that most of that profit was made owing to low freights, as the company had contracted for; the shipment of material at a cheap rate, and were thusenabled to increase their profit. If they had been compelled to pay the ruling . rate that profit would have gone. Surely the Government will give the Senate time to analyze these figures. </para>

            <para>- He quotes from the balance-sheet. If the two properties, Ocean Island and Nauru, could not showa profit of more than &#163;70,000 in the past year, when freight was obtainable at a cheap rate; the proposition isnot a very attractive one. If the Minister analyzes the statement closely he will realize that it is not one from a biassed writer. I want honorable senators to review these things, because, in my opinion, we are being invited to enter into a wild-cat venture. </para>

            <para>- If we could have got the ships. And ifthis proposition is loaded with another &#163;l,000,000, or &#163;2,000,000 of capital, we will want very much more than that to cover overhead charges, and meet all expenditure. We do not want to put&#34; money into this venture, which I regard as suspiciously dangerous. &#34;In fact, we do. not want to invest Commonwealth money in anything at all. Money is too valuable to be risked in hazardous enterprises. I have asked the Minister to adjourn the. debate  in order that further information may be obtained. If the adoption of the scheme could be postponed, and if the Government sent three responsible men to the island to make fullest inquiries, we would then have reliable information, and be in a better position to judge of the value of the proposition. It appears, however, that the Government want to rush into it. And they want to rush into an election. I do not desire to talk of scandal during the campaign, and so I say that when huge public interests are at stake, the greatest care should be taken before the Government commit the Commonwealth to expenditure. The Government should fix a limit to the expenditure, and tell Parliament they do not intend to go beyond it. That is a fair proposition. I shall call for a division upon every article in the agreement. I remember that, even after the fullestinvestigation into the proposal topurchase the Shaw wireless works, in Sydney , and when the Government of which I was a member were acting npon expert advice, there were subsequently newspaper comments upon the transaction, and a Commission of Inquiry was appointed, to investigate certain charges. Similar allegations will, no doubt, be made against the Government in regard to this proposal if the Government invest the people&#39;s money in it. On the scanty information given to honorable senators up to the present, it might be skid that the Prime Minister did not enter into the agreement without knowing all about it. If he did, it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> his duty now to place all idle information he obtained before Parliament, and, as he has not seen fit to do so, I now invite the. Minister in charge of the Senate to tell honorable senators everything that he knows about it. I shall not vote for any article in the schedule, until I know upon what information the Prime Minister attached his signature to the agreement. We have had some reference to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> the Prime Minister of New Zealand. It appears to me that some wealthy company in England had command of sufficient influence to induce the Governments to enter into this scheme, which I am entirely opposed to. </para>

            <para>- Last night we had statements of &#163;500,000 having been put into the venture, and this afternoon that figure jumped to &#163;3,000,000. The statements as to cost of production, royalty, and administrative charges are altogether too unreliable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> speaks of it as a wild-cat proposition, and even some supporters of the Government last night, at first, appeared inclined to vote against the Bill, but after a calm consideration they realized their error, and voted for the second reading. I hope there will be no further delay. We have had a fair debate, and no reason has been advanced for any postponement of consideration. </para>

          <para>. - I would not have arisen again but for the obviously personal and somewhat insulting remarks by the sycophantic Government Whip. I have been told by him that I did not know what&#39; I was talking about, when I quoted certain figures in an attempt to get nearer to a reasonable capitalization value of this island. I now make this challenge to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I will hand to him the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs of my remarks, and if, on Wednesday next, when the Bill is again under discussion, he can come along with any connected and reasonable refutation of the figures I presented, I shall have pleasure in voting for the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The mention of that amount, I remember, invoked loud laughter from various parts of the chamber, suggesting that the honorable senator had quoted an extravagant amount. I now desire to point out that, under another agreement, the Government are committed to pay, not 5s. per ton, but &#163;1 per ton for depreciation and managerial supervision; I refer to the sum allowed to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in regard to the contract for handling and refining raw sugar for the Commonwealth Government, and I point out also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> said that 5s. per ton for wear and tear, and de preciation of plant was rather a moderate estimate. We must bear in mind, too, that wear and tear and depreciation of plant are likely to be much greater inthe treatment of phosphatic rock than in the refining of raw sugar, because the latter process merely consists of melting the raw sugar to a liquid state, passing it through charcoal filtration plant, solidifying and drying the liquid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> estimate of 5s. per ton appears to be fairly accurate, and I should say that his other figures are not very far from the mark. We have had too much of late of Bills being brought into the Senate merely to give effect to agreements already made, thus taking the conduct of public business out of the hands of Parliament, and relegating it to outside bodies or conferences. Under our present system it is not likely that the Government supporters would say &#34; No &#34; to the ratification of what, after all, is their own instrument, but this practice is really superseding the functions of Parliament. Article 1 is vital, and if it is adopted by this Committee, control of the island will pass to an outside official in the guise of an Administrator. There is far too much government by civil officials already in Australia. If we agree to Article 1 it will be useless at any future date to protest against the agreement. The Government should postpone further consideration of the Bill until a thorough inquiry has been undertaken. I do not believe in signing a blank cheque. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has given his assurance in good faith, he is but one member of the Cabinet; and the Australian Government is but a partner in the proposed scheme of control. . I have more than once expressed the view that Australia, during the war, has not been fairly treated with respect to her commercial and mineral, output. The praise lavished upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for his alleged achievements in behalf of Australian commerce has been unjustified. We should not make any more mistakes. If the. agreement is ratified one section of the Australian people - the farmers - will be called upon to meet the interest bill. It would be fairer if the Australian taxpayers as a whole were called upon to meet the cost. Seeing that Australia is to be given a mandate over a wide zone of Pacific possessions, is it not reasonable, or, at any rate, possible, that other phos- phatic deposits, equally as rich and extensive as those at Nauru, may be discovered <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I have already indicated that a valuable deposit has been discovered on an island off Bo wen, on the Queenslandcoast, and that activities are in progress whereby the product from that island is being placed upon the market. I do not know what Australia may be called upon to pay, as her proportion, in buying out the company at present operating at Nauru. </para>

          <para>. - As the debate has developed, honorable senators are becoming better informed with respect to Nauru Island and its phosphatic deposits, but not withregard to the prospective obligations of the Australian people. One thing is clear, namely, that we shall simply be securing rights over the raw material. It will still be necessary, if the rock is conveyed to Australia, to undertake considerable expenditure in the erection of a plant, or plants, for the treatment of the phosphate. That is a factor involving still further increase in the cost of the product. </para>
